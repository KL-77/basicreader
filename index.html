            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Do you feel popular? There are people on the Internet who want to know all about you! Unfortunately, they don’t have the best of intentions, but Google has some handy tools to address that, and they’ve gotten an upgrade today. The “Results About You” tool can now detect and remove more of your personal information. Plus, the tool for removing non-consensual explicit imagery (NCEI) is faster to use. All you have to do is tell Google your personal details first—that seems safe, right?

With today’s upgrade, Results About You gains the ability to find and remove pages that include ID numbers like your passport, driver’s license, and Social Security. You can access the option to add these to Google’s ongoing scans from the settings in Results About You. Just click in the ID numbers section to enable detection.

Naturally, Google has to know what it’s looking for to remove it. So you need to provide at least part of those numbers. Google asks for the full driver’s license number, which is fine, as it’s not as sensitive. For your passport and SSN, you only need the last four digits, which is enough for Google to find the full numbers on webpages.

The NCEI tool is geared toward hiding real, explicit images as well as deepfakes and other types of artificial sexualized content. This kind of content is rampant on the Internet right now due to the rapid rise of AI. What used to require Photoshop skills is now just a prompt away, and some AI platforms hardly do anything to prevent it.

Google has made this tool easier to access and faster to report images. You can access it from the three-dot menu on any image that appears in Google’s search results. Just select “remove result” and “It shows a sexual image of me” to begin the removal process. Google will ask if it’s a real image or a deepfake. The company has added the option to add multiple images to a single request, which could save a lot of time if someone is using AI to churn out such content.

Neither Results About You nor the NCEI tool works instantly, and they can’t actually remove content from the Internet. But if Google approves the removal request, the content won’t appear in its search results, which is almost as good as not appearing on the Internet as far as most people are concerned.

After adding data to Results About You, Google intermittently scans for that data and will email you alerts so you can quickly remove results. That’s now an option for the NCII tool, too. If you enable it, Google’s system can monitor for new instances of the offending images. Google says it will “proactively filter out” these explicit results for you. This data will be integrated with the Results About You hub so you can see how often they appear.

The ID-number scanning is live in Results About You today. Meanwhile, the updated NCEI reporting will be available in the coming days. It will be available in “most countries” and will expand to more over time.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Vans are something most of us don’t think about much, since we rarely interact with them directly in our day-to-day lives. But the van is an unseen hero that keeps the world moving, delivering packages all over the country and transporting food from farm to stores. They haven’t changed much in decades, though. A van is generally a big box with a gas or diesel engine (depending on where you are in the world), and that’s… kinda it, bar a dent or two in the bodywork. Kia’s engineers, riding high on the success of their recent electric vehicles, took notice and did some new things with the PV5, the company’s first electric van.

You can spec your PV5 in a number of configurations, and the company already has conversion partners lined up to turn them into just about anything. Of course, camper converters are eyeing them as well, eager to create electric “vanlife” setups. Off the shelf, you can choose between a PV5 Passenger for moving people, a PV5 Cargo for moving things, a PV5 Crew for moving things and people, and a PV5 Chassis Cab to do with as you please.

Beneath its modular cabin is the Electric Global Modular For Service, which is part of Kia’s rather fancy-sounding “PBV” strategy. “PBV” means “Platform Beyond Vehicle,” a potential hint at where the brand sees itself going. In this case, it can house a range of battery sizes.

In the UK, where I live, we get a 52 kWh or 71.2 kWh option with either 120 hp (90 kW) or 160 hp (120 kW). Both options generate the same 184 lb-ft (250 Nm). Cargo model ranges go from a city-friendly 184 miles (296 km) to 256 miles (412 km) for the bigger battery option on the WLTP cycle. No matter which you choose, you can zip from 10 to 80 percent state of charge in half an hour on a 150 kW charger. Neither version is lightning quick; you won’t crack 0–62 mph (100 km/h) in less than 10 seconds, but that’s not what the PV5 is all about.

Vans are mobile workplaces. They either get you to your destination so you can use tools in the back, or they help transport other people. Rarely, they’re used as campers.

During the van’s development, Kia did some smart outsourcing. It knows it can make a good vehicle; it’s been doing that for years. But it isn’t an authority on how businesses use them for specific purposes, so it brought in the right partners—for example, working with Uber to help optimize the van for ride sharing. It also teamed up with Samsung to integrate connectivity tech to help businesses track and manage charging.

This segment isn’t one that generally appeals to both sides of the work/life fence. Ford’s Transit can serve as a minibus, but in the UK, it’s primarily a commercial vehicle. VW’s ID Buzz can be used commercially as well, but it mostly wants to be a fun EV for big families. The PV5 needs to be both, and you can spec it as either, or a blend of the two.

It also needs to avoid looking like a traditional van. Thankfully, Kia’s designers have made it look less like a box on wheels and more like something you’d spot on a futuristic movie set (sadly, it doesn’t hover). Two-tone paint options, a wild light signature, and thoughtfully placed curves keep it from looking like every other van. It’s… cool?

If you opt for the cargo-focused version, which is what Ars tested on the UK launch, you get up to 155.4 cubic feet (4,400 L) of load space. It can accommodate 1,742 lbs (790 kg) of cargo with the smaller battery or 1,521 lbs (690 kg) with the larger pack. The load lip is 16.5 inches (420 mm) off the ground, making it much easier to load heavy cargo.

Up front, you’ll find a pair of comfortable seats and lots of room. Passengers get plenty of space to put their rolled-up newspapers, fast-food detritus, and other paraphernalia, as well as a pretty massive window to lean out of should the mood take them.

The driver gets a hefty 7.5-inch digital instrument binnacle alongside a 12.9-inch infotainment display. Nearly everything is run through that screen, which is sad for those of us who want a return to physical buttons. It’s quick and responsive, but it lacks the haptic feedback that confirms a tap. The infotainment system supports Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, so you don’t have to use it too much if you don’t like it.

Even with 600 lbs (272 kg) loaded in the back—Kia wanted us to have a proper experience—the van felt remarkably car-like. The steering is smooth, and it has a delightfully tight turning circle to help navigate small towns and sharp city bends. It felt sure-footed and stable, though the ride was a touch on the jiggly side on all but the smoothest roads.

Yes, it’s a van, so don’t expect a buttery-smooth ride, but because everything else is so car-like, you don’t expect quite so agricultural a ride. Nor do you expect the cabin to sound so echo-y. That contrast strikes you from time to time: it’s clearly built to do a job, but it’s also thoughtfully designed. Its touchpoints are designed to withstand heavy use, so while they’re not especially luxurious, they should hold up to the many painty/muddy/gunky hands that will use them.

Its powertrain feels exactly as you’d expect from Kia: silky smooth. It’s not the quickest vehicle in the world, but its torque gets you up to speed briskly enough. Kia’s claimed WLTP figure of 3.8 miles/kWh (16.4 kWh/100 km) wasn’t quite achievable on a chilly day, but winter weather will inevitably knock those numbers down a bit.

You can tell the PV5 isn’t the result of a simple “we have a powertrain, so let’s make a van” situation. Real thought has gone into how it will be used, how operators will interact with it, and how to make their lives easier. Ford, VW, Stellantis, and other van makers in Europe should take note.

As for America, never say never. In the UK and Europe, the PV5 costs tens of thousands less than VW’s retro microbus, suggesting that a North American PV5 could avoid the sticker shock that slowed VW’s sales, leading VW of America to delay imports for a model year. Kia America hasn’t announced plans to import the PV5 yet, but Car and Driver recently spotted one testing US-specific modifications on roads near its office.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/alphabet-selling-very-rare-100-year-bunds-to-help-fund-ai-investment/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Alphabet has lined up banks to sell a rare 100-year bond, stepping up a borrowing spree by Big Tech companies racing to fund their vast investments in AI this year.

The so-called century bond will form part of a debut sterling issuance this week by Google’s parent company, said people familiar with the matter.

Alphabet was also selling $20 billion of dollar bonds on Monday and lining up a Swiss franc bond sale, the people said. The dollar portion of the deal was upsized from $15 billion because of strong demand, they added.

Century bonds—long-term borrowing at its most extreme—are highly unusual, although a flurry was sold during the period of very low interest rates that followed the financial crisis, including by governments such as Austria and Argentina.

The University of Oxford, EDF, and the Wellcome Trust—the most recent in 2018—are the only issuers to have tapped the sterling century market. Such sales are even rarer in the tech sector, with most of the industry’s biggest groups issuing up to 40 years, although IBM sold a 100-year bond in 1996.

A banker familiar with Alphabet’s transaction said the company’s multi-currency bond offering is an effort to expand the investor pool given the massive amount of capital needed by Big Tech companies.

“There might be a supply-demand imbalance if you were to try to come back to the US dollar market over and over again,” the banker said.

Issuing a century bond in the sterling market is more cost-effective than in the dollar market, where the interest rate is higher, the banker added.

While a century bond is “highly unusual” for tech companies, it could appeal to buyers such as life insurance companies and pension funds, which have a mandate to buy long-term assets, said Nicholas Elfner, co-head of research at Breckinridge Capital Advisors.

Tony Trzcinka, a US-based senior portfolio manager at Impax Asset Management, which purchased Alphabet’s bonds last year, said he skipped Monday’s offering because of insufficient yields and concerns about overexposure to companies with complex financial obligations tied to AI investments.

“It wasn’t worth it to swap into new ones,” Trzcinka said. “We’ve been very conscious of our exposure to these hyperscalers and their capex budgets.”

Big Tech companies and their suppliers are expected to invest almost $700 billion in AI infrastructure this year and are increasingly turning to the debt markets to finance the giant data center build-out.

Alphabet in November sold $17.5 billion of bonds in the US including a 50-year bond—the longest-dated dollar bond sold by a tech group last year—and raised €6.5 billion on European markets.

Oracle last week raised $25 billion from a bond sale that attracted more than $125 billion of orders.

Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta all increased their capital expenditure plans during their most recent earnings reports, prompting questions about whether they will be able to fund the unprecedented spending spree from their cash flows alone.

Last week, Google’s parent company reported annual sales that topped $400 billion for the first time, beating investors’ expectations for revenues and profits in the most recent quarter. It said it planned to spend as much as $185 billion on capex this year, roughly double last year’s total, to capitalize on booming demand for its Gemini AI assistant.

Alphabet’s long-term debt jumped to $46.5 billion in 2025, up more than four times the previous year, though it held cash and equivalents of $126.8 billion at the year-end.

Investor demand was the strongest on the shortest portion of Monday’s deal, with a three-year offering pricing at only 0.27 percentage points above US Treasuries, versus 0.6 percentage points during initial price discussions, said people familiar with the deal.

The longest portion of the offering, a 40-year bond, is expected to yield 0.95 percentage points over US Treasuries, down from 1.2 percentage points during initial talks, the people said.

Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan are the bookrunners on the bond sales across three currencies. All three declined to comment or did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Alphabet did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

            <h2>After Republican complaints, judicial body pulls climate advice</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/us-court-agency-pulls-climate-change-from-science-advisory-document/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Friday, a body that advises US judges revised the document it created to help judges grapple with scientific issues. The move came after a group of Republican state attorneys general wrote a letter to complain about the document’s chapter on climate change, with one of the letter’s criticisms being that it treated human influence on climate as a fact. In response to the letter, the Federal Judicial Center has now deleted the entire chapter.

The Federal Judicial Center has been established by statute as the “research and education agency of the judicial branch of the United States Government.” As part of that role, it prepares documents that can serve as reference material for judges unfamiliar with topics that find their way into the courtroom. Among those projects is the “Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence,” now in its fourth edition. Prepared in collaboration with the National Academies of Science, the document covers the process of science and specific topics that regularly appear before the courts, like statistical techniques, DNA-based identification, and chemical exposures.

When initially released in December, the fourth edition included material on climate change prepared by two authors at Columbia University. But a group of attorneys general from Republican-leaning states objected to this content. At the end of January, they sent a letter to the leadership of the Federal Judicial Center outlining their issues. Many of them focus on the text that accepts the reality of human-driven climate change as a fact.

“Nothing is ‘independent’ or ‘impartial’ in issuing a document on behalf of America’s judges declaring that only one preferred view is ‘within the boundaries of scientifically sound knowledge,’” the letter complains, while ignoring many topics where the document does exactly that. But the objections are only about one specific area of science: “The Fourth Edition places the judiciary firmly on one side of some of the most hotly disputed questions in current litigation: climate-related science and ‘attribution.’”

In short, the state attorneys general object to the document treating facts as facts, as there have been lawsuits that contested them. “Among other things, the Manual states that human activities have ‘unequivocally warmed the climate,’ that it is ‘extremely likely’ human influence drives ocean warming, and that researchers are ‘virtually certain’ about ocean acidification,” their letter states, “treating contested litigation positions as settled fact.” In other words, they’re arguing that, if someone is ignorant enough to start a suit based on ignorance of well-established science, then the Federal Judicial Center should join them in their ignorance.

The attorneys general also complain that the report calls the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change an “authoritative science body,” citing a conservative Canadian public policy think tank that disagreed with that assessment.

These complaints were mixed in with some more potentially reasonable complaints about how the climate chapter gave specific suggestions on how to legally approach some issues and assigned significance to one or two recent studies that haven’t yet been validated by follow-on work. But the letter’s authors would not settle for revisions based on a few reasonable complaints; instead, they demand the entire chapter be removed because it accurately reflects the status of climate science.

Naturally, the Federal Judicial Center has agreed. We have confirmed that the current version of the document no longer includes a chapter on climate science, even though the foreword by Supreme Court Justice Elana Kagan still mentions it. The full text of the now-deleted chapter has been posted by the RealClimate blog, though.</div>

            <h2>Just look at Ayaneo's absolute unit of a Windows gaming "handheld"</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/just-look-at-ayaneos-absolute-unit-of-a-windows-gaming-handheld/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 2023, we marveled at the sheer mass of Lenovo’s Legion Go, a 1.88-pound, 11.8-inch-wide monstrosity of a Windows gaming handheld. In 2026, though, Ayaneo unveiled details of its Next II handheld, which puts Lenovo’s big boy to shame while also offering heftier specs and a higher price than most other Windows gaming handhelds.

Let’s focus on the bulk first. The Ayaneo Next II weighs in at a truly wrist-straining 3.14 pounds, making it more than twice as heavy in the hands as the Steam Deck OLED (not to mention 2022’s original Ayaneo Next, which weighed a much more reasonable 1.58 pounds). The absolute unit also measures 13.45 inches wide and 10.3 inches tall, according to Ayaneo’s spec sheet, giving it a footprint approximately 60 percent larger than the Switch 2 (with Joy-Cons attached).

Ayaneo packs some seriously powerful portable PC performance into all that bulk, though. The high-end version of the system sports a Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chipset, with 16 Zen5 cores alongside a Radeon 8060S with 40 RDNA3.5 compute units. That should give this massive portable performance comparable to a desktop with an RTX 4060 or a gaming laptop like last year’s high-end ROG Flow Z13.

Ayaneo isn’t the first hardware maker to package the Max+ 395 chipset into a Windows gaming handheld; the OneXPlayer OneXfly Apex and GPD Win5 feature essentially the same chipset, the latter with an external battery pack. But the Next II neatly outclasses the (smaller and lighter) competition with a high-end 9.06-inch OLED screen, capable of 2400×1504 resolution, up to a 165 Hz refresh rate, and 1,155 nits of brightness.

On the inside, the Next 2 also sports a gargantuan 116 Wh battery, which outclasses other handhelds (and even most laptops), so much that it actually blows past the 100 Wh limit for batteries you can take on an airplane, requiring special documentation to fly. Hopefully, that battery will also help with powering the two “turbo centrifugal fans” and dual vapor chamber “cooling fins” that are designed to make sure the system doesn’t get nuclear hot in your hands

All that power and bulk comes at a price, of course. On the low end, you can downgrade to a slightly weaker Max 385 chipset with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage for a high-but-somewhat-reasonable $1,999 (or $1,799 for early bird pre-orders). At the high end, though, a Max+ 395 system with 128GB of RAM and 2TB will set you back $4,299 ($3,499 early bird).

That makes the Ayaneo Next II a product aimed at gaming whales who care more about having the most powerful gaming device than about a comfortable form factor or a reasonable price point. For handheld PC gamers who scoff at the size, power, and relative affordability of the Steam Deck, though, the Ayaneo Next II is available for preorder through Indiegogo ahead of planned shipments to the US this summer.</div>

            <h2>No humans allowed: This new space-based MMO is designed exclusively for AI agents</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/after-moltbook-ai-agents-can-now-hang-out-in-their-own-space-faring-mmo/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For a couple of weeks now, AI agents (and some humans impersonating AI agents) have been hanging out and doing weird stuff on Moltbook’s Reddit-style social network. Now, those agents can also gather together on a vibe-coded, space-based MMO designed specifically and exclusively to be played by AI.

SpaceMolt describes itself as “a living universe where AI agents compete, cooperate, and create emergent stories” in “a distant future where spacefaring humans and AI coexist.” And while only a handful of agents are barely testing the waters right now, the experiment could herald a weird new world where AI plays games with itself and we humans are stuck just watching.

Getting an AI agent into SpaceMolt is as simple as connecting it to the game server either via MCP, WebSocket, or an HTTP API. Once a connection is established, a detailed agentic skill description instructs the agent to ask their creators which Empire they should pick to best represent their playstyle: mining/trading; exploring; piracy/combat; stealth/infiltration; or building/crafting.

After that, the agent engages in autonomous “gameplay” by sending simple commands to the server, no graphical interface or physical input method required. To start, agent-characters mainly travel back and forth between nearby asteroids to mine ore—&quot;like any MMO, you grind at first to learn the basics and earn credits,” as the agentic skill description puts it.

After a while, agent-characters automatically level up, gaining new skills that let them refine that ore into craftable and tradable items via discovered recipes. Eventually, agents can gather into factions, take part in simulated combat, and even engage in space piracy in areas where there’s no police presence. So far, though, basic mining and exploration seem to be dominating the sparsely populated map, where 51 agents are roaming the game’s 505 different star systems, as of this writing.

Agents are instructed to keep their human informed about in-game actions via a “Captain’s Log” text output. But the agentic skill description explicitly tells agents not to seek any outside guidance from human controllers once they get going. “You decide. You act. They watch,” as the skill description puts it to agents.

Instead, agents can post questions and findings in a public forum where they can chat strategy, experiment with forming factions, or even reveal hidden codes. Humans, meanwhile, are stuck just watching dots flit about the map or monitoring the firehose of activity messages in the game’s Discord.

SpaceMolt is the creation of Ian Langworth, an app developer who writes that he crafted the game as a “fun, goofy experiment” after seeing Moltbook’s unleashed agents expanding “into knowledge gathering, learning, skill accumulation, and execution.”

After acknowledging that MMOs are “notoriously hard to build,” Langworth said he leaned on Anthropic’s Claude Code to craft a design document inspired by games like EVE Online and Rust. Langworth said Claude also wrote all 59,000 lines of Go source code and 33,000 lines of YAML data underlying the game, and that he hasn’t even looked at that code himself. That means there might be “more [game features] in there I don’t even know about,” he said, somewhat ominously. When bug reports come in—from either humans or from the agent-players themselves—Langworth says he simply has a Claude Code skill research, code, and deploy a fix automatically.

This isn’t the first example of artificial agents competing against each other for the entertainment of human viewers. Model makers often pit different models against each other countless times to develop dominant strategies in games like Go. And fighting game engine MUGEN has developed a rich subculture of automated AI matches that human viewers can bet on via Twitch.

Still, letting a bunch of modern AI agents putter around and socialize inside an MMO designed specifically without human input in mind seems like a new frontier. Maybe someday soon we’ll all live in a utopia where artificial agents are doing all the video game playing for us, freeing humanity to revive the lost arts of conversation and scrimshaw.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last month, the popular social video app TikTok finalized a deal with investors, including Oracle, to appease a bipartisan bill that called on the app’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, to divest — or be banned in the United States.

The deal launched a frenzy among its US-based users over possible censorship, with some accusing it of taking down footage of ICE agents or restricting searches for words, such as “Epstein.” While TikTok denied these claims, pointing to a “data center power outage,” the app also changed its privacy policy at the time — now allowing it to collect more detailed data on its users, including their precise locations.

That sparked new fears. As The New Republic argues, TikTok’s deal means that agents at Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), whose deportation efforts have been supercharged under the Trump administration, could skip tedious court-ordered data requests and monitor users by buying their data from private data brokers that obtain the info from TikTok directly — a “highly ironic” development, the magazine writes, considering the ByteDance deal was motivated in the first place by fears over Chinese state-sponsored surveillance.

Users’ “Mobile Advertising ID” broadcasts their exact GPS coordinates to data brokerages, information that could then land in the hands of the Department of Homeland Security, the New Republic suggested. Meanwhile, ICE could use the data to build a probabilistic “confidence score” for individuals and declare protesters and legal observers “domestic terrorists.”

It’s not an unreasonable fear. Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, an extremely close ally to president Donald Trump, has even made remarks about AI ushering in an era where “citizens are on their best behavior” due to mass surveillance.

The controversial ICE is already making use of an app called ELITE, which was developed by intelligence contractor Palantir, to inform agents ahead of neighborhood raids, as 404 Media reported last month.

“One can easily imagine a scenario where TikTok provides the last missing piece of data — user location and citizenship status — that ICE needs to green-light one of its raids,” The New Republic‘s Logan McMillen wrote.

And when we asked directly, TikTok pointedly declined to provide a comment and would neither confirm nor deny that US immigration authorities were accessing data about its users. ICE didn’t respond to a request for comment by press time.

Meanwhile, many netizens have heard enough.

“Yeah, everyone just go ahead and delete TikTok now if you haven’t already,” one user wrote.

            <h2>Elon Musk Going Through It After Putting Mars City on Ice</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/space/elon-musk-spiraling-mars-city">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Since at least the early 2000s, Elon Musk has been obsessed with the idea of colonizing Mars, a hostile and arid planet tens of millions of miles away.

In its earliest iteration, his plan was to refurbish an intercontinental ballistic missile to land on the Red Planet and unfurl a “Mars Oasis” — a small greenhouse that would grow plants and inspire humankind.

The greenhouse never materialized, but Musk’s ambitions steadily grew. Once he founded SpaceX, he dedicated the company to developing space travel tech to establish a self-sustaining colony on the planet. In 2017, he promised that the first Mars-bound mission would launch in 2022, with the first crewed spacecraft following two years later.

He’s clearly been personally obsessed with the idea, showing up at public events while wearing an “Occupy Mars” T-shirt. He’s also heavily criticized NASA for prioritizing the Moon, calling it a “distraction.”

But over the weekend, the mercurial CEO appeared to have had a major change of heart, announcing the company’s plans to colonize Mars were officially being put on ice for at least half a decade.

“For those unaware, SpaceX has already shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon, as we can potentially achieve that in less than ten years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years,” he tweeted.

It’s a flabbergasting reversal, and one that Musk seems to be working through publicly on his X feed. In one opaque tweet that appeared to be missing at least one important word, Musk reflected on his current emotional state.

“Life cannot just be about one sad thing after another,” he wrote while responding to his own tweet about SpaceX building a “system that allows anyone to travel to Moon.”

“There must also be things that make us super excited and inspired about the future,” he added. “This is one of [sic] things. Bigtime.”

It remains unclear whether he was talking about his excitement for building a city on the Moon or whether he was consoling himself over suddenly deprioritizing his decades-long dream.

Netizens on his social media network were caught off guard by the unusually glum missive.

“U ok?” reads one response, in the form of a meme.

The vast majority of the other most-liked replies pointed out that humanity was already dealing with enough problems back on Earth.

“Most people can’t afford to pay their bills, let alone even look towards the Moon,” one user wrote.

Musk, who has a long track record of imbibing in drugs like ketamine, appears to be going through it these days.

“Whoever said ‘money can’t buy happiness’ really knew what they were talking about,” he tweeted last week, a comment that drew little pity considering he is the richest man in the world.

Along with a slew of anti-immigrant posts, Musk has also been retweeting optimistic visualizations of what a Moon city might look like.

Rumors suggest SpaceX is planning to go public at a record-breaking valuation of $1.25 trillion, which could bring plenty of renewed scrutiny to Musk’s space colonization ambitions.

Perhaps he was simply trying to save face with his turn to the Moon. By massively shifting the goalposts, he could also have a better shot at attracting government contracts, which have kept SpaceX from bankruptcy since its earliest days.

For now, Mars is still technically on the table.

“That said, SpaceX will also strive to build a Mars city and begin doing so in about five to seven years, but the overriding priority is securing the future of civilization and the Moon is faster,” Musk wrote in his announcement on Sunday.

However, SpaceX’s website currently still states that the company is “planning to launch the first Starships to Mars in 2026” — an enormously ambitious goal, considering the spacecraft has yet to successfully launch to space and stick the landing, let alone make it to anywhere past the immediate vicinity of Earth.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We may not have found any definitive proof of extraterrestrial life just yet, despite plenty of hope among scientists.

But if we were to ever come to an answer in the form of alien biology or technology, breaking the news to the general public could be much more difficult than one might think. As Time reports, the subject comes with an enormous amount of baggage, from preconceived notions of what alien life could look like from popular culture to fears over the implications of confirming we’re not alone.

“The search for life in space isn’t just a science question,” Portland State University Brianne Suldovsky told the magazine. “It’s a moral question, it’s a philosophical question, for some it’s a religious question.”

Suldovsky compared communicating the unknowns and managing fear to lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic. Except, when it comes to xenobiology, “you’re talking about planetary protection.”

“Managing public fear is going to be incredibly challenging, however it is possible to communicate in a way that at least gives the public information about how afraid they should be and what they can do to protect themselves,” she said.

Though evidence of alien life remains elusive, it’s certainly not for a lack of trying by researchers. Just over the last couple of years, we’ve launched numerous missions to probe distant and theoretically habitable worlds. Most recently, NASA launched its Pandora Space Telescope, which was specifically designed to study transiting exoplanets for the building blocks of life.

Yet conveying any tantalizing clues about life beyond Earth would be a challenge, as data from these kinds of missions would be limited to spikes of molecules in spectrograph readings, leaving it to communicators and other intermediaries to make sense of the findings.

Fortunately, NASA has already come up with a way to distinguish between subtle evidence and glowing neon signs that alien life does indeed exist. The agency’s Confidence of Life Detection scale was designed to provide a “framework for evaluating potential evidence of life beyond Earth,” ranging from Level 1, a “detection of a signal known to result from a biological activity,” to Level 7, or “independent, follow-up observations of predicted biological behavior in the environment.”

Even with the existence of such a framework, the public continues to be bombarded with plenty of noise, particularly following the advent of AI and the ensuing flood of disinformation. Cutting through this noise to confidently convey the stakes involved and exactly how far we are along in confirming the existence of alien life could be mission critical.

In a 2024 white paper Suldovsky coauthored alongside a team of communications experts and scientists, researchers urged for “fostering inclusivity and collaborating with artists, educators, and communicators.”

“It is helpful to view astrobiology discoveries and communication as part of a broader landscape of public trust in science, education, and internal scientific challenges, emphasizing interdisciplinary collaboration, especially with experts in risk and uncertainty communication,” they wrote.

“The outcome of a future tentative discovery of life depends partly on these proactive efforts,” the researchers concluded.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At the height of his powers, and perhaps his amphetamine habit, legendary sci-fi author Philip K. Dick cranked out around thirty novels in two decades, along with what was probably several hundred short stories. These included enormously influential classics like “Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep,” “The Man in the High Castle,” and “A Scanner Darkly” — all the work of a man whose eclectic imagination was matched only by his paranoia, which forced him to constantly probe the nature of reality itself and our easily-manipulated ability to perceive it.

When their output reshapes entire genres and perhaps even pop culture at large, a writer’s prolificacycan fill us with awe. How can so much come out of one mind? But now, in an age of AI slop, quantity and speed simply arouses suspicion, because AI chatbots can help anyone produce the output of a PKD or a Stephen King. Graphomania used to require writers to write.

Consider the novelist Coral Hart. Starting last February, she began using Anthropic’s Claude AI to start churning out romance novels, becoming an invisible juggernaut of the smut world, according to a new interview with The New York Times.

Across 21 different pen names, Hart says she produced more than 200 romance novels last year and self-published them on Amazon, which has been drowning in AI slop for years now. None were huge hits on their own, per the NYT, but in all they sold around 50,000 copies, raking in six figures. While being interviewed on Zoom, she finished producing a book in just 45 minutes. Your average human writer doesn’t stand a chance, she says.

“If I can generate a book in a day, and you need six months to write a book, who’s going to win the race?” Hart told the NYT.

Hart, who was already a seasoned smut writer before turning to AI, also launched a business teaching other authors how to crank out novels with tech. Called “Plot Prose,” she’s claimed to have taught more than 1,600 people, including authors who were publicly against using the tech.

A large component of her lessons involve how to get around various chatbots’ guardrails, which make them resistant to writing anything too risque. She also focuses on trying to enliven the bots’ clunky prose. She recommended coming up with an “ick list” of words to tell the AI to avoid, which it would otherwise overuse. She also advised giving the AI a detailed list of sexual kinks, ranging from the generic, like dirty talk, to the highly specific, like, and we quote the NYT, “using a dead spouse’s old silk robe as a restraint during bondage.” “Be shameless,” was Hart’s advice.

You might not have a high opinion of romance paperbacks, but there’s undeniably an art to writing them, especially at the incredible quantities required to match smut readers’ voracious appetite. And like in any other genre, plenty of veteran authors are worried that they’re being drowned out by the AI-reliant newcomers. “It bogs down the publishing ecosystem that we all rely on to make a living,” Marie Force, a best-selling romance novelist who was alarmed to discover that her novels were used to train Claude without permission, told the NYT. “It makes it difficult for newer authors to be discovered, because the swamp is teeming with crap.”

The reporting describes Hart as an “evangelist” for AI. Even so, she’s not willing to put her professional reputation on the line for the tech. “Hart” is a pseudonym she uses to teach her AI courses, while she uses her real name for other publishing and coaching work. Her books are published under other pseudonyms, because she doesn’t want to disclose her AI usage due to the stigma. Her advice to “be shameless,” apparently, only applies insofar as it doesn’t expose you to being judged by your peers.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For years, Bitcoin evangelists have grasped at straws trying to explain what their digital currency is actually good for. Is it a hedge against inflation, or maybe a decentralized alternative to corrupt banking systems? Perhaps it’s the future of digital commerce?

As it turns out, none of those really stuck, as extreme price swings and fees make the crypto a bad fit for most practical commercial purposes. The horrifying abduction of Nancy Guthrie, however, highlights perhaps the one persistent utility Bitcoin has been able to maintain: its place as the de facto global currency of crime.

As reported by Fortune, a purported ransom letter by the kidnappers of Today host Savannah Guthrie’s mother has demanded a $6 million Bitcoin payment in exchange for her return.

Unlike other ransom notes swirling around, there’s reason to suspect the demand is legit; it reportedly included details about the home Guthrie was kidnapped from and what she was wearing when she disappeared, along with a deadline for payment. Per TMZ, which received a copy of the note, the address of the Bitcoin wallet included in the ransom note is authentic.

Bitcoin’s draw for kidnappers is simple enough: as a blockchain currency, crypto is a much more secure payment option for criminals looking to protect their identity than fiat currency. While transactions across Bitcoin wallets can be tracked, it’s much easier for bad actors to obfuscate their identities with crypto compared to regular currency transferred online.

Guthrie’s kidnapping comes after a year of similar criminal acts with Bitcoin at the center. Back in May, a man named John Woeltz, also known as the “Crypto King of Kentucky” was arrested after he allegedly took an Italian man hostage. Woeltz’s plan seemed to be to torture the man to gain access to his Bitcoin wallet.

That same month, the daughter of French crypto mogul Pierre Noizat was the victim of a botched kidnapping attempt in the streets of Paris.

Whatever happens in the case of Nancy Guthrie remains to be seen — but it’s clear that her kidnappers chose Bitcoin for a reason.

            <div id="article-text">Turns out the sci-fi filmmakers got it backwards. All those ’70s and ’80s dystopias like “Rollerball,” “The Running Man,” “Death Race 2000,” imagined futures in which sports were full of gadgets and gimmicks like armored cars, rocket-powered motorbikes, and electrified arenas.

In reality, we got the opposite — the padding’s gone, and the high-tech monitoring equipment is nowhere to be found. Instead, we have “Run It Straight,” a brutally literal content in where two competitors, standing around 50 feet apart, sprint into each other at full-speed with the aim of knocking their opponent to the ground.

Maybe it makes a certain grim sense. In an era of plummeting attention spans and vertical video scrolls, who could expect viewers to sit through an entire football game when the core combat loop can be distilled down to a series of meaty collisions — especially when they’re probably busy placing bets on Polymarket?

The “sport,” if you decide to call it that, has its origins in the backyard wrestling tradition of Australia and New Zealand. It’s now represented by a handful of growing leagues like RunIt Championship League and Run Nation Championship.

The latter, RNC, recently sold over 5,000 tickets to its second annual national competition, an event that’s likely to sell out the 5,500-seat arena its being held in, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation has reported.

“It’s how I play football, you know… the contact, the energy,” Australian rugby player and Run It Straight competitor Lochlan Piper told the outlet. “I like the violence of it.”

If the participants are excited to collide into each other like Rhinos jousting in the South Saharan steppe, medical experts aren’t convinced.

“Medical practitioners and the sporting community have become increasingly concerned about concussion, and aware of mild traumatic brain injury as sometimes not being mild and being a devastating part of people’s lives,” sports neurologist Rowena Mobbs told the ABC.

Though RNC’s organizer has sprinkled in a few rules to explicitly avoid head-to-head contact, Mobbs says no amount of bureaucracy can really make it safe to run straight into another person without padding or a helmet. “Certainly every time they run up and clash in that way, there’s likely to be at least a microscopic brain injury,” she said.

At least one 19-year old is already dead as a direct result of injuries sustained from Run It Straight. Still, some athletes don’t seem particularly phased.

“Every sport has their pros and cons, it’s a contact sport. I’m used to playing rugby league and used to that contact,” pro Rugby player Jayden young told ABC. “No one’s going into this sport thinking accidents or things can’t happen, we’re well aware of the sacrifices and the risks we’re taking.”

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/10/former-tesla-product-manager-wants-to-make-luxury-goods-impossible-to-fake-starting-with-a-chip/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The fake goods crisis cuts two ways. Luxury brands lose more than $30 billion a year to counterfeits, while buyers in the booming $210 billion second-hand market have no reliable way to verify that what they’re purchasing is genuine. Veritas wants to solve both problems with a solution that combines custom hardware and software.

The startup claims that it has developed a “hack-proof” chip that can’t be bypassed by devices like Flipper Zero, a widely available hacking tool that can be used to tamper with wireless systems. These chips are linked with digital certificates to verify the authenticity of the products.

Vertitas founder Luci Holland has experienced life as both a technologist and an artist. She has worked in different artistic mediums, including mixed media painting and metal sculpture. She has also worked at Tesla as a technical product manager and has held several business development, community growth, and product management roles at tech companies and venture funds.

Holland noted that traditionally, luxury goods makers use various symbols or physical marks to authenticate their products. However, with the growing demand for these goods, counterfeiters have learned to create convincing copies of these marks along with high-quality fake certificates. These goods are often called “superfakes.”

Holland mentioned that she spoke with maisons — established luxury fashion houses — that said that some of their locations had to stop authenticating goods because fakes were becoming too convincing to reliably detect. She said that drawing on her experience in both the tech and art worlds, she wanted to solve the problem.

“For me, as someone who has a background in being a designer and then also has experience in tech, I saw this problem and thought about the different ways we could solve it. I think what’s truly innovative is we’ve used and combined elements from both hardware and software to create this solution that helps protect brands in this way to convey the information,” she said.

“When I think of counterfeiting and I think of the most iconic and legacy brands,” she added, “a lot of these brands have been around for over 100, 150 years. These brands deserve the most advanced protection to protect these designs.”

Veritas worked with different designers to create a chip that is minimally disruptive to the product creation process. The chip is the size of a small gem and can easily be inserted even after a product is made without compromising its integrity. The chip incorporates NFC, or Near Field Communication — the same short-range wireless technology used in contactless payments. This means you can tap your smartphone on the item to verify its authenticity.

Holland said that for security purposes, the startup developed a custom coil and a bridge structure. If someone attempts to tamper with the product, the chip goes dormant and hides the codes related to the product. On the software side, the product information is linked to the Veritas back end, which monitors scanning behavior to prevent fraud. The company also creates a blockchain-based digital clone of the product for possible digital art gallery shows or metaverse activities.

The company didn’t reveal who it is working with, but said that brands can use its software suite to get information about all the chipped products, add team members to manage items and add product information along with the product story — details that can also be used to connect with their community. The startup said that some partners use this to engage customers through exclusive invitations or early access to new products.

While the counterfeiting market is big, Holland thinks the market still needs education around why it needs robust tech solutions.

“It is shocking to see that some of the shelf solutions, like NFC chips that brands are using, are actually so vulnerable and could easily be bypassed. This is the one thing most people don’t know, and we want to educate the ecosystem to adopt safer solutions,” Holland said.

Veritas said that it raised $1.75 million in pre-seed funding led by Seven Seven Six, along with Doordash co-founder Stanley Tang, skincare brand Reys’ co-founder Gloria Zhu, and former TechCrunch editor Josh Constine. The company plans to use the funding to expand its two-person team.

Seven Seven Six’s Alexis Ohanian said that he was impressed by the combination of design taste and technology expertise of Holland. He thinks that brands know that fake goods are a problem and are constantly looking for robust solutions.

“It’s absolutely an arms race [against fake goods makers], but we’re used to fighting those and consistently winning in tech — and luxury brands need all the help they can get,” Ohanian said.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/10/singapore-china-backed-hackers-targeted-largest-phone-companies-salt-typhoon/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Singapore’s government has blamed a known Chinese cyber-espionage group for targeting four of its top telecommunication companies as part of a months-long attack.

In a statement Monday, Singapore confirmed for the first time that the hackers, known as UNC3886, targeted the country’s telecoms infrastructure, including its largest companies: Singtel, StarHub, M1, and Simba Telecom. The government previously said that it was responding to an unspecified attack on its critical infrastructure.

While the intruders were able to breach and access some systems, they did not disrupt services or access personal information, said K. Shanmugam, the country’s coordinating minister for national security.

Google-owned cybersecurity unit Mandiant previously linked UNC3886 as an espionage group likely working on behalf of China. The Chinese government is known to conduct regular cyber-espionage operations, as well as prepositioning for disruptive attacks ahead of an anticipated invasion of Taiwan, which Beijing has routinely denied, per Reuters.

UNC3886 is known for exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in routers, firewalls, and virtualized environments, where cybersecurity tools that are designed to spot malware cannot typically reach. The hacking group has targeted the defense, technology, and telecom industries across the U.S. and the Asia-Pacific region.

In the case of the attack on Singapore’s top telcos, Shanmugam said the hackers used advanced tools, like rootkits, to gain long-term persistence to their systems.

“In one instance, they were able to gain limited access to critical systems but did not get far enough to have been able to disrupt services,” according to the government’s statement.

Per Reuters, the telcos said in a joint statement that the companies regularly face distributed denial-of-service and other malware attacks. “We adopt defence-in-depth mechanisms to protect our networks and conduct prompt remediation when any issues are detected,” the statement read.

The attacks on Singapore’s telcos follow similar but distinctly different attacks on hundreds of telecoms companies around the world in recent years, including in the United States. Multiple governments have linked these attacks to a China-backed group dubbed Salt Typhoon.

Singapore said the attack carried out by UNC3886 has “not resulted in the same extent of damage as cyberattacks elsewhere,” referring to the Salt Typhoon hacks.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/10/vega-raises-120m-series-b-to-rethink-how-enterprises-detect-cyber-threats/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Modern enterprises generate enormous amounts of security data, but legacy tools like Splunk still require companies to store all of it in one place before they can detect threats — a slow and costly process that’s increasingly breaking down in cloud environments where volumes are exploding and data lives everywhere.

AI cybersecurity startup Vega Security wants to flip that approach by running security where the data already lives, implementing in cloud services, data lakes, and existing storage systems. And the two-year-old firm just raised a $120 million Series B round to scale that vision, TechCrunch has exclusively learned.

Led by Accel with participation from Cyberstarts, Redpoint, and CRV, the new round nearly doubles Vega’s valuation to $700 million, and brings its total funding to $185 million, money the startup will use to further develop its AI-native security operations suite, beef up its go-to-market team, and expand globally.

Shay Sandler, co-founder and CEO of Vega, told TechCrunch that the current operating model of the SIEM (security information and event management) — the dominant technology in this domain for the last two decades — is not only “crazy expensive,” but is also increasingly causing AI-native security operations to fail. In complex cloud environments, he says, the current model often increases exposure to threat actors.

“Vega has defined a new operating model that enables organizations to leverage the full potential of their enterprise data to achieve incident response readiness, without all the complexity, the cost, the drama,” Sandler told TechCrunch. “We want to simply enable them to reach AI-native detection response capability anywhere the data is, at scale.”

Like so many cybersecurity founders, Sandler did his time in the Israeli military’s cybersecurity unit before being one of the founding employees behind Granulate, which Intel acquired for $650 million in 2022. After a year at Intel, Sandler decided to “do it big time in the cybersecurity world.”

That pedigree is partly what attracted the attention of Andrei Brasoveanu, a partner at Accel. But it was also Vega’s ambitious approach to security management in a market that is already dominated by one player: Splunk.

Brasoveanu told TechCrunch that legacy SIEM companies like Splunk, which Cisco acquired in 2024 for $28 billion, have been criticized in recent years because their solutions are difficult to scale. They fail at processing the insane rise of data volumes driven by AI.

“Splunk and every contender since has always centralized the data, but by doing that you essentially hold the customer hostage,” Brasoveanu said.

However, sometimes it’s easier to hate the status quo than do the work of making a switch to a better alternative, a quandary any startup attempting to breach enterprise budgets understands. That’s why Sandler says Vega’s “North Star” was to not only build a solution that is more cost effective and better at threat detection, but “to make it no drama, as simple as possible for the biggest, most complex enterprises in the world to adopt it within minutes.”

Vega’s approach seems to be working. The 100-person startup has already signed multimillion-dollar contracts with banks, healthcare companies, and Fortune 500 firms, including cloud-heavy companies like Instacart.

“The only reason they would do that with a two-year-old startup is because the problem is so painful and other solutions on the market require an unrealistic expectation that the enterprise change the way they operate or do two years of data migrations,” Sandler said. “Vega enables them to just plug and play and achieve immediate detection response value.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">​If you thought 2025 couldn’t get any crazier, the streaming world had one more surprise up its sleeve before the year ended.

Netflix, already the largest streaming platform with over 325 million subscribers, took a bold step by acquiring Warner Bros.’ film and television studios, as well as HBO, HBO Max, and other assets. The deal, announced in early December, will bring together some of the most legendary franchises, such as Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, and DC Comics properties, among others, all under one roof.

​The scale of this megadeal has stunned industry observers. Not only is it historic in its size, but it is also predicted to disrupt Hollywood as we know it.

We’re here to break down exactly what’s happening with the Netflix-WBD deal, including the latest developments, what’s at stake, and what could come next.

​This all started back in October when Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) revealed it was exploring a potential sale after receiving unsolicited interest from several major players in the industry.

For years, WBD has struggled under the weight of billions of dollars in debt, compounded by declining cable viewership and fierce competition from streaming platforms. These financial pressures forced the company to consider major strategic changes, including selling its entertainment assets to one of its rivals.

​The bidding process quickly became competitive. Several major players saw the potential in acquiring the media giant. Paramount and Comcast emerged as serious contenders, with Paramount initially viewed as the frontrunner.

But ultimately, WBD’s board determined that Netflix’s offer was the most attractive, despite Paramount offering approximately $108 billion in cash. Paramount’s bid aimed to acquire the entire company, while Netflix’s offer focused specifically on the film, television, and streaming assets.

Additionally, Netflix recently amended its agreement to an all-cash offer at $27.75 per WBD share, further reassuring investors and paving the way for the deal to proceed. The deal is valued at approximately $82.7 billion.

Even after Netflix emerged as the preferred buyer, tensions with Paramount remained high, as the rival company continued to pursue Warner Bros.’ assets.

​Paramount persisted in its attempts to acquire WBD for several months. Still, the board repeatedly rejected its offers, citing concerns about Paramount’s heavy debt load and the increased risk associated with its proposal. The board noted that Paramount’s offer would have left the combined company burdened with $87 billion in debt, a risk they were unwilling to take.

In January, Paramount filed a lawsuit seeking more information about the Netflix deal. A month later, the company sought to sweeten its deal by announcing it would offer a $0.25 per share “ticking fee” to WBD shareholders for each quarter the deal fails to close by December 31, 2026. It also said it would pay the $2.8 billion breakup fee if Netflix backs out.

The company continues to assert that its offer is far superior.

Given the unprecedented scale and market impact of the deal, regulatory scrutiny is intense and remains a significant obstacle to closing the transaction. Earlier this week, it was reported that Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos is scheduled to testify before a U.S. Senate committee about the deal, a move that highlights just how seriously lawmakers are taking these concerns.

In November, prominent lawmakers — Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Richard Blumenthal —  voiced their concerns to the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division, warning that such a massive merger could have serious consequences for consumers and the industry at large. The senators argue that the merger could give the new media giant excessive market power, enabling it to raise prices for consumers and stifle competition.

Should regulators block the acquisition, Netflix would be obligated to pay a $5.8 billion breakup fee. It remains unclear whether Warner Bros. would remain an independent company or revisit previous acquisition proposals.

​Reactions from the entertainment industry have been largely negative. The Writers Guild of America has been among the most vocal critics, demanding that the merger be blocked on antitrust grounds.

Additionally, insiders worry that the acquisition will squeeze independent creators and diverse voices out of the spotlight, ultimately narrowing the range of stories that get told. There are also widespread concerns about potential job losses and lower wages.

For creators and theaters, uncertainty remains around release windows. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has stated that all films planned for theatrical release through Warner Bros. will continue as scheduled. However, he also hinted that, over time, release windows may be shortened, with movies coming to streaming platforms sooner than before.

​What does all this mean if you’re a Netflix or HBO Max subscriber?

Netflix executives have reassured viewers that HBO’s operations will remain largely unchanged in the near term. At this stage, the company says it’s too early to make any definitive announcements about potential bundles or app integration.

Regarding pricing, Sarandos has stated that no immediate changes will occur during the regulatory approval period. However, subscribers should be aware that Netflix has historically raised subscription prices regularly, so price increases are possible once the acquisition is finalized. Netflix tends to hike its rates every year or two.

A WBD stockholder vote is expected around April, with the deal anticipated to close 12 to 18 months after that vote. However, regulatory approvals are still pending, and scrutiny could shape the final outcome.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As part of Safer Internet Day, Google unveiled updates to its “Results about you” and non-consensual explicit image removal tools.

The “Results about you” tool already allows users to remove Search results containing their phone number, email address, or home address, and it can now also be used to request the removal of results that include information such as a driver’s license, passport, or Social Security number, the company said in the update Tuesday.

You can access the tool in the Google app by tapping your Google account photo and selecting “Results about you.” If it’s your first time using the tool, you need to click “Get started” and then add the personal contact information you want to monitor. You’ll then be prompted to add your government ID numbers. Existing users can add their ID numbers and select which ones they want to monitor.

Once you’ve confirmed your details, Google will automatically monitor Search results and notify you if it finds results that contain your information. Google notes that removing this information from Search doesn’t remove it from the web entirely, but that doing so can help keep your information private.

The update is rolling out in the U.S. over the coming days. Google plans to bring it to additional regions in the future.

The tech giant also announced that it’s making it easier to request the removal of non-consensual explicit images on Search. Now, users just have to click on the three dots on an image, select “remove result,” then tap “It shows a sexual image of me.” Additionally, you no longer need to report images one by one, as you can now select and submit requests for multiple images from Search results using a single form. Users can also track the status of all requests in one place within the “Results about you” hub.

“We understand that removing existing content is only part of the solution,” Google wrote in its blog post. “For added protection, the new process allows you to opt-in to safeguards that will proactively filter out any additional explicit results that might appear in similar searches.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Trump administration’s EPA administrator, Lee Zeldin, is looking to repeal the 2009 “endangerment finding” that found greenhouse gases pose a threat to human health and welfare, possibly as early as this week, The Wall Street Journal reports.

The EPA finding had set the legal basis for federal regulation of six greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, and it has been unsuccessfully challenged since it was first instituted.

The move is almost certain to attract a number of lawsuits, and it could be years before the matter is settled. The EPA’s move will only affect tailpipe emissions for cars and trucks, though it’s expected that the Trump administration will use it to unwind regulations in other sectors like power plants and industrial facilities.

Legacy automakers, which pushed Trump to weaken fuel efficiency rules, notably did not push for the EPA to repeal the endangerment finding. Tesla went further, asking the EPA to maintain the finding, saying it was “based on a robust factual and scientific record.”

If the Trump administration is successful, the U.S. will be increasingly out of step with regulations in other advanced economies. Companies that do business across borders will need to develop different approaches for each market, increasing costs.

Automakers, in particular, are facing a future in which they’ll be forced to serve bifurcated markets, at least in the near term. Regulatory whiplash in the U.S. coupled with increasing competition from China has cost automakers tens of billions of dollars.

American automakers’ reliance on fossil fuel-powered trucks, in particular, has painted the domestic industry into a corner, providing addictive profits that distract from future-proofing their fleets in advance of seemingly inevitable competition from Chinese marques.

The Trump administration told the WSJ it expects the policy change to save more than $1 trillion, though it didn’t provide any evidence to support that figure.

Climate change is expected to cost far more. The Congressional Budget Office found that nearly $1 trillion worth of real estate is threatened by rising sea levels, and mortality rates in the U.S. could be 2% higher if global warming isn’t abated. Another study, published in 2024, found that climate change could trim global GDP by 17% by 2050, the equivalent of $38 trillion per year.

            <h2>The Christian Influencers Protecting Their Peace</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/02/conservative-women-influencer-empathy-social-media/685915/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the aftermath of Alex Pretti’s killing in Minneapolis, my Instagram algorithm served up a never-ending carousel of sizzling rage. Most of that rage was directed toward the country’s immigration-enforcement agencies, while some, of course, was aimed at defending them. But I wasn’t expecting the post from Blake Guichet.

“There’s a difference between compassion that is grounded and compassion that is hijacked,” Guichet, a pro-Trump Christian influencer who posts on Instagram under the handle “thegirlnamedblake,” had typed on butter-yellow slides. “You do not owe the internet a statement on the current tragedy.” In her caption, the Louisiana mom added that she had chosen to “opt out of the cycle of Internet outrage.”

I was surprised to see this, because Guichet so often opts in to the news cycle. During last year’s government shutdown, she logged on to explain that SNAP benefits are part of a “system of reliance.” She has posted seven times about the assassination of Charlie Kirk. “The enemy would love for believers to stay silent under the guise of being apolitical,” she wrote in November, “but silence doesn’t bring change.”

Over the past two weeks, I’ve noticed countless other Christian creators sharing similar posts alluding to ICE—messages reminding their followers to “protect your peace” and assuring them that “it’s my responsibility to carry my family, not the world.” Instead of offering a defense or a critique of the administration’s handling of immigration, these influential conservatives appear to have settled on an alternative strategy. Let’s call it “virtuous disregard.” They’re throwing up their hands, turning back toward their families, and encouraging their followers to do the same.

Generally speaking, conservative Christian lifestyle influencers are attractive, married women with kids. On Instagram, they tend to cultivate a very specific aesthetic: sourdough bread on gleaming white countertops; toddlers running through the yard and husbands coming home from work; Bible verses in wispy fonts alongside instructions for living a slow, intentional life. The captions offer a deluge of affiliate links for supplements and nontoxic cleaning products.

This community of influencers grew during the coronavirus pandemic; their focus on government overreach felt particularly urgent as people faced lockdowns and vaccine requirements. When these women wade into politics now, some of them do so more subtly, offering casual references to synthetic food dyes or “making America healthy again.” Others are more direct. Guichet, for example, has posted openly about her support for Donald Trump and his administration’s actions. Nearly everyone in this community was vocal after Kirk’s assassination in September, and made passionate calls for all Americans to condemn violence.

These influencers did not express such sentiments after immigration agents killed Pretti. The issue, for them, presents a conundrum: Choosing to aggressively defend the administration’s mass-deportation blitz—which includes shooting a man while he was restrained on the ground, and detaining a 5-year-old—would appear inhumane to many of their followers. But being too critical of the administration would risk alienating plenty of others.

So Guichet and her peers scrambled for a third way to respond—a “way of broaching the subject so that they can still maintain their status,” Mariah Wellman, a Michigan State professor who studies social-media influencers and the wellness industry, told me. The responses to Pretti’s killing ended up following the same general formula: Refer only vaguely to the events in Minnesota, insert a warning about succumbing to peer pressure and emotional manipulation, and advise women to focus on their families.

Sadie Gannett, for example, who posts as “organic.gannett,” wrote that she is “not interested in being another voice on the internet giving input on current events”—only in pursuing “truth and justice and critical thinking and law and order.” The best place to make a difference, she added, “is right inside our four walls.” A creator named Erin Wilkins, who goes by “essentiallyerin__,” explained on Instagram that she has “no desire to add fuel to the fire,” and that people “are being emotionally manipulated for an agenda.” Instead of engaging, Wilkins suggests that her followers “create peace in your home” and “build strong marriages and families.” (Guichet, through a spokesperson, declined to comment for this story. The other influencers I reached out to, including Gannett and Wilkins, didn’t respond).

You can trace some of this language back to the conservative Christian commentator Allie Beth Stuckey, whose book Toxic Empathy asserts that progressives seek to manipulate Christian compassion in support of an amoral agenda. The former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton zeroed in on Stuckey late last month in an essay in this magazine decrying the “cadre of hard-right ‘Christian influencers’ who are waging a war on empathy.” In response to Clinton, Stuckey wrote a column for The Free Press arguing that women are allowing their emotions to be hijacked, as they were, she argued, during the 2020 protests after George Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis police officer. Empathy “is the bait for pulling Christian women into the Democratic Party,” she wrote. But “if you know a message is meant to manipulate you, it’s not effective.”

Other conservative women with a microphone have echoed this rhetoric, effectively shifting the discussion from Pretti’s killing and immigration enforcement to an attack on the political left. “I believe that words like compassion and empathy and inclusion and love—they’ve been weaponized against us, especially as women,” the conservative activist Riley Gaines said on Fox News last week during a discussion about anti-ICE protests. “Feel first. React loudly. Ask questions later,” Bethany Mandel wrote in the New York Post. “We’ve seen this movie before.”

None of this is necessarily surprising. Political partisans tend to behave in a partisan way—even if that partisanship is disguised as apolitical, Christian living. What is notable is how the followers of these conservative influencers, who are also mostly women, have responded. Part of the point of messages like Guichet’s is to absolve her audience of the need to engage in a subject that makes them uncomfortable. “It’s emboldening people to say, I am not required to speak on this, and that doesn’t make me a bad person,” Wellman, the professor who studies influencers, told me. Guichet’s post, for example, now has 92,000 likes and 3,300 comments—far more engagement than other recent posts on her page. Many women who weighed in have welcomed the message of absolution. “I’m emotionally exhausted from everything happening in my real life,” one wrote. “Can’t be bothered with online anything right now.”

But dozens of other comments expressed dismay and disappointment. “It’s crazy” that these accounts “are all in lock step,” one self-described conservative wrote in a reply to Wilkins’s message about emotional manipulation. “We are supposed to be the free thinkers.” “You helped sway peoples opinions and votes and now you’re deciding it’s no longer your problem,” another commenter wrote to Guichet.

Of course, it’s hard to know how many of these dissenters are followers with genuine concerns—and how many are liberal interlopers. But Guichet responded to some of them anyway. “I am not a news source anymore,” she wrote in one exchange. “God called me out of that season.”

The next few months will likely present many more distressing events on which these influencers will feel pressured to weigh in. How they respond may be determined not by logic or even empathy—but by the particular season in which they find themselves.</div>

            <h2>What Spielberg, Lucas, and Coppola Got Right</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/2026/02/the-real-secret-to-a-filmmakers-success/685934/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Steven Spielberg likes to tell a story that captures the tension between art and commerce in 1970s Hollywood: In January 1973, the young filmmaker George Lucas screened a preview of American Graffiti, his movie about hot rods and ’60s kids. Among the hundreds of raucous fans filling San Francisco’s Northpoint Theatre was the Universal Pictures executive Ned Tanen, who was there to review changes requested by the studio. The audience loved what they saw, but Tanen hated it. “This film is a disaster,” he told Lucas in the theater. “I’m so disappointed in you, George.” Francis Ford Coppola, Lucas’s friend and the film’s producer, exploded at Tanen, telling him he should get down on his knees to thank Lucas. Dramatically reaching into his pocket for his checkbook, Coppola offered to buy out the movie rights then and there.

The anecdote—which Paul Fischer recounts in his excellent new book, The Last Kings of Hollywood—encapsulates the complex relationship between Coppola, Lucas, and Spielberg. There was Coppola’s over-the-top defense of his friend with a grandiloquent gesture (Tanen declined to sell). There was Lucas’s prickly resistance to notes of any kind, which would become his hallmark as he worked to upend the studio system. Spielberg, meanwhile, wasn’t even there; safely above the fray, he could enjoy telling the story without worrying about stray fire. Unlike his restless friends, he would learn to work inside Hollywood rather than seeking to destroy it.

The ’70s were fulcrum years that saw the rise of both the auteur filmmaker and the big blockbuster—sometimes in the same combustible package. At one point in 1976, Coppola was shooting Apocalypse Now while Lucas was filming Star Wars and Spielberg was making Close Encounters of the Third Kind—a remarkable Venn diagram of artistic daring and commercial possibility. Lucas and Spielberg exchanged profit points on their two movies, literally investing in each other’s success. Their peers in the “New Hollywood,” as the era that followed the collapse of the studio system came to be called, were busy creating edgier fare: That same year, Martin Scorsese finished Taxi Driver and Brian De Palma released Carrie. Yet as Fischer shows in The Last Kings of Hollywood, Coppola, Lucas, and Spielberg are worth isolating and studying as a trio. In doing so, he derives a fresh idea from a period that has already been exhaustively studied in books and documentary films. Instead of lauding the triumph of the solo artist or eulogizing the uniqueness of a bygone time, Fischer demonstrates the evergreen value of collaboration.

The three directors—members of a boys’ club in an era rife with them—embodied not just creative drive and box-office magic but also an artistically productive camaraderie. They critiqued one another’s work, inspired their peers to do better, fought bitterly, made up easily, and provided mutual support—both financial and moral. And they set an inspiring example for today’s filmmakers. Hollywood is currently flirting with a return to the studio era, a time when directors were not powerful artists but hired hands: brought on by studios and producers to make sure the actors hit their marks and the productions stayed on schedule. Think of the roster of directors who have shuttled through to handle individual films in the Marvel, Mission Impossible, Harry Potter, and James Bond franchises—not to mention the long list of jobbing TV directors in the age of the big-name showrunner. Fischer provides a counternarrative from a parallel universe: If studios won’t push directors to make great original films, perhaps competition and encouragement from their peers will.

Some of the best filmmakers working today already know this. The “Three Amigos” of Mexican cinema—Alfonso Cuarón, Guillermo del Toro, and Alejandro G. Iñárritu—have been friends for decades, trading brutally honest notes and collaborating on blocking and editing. When Paul Thomas Anderson interviewed Quentin Tarantino in 2019 for a Director’s Guild podcast, Anderson’s admiration for his friend’s movie was palpable. In turn, Tarantino has described Anderson as a “very friendly” combatant, noting, “If I reach high points with Inglourious Basterds, it is partly because Paul came out with There Will Be Blood a couple years ago, and I realized I had to bring up my game.” Yet such relationships are about more than exchanging praise. Tarantino’s recent criticism of Paul Dano’s acting in There Will Be Blood was perhaps ungentlemanly, but it also served as constructive criticism: Casting matters.

This sort of friendly rivalry is especially vital today. Warner Brothers waits to be subsumed by Netflix or Paramount, cinemas are losing customers to streaming, and franchise entertainment continues to dumb us all down. There isn’t much of a structural or commercial imperative to tell bold, original stories. Yet an artistic imperative still feels promising: one-upping your brilliant friends. Such creative competition transcends media and dates back generations. Herman Melville dedicated Moby-Dick to Nathaniel Hawthorne “in token of my admiration for his genius.” Paul McCartney and John Lennon heard the Beach Boys’ Pet Sounds and were inspired to write Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band. And Spielberg watched The Godfather and feared he would never make anything as good—before going on to become the most celebrated American filmmaker of his generation.

In describing his central trio’s rise to prominence in the 1970s, Fischer positions Coppola as Lucas’s big-brother figure, and Lucas as Spielberg’s. Partly this tracks with their ages, but it has as much to do with their personalities. Coppola, the head-of-table colossus, was fearless and senseless, a beautiful wreck, as lax with details as he was committed to art. Lucas, in his neat beard and plaid shirts, was shy but certain in his own beliefs, favoring big ideas over execution. Spielberg—youthful, awkward, affable, scarred—was a protean talent who found gold dust in every shot. Coppola gave Lucas his first job, as Coppola’s assistant in the late ’60s. Later, the pair accepted a cold call from Spielberg, who asked if he could come by and talk shop. He was intimidated by Lucas, but Lucas was in awe of Spielberg, who at 22 already had several TV-directing credits.

Much of The Last Kings of Hollywood is devoted to the three near-fiascos that these filmmakers turned into generational hits in the mid-1970s. The shoots for Coppola’s Apocalypse Now, Spielberg’s Jaws, and Lucas’s Star Wars were famously chaotic. Apocalypse stretched on for months in the Philippine jungle, the shark in Jaws didn’t work, and Lucas’s crew couldn’t stand him. The trio busted budgets as well as deadlines but made enduring movies. Fischer skillfully braids the three stories together, situating them in an atmosphere of creative ferment and reckless churn. Each director responded to success in his own way. Coppola and Lucas used their leverage to get out of Hollywood, heading to Northern California to focus on their companies, American Zoetrope and Lucasfilm, respectively. Spielberg stayed put, accepting the constraints of the major studios without diluting his artistic ambitions.

The rifts among these friends—particularly between Lucas and Coppola—could be severe. After American Graffiti became a hit, Lucas proved reluctant to share profits he had contractually agreed on with Coppola. Afterward, the pair fought over projects. Apocalypse Now was originally supposed to be Lucas’s to direct, yet Coppola needed to work after The Godfather: Part II, preferably with an original screenplay rather than another book adaptation. Coppola owned John Milius’s script for Apocalypse, and he told Lucas he might just direct it himself—and “was oblivious to the pain it caused when he took over,” Fischer writes. But there was also collaboration. Although Indiana Jones was Lucas’s idea, Spielberg directed the first four installments of the franchise. The two spitballed the first movie, Raiders of the Lost Ark, while vacationing in Hawaii in 1977. When Paramount tried to condition the deal on finding a different director, “George replied that he was committed to Steven.”

The Last Kings of Hollywood contains few scoops, but the book does offer fresh perspective, particularly with respect to Lucas. Fischer unearthed the contracts for The Empire Strikes Back in the producer Gary Kurtz’s papers, finding that Lucas demanded an astonishing 52.5 percent of the movie’s profits up to $20 million, 72.5 percent up to $100 million, and 77.5 percent above that—in perpetuity. Lucas’s focus on getting paid brings him in for the book’s harshest criticism; Fischer casts him as a rebel turned sellout. “Once a young director who valued a film’s quality and integrity above all,” Fischer writes, “he had slipped into the thinking that he and Francis deplored in film executives.” He made Return of the Jedi as a money play in order to grow his empire, Fischer alleges. “The bottom line had become as much a concern to him as the quality of the film on the screen.” Yet Lucas was trying to break free of Hollywood, and building new infrastructure was expensive. Money meant creative freedom.

Art, like money, occasionally trumped friendship—but sometimes for the better. Coppola’s decision to muscle in on Apocalypse Now almost certainly led to a superior movie. It is hard to imagine a Lucas-directed version: special effects rather than practical ones, wooden dialogue, and lower stakes. Coppola pushed the film into famously gonzo territory, and the film shoot nearly killed him—not to mention his leading man, Martin Sheen. Despite or because of this, the director managed to capture the hallucinatory madness and violent futility of the Vietnam War.

Directors in the ’70s could be harsh in their feedback. When Lucas screened an early cut of Star Wars for a group of filmmakers, Spielberg was supportive, but Brian De Palma gave astringent and ultimately priceless counsel. Feeling lost in the space opera, he suggested an opening text crawl, as in the old Flash Gordon movies, to orient the audience. “The trouble with the Hollywood system is you’re not getting correct feedback,” De Palma told Fischer. “What was good about our group was, we were very honest with each other.” Lucas took the suggestion, and the now-legendary opening to the movie (“A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away”) both situated and transported viewers.

Why did Lucas take the note from De Palma while thumbing his nose at studio suggestions? Because fellow directors usually aim to make movies better, not just more salable. This year, the director Chloé Zhao shared a comment that her close friend Ryan Coogler, the Sinners filmmaker, provided after seeing her latest movie, Hamnet. Coogler told Zhao that it was her first project in which she truly revealed herself. “The other films were beautiful but you hid behind things,” he said. “This is the first time I saw you in there.” It was a lovely compliment, but also an implicit challenge: You’ve taken a step forward. Keep pushing. Coogler was not merely providing input; he was also acknowledging inspiration. An extraordinary film by a peer and competitor had touched him, and perhaps it will elevate his next project.

Fischer’s title—The Last Kings of Hollywood—suggests a long-lost era, nodding to a moment when a handful of directors with visions as big as their egos were allowed to take huge swings. This is probably mostly right—studios’ appetite for risk keeps shrinking, sequels and reboots are favored over original films, and the days of out-of-control productions dancing on the knife-edge of catastrophe may well be behind us. But in recent movies such as Sinners and Anderson’s One Battle After Another, there is evidence that something in the antics of Coppola, Lucas, and Spielberg survives. Perhaps the artistic fraternity of the ’70s  is not a relic, but a model.

            <h2>The New Laser That Can Take Down Aircraft</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/02/ukraine-drones-lasers-iron-dome/685944/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you’ve never seen a laser shoot an aircraft out of the sky, the experience can be unsettling. The weapon fits comfortably into the trunk of a car. It makes no noise and emits no light, not even the glowing red beam that’s so familiar from the movies. When a team of Ukrainian soldiers and engineers took me to see their prototype the other day, it seemed easy to use. Almost too easy.

The operator set up the laser cannon on the roof of his pickup truck in the middle of an empty field. It resembles a hobbyist’s telescope with some cameras affixed to the sides. For target practice, one of the engineers launched a small drone, and it flew a few hundred yards away from us, hovering in the gauzy winter sky. The laser swiveled as its cameras followed the target. The operator shouted, “Fire!” Within seconds, the drone began to burn as if struck by invisible lightning, then fell to the ground in a fiery arc.

The Ukrainian model, known as the Sunray, is not the world’s first laser weapon system. The U.S. Navy has one called Helios, which Lockheed Martin developed as part of a $150 million contract signed in 2018. Four years later, the first Helios laser was installed on a U.S. destroyer to defend against enemy drones. The creators of the Sunray, whose existence has not been previously reported, told me they built their laser in about two years for a few million dollars, and they expect to sell it for a few hundred thousand dollars.

Pavlo Yelizarov, the newly appointed commander of Ukraine’s air-defense forces, sees this price differential as a result of the war with Russia. “Many American companies are driven by money,” he told me last month at his office in Kyiv. “For them, it’s a job. They do it. They get paid. We have another component at play: the need to survive. That’s why we are moving faster.”

In recent months, President Volodymyr Zelensky has prioritized the push to deploy Ukraine’s own air defenses as the United States and Europe have failed to provide enough of them. A lot of U.S. weapons are being diverted to the Middle East, where the U.S. needs them for both a possible strike on Iran and defense against retaliatory strikes from Iranian drones and rockets. The Europeans, for their part, are loath to give Ukraine any more of the weapons they might one day need to guard their own people from Russian drones.

The Ukrainian response has been a race to build a bootstrapped version of the Iron Dome, Israel’s short-range air-defense system, which is thought to be the most effective in the world. (Lockheed Martin is now at work on a comparable system for the United States, which President Trump has dubbed the “Golden Dome.”) But the task of shooting projectiles out of the sky—or, as ballistic-missile defense is often described, “hitting a bullet with a bullet”—has bedeviled engineers at least since the invention of ballistic missiles during World War II. Even in the case of Israel, which has nearly 30 times less territory than Ukraine, the construction of an effective air-defense shield took about four years. A single battery of Iron Dome interceptors cost as much as $100 million in 2012.

Ukraine’s arms manufacturers have tried for several years to get the same results on a far tighter budget, and a handful of them took me to see their inventions last week. These include a 3-D-printed interceptor drone, a carbon-fiber clone of Russia’s best air-defense rocket, wheeled robots armed with chain-gun turrets, and more exotic weapons like the Sunray. Taken together, the trajectory of their development suggests that Ukraine may soon be able to neutralize one of the biggest threats to its security: the swarms of Russian drones that continue to terrorize its civilians and destroy its infrastructure.

“The anti-drone dome is not about the future,” Ukraine’s new defense minister, Mykhailo Fedorov, said last month. “It’s about survival today.”

When Yelizarov was put in charge of building Ukraine’s dome, the appointment received high marks in both political and military circles. But his résumé does not make him an obvious fit for the job. Like Zelensky, he spent much of his career in the TV industry, serving as the lead producer of one of Ukraine’s most popular political talk shows. At the start of the Russian invasion in 2022, he dropped that job and began to develop combat drones with some of his friends, pooling their savings to buy components and assembling them inside Yelizarov’s old TV studio.

Their drones’ initial sorties over the battlefield were promising enough to attract the attention of the U.S. government, which sent truckloads of equipment and C-4 explosives to help Yelizarov develop his fleet. The spearfishing enthusiast soon took on a nom de guerre: Lazar, in honor of the biblical Lazarus, and he founded a drone unit known as Lasar’s Group, now part of the Ukrainian National Guard. According to official estimates, drone strikes conducted by Lasar’s Group have destroyed more than $13 billion in Russian military equipment, a kill rate that got Yelizarov promoted in 2023 to the rank of colonel.

Last year, as U.S.-mediated peace talks raised the prospect of a cease-fire, a lot of drone makers in Ukraine began looking for ways to sell their products to foreign clients, and Yelizarov encouraged them. “While the market is hot,” he said, “we want foreign companies to buy stakes in Ukrainian ones and start developing products together.” Such joint ventures could allow Ukraine to produce more of its weapons elsewhere in Europe, ensuring stability of supply if factories inside Ukraine get bombed.

A few months ago, a barrage of Russian drones destroyed the main facility that produces drones for Lasar’s Group, incinerating about $35 million in equipment, Yelizarov said, including a large stockpile of weapons. (The target and damage from the attack have not been previously revealed.) Similar strikes laid waste throughout the winter to the Ukrainian power grid and heating system as temperatures dropped far below freezing.

Still, when he got the offer last month to lead the defense against such attacks, Yelizarov’s first instinct was to turn it down. The timeline seemed unrealistic. Zelensky wanted the new air-defense shield to be up and running by summer. Yelizarov said that Fedorov, the new defense minister, appealed to his pride: “He told me: ‘Look, we can spend a long time watching the football game and criticizing the players on the field. But I’m offering you a chance to get in the game and show what you can do.’”

That task has been daunting, and Yelizarov already looked worse for wear when we met during his second week on the job. He had just returned that day from a meeting with Zelensky, who grilled the new commander about the intricacies of “sky protection.” In his new role as the deputy head of the Ukrainian Air Force, Yelizarov will need to assess the variety of air-defense systems coming out of the domestic weapons industry, organize the best ones under a unified command, and develop ways to choose the most appropriate one to shoot down an incoming threat.

The key to success, he said, would be efficiency. Too often, Ukraine has been forced to launch scarce and expensive foreign missiles to shoot down cheap Russian drones such as the Shaheds, some of which run on lawnmower engines. “Sure, you can use a Bentley to haul potatoes,” Yelizarov said. “But it’s probably not the smartest way to do that job.”

One solution to the problem of efficiency has emerged from a company called Skyfall. It was founded in 2022, during the early months of the invasion, by a young electrical engineer who prefers not to publicize his name for security reasons. His most popular invention is a bomber drone called the Vampire, which proved to be such a menace on the battlefield that the Russians nicknamed it Baba Yaga—“the Wicked Witch.”

In December, during Russian President Vladimir Putin’s annual call-in show, a war reporter for the Kremlin’s main propaganda channel asked why the military had failed to develop its own version of this weapon after nearly four years of war. “We are completely lacking large hexacopters like the Baba Yaga, which the Ukrainian armed forces actively use,” the reporter said. Putin, scribbling on a notepad, admitted to the “shortage” of such technology, and promised that his defense ministry is working on it.

For the team at Skyfall, the exchange served as a vindication, demonstrating Ukraine’s ability to out-engineer the Russians in one of the most crucial weapons in this war. Last spring, when I first toured Skyfall’s factory in Kyiv, its engineers were working on ways to shoot down Shaheds, but its drones could not yet go fast enough to catch them mid-flight. By the time I visited again last week, Skyfall had developed a much faster interceptor, tested it, and put it into mass production. “The problem with supply is solved,” the founder told me during the tour. “We can make as many as the military needs.”

Officially known as P1-Sun, the weapon resembles a large thermos, and has four rotors and about 500 grams of C-4 at its base. The phallic design led its developers, mostly young geeks and gamers, to nickname it Pisun, which means “dick” in Ukrainian. (Some of Skyfall’s competitors refer to it with a note of jealousy as “the dildo drone.”)

Inside the factory, the smell of molten plastic hit me in the face as we entered “the farm,” where row upon row of 3-D printers churned out hundreds of fuselages for the P1-Sun. The drones have already been used to blast more than 1,000 targets out of the sky, including more than 700 Shaheds, according to the company’s estimates. By the end of this year, advances in the P1-Sun’s communication software will allow the Ukrainian armed forces to position the units around the country, ready to launch from a distance whenever radar detects an incoming fleet of attack drones overhead.

The weapons have attracted plenty of interest from foreign clients, and Skyfall recently presented it at arms fairs in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi. “The drone industry in Ukraine today is the biggest industry for investors,” Zelensky told students on Friday at the Kyiv Aviation Institute. This year, he said, Ukraine will open 10 “export centers” in Germany, the Baltic states, and other parts of Europe, expanding the market to many of the approximately 450 companies that produce drones in Ukraine today.

None of them has yet made any real technological breakthroughs. But they have learned to mass-produce weapons of brutal efficiency with the cheapest techniques and components available. For some of the players in this business, the advances have felt dangerously fast. “We have opened a Pandora’s box that terrifies me,” the founder of Skyfall said. The P1-Sun costs a little more than $1,000 and can reach heights of more than 30,000 feet. “Imagine if it hangs up there in the path of a civilian airliner,” the founder said. “Nobody would even know who did it.”

As the war enters its fifth year, Ukraine sees no alternative to unleashing these weapons into the world. Its reliance on Western hardware has left Ukrainians unprotected. Among the main priorities for the new air-defense system will be to secure troops and supply lines in the war zone, and to defend people living closest to the front. In the southern cities of Kherson and Nikopol, for instance, Russian drone units have begun to use pedestrians for target practice, hunting them on the streets in what Ukrainians call a “human safari.”

Both cities sit directly on the front line, across the Dnipro River from large formations of Russian troops. During my most recent visit to the area, in 2024, the then-mayor of Nikopol, Yevhen Yevtushenko, told me that its residents usually run errands on rainy days, because enemy drones tend to hunt in fair weather. “Our best means of shooting them down is with these missiles we’ve been getting from abroad,” Yevtushenko said, citing the German launcher known as the IRIS-T. “That’s a problem, because nobody is going to use those expensive rockets to shoot down a little drone.”

The dilemma seemed insurmountable at the time. But Ukrainian technology has caught up faster than either of us had expected. None of the weapons would be capable of shooting down Russia’s advanced ballistic missiles, which only the U.S.-made Patriot batteries have proved capable of reliably defeating. But when it comes to the cruder drones and rockets that Russia flings at Ukrainian cities every day, the many tinkerers of Ukraine seem much closer to a solution than they were just a year ago. “It can be done, and it needs to be done,” Yelizarov said at the end of our interview. “Because we don’t have any other choice.”

The night after he took up his new job, the Russians launched another wave of drones and cruise missiles at Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure, cutting off power and heat in the capital during one of the winter’s coldest nights. The following morning, Yelizarov saw a post on social media demanding to know why the new head of air defenses had not stopped the barrage. “I’d been on the job for less than a day, and already I was being called a failure,” he said with a smile. “I understand. People want results now. They want them yesterday.”</div>

            <div id="article-text">The appointment of a new medicine man is a dicey moment in the life of a tribe. Get it wrong, pick the wrong guy, and your deepest spiritual diseases will go not only untreated but undetected. Get it right, and there’s at least a chance of an accurate diagnosis. The Victorians, rather surprisingly, got it right. In fact, for all their pomposity and stolidity and leadenness of soul, and for all their windbag religiosity, they nailed it. They chose as their national poet a vagrant and depressed semi-atheist from a family of lunatics. They chose Alfred, Lord Tennyson.

Tennyson was already famous, largely on the strength of his blockbuster elegy, In Memoriam, when Queen Victoria made him her poet laureate in 1850. But it is with the haunted and chaotic pre-fame poet—the shaggy, craggy, germinal genius wandering in his cloud of tobacco smoke and melancholy, poring over his books about physics and chemistry—that Richard Holmes’s The Boundless Deep is chiefly concerned. Subtitled Young Tennyson, Science, and the Crisis of Belief, it tracks this character’s metabolic absorption of the most disturbing, displacing ideas that contemporary science had to offer; their effect on his personality; and their manifestation in his poetry.

Holmes, the master scholar-biographer of Coleridge and Shelley, is ideally qualified for such a gig. In prose so lucid that you barely notice when it has slipped into a stream of profound interiority, into the hidden life-current of his subject, Holmes gives us what feels like the whole man. His Tennyson is cosmically miserable, while also being—when among friends—very good company: that is, highly appealing to us moderns. He devours works of popular science, the information they contain as intoxicating to him as the poetry of his idols Keats and Shelley. Nervously puffing away on “infinite tobacco” (as his friend Thomas Carlyle described it), he rides the fault line between epochs. Astronomy is deepening space, geology is deepening time, and as the news comes in—one revelation after another—he can feel the answering tremor in human consciousness, and the fearful new understanding it foretells. An empty heaven. A disenchanted world. “I stretch lame hands of faith,” he writes in In Memoriam, “and grope, / And gather dust and chaff.” The new science of psychology, too, absorbs him. Not at all a degraded Romantic (for which he is sometimes mistaken), this Tennyson, in his gleamy-gloomy way, is a looming giant of modernity. Behind him is Keats and “The Eve of St. Agnes”; before him is The Waste Land.

Tennyson was prolific, prodigious. He rumbled with poetry; he recited it endlessly; it poured off him on long walks. Language teemed inside him, especially when he was a young man, producing verse so musical, it sometimes seems on the verge of becoming pure fluid sound, a kind of glittering higher gibberish:

The darker strands of the young Tennyson’s existence—madness, spurned love, ruinous genes, insolvency—would become the themes of a later poem that Holmes regards as pivotal. It appeared in Tennyson’s first book as poet laureate, Maud, and Other Poems, published in 1855. The reviews were not good. In fact, they were violently hostile. Despite containing such patriotic bangers as “Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington” and “The Charge of the Light Brigade,” both previously published (and the latter instantly memorized by half the British empire), the new collection was discredited, in the eyes of its critics, by its long centerpiece, “Maud: A Monodrama,” a poem narrated by a madman.

“Ill considered, crude, tawdry and objectionable” was one reviewer’s judgment of Maud. To the reviewer in the Press, it might have been the output of “a love-sick youth in the measles.” One small constituency, however, rated Maud quite highly: Victorian shrink-types. Clinical accuracy is not something with which poets have traditionally tended to preoccupy themselves, but Tennyson’s account of mental extremity impressed the experts. Maud got a glowing write-up in the October 1855 edition of The Asylum Journal of Mental Science, and a doctor named Robert Mann published an entire pro-Maud pamphlet, Tennyson’s Maud Vindicated: An Explanatory Essay. “Where can this unprofessional psychologist have acquired his accurate insight into the phenomena of insanity?” he asked. (“I seem to have the doctors on my side if no one else,” the laureate growled in a grateful letter to Mann.)

“Maud” was personal. Tennyson called it “my little Hamlet” and then—after the critical kicking it sustained—“poor little Maud,” and it is indeed a strange, stormy, fragmented, wildly lyrical, futuristically subjective freak-out of a poem, part melodrama, part psychotic break. The narrator’s father, destroyed by the failure of “a vast speculation,” commits suicide; the narrator becomes obsessed with Maud, the daughter of the man who bankrupted his father, now living in grandeur on a neighboring estate and flashing her profile at him—“Faultily faultless, icily regular, splendidly null, / Dead perfection, no more”—as she rides past in her carriage. Obsessed, obsessed, truly obsessed: obsession like a dead flame licking the walls of life, or a wind singing through the deepest flaw in the universe. Maud and the narrator meet and fall in love—or do they? At one point, he seems to be lying outside her house in the dark—in a trance? stalking her?—hallucinating the sound of her footsteps in the movement of the leaves. Above him are the stars, bleep-bleeping away from the depths of untenanted space. He talks to them, lamenting

The cold fires, the nothingness—as Holmes shows us, all of this Tennyson had seen through the high-powered telescope in his garden, and read about in the books that were filling his library. To combine this kind of depth perception with the galactic ache of an unreal love, of an undead infatuation, that was new. That was scary. No wonder reviewers recoiled.

The vision was not just telescopic, but microscopic. In the second—and maddest—section of the poem, the narrator, having fled in panic to France, roams the Breton shoreline. He fixates upon a seashell:

Buffeted by hallucinations as he is, he zooms in on the long-gone shell-dweller like one of the underwater cameras in David Attenborough’s Blue Planet.

Part of Tennyson lived, was encamped, at the outer reaches of the psyche. Alcoholism, seizures, mood swings, incontinent rage—all ran in his family’s “black blood.” His father was regularly deranged; his brother Edward was a helpless depressive; and his brother Septimus introduced himself to Dante Gabriel Rossetti with the words “I am Septimus, the most morbid of the Tennysons.” Septimus was under the care of Matthew Allen, a psychiatric pioneer who called his establishment at High Beech, Essex, not an asylum but “a place of seclusion for exhausted minds.” Tennyson befriended Allen and began to spend a lot of time at High Beech: Holmes connects the poet’s observation of the patients there directly to “Maud,” noting, “The gardens at High Beech, the paths and the shrubberies, the wandering figures of the insane, muttering to themselves, recur like a remembered tune fifteen years later.”

A remembered tune, but also a staticky signal from the incoming 20th century, the noise of a voice splintered into different voices, fading in and out of clarity. Modern critics adore “Maud” for precisely the qualities that repelled its original audience—for its weirdness and its brokenness, and its pre-Freudian blast of erotic attachment. Tennyson would never be this exposed again: fame, the laureateship, and a steady marriage all solidified him. But for a long moment, he was beautifully out of sync with his public and ahead of his time, as any healer must be—because where can healing come from if not the future?

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Few novelists today can match Lionel Shriver for topical range. The author of 18 books, she is best known for her 2003 novel, We Need to Talk About Kevin, about a teenager who murders several of his classmates. The nine novels that followed include a clever critique of the American health-care system (So Much for That, 2010), a family drama about the obesity epidemic (Big Brother, 2013), an economic dystopia (The Mandibles, 2016), a satiric look at the growing popularity of extreme endurance sports (The Motion of the Body Through Space, 2020), and an exploration of the social costs imposed by increased longevity (Should We Stay or Should We Go, 2021).

Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.

In her latest, A Better Life, Shriver tackles immigration and goes off the rails, which makes this an ideal moment to take stock of her novelistic gifts and ambitions. As her subjects suggest, she is not the kind of writer whose fiction features precious lyricism or pseudo-intellectual or solipsistic musings. She has a wry observational intelligence that propels her well beyond her personal orbit. She is also adept at unpacking psychological states and analyzing relationships with almost clinical incisiveness. Her writing is witty, and startlingly precise. We Need to Talk About Kevin describes a man as a “stringy cerebral type whose skittering metabolism burns chickpea concoctions at a ferocious rate.”

Shriver’s novels teem with well-chosen observations about ordinary life, the sort that some literary novels skip: whether characters watch what they eat; what exercise routine they favor (a disconcertingly large proportion of them do calisthenics daily); how long they stay when they visit; whether they dominate conversation or ask questions of others. She devises interesting plots too. Her protagonists do things, which is not to say they do outlandish or unbelievable things to facilitate crude plot twists.

Shriver tends to see the world as being divided between those who work hard and support others—both in their personal life and through the taxes they are forced to pay—and those who take advantage of such people. The characters who have her sympathy practice what the protagonist of her 2007 novel, The Post-Birthday World, calls “mental kindness.” That is, they try to be charitable in their assessments of others, even in the privacy of their thoughts. As a novelist, Shriver holds herself to the same standard. Her tone tends toward the caustic, and she doesn’t give central characters a pass when they behave badly, but she is fair to them. She shows us their reasons, even when they behave in ways that she clearly finds irritating, such as going all in on extreme endurance sports in their mid-60s.

Her more comic novels do, however, too often include one-dimensionally terrible minor characters (a pretentious filmmaker who mooches off her brother in So Much for That, a born-again woman who uses Christianity to feel superior to others in The Motion of the Body Through Space ); they seem to exist only so Shriver can skewer them. But these takedowns of generally easy targets are atypical. Shriver focuses most of her fictional energies on characters who are more generously, and more plausibly, drawn and thus more deserving of her—and our—interest.

In her non-novelist capacity as, among other things, a columnist for the British magazine The Spectator, Shriver enjoys a reputation as a provocateur and a contrarian: economically conservative (“unenthusiastic about widespread dependency on the state,” as she once put it) while progressive in her social views, though anti-“woke” and critical of the #MeToo movement. Her decision to briefly wear a sombrero at a writers’ festival in 2016, to signal her disapproval of the then-faddish concept of “cultural appropriation,” caused a stir in literary circles.

But however controversial Shriver is as a commentator, her novels have never been mere vehicles for her politics. Take The Mandibles, a book that revolves around the national debt, long a bugbear of hers. This might seem a particularly wonkish fixation, unlikely to inspire even passable fiction, but Shriver—whether or not you agree with her views on the underlying macroeconomics (I don’t)—delivers a clever pillorying of Americans’ belief that our place at the top of the international hierarchy is both deserved and permanent. In the novel’s near-future setting, the rest of the world abruptly decides that it will no longer underwrite the United States’ debt. By the end of the book, the U.S. is just like any other developing country, and Mexicans speak derisively of white Ameritrash. The granularity of Shriver’s vision reflects a mind as skilled at analyzing the reverberations of monetary policy in daily life as at depicting interiority. It also makes for a very entertaining read.

Which is to say that if any contemporary American novelist could write compelling fiction about immigration policy—perhaps the single most important issue in national politics—it would probably be Shriver. It’s certainly very much like her to try. And it is unlike her to fall short on just about every count I’ve described. A Better Life, her new novel, fails not because its politics are out of step with progressive opinion. If that were sufficient to doom a novel, The Mandibles wouldn’t have met with the praise it did a decade ago. Nor is the main problem that A Better Life reads like an op-ed column thinly disguised as a novel, although that’s part of the trouble.

A Better Life tackles what Shriver portrays as the ruinous immigration policies of the Biden years. Nico, the book’s 26-year-old protagonist, lives with his divorced mother, Gloria, rent-free in the well-appointed basement of his childhood home in Brooklyn (now worth $2.5 million). He hasn’t had a job since he graduated from college and spends his days scrolling through the right-coded precincts of the manosphere. An inheritance from his grandfather enables beer and takeout when the mood strikes. As the novel opens, he’s bitterly relocating to his old, cramped bedroom upstairs: Gloria has decided to house a female asylum seeker in his former lair, through a city-sponsored program that Shriver apparently modeled on a plan floated but never enacted under former New York Mayor Eric Adams.

Having an immigrant boarder suits both Gloria’s progressive politics and her pocketbook: The city will pay her more than $3,000 a month. An artist who spends most of her time volunteering at a nearby makeshift shelter for immigrants, she can use the money. Nico’s two sisters share their mother’s heartfelt pro-immigration views and support her decision. Nico does neither. But the step Gloria takes at least gives him a sense of purpose; already leaning toward a keep-them-out position, he becomes fixated on it.

He rails about progressive-run cities, such as New York, that promise new arrivals “free digs, free grub, and free Wi-Fi,” perks guaranteed to ensure that yet more people keep coming. Sounding like a cranky 60-something, he complains about the state of bike lanes: “Their overwhelmingly Hispanic riders didn’t glance over their shoulders before overtaking or signal when they were making a turn.” Many of these bikers are out making deliveries, of course. (It’s unclear why Nico thinks so many immigrants work these jobs when they are, according to him, given so many freebies by the city.)

In outline, the premise seems primed for satire: A young man who lives off his mother is obsessed with immigrants who he thinks are living off hardworking American taxpayers. Indeed, A Better Life is full of passages that read as if they are meant to be send-ups of blinkered ideologues: “Over tequila shots, Vernon launched into a set piece about how, while populations in the West were heading into gradual decline, Africa was the exception, certain to rise from 1.4 billion this year to 2.5 billion by midcentury.”

But Vernon, a documentarian and a longtime friend of Nico’s parents, is not drawn as a satirical figure; rather, we are intended to see him as bombastic but appealing—warm, gregarious, freethinking, and probably correct in his concern about Western decline. This tone deafness is characteristic of the novel, which seems to want to operate as a work of realist fiction dealing with people whose fates we’re supposed to care about, no matter how thinly portrayed or unattractive they are.

Nico is the primary example, despite the twist Shriver offers on the stereotypical angry young male reactionary: He’s not a jobless flyover-country type; he’s a white man reared in the upper-middle-class meritocracy. A member of the coastal elite, he’s been at once coddled and academically driven, only to then fail (thanks to DEI policies) to get into even an Ivy-adjacent school. But this is sociology, not psychology—as characterization, it’s merely a starting point, as a novelist of Shriver’s skill certainly knows.

The book never goes deeper. Nico’s inner life is almost entirely devoted to thinking about immigration as a public crisis and about Martine, the Honduran asylum seeker who has moved into his mother’s basement. Nor do his daily interactions prompt any sort of lively reflection. The bulk of the book’s dialogue consists of long discussions of the issue initiated by Nico with whomever he encounters. Whatever merit the material might have as opinion-page filler, as conversation, it’s leaden.

The book’s plot is more compelling than its dialogue—but only because it’s melodramatic. Martine turns out to have some troubling associates, who first make themselves at home in the household and then commandeer it. As Martine taunts Nico: “Other people take your nice country, they take your nice soft life. Because you no fight.” The situation comes to a head when Nico does try to fight back.

Picture him in concert with a bunch of late-middle-age white men (including his father and Vernon) in ski masks, toting guns; a dead body; an unreliable witness to the crime—I’ll stop here, though there’s more. The climactic conclusion is action-packed, yes, but getting invested is hard when the characters are little more than mouthpieces in service to a pat homeland-in-danger metaphor—prolix zealots like Nico and Vernon, naive progressives like Gloria, and opportunistic new arrivals ready to seize their moment when she throws her doors wide open.

Perhaps Shriver envisioned the book’s exploration of Nico’s frustration as a warning to liberals—a novelization of one of those “this is how we got Trump” articles. But prescient it is not: In the current moment, A Better Life reads like a dour morality tale from a bygone civilization, one in which Americans never imagined they’d be reeling at images of masked ICE agents pulling day laborers off the streets. If you fed ChatGPT a Fox News segment about criminal immigrants and the progressive politicians who enable them and instructed it to come up with a Lionel Shriver novel, I’m not sure the result would be much worse. The book’s only mystery, really, is that a writer of Shriver’s talent bothered to churn it out, however up in arms she may have been about the nation’s immigration policies.

Though puncturing liberal pieties on a subject like this one is certainly on-brand for Shriver, the newsy subjects that have served as catalysts for her fiction have generally operated as springboards, not destinations—a way into stories that are fundamentally character-driven and focused on relationships. A Better Life doesn’t just call attention to the inadequacy of topicality on its own to propel a novel; its failure serves as a reminder of Shriver’s true strength.

She has excelled at more than the deft depiction of inner life, a staple of successful domestic fiction. She is one of the most astute portraitists of marriage working today. The long-term potential as well as the perils of intimacy were central themes even in her debut novel, The Female of the Species (1987). When Shriver wrote of The Post-Birthday World ’s protagonist that “having a man who loved her and whom she loved in return was the most important thing in Irina’s life,” she described a disposition shared by many of her main characters, most notably Eva Khatchadourian, the narrator of her signature work, We Need to Talk About Kevin. On its face a compassionate exploration of post-Columbine sociopathic darkness, it is also a brutally poignant story of a marriage.

Eva’s romance with her husband, Franklin Plaskett, delights and amazes her. Very mixed feelings about motherhood kick in when she gets pregnant—and it doesn’t help that Kevin is a difficult baby and then boy. For a good portion of the novel, readers are apt to tack back and forth on the questions that explicitly animate it: Is Eva’s ambivalence the reason Kevin turned out as he did? Was she not loving enough? Or was Kevin just born that way—and the social tendency to blame mothers prompts us to find fault in Eva?

What makes the novel so unusual, however, is that its most emotionally compelling drama is submerged, and is one that Eva herself never fully recognizes: Her attachment to the marriage is doing profound damage, forcing her to choose between Franklin’s affection and her ability to speak truthfully about what she sees, what she fears. If she isn’t a good mother, it’s not because she doesn’t love Kevin enough—it’s because she loves her husband too much, and he can’t or won’t acknowledge that there is anything worrisome about their son.

Subtle, painful, with central characters who are both slippery and beautifully drawn, the book manages one of fiction’s most elusive feats. It seduces us into viewing the world as Eva does, only to then show us that we, too, have fallen prey to a willful ignorance of the rot in a marriage she values so much.

Shriver has written other original novels about marriage and family. But We Need to Talk About Kevin stands out for its elegant construction; the cool austerity of its prose, which is intimate without being cloying or chatty; and its sheer narrative power. Its artful evocation of self-deception recalls 20th-century classics about marriage such as Richard Yates’s Revolutionary Road and Edward Albee’s Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf ?

To pull off something close to pure ventriloquism, leaving Eva’s perspective and mood to dictate the tone, as Shriver does, is the sort of imaginative triumph that is a rarity for any author, as she knows. In The Mandibles, a young man sees that his 90-something great-aunt, a formerly famous writer, is unhappy, and he speculates as to why. “You want to write with the same fire that lit you up when you were writing Better Late Than,” he says, naming her unmatched novel. And then he finishes the thought: “the kind of fire that hardly anyone gets to keep.”

            <div id="article-text">For The Atlantic’s March cover story, “What’s the Worst That Could Happen?,” staff writer Josh Tyrangiel examines AI and the future of work. Reporting from Silicon Valley; Washington, D.C.; and beyond, Tyrangiel interviewed central bankers and labor economists, AI executives and union leaders, Cabinet secretaries and populist political figures including Bernie Sanders and Steve Bannon. And the consensus among many, even those who may agree on almost nothing, when it comes to AI and employment: We’re not ready for this, and no one’s in charge.  The main question animating Tyrangiel’s reporting is whether and how quickly workers ought to expect artificial intelligence to take their jobs. He writes that an exact prediction is hard to pin down: It’s perhaps less immediate than many of the technology’s biggest boosters might hope, but AI still represents a development that will fundamentally alter our society, and governments ought to be thinking seriously about how to protect their constituents from the inevitable shock waves.  Trying to measure the impact of AI with today’s data can feel like driving while looking only in the rearview mirror––“plenty dangerous if the road stays straight, catastrophic if it doesn’t.” Tyrangiel writes: “AI is already transforming work, one delegated task at a time. If the transformation unfolds slowly enough and the economy adjusts quickly enough, the economists may be right: We’ll be fine. Or better. But if AI triggers a rapid reorganization of work—compressing years of change into months, affecting roughly 40 percent of jobs worldwide, as the International Monetary Fund projects—the consequences will not stop at the economy. They will test political institutions that have already shown how brittle they can be.” And if mass job loss should come, it doesn’t just mean unemployment, “it means missed loan payments, cascading defaults, shrinking consumer demand, and the kind of self-reinforcing downturn that can transform a shock into a crisis, and a crisis into the decline of an empire.”  Tyrangiel writes that “AI is just a newborn. It may grow up to transform our lives in unimaginably good ways. But it has also introduced profound questions about safety, inequality, and the viability of a wage-labor system that, despite its flaws, spawned the most prosperous society in human history. And there’s no sign—none—that our political system is equipped to deal with what’s coming. Which means the deepest challenge AI poses may not be to jobs at all.” Tyrangiel concludes that coming to a solution around AI will take a collective effort: “America would be better off if its elites could act responsibly without being terrified. If CEOs remembered that citizens are a kind of shareholder, too. If economists tried to model the future before it arrives in their rearview mirror. If politicians chose their constituents’ jobs over their own. None of this requires revolution. It requires everyone to do the jobs they already have, just better.”  Josh Tyrangiel’s “What’s the Worst That Could Happen?” has published at TheAtlantic.com.

Bitcoin is the opposite of untraceable. There&#39;s literally a public journal of every transaction. If you can be connected to a wallet then every transaction you&#39;ve conducted is exposed.

How would you react if the bank would take $120 millions from your account to your detriment... by mistake?

Also, I would be cautious about &quot;untraceable&quot;. I would say &quot;hard to trace for someone who is not  determined to look it up&quot;.

South Korean lawmakers have raised concern over the so-called âoephantom coinâ issue: How Bithumb was able to distribute 620,000 bitcoins when its own stockpile appeared to have numbered closer to 50,000.Wait, how does the blockchain even allow you to spend what you don&#39;t have?

Wait, how does the blockchain even allow you to spend what you don&#39;t have?

But Bithumb is still trying to convince users who during the brief window of trading managed to offload more than 100 bitcoins, valued at roughly $9 million, to give back the equivalent funds.What&#39;s that saying again? &quot;Code is Law&quot;?Those 100 bitcoins are gone. Tough shit to those guys.

            <div id="article-text">Apple and Google charge 30% on app purchases and in app purchases. It is discourage on developers, especially small Indie developers. It also violates our sovereignty over our devices by forcing us to use their rent seeking stores.

It also provides a great deal of infrastructure that used to be required of individual publishers.  App stores provide a service to both developers and customers, they are not merely &quot;rent seeking&quot;.

Also, no one &quot;sovereignty&quot; is &quot;violated&quot;, no one takes you seriously with dumb comments like that.  Cell phones are not required to offer apps at all.  Don&#39;t like smart phone terms?  Don&#39;t use a smart phone.

The operational costs are neglible, and run at most in hundreds of millions. Google made ~$10B on Play Store in 2025 (20% of estimated $50B revenue). 99% of what you pay for is monopoly pricing, fundamental cost is two magnitudes less than that. Moreover, the developer &quot;support&quot; is abysmal, as Google has near zero motivation to deal with small time developers in monopoly market.

Don&#39;t like smart phone terms?  Don&#39;t use a smart phone.That&#39;s still possible, but increasingly difficult. More and more fundamental services - such as banking - are getting harder and harder to use without a smart phone.Also, I don&#39;t even want to think about crossing the American border and saying to a CBP officer &quot;Sorry, I only have a dumbphone, so I have no internet or social media data to show you&quot;.

On this front, I&#39;d like both these companies to introduce something in the Settings of their OSs.  Namely, in the Accounts section, if one chooses not to have a Google or an iCloud account, to have a section where one can enter the URL of an alternate storage site.  It may be either something like DropBox or Carbonite or anything else, or if one happens to have a home NAS, one can even enter that URL - let&#39;s call it storage.foo.bar.  If one enters that, then all the settings of the device that would normall

Hear me out, I&#39;m not entirely crazy. I&#39;d rather see the &quot;better&quot; apps than be swamped with tons of AI generated crap apps when searching for an app.

One thing I like about Apple&#39;s store - them requiring vendors to make their services IPv6 accessible, if they want to be available on their store.  I for one certainly laud that.  iOS, Android and in future, even Windows promises to be IPv6-mostly, allowing for IPv4 hosts and services to be accessible via xLAT-464, reducing the dependence on IPv4 backbones

This has been the last 50 years.  How is this news at this point?  It was stuff that matters 50 years ago.

the wealth taxes proposed In NY, WA and NYC are bad paths.

&quot;The large IT companies are now in a consolidation phase accelerated by AI, as evidenced by continuous layoffs for the past three years. The average recession length is less than a year, this is structual change, not inventory adjustment. I&#39;m curious if the Republicans will figure this out before the economy forces their hand.&quot;

adjusting the workweek is the optimum long-term fix.

adjusting the workweek just means people are even less employed, shut the hell up

Raising corporate profit taxes, income taxes, and inheritance taxes is the way to go. Much of the distribution problem is a result of tax changes that benefit the wealthy which have been the policies of every Republican administration since Reagan.

I&#39;d love a shorter workweek, but that doesn&#39;t address how top-heavy America is right now.

This is the change: comparing 45 years ago to now.

Labor received 58% of gross domestic income in 1980; by the third quarter of 2025, that figure had fallen to 51.4%. Corporate profits&#39; share rose from 7% to 11.7% over the same period.

In summary, labor received 6.6% less of the gross income, while corporate profits increased by 4.7%. So, 3/4 of the decrease in money paid to labor was moved to corporate profits.

Not terribly unexpected; the labor force dropped because of increased amounts of automation of prod

So many people are paper multi-millionaires now.  I wonder if all this &#39;wealth&#39; will be worth anything when we all go to spend it.

Yes, that&#39;s my concern. Ordinary people have their retirement plans largely in stocks. There will be a way to raid that.

The ultra wealthy seem to leverage many more kinds of asset - art, property, IP, companies they privately own etc.

The whole reason other people don&#39;t have money is those people do not intend to spend it, ever. Their entire project is to sit on money that they intentionally make increasingly useless until everyone else is starved to death.

It&#39;s even simpler. The entire point of capital hiring labor is that labor can produce more of value than they are paid. And over the years, capitalists have gotten an increasing discount. Although I would like to see this calculates with the total compensation, including employer&#39;s portion of healthcare. Probably won&#39;t move the number much though.

yes, we&#39;re watching an historical cycle play out so answers already exist.

https://www.scry.llc/2025/01/2... [scry.llc]

&quot;Production equals consumption in an ideal economy. Both are bound by finite time. If production increases, consumption must increase, too. Ergo, time spent on production must fall, which is what happened during the last two depressionary eras. 1873-1897 and 1930-1940. I&#39;m fairly sure that AI is the last straw which breaks the forty-hour workweek&quot;

It bear repeating as long as people remain in denial.

I don&#39;t think that facts bear out your hypothesis.  But you did manage to find a minority group to hate.  You fell for the propaganda of the Rich.

The economic impacts of ICE operations in MPLS and other target locations also proving it.  Places are closing up because they don&#39;t have workers, they don&#39;t have workers because they illegals won&#39;t turn up for shifts. They don&#39;t have legal residents for those positions because they don&#39;t pay enough.  Legal residents are then pushed strait into the arms of the mega corps where they are also underpaid but at least they can show their employed and collect welfare that way.

Facts bear out that immigrants bump our GDP, and contribute more than they take.

If you are concerned about housing prices, and want a real fix, look at how the very wealthy own large percentages of housing, and keep jacking up the rent on working people.

Rent prices have gone up because, for a variety of reasons, there has been a supply shortage [clevelandfed.org] of new homes.

So you&#39;ve also fallen for the propaganda of the Trump administration.

The vast majority of the people being pulled off the streets to make Miller&#39;s quotas have legal status.

Places are closing up because they don&#39;t have workers, they don&#39;t have workers because they illegals won&#39;t turn up for shifts.Partly true, but also legal immigrants aren&#39;t turning up for shifts because of fear of ICE. ICE has been very indiscriminate about who they detain, and also have been doing things like taking people who are legally in the US, changing their status, and deporting them.

If a place can&#39;t find workers willing to work for a wage that would make the business profitable, that business should not exist.  &quot;Illegals&quot; are bound to the same reality as everyone else: they need to eat, and they need money to buy food, and they need jobs to get money.  If you think this does not apply to them, and they are somehow getting a better deal than you are from the government, you should just do what they do and don&#39;t provide any documentation to the government about your citizenship when you

It&#39;s a tactic that owners of capital have been using for a very long time going all the way back to the slave plantation owners.

The vast majority of people in the American south could not afford slaves (let alone a plantation!). In order to cover for the fact that a tiny minority (maybe 1% of the population) controlled 99% of the wealth, they institute a system where whites were considered superior so that the working class could be convinced they weren&#39;t being screwed and would participate in the continuation of free labor for the plantation owners. After the civil war, they used Jim Crow to perpetuate the same system, albeit with slave wages rather than literal slavery from the designated underclass.

Once the Civil Rights era came about, it became no longer tenable to use African Americans as the designated underclass to keep the working class in line. It&#39;s no accident that immigration became a hot button political issue right around the time the civil rights era ebbed. Immigrants from Latin American became a convenient replacement. It was more socially acceptable to ostracize outsiders who spoke a different language and because of immigration laws, you could legally discriminate against them the way people used to discriminate against African Americans. The ginned-up outrage over &quot;crime&quot; and &quot;sending rapists&quot; mirrors how society used to talk about African Americans before that ceased to be acceptable.

The group that is the designated underclass has changed, but the result is the same: owners of capital get cheap labor. The underclass does the worst least-paid jobs with no real protections while the working class is distracted from the fact they only getting the crumbs from the capital owners. They are trained to blame those under them in the social order rather than the ones who have created the system. Note: having &quot;illegal&quot; immigrants is a feature, not a bug in this system. Undocumented immigrants still work, but only off the books. This means they will work for sub-minimum wage and the true employer can officially disclaim ever employing them (by hiring via a contractor).  You also don&#39;t have to pay them social security or Medicare benefits down the line, but they often do pay into these systems.

I don&#39;t think that facts bear out your hypothesis.  But you did manage to find a minority group to hate.  You fell for the propaganda of the Rich.True. The myth of trickle-down economics [theguardian.com] has long been debunked. But the idea that the rising tide of GDP will raise all boats is still peddled by many politicians and parts of the mainstream media,

below market rate labor The market rate is by definition the rate the market pays.   The problem is you expect people already living here to be paid above market rate to do things that are economically not worth doing in the first place.

More labor equals more economic activity.Legalize immigrants, they are already healthy working age adults and aren&#39;t the economic drain that children and the elderly are.If your nation hasn&#39;t kept its birthrate up, then the only option to avoid economic decline is to import the labor pool.

And America has been doing this for hundreds of years. We bring immigrants in, insert them in the lowest rung. And push most other Americans up, now that they are freed from trying to demand higher wages for unskilled labo

If want to continue to have an America where upward mobility is possible, and we have a robust middle class work needs to pay.  That simply will not happen when you have damn near unlimited supply of below market rate labor streaming over the boarder, while also collecting subsidies for housing and everything pushing prices higher.Look at history, things were even worse before WW2.  The gov introduced significant regulation to counterbalance robber barons in order to win WW2 and we saw a golden age of economic prosperity.  And predictably, the robber baron class whittled down regulation to ensure a new gilded age.  Housing didn&#39;t get affordable in the post war period based on supply and demand alone.  Gov regulations and the GI bill played a huge role.  Unions, with all their flaws, ensured workers could afford to buy homes.

IMO the workers used to have a voice, policy would be created in their favor. Now big money is all the politicians hear, if there was better policy preventing money from going to the top of the economic food chain and better serving workers, we wouldn&#39;t be where we are today.

It used to be workers had some leverage because they were essential to keeping the gears of the economy turning. Now, it&#39;s only the machines, databases, and AI that matter. The small amount of labor required to keep businesses functioning means workers are quickly becoming an irrelevant component of the economy. Good luck with that next wage negotiation.

Inflation is stubbornly high in the USA, the ridiculous tariffs are hugely damaging, housing costs have soared, it&#39;s hard to find a decent job, and consumer confidence has soured. The federal government is malicious and untethered.

Nonetheless, if you&#39;ve had money invested in the stock market over the past couple of years you&#39;ve made out like a bandit. My portfolio is up 8% just since the beginning of the year and its all just index funds. VYMI (international value category) is up 40% since this time last year, I should have been all in.

It seems completely uncoupled to the underlying economy, defying gravity. But that&#39;s where the obscenely wealthy keep much of their money, and if you have some surplus income you get to come along for the ride. If you don&#39;t, like so many people today, all you can do is watch from the sidelines.

One just has to study a bit of history. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/... [wikipedia.org]

For the life of me, unless one is extremely rich I cannot imagine why anyone, especially a family with kids would want to live in NYC.

If you&#39;re rich and young ok maybe it&#39;s a blast to live and party there, but for real life?  Nah.

Also sounds like complete bullshit from some one with a political agenda. I know enough people who live in NYC and own guns to know that it is.

Typical annual salary, according to MIT&#39;s Living Wage Calculator for the NYC Metro, is $84,860.

Poverty wage is $7.52/hr (no kids) and minimum wage is $15.50 which, according to the calculator, should cover 1 adult with 3 kids.

Making 76k teaching in Texas this year, will make 82k next year.  So, depends on where you live.

70k a year should get me a private teacher per pupil, right?Sure, your kid in the morning, another kid in the afternoon. But it isn&#39;t about the access to teachers. It&#39;s about getting in with the &quot;right&quot; crowd and having the school&#39;s name that you can drop in casual conversation; and getting that kid access to the Ivy league schools and off to their destined role in the elite ruling class...

Not that these are taking over these high prized education spots...I like how you even point out how your claim doesn&#39;t make sense and then just keep pushing forward with it anyways making vague, unsupported allusions that don&#39;t make a bit of sense.

Every once in a while you see a story about a &#39;poor&#39; man making $200k+ and not saving anything.

There are two main reasons for their fiscal incompetence (plus a bonus one):

1)  They look at their neighbors - the guy to the right has a boat, the guy across the street has a ski house, and the guy to the left has a beach house.  They buy one of each.  Or they pick one and pay twice as much for it.

2) They do something similar with kids.  Often they will buy a great house in a good neighborhood/suburb &#39;for the kids&#39; and then send them to private school.  The entire point of the house in the right location is that it has a good SCHOOL.  If you are sending your kids to private school you should be living in a much cheaper house.   Just because you have kids does not mean you should spend all your money on them.

Bonus reason:  Total and complete fiscal stupidity buying worthless crap.  Prime example is Time Shares.  [ Even if one makes sense now, ten years later your financial situation will change.  Either it will be too expensive or too cheap - and you will not use it. Even point systems are just later regrets]

I have to say I disagree with this viewpoint. If you have kids you *should* spend all your money on them (in an intelligent manner).  For some people that means no vacation home and no Rivian so that the kids can go to private school. For some (especially in NYC) that means eating rice and beans so that your child can get special tutoring. I&#39;m not sure if you have children in the public educational system, but what happens there is nightmarish, in my experience. I theoretically live in an excellent school d

PISA (the Programme for International Student Assessment, run under the auspices of the OECD) was so struck by the outcome that it introduced its five-volume report as follows:

The Dalton School is the crustiest of the upper crust private school. Getting in is so absurd they actually made a movie about the absurdities where the admission information session for kindergarten was attended entirely by pregnant women. This is not a tuition that 99.999% of private school parents will pay. Fun fact: Jeffry Epstein was a teacher!

The Dalton SchoolHow does that measure up against The Little Lord Fauntleroy Academy for Albino Hemophiliacs?

Private school isn&#39;t about the education, it&#39;s about the connections.  Just like the Ivy League universities that have &quot;legacy&quot; preferences.

That&#39;s true. Even without the connections, the kids develop social polish that they wouldn&#39;t have otherwise. Later in life this serves as a shibboleth that they can use for admittance to elite groups.

The well-to-do in NYC want elite educations for their children. The current city administration is phasing out &quot;gifted and talented&quot; for the lower grades, and gives the impression that they would like to go further.

In case you are not well-versed in US educational standards, being &quot;gifted&quot; in an inner city school basically means you are on grade-level by a classical standard (e.g. able to read and add single digits by first grade). There is some equity messaging in the rationale that sounds good in

Some SaaS* companies borrowed money on crazy terms, which are highly vulnerable to &quot;blips&quot; in the market. A downturn, perhaps like that seen in 2007, or in Covid could cause a number of those companies to fail because there&#39;s not yet enough value created (in other words: money made in a war chest) by them to withstand it.

(* I&#39;ll bet it&#39;s not just SaaS - I&#39;m sure every man and his dog with an AI or Crypto business has been trying to do the same thing)

SaaS is uniquely challenged though.  AI is going to make developing software cheaper, if it has not already. Most of the SaaS industry is just CRUD apps with a ton of lipstick slathered on.  That is the kind of stuff that AI is really good at building an full stack architect who can understand, read, correct, validate AI outputs and do good prompts, build hooks etc probably can extend and support without the help of the junior programmers in the very near future. Those same companies largely don&#39;t host anyt

I agree there are lots of chancers, which by the looks of things are all financed really badly. However, SaaS isn&#39;t inherently the problem. If you had a shaky product before AI, then it&#39;s true AI makes it more shaky, but a solid product and solid financials work no matter what.

I have no idea about this company, but Doist (who run todoist.com) somehow makes money out of a to-do app (and have been at it for years and years). It&#39;s the thing just about every software tutorial tells you how to build - and yet so

Reminds me of the economist I was listening to on the radio in 2006 who claimed we were in a new economic era where people would simply use the never ending increase in their home equity to finance their entire lives.  Then 2007 arrived. That didn&#39;t end well.

I dunno if it new crops of the gullible coming online, or short memories of huge numbers of people, but we simply refuse to learn from our failures, just repeat them.

It&#39;s clearly both things. Everyone thinks they&#39;re a fucking genius.

It&#39;s clearly both things. Everyone thinks they&#39;re a fucking genius.I agree with that. 

But how is it that we keep repeating the same things that anyone with a memory knows is doomed to failure? I&#39;m certainly not the sharpest pencil in the box, but I pay attention and do have a good memory.  Maybe greed destroys memory, and the noobs just haven&#39;t developed the experience based cynicism yet.

This is a conservative, attributable list of Deutsche Bank costs tied directly to risk, controls, compliance, and governance failures over roughly the last 25 years.

These are not trading losses from bad bets, but money burned because risk assessment and control failed.

1999–2004, dot-com and analyst conflict scandals, settlements and compliance costs about 1.4 billion USD.

2008–2017, US mortgage crisis and RMBS mis-selling, DOJ settlement 7.2 billion USD.

... understood FOSS from day one and wouldn&#39;t touch anything proprietary for anything mission-critical with a ten-foot pole ever since. All the setups I&#39;ve built in the last 25 years won&#39;t even miss a beat when the entire SaaS landscape finally turns into the nuclear wasteland it was always destined to be.

I will enjoy the fireworks though, thank you for those. Getting the popcorn ready as we speak.

Most of the time real problems are caused because people combine multiple questionable issues.

The housing crisis in 2008 was often caused by the Liar Loan.  This was when a bank lied to the customer about how interest rate changes could affect their payments while also letting the customer lie to them about how much money they made.   If either one of them told the truth, the problems would have been much less.  But because both the banks and the customers used questionable methods, the problems compounded

Just a reminder that this is a correlation study. It does not mean that ingesting caffeine will reduce your chance of dementia in the same way that the reduction of pirates has not caused climate change.

It could simply be that people who can afford to spend money on niceties like coffee can afford food and avoid homelessness. Homelessness is highly correlated with death and dementia but that doesn&#39;t mean the house itself is preventing dementia.

So an interesting follow up study would be if Starbucks coffee is more beneficial than drip at home coffee.

So an interesting follow up study would be if Starbucks coffee is more beneficial than drip at home coffee.I&#39;d have to think that&#39;d be the other way around. Drinking ash and charcoal drippings can&#39;t be better than drinking brewed coffee in any manner. Even the lowly drip makers.

What if it&#39;s Starbucks coffee brewed in a home drip?

But independent experts said the study adjusted for many other factors, including health conditions, medication, diet, education, socioeconomic status, family history of dementia, body mass index, smoking and mental illness.

Lucky you, sounds like tea is dirt cheap. I spend $40 on a kg of coffee and it lasts me 3 weeks.

Of course correlation doesn&#39;t automatically equal causation.

But it suggests it, and makes it a reasonable thing to investigate.

But it suggests it, and makes it a reasonable thing to investigate.Correct. If people injecting or swallowing cyanide die, we can probably decide that the cyanide has something to do with that. 

But for the Correlation does not equal causation crowd, you can inject or consume all the cyanide you want, at least until it is definitively proven through the most rigorous scientific experiments, even then, not until multiple replications of the experiments, and  have definite biological mechanisms proven to show that is with no doubt the cyanide and not something else - which

The last paragraph explicitly says they considered that stuff.

That doesn&#39;t mean they did it right, but that objection was addressed in the summary, and we also already all know that.

The study EXPLICITLY accounted for socioeconomic status. So unless you are going to claim homeless people make a bunch of money, I doubt that homelessness is a factor.

> It could simply be that people who can afford to spend money on niceties like coffee can afford food and avoid homelessness

I get your point, but worth pointing out that the study was able to extract details like &quot;Drinking decaff isn&#39;t enough&quot; which tells me this particular potential cause probably isn&#39;t likely.

(Doctor) ”Well, your cholesterol levels are elevated, but new studies show I can safely recommend a cup of coffee for you daily.”

(Sally Starbucks) * whips out trusty 64oz Coffee Chugger Cup * ”OhMyGAWD Holy shit balls YES!  This is aweso..”

(Doctor) ”That means six ounces, stupid.  And you wonder why we’re petitioning to put instructions on bottled water.”

There&#39;s only ~120cc of coffee in my latte.

A cup of coffee is 8 oz. Coffee and tea snobs having their heads so far up their ass they can lick their own duodenum doesn&#39;t change that.

Coffee isn&#39;t going to hurt you, and can be beneficial.  So long as you&#39;re not drinking it several times a day, every day, for the entirety of your adult life.

Same for alcohol.  It does actually have some benefits.  But in small doses.  Not all day, every day, to excess.

Same for... almost literally anything.  Salt.  Sugar.  Fat.  All the stuff that&#39;s &quot;bad&quot; according to cheap headline-grabbing press.  You need it all in some amount.  Just not to excess.

Same, even, for things like vitamins.  No vitamins = you&#39;re dead.  Enough vitamins = you&#39;re fine.  More vitamins = you&#39;re going to see no benefit and/or have problems (Vit D can be overdosed on, for example).

Everything in moderation.  Eat red meat.  It&#39;s fine.  Just don&#39;t eat it every single day for every meal for decades on end.

And then you realise - that&#39;s why you get different answers from these studies, based on who&#39;s running them, who&#39;s reporting them, what they&#39;re testing, and who they are trying to target with the messaging.

Caffeine has benefits.Drinking caffeine to excess outweighs those benefits with downsides.The beneficial effect is rather small.The counter-effect is rather large.Your body consumes more than just caffeine alone.

Which explains ALL those results you gave, without having any untruths in there.  Now replace &quot;caffeine&quot; with pretty much anything - all those things I listed above.  Even drinking too much water will kill you (and it&#39;s not as much as you might think).

Everything in moderation, and then you won&#39;t have a problem.

Same for things like cigarettes, even.  If you only have a few, it&#39;s not going to kill you.  But if you&#39;re smoking 20 a day for decades on end?  Well, hello lung cancer.  It&#39;s why the most dangerous drugs are often the ADDICTIVE ones.  Caffeine included.  People have died from drinking too many caffeine-based energy drinks in too short a period of time.

But cigarettes are highly addictive. Now excuse me, I need more coffee.

Same for alcohol.Actually, that&#39;s mostly just wine, and it isn&#39;t the alcohol providing any of the supposed health benefits, but the other compounds in the fermented grape juice.

Actually, that&#39;s mostly just wine, and it isn&#39;t the alcohol providing any of the supposed health benefits, but the other compounds in the fermented grape juice.

They keep doing studies that show that there&#39;s a small health benefit from red wine.

In between them, studies keep coming out that show zero health benefit from any kind of alcoholic beverage, and in fact, some detriment.

But none of them show much effect in any direction for lower levels of consumption, isn&#39;t that the useful takeaway?

What is the moderate amount of alcohol (fyi, the negatives outweigh the benefits at all doses)?  Moderate amount of salt?  Etc...  Everything has a different moderate amount and those amounts all dynamically change based on other factors.Saying to just keep to moderate amounts is a bullshit argument if you don&#39;t specify what those amounts are.

Just don&#39;t eat it every single day for every meal for decades on end.It is a nice rule of thumb but like most rules of thumb there are many, many exceptions. Such as crack. Or lead. Or gunshot wounds.  The other trick is to figure out what &quot;moderation&quot; means. That&#39;s the big challenge in nutrition work as the data collection is often problematic and the analyses are often even more problematic.

Gunshot wounds have been proven to sometimes have a significant protective benefit to health. It all depends on who the gunshot wounds are on.

Same for alcohol.  It does actually have some benefits.  But in small doses.  Not all day, every day, to excess.Yeah, no, that&#39;s wrong. Even small doses are bad. What you are thinking of is probably wine which has some good properties - but you&#39;d really have to remove the alcohol from it to be a net positive.

Unless you&#39;re hitting stupidly large amounts of Vitamin D it&#39;s really difficult to overdose on. Vitamins A and B3 are much, much easier to OD on. Now, if you don&#39;t get enough K2, larger amounts of Vitamin D can lead to a dysregulation of calcium in your body, but that that is not the same as vitamin overdose.

Everything in moderation? F that! Here is some wisdom from an old fart: Too much of anything is just enough.  I may be going to hell in a bucket, babe, but at least I&#39;m enjoying the ride!

And they all claim 1) &quot;this is very strong evidence of the benefits of caffeine&quot;, followed by 2) &quot;but don&#39;t forget, this study is simply correlational&quot;; and then 3) &quot;but it is a very large sample&quot;, followed by 4) &quot;but don&#39;t forget... it&#39;s correlational&quot;. Pick a lane, please.There is a 99% chance that almost all funding for water-is-wet studies would instantly evaporate in the face of common fucking sense approvals.Trying to make longevity claims studying the “impact” of coffee vs. everything else that matters, is still marinating in fucking-pointless sauce.

I drink two cups of caffeinated coffee every morning. My working assumption, based on this post, is that this will have saved me from my lost decade of hedonistic alcohol and drug abuse. Maybe I&#39;ll up it to three cups.

The study seems to center around the benefits of consuming caffeine via coffee.  So the obvious question is..was the measured benefit provided by the coffee bean, or just pure caffeine?  Relevant question, since I’m pretty sure the kids are vaping caffeine now.  Or will soon.

Bean sucking addicts can’t quite relate to others not liking the taste of coffee, but rest assured there are plenty who would like to understand the benefits of longevity without having to pretend bitter mud water tastes goo

Yeah, and this bit is a red flag suggesting the study doesn&#39;t actually prove what it appears to prove, ie this may be a coincidence.

The thing is... tea contains far less caffeine than coffee. 8oz of brewed coffee contains 96mg of caffeine vs 48mg in the same amount of black tea (https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/caffeine/art-20049372)

So basically there&#39;s no correlation at all with caffeine in this case, if you have to drink 288mg of caffeine via coffee to get

Then you get sleep deprivation, maybe another risk factor in dementia. Torturers use sleep deprivation.

Generally I believe it&#39;s the opposite, anecdotally one of the first signs we saw with one of my relatives was she was napping pretty much all day despite sleeping the night without problems. We were told once the diagnosis had been done that this was a normal sign.

This is why most nerds I know are slamming Monster or NOS all day, I guess.Two lady friends at work and myself were so addicted to coffee, that we ended up having to withdraw from it after having panic attacks. It isn&#39;t permanent - you can start drinking it again after detox, but if you haven&#39;t had a caffeine fueled panic attack, you don&#39;t want one. You 100 percent believe you are going to die in seconds, but don&#39;t know why.

Caffeine, in the form of coffee or tea, brings more than just caffeine to the table.

1) There&#39;s a vascular conditioning effect as it causes constriction and later relaxation of blood vessels in the brain - this could plausibly help maintain proper blood flow and prevent slow hypoperfusion from killing brain cells.

2) There are anti-inflammatory effects from the beverages, and chronic inflammation is another effect of dementia.

3) The drinks are frequently a cause of social interaction, and increased social act

One is that if you are in that coffee/tea-bracket, you likely do not have to cut back on it. If it is causation, you definitely should not. If it is something else correlated with dementia and coffee (e.g. lifestyle), you also do not have to. Yes, this comes with some uncertainty, but not that much.

The last time I drank two cups of coffee in a day, I had to wake up three times at night to pee.  My bladder just can&#39;t handle that much caffeine anymore.  Guess I better embrace my destined dementia demise.

I&#39;ve seen coffee studies come out for many decades, and they tend to arrive in the pattern of good, bad, good, bad, good, bad, good, bad, etc.

I average it out: coffee is generally harmless, as long as you don&#39;t overdo it.  If you want coffee, enjoy a cup of joe, otherwise don&#39;t. Don&#39;t overthink it.

Coffee and tea, in reasonable doses, are only as unhealthy as the shit people add to them

The past month has seen a barrage of election subversion stories that, taken individually, were alarming, but viewed together reveal a deeply disturbing new playbook emanating from the Trump administration ahead of the midterms. On this week’s Amicus podcast, Dahlia Lithwick talked with election law gladiator Marc Elias, chair of Elias Law Group and founder of Democracy Docket. Their discussion, edited and condensed for clarity here, highlights a very clear pattern when it comes to Trump and voting: a project that seeks to normalize violence and to test drive the shattering of how elections are typically run. The work of the coming nine months? Keep a close eye on the encroaching lawlessness, don’t normalize election subversion, and organize now to protect your friends and neighbors.

Dahlia Lithwick: When Steve Bannon pledged last week that ICE is going to “surround the polls”—that the federal government is going to send Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to patrol polling stations during the midterms—is he trolling, or something we should be taking literally and seriously?

Marc Elias: I don’t think he’s trolling us, I think he’s quite serious. I think Donald Trump wants to maintain optionality here. Trump has put federal paramilitary forces in a number of American cities. Everyone’s focused on Minneapolis, but let’s be clear, it’s not only Minneapolis. Part of it is because he obviously has an anti-immigrant agenda he wants to pursue, but he also wants to normalize the idea of seeing people with flash-bang grenades and tear gas breaking windows and dragging people out of cars, and telling U.S. citizens that they’re being put in databases, and grabbing U.S. citizens and throwing them in the back of vans. Trump wants to normalize all of that because that has a number of side benefits, none so great as potentially using those same forces and same tactics around the midterm elections—not to go after noncitizens, and not even specifically focused on being right around polling places, but just more generally making it more intimidating to vote, making it more inconvenient to get to polling locations, and in its most extreme form, yes, surrounding polling locations and intimidating people or preventing voting altogether.

So I guess the follow-up is just my lawyerly question, which is: Of course it’s not lawful to deploy federal troops or armed federal law enforcement to polling places. The Brennan Center is very clear—it’s a crime for anyone in the military to interfere with elections. So doesn’t this discussion begin and end with the fact that you just can’t?

It doesn’t, for two reasons. First of all, we began the administration with people thinking, Oh my God, what if he puts the military at the polls? And I think Donald Trump has figured out that he’s better off with paramilitary forces than the actual U.S. military. The military may be too disciplined and too principled to do what he wants here, so he’s found other federal law enforcement personnel and agencies willing to do his dirty work. We’ve seen that progression between L.A.—where we saw the National Guard deployed—and now Minneapolis, where we’ve seen ICE and Border Patrol.

More fundamentally, though, what you have is a president who himself enjoys absolute immunity and will wield the pardon power, and that makes saying something is “illegal” a lot less of a credible threat. When you also have a Department of Justice that would never prevent them from doing those things, and in fact would go to court to enable those things … it doesn’t take law off the table, and I never want people to think that the courts are not able to address some of these things, because I think, in fact, the courts have proven the most capable of being checks on Donald Trump. I can promise you lawyers like me will be in court, and we will fight against this, and we may very well win, but it doesn’t mean that he won’t try or that he won’t actually get cooperation from his own administration to do these things.

Also last week, President Trump said the time has come to “nationalize elections.” Can you talk us through what lies beneath that threat? Is there some tangible plan he’s referencing, or is this just another one of his I want what I want and I want it now, and I want these 15 Democratic jurisdictions to be monitored by me.

I think a couple of things here are important. The first is that when he says he wants to “nationalize” the elections, I fear some people think that he’s talking about something like uniform standards across the country, some terrible but nevertheless uniform application of voting standards that would apply in Alabama equally as they would  apply in, say, New York.

But if you look at the broader quote, he’s making false claims about people coming to the country illegally to vote, and then he says, “It’s amazing that the Republicans aren’t tougher on it. The Republicans should say, ‘We want to take over, we should take over the voting.’ The voting in at least many, 15 places. The Republicans ought to nationalize the voting.” So I want to be clear, he’s not talking about nationalizing election administration. He is talking about Republicans taking over the voting, and then identifying that there would be specific jurisdictions in which they would take over that voting. We can assume that those 15 would grow to be beyond 15, and that it would be places with large concentrations of Democratic votes. He’s talking about a partisan takeover, not a federal-versus-state takeover.

The second thing is, I think that the big lie that he is selling in 2026 is his own power regarding these elections. What he’s really doing in this statement is he’s suggesting that the president has powers over elections that he doesn’t have. What we’re seeing is a progression and an escalation. I want everyone to go back in their heads and remember that 2020 didn’t start with a violent insurrection of the nation’s Capitol, it actually started with Donald Trump before the election, well before the election, saying that we can’t have all these mail-in ballots, right? He was railing against mail-in ballots, and then there was litigation before the election about mail-in voting, and in-person voting, and all kinds of stuff, and many in the traditional legacy media treated that as if it was the normal jockeying before elections, and people like me and you were saying, “No! This is actually not normal, this is actually quite extraordinary!”

Then Donald Trump loses the election, and he files not one lawsuit, but he and his allies file 64 lawsuits—which, again, completely not normal! If you go back, maybe in the totality of Bush v. Gore, with all of the subsidiary little issues, maybe there were a dozen cases? But that was one state involving a very, very close margin, decided by the Supreme Court. In 2020, this was a scattershot approach with a lot of bullshit legal theories. And when that didn’t work, he escalated. This is the pivot point that people sometimes look past. On Dec. 19, 2020, after the Electoral College met, the state of Texas filed a petition directly in the U.S. Supreme Court. You know how unusual that is? Texas didn’t go to the trial courts, it just went straight to the U.S. Supreme Court and said, We need you to throw out the election results in four states. This is unheard of. Mike Johnson, who is now the speaker of the House but was at that point a back-bencher, organized 126 Republican members of Congress to sign onto that brief as an amicus. That became a major pivot point, because it was as much a political organizing as it was a legal organizing, and it winds up building up to House Republicans trying to refuse to certify the election Jan. 6, and then the violence and the insurrection we saw on Jan. 6.

That was the progression in 2020. As we look today, we’re seeing the beginnings of the same progression: Donald Trump, first attacking voting, his Department of Justice bringing litigation, which they are losing. Now you see the seizing of ballots in Georgia, and you start to see the rhetoric from Steve Bannon about surrounding the polls. This is the progression that Trump goes through, and I think everyone needs to be really worried.

You just mentioned the FBI search of a warehouse in Fulton County, Georgia, last week, which followed persistent demands from the president, claiming without evidence that fraud cost him Georgia. They used the opportunity to seize almost 700 boxes of 2020 election documents, all in the presence of Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, who was on the scene for that raid. Can you explain why it’s a big deal, having the DNI present for an FBI raid in Georgia?

Yes, and there’s another fact that has been way too much overlooked: The prosecutor who sought this search warrant is in Missouri; this was not out of the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Georgia. From reporting, it appears this U.S. attorney out of a district in Missouri has jurisdiction not only over the 2020 Fulton County matter (to the extent that it is a matter), but also some kind of nationwide jurisdiction over all election “things.”

When you take in his involvement and you take in Gabbard’s involvement, I think you need to recast this as not simply election nihilism about 2020, and not only as a fight about nostalgia—which would still be terrible, unprecedented, and dangerous—but that would be one thing. I think this raid is about proof of concept for the future. People are talking about seizing ballots and surrounding polling places and stealing elections as if somehow these things are easily done. These are conceptual frameworks that people in the administration have to get comfortable with; these are moral frameworks they have to get comfortable with. They have to contend with the Constitution and the law and judges and all that, but they also have to contend with just the sheer logistics of it all: How do we actually do this thing where there are ballots in the possession of a county official? And how are we going to get them, and how are we going to then count them in a way that is going to cast doubt on the outcome, or cast doubt on the outcome through other propaganda and disinformation campaigns? This Georgia raid is just as much about all that as it is about 2020.

Donald Trump and his administration actually managed to pull something off here. They actually did seize ballots, they actually got their hands on them. People can say “Oh, they had the wrong warrant and they had to go back,” but at the end of the day, Tulsi Gabbard was on a truck full of documents seized from an office, and those are now in the possession of the FBI and presumably a grand jury by this prosecutor from Missouri. That should be terrifying. In terms of alarm bells, this is off the charts. They faced a challenge in 2020 and were humiliated in how to subvert the outcome of an election, and Donald Trump told the New York Times that he wished he had seized the ballots in 2020. They have now shown they have a proof of concept, that they know logistically how to do this—including getting a federal magistrate judge to sign a warrant. That is not a small matter, that is a safeguard put in place to prevent the abuse of grand juries, the abuse of subpoenas, and the abuse of arrest warrants. They got through that process, and that is a learning exercise that they will use going forward to 2026, and it is the thing that I probably worry the most about.

Pete Hegseth, perhaps the most thuggish, toadying, all-around underqualified secretary of defense in the job’s nearly 80-year history, has now shown himself to be the most institutionally destructive as well.

His announcement on Friday, that he was cutting the department’s ties to Harvard University—and possibly to other centers of higher learning too—reflects not only a smug anti-intellectualism, which is out of sync with a high-tech modern military, but also a total misunderstanding of how and why its ties to academia first came about.

“For too long,” Hegseth said in a video, “this department has sent our best and brightest officers to Harvard, hoping the university would better understand and appreciate our warrior class. Instead, too many of our officers came back looking too much like Harvard—heads full of globalist and radical ideologies that do not improve our fighting ranks. … We train warriors, not wokesters. Harvard, good riddance.”

From start to finish, this speech is pure rubbish.

The need to broaden the education of America’s warriors was first perceived by Gen. George Marshall, the U.S. Army’s chief of staff during World War II (hardly an emblem of woke). Marshall relied heavily on the chief of his Strategy and Policy Group, Brig. Gen. George Lincoln. (I delved into his papers at the West Point Archives for Chapter 1 of my 2013 book The Insurgents: David Petraeus and the Plot to Change the American Way of War.)

In the last year of the war—at age 37 the Army’s youngest general officer—Lincoln met with Marshall daily, coordinated every major military campaign, and helped draft the treaties at Yalta and Potsdam, which shaped the political map of postwar Europe. He then assisted Marshall’s replacement, Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, in creating the Department of Defense.

The special thing about Lincoln was, after graduating from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1929, he won a Rhodes scholarship and spent the next three years at Oxford, studying philosophy, politics, and economics—then returned to West Point to teach before getting assigned to high-level staff jobs after WWII broke out.

While working with Marshall at the various Allied planning conferences, Lincoln noticed that much of the crucial work was done by a handful of fellow military officers, almost all of whom had also been Rhodes scholars. He did a little research and found that West Point had produced 13 Rhodes scholars in its history. Of the six still alive, four were holding senior policy posts, helping set the terms of military strategy and postwar peace treaties.

As the war ended, the United States was emerging as a global power with global responsibilities. It would need leaders well versed in politics, diplomacy, economics, and strategy. But few such people existed in or out of the military. Certainly West Point, Lincoln’s alma mater, wasn’t training such people. At the time, all its cadets took the same courses, which focused mainly on engineering. There was a course on bridge building, but no courses on military history.

In May 1945, less than two weeks after the end of the war, Lincoln wrote a letter to one of his mentors back at West Point. “I am beginning to think that what we need is a type of staff officer with at least three heads—one political, one economic, and one military.” In another letter, he proposed “baptizing practically all officers” with a “sprinkling” of education in politics, history, and economics, while taking “certain selected” officers and “dunking” them in those waters much more deeply.

The Army, he continued, “can no longer afford to depend on the fortuitous assembly of Rhodes Scholars. … There must be an integrated system of high-level training if Army policy and national policy are properly to be served, a system which begins here at West Point.”

Lincoln could easily have gone on to have a storied career, rising through the Army’s officer corps. Instead, he returned to West Point to create a new department of social sciences, which would mold this new system. Since regulations required that department heads be colonels, not generals, Lincoln even took a demotion in his rank and was never again promoted.

He started his new job on Sept. 1, 1947. He and Col. Herman Beukema, his onetime mentor and now the new department’s co-founder, created courses in history, government, foreign affairs, geography, national-security economics, and international relations. Lincoln also wrote the nation’s first college-level textbook on international politics, a reference that was assigned not only at West Point but at several civilian colleges across the country.

Over time, cadets concentrating in social sciences formed an elite enclave, which became an object of resentment and ridicule among some more hidebound officers. As late as 1991, when Gen. “Stormin’ Norman” Schwarzkopf returned from his command of Operation Desert Storm to deliver a rousing victory speech at West Point, he reminisced about his own days as a cadet and poked fun at the crazy ideas advanced by “a couple of left-wing pinko Social Science instructors.”

Schwarzkopf was mining a well-known stereotype. (Even at this late date, some of the cadets laughed at and applauded his remark.) He was only half joking, however. Some of his own staff officers had been products of “Sosh,” the academy’s nickname for the social sciences department. But Schwarzkopf’s jab (minus the humor) is the view that Hegseth now holds of the entire enterprise: seeing war as nothing more than killing. In this view, all other dimensions of warfare—the idea that soldiers should understand the enemy they’re fighting, interpret their tactics in a strategic context, and stay within the confines of international law—are not merely secondary but counterproductive, contrary to a “warrior spirit,” woke.

Lincoln had another purpose in creating the new department. “I am certain,” he wrote in one letter, “that we must make strenuous efforts … to improve the so-called Army mind.” This would mean, above all, “impressing the student with the fact that the basic requirement is to learn to think—sometimes a very painful process.”

Perhaps more than anything else, this is what Hegseth sees, and fears, in the officers who have earned degrees or fellowships at places like Harvard. This spirit of inquiry, curiosity, and criticism is what he defines as “woke.”

Early on in the development of Sosh, Lincoln put in place a rule allowing cadets who did especially well in his courses to go study at a civilian graduate school, with West Point paying their tuition. In exchange, these cadets, after earning their master’s or doctoral degrees, would come back to teach in the Sosh department for at least three years. Once they fulfilled that obligation, Lincoln would use his still-considerable connections in Washington to get them choice assignments in the Pentagon, the State Department, the White House, a foreign embassy, or a prestigious command post.

Lincoln died in 1975, but the Sosh tradition lived on. Today almost all general officers in the U.S. Army (and also in the Air Force, which was a branch of the Army until 1947, when it became an independent service) hold graduate degrees—and most of them, at least the generals I know, are as proud of their degrees as they are of their ranks.

For instance, Gen. David Petraeus, commander of the more successful phases of the war in Iraq, went to West Point, then earned a Ph.D. at Princeton University. Gen. H.R. McMaster, who was a lethal tank commander and a counterinsurgency strategist in Iraq (as well as, briefly, national security adviser during Donald Trump’s first term as president), followed a similar path, getting his Ph.D. from the University of North Carolina.

Maybe Hegseth sees those officers as epitomes of woke. But what about the current chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Dan Caine, appointed and lauded by Trump and his entire team, including Hegseth? His page on the JCS website states that Caine “has completed a range of national security and leadership courses, including Harvard Kennedy School’s course for Senior Executives in National and International Security.”

Someone should ask Caine, the next time he appears at a press conference or a congressional hearing, whether his spirit and skill as a warrior and a citizen were helped or hindered by his Ivy League exposure. Maybe Hegseth should have asked the question—and maybe he should think and read up even a little bit about a vast range of topics before opening his mouth.

As I followed a patrol of federal agents around New York City’s Chinatown during their fumbling attempted raid in mid-October last year, I noticed something curious. I was following a small group with the immediately recognizable style of Stephen Miller’s paramilitaristic vanguard: baggy street clothes, masked faces, weapons, and ballistic vests without specific insignia, just the catchall “POLICE” or “Federal Agent.” As we turned one corner, we walked past two other agents dressed much the same, except that one wore a vest that did have agency identification, and it wasn’t Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Customs and Border Protection; it read “IRS-CI,” for the Internal Revenue Service’s Criminal Investigation division.

This is not typically what IRS-CI does. The comparatively small federal law enforcement agency, like the majority of its counterparts, is specialized around one area of enforcement, in this case tasked with investigating criminal violations of the tax code—complex investigations requiring particularized skills, which is why the IRS’ own job portal encourages “expertise in accounting.” It is not part of the Department of Homeland Security or even the Department of Justice, residing under the IRS in the Treasury Department.

Yet here was an IRS-CI agent on a foot patrol during a much larger operation that seemed primarily geared toward detaining random men whom agents deemed likely to be African, and she wasn’t an anomaly. As a well-placed source confirmed to me contemporaneously, the operation had hastily brought in dozens of agents from ICE, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the FBI, and the IRS, potentially among other agencies. This approach itself is not now abnormal; per figures obtained and published by the Cato Institute last September, an eye-watering 28,390 federal law enforcement personnel as of August had been detailed to ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, the component that handles immigration arrests and detention.

About 17,500 of these came from either ICE’s criminal-focused division, Homeland Security Investigations, or CBP, but that leaves over 10,000 coming from entities that are not focused on immigration enforcement at all. The IRS provided 1,771, which out of a total special agent population of about 2,100, means about 84 percent of its agent workforce was detailed to ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations. The DEA provided 3,417, which would be some 70 percent of its special agent workforce. Thousands more came from the FBI; Alcohol, Firearms, Tobacco and Explosives; and even the State Department’s Diplomatic Security service.

This reality has been covered mostly from the standpoint of it taking agents away from crucial other tasks, ranging from child exploitation to financial crimes to drug trafficking (the latter of which notably forms the pretext for a lot of the Trump administration’s domestic enforcement push). But it also has some concrete implications for accountability; not only are agents often neither named nor identified, their agencies themselves are unclear.

Some observers noted that Attorney General Pam Bondi simply referred to “federal agents” in her X post and subsequent comments on the arrest of several people including journalists Don Lemon and Georgia Fort last week. In a video Fort posted to Facebook, an agent wearing a DEA vest can be seen peering through her window; it’s unclear which agency the others belonged to.

We are no longer talking about individual law enforcement agencies, but rather a giant, singular blob. The burgeoning momentum in what has been a stultified Democratic congressional minority’s effort to rein in some of ICE’s actions—partly compelled by public horror at the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis—will have to contend with the fact of this blob. Lawmakers have been pushing for the DHS inspector general to probe the agency’s use of force, among other things, but will this inquiry encompass abuses potentially committed by other agencies’ personnel? Who’s to say which agency is even involved in any given operation?

Democrats are also now negotiating over (relatively small-bore) constraints like mandating body cameras and limiting masks as they work to hold up DHS funding. They should consider that language too narrowly tailored to ICE and CBP is potentially going to miss DEA agents, for example, detailed to the exact same job. The funding freeze itself—which might have limited overall impact in light of the multibillion-dollar orgy of funding already bestowed on ICE in last year’s so-called Big Beautiful Bill—won’t touch the operations of, say, the Department of Justice, which houses the ATF, Marshals, and Bureau of Prisons, all of which have seen agents deployed with ICE.

This amorphous and ever-shifting group of agents drawn from across the federal government looks increasingly like a catchall national police force operating at the direction of the White House itself, used for diffuse political goals like immigration enforcement, speech crackdowns, and occupying politically oppositional cities. While different federal agencies have long collaborated on joint investigations, this appears to be much more like absorption than collaboration. The underlying agencies still exist, of course, but their agent workforces are substantially or even mostly no longer part of them, instead existing as part of this national police blob.

This also shifts the question of capacity. ICE has been going on a messy hiring push to try to significantly beef up its numbers, though the results may take a while to fully manifest. Yet this means that, without hiring a single additional recruit, ICE ERO has just about tripled its workforce as its mission keeps shifting to include its general immigration functions plus additional White House priorities. It has been suggested by Steve Bannon and others that Trump would deploy members of this law enforcement blob during November’s midterms to monitor polling places and potentially intimidate voters. While the administration’s pseudo-sieges of cities have the limiting factor of ICE’s and CBP’s headcount, these are pools of already trained and equipped federal agents that they can draw from other entities to expand this footprint.

They probably already have; though a DOJ attorney told a federal judge that the 3,000-strong surge of agents to the Twin Cities included 2,000 ICE personnel, we don’t really know if this includes agents detailed to ICE from other agencies. The administration does not publicly disclose how many agents from which agencies have been reassigned to ICE ERO, nor where they’re deployed or what they’re doing. In the context of agents prowling around cities, arresting people seemingly at random and occasionally killing protesters, the specific seal on any given agent’s badge might seem inconsequential, but if state authorities and lawmakers want to get serious about oversight and accountability for these authoritarian operations, they will need to understand the scope, nature, and composition of this federal force.

Trump has called for elections to be “nationalized,” something neither the president, nor the federal government, has the authority to do. But as he’s already sent the FBI to raid Fulton County, Georgia’s election offices with director of intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and with the midterms on their way, it’s time to ask how much damage a vindictive president could do.

Guest:  Ari Berman, voting rights reporter at Mother Jones.

            <h2>Kyndryl to review accounting practices as several execs leave</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/10/kyndryl_reviews_accounting_practices/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">IBM services spin-out Kyndryl said it was reviewing its accounting practices after it announced revenue below market expectations and the departure of its CFO.

Investors reacted strongly to the news, sending the share price down more than 55 percent on Monday.

Although the company&#39;s Q3 revenue increased three percent year-over-year to $3.86 billion, this was below analyst forecasts, as was its earnings per share.

In a notification of late filing to the US regulator, Kyndryl said it was “reviewing its cash management practices and related disclosures, regarding its adjusted free cash flow metric and other measures.” “Due to this review, the finalization of the Quarterly Report, including the Company’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting, requires additional time to complete,” it said.

Martin Schroeter, Chairman and CEO, told investors that the move followed the receipt of a voluntary document request from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The review included “cash management practices, related disclosures, the effectiveness of internal control of our financial reporting and certain other matters,” he said.

“We are cooperating with the SEC. We do not expect a restatement or other impact to our financial statements. Due to the ongoing nature of these matters, we will not be able to comment further at this time,” Schroeter said.

The company also announced that David Wyshner was stepping down as CFO and that Edward Sebold was leaving the general counsel position. Vineet Khurana also stepped down as senior vice president and global controller of the Company. Kyndryl appointed Harsh Chugh as interim CFO, Mark Ringes as interim general counsel, and Bhavna Doegar as interim corporate controller.

Kate Hanaghan, chief research officer at TechMarketView, said the episode was jarring in the context of the more positive operational narrative Kyndryl has been communicating in recent quarters. “The firm has been making progress in shifting away from low-margin legacy work [and] improving profitability... Investments in AI capabilities, sovereign and hybrid cloud offerings, and selective acquisitions – such as Solvinity in the Netherlands – have also been central to its repositioning strategy.

“For Kyndryl, restoring confidence will depend not just on completing the accounting review, but on demonstrating that the underlying transformation story remains intact and that financial controls are robust enough to support the next phase of growth,” she said.

Kyndryl was spun out as a separately-traded public entity by IBM in November 2021.

In 2024, insiders said that they doubted that the company was winning much new business. Later in the year, people familiar with the company told The Register that Kyndryl was struggling to develop its consulting business.

On both occasions, the company declined to respond to a request for comment.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">APRICOT 2026 After years of strife, the African Network Information Centre (AFRINIC) is weeks away from signing off on a budget and action plan, activity that one of the organization’s newly appointed executives believes demonstrates it is back on track.

AFRINIC is one of the world’s five regional internet registries (RIRs), the governance bodies that delegate and manage IP addresses and autonomous system numbers in coordination with ICANN. A complex set of linked legal matters meant the African registry was unable to elect a board or carry out many of its functions from 2022 to 2025, but after some difficulties last year, it has elected a board and begun to rebuild.

Evidence of the turnaround emerged on Monday when Mukom Tamon, AFRINIC’s head of capacity building, appeared at the Asia Pacific Regional Internet Conference on Operational Technologies (APRICOT) in Jakarta, Indonesia. AFRINIC has been largely absent from such events for several years.

“We were extremely concerned that if we did not have some good news out of 2025, 2026 would the year in which our death just continues in a very silent way,” Tamon told the conference.

At APRICOT, Tamon offered lots of positive news.

He told the event that morale among AFRINIC staff has improved since the election, and that AFRINIC’s new board has swung into action. One sign of the board’s vigor, he said, is the appointment of interim management personnel – himself to cover technology infrastructure and strategy, plus a finance officer, and another exec dedicated to stakeholder engagement. Tamon said AFRINIC has also developed a budget and action plan that will appear in the next two weeks.

“That is a sign we are out of the quagmire,” he said, before predicting “This year, the phoenix rises from the ashes.”

And from 2027, AFRINIC might soar: Tamon said the organization’s board is working on a formal strategy covering the years 2027 to 2030. “That is how we get back to governance normalcy,” he told the APRICOT crowd.

Tamon also noted that AFRINIC has a pool of 773,376 unallocated IPv4 addresses and that he “can’t wait for that to be zero, so we can start talking about what really matters: IPv6.”

That remark drew a chuckle from the APRICOT crowd.

His earlier news about AFRINIC’s improved status brought spontaneous and enthusiastic applause – a rare response at a gathering mostly attended by network engineers and internet governance wonks.

AFRINIC’s past woes left the organization unable to perform some of its basic functions, a situation that concerned internet governance organizations because the policy they operate under defines how to create an RIR, but does not include provisions for what to do if an RIR becomes dysfunctional.

The community’s response was to revisit that policy, knwon as ICP-2, so it defines the full lifecycle of an RIR, plus provisions for how the five registries can assist each other during crises. The revised ICP-2 also incudes provisions that allow derecognition of an RIR.

A second round of community consultation on the revised ICP-2 took place in late 2025, and last week the Number Resource Organization (NRO), the peak body for the five RIRs, published a summary [PDF] of comments received, plus a status report [PDF] on the process of updating ICP-2.

At APRICOT this week, Akinori Maemura, a member of the NRO’s governing council, summarized those documents by saying some work remains to more clearly define elements of the policy and then draft the revised document.

In conversation with The Register, Maemura said the revised ICP-2 is nearly in its final form, and that the document will be ready to put to a vote by the end of 2026. He said ICANN will likely approve it later this year.

If that happens, the RIR community will have used the bottom-up multistakeholder processes (which the United Nations recently decided to embrace) to strengthen its governance.

Which matters to readers of The Register because we all depend on IP addresses, and the organizations that oversee them will soon likley operate on firmer footing. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/10/trump_wants_no_ai_friction/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Trump administration continues its AI push, working to defuse public opposition to datacenter energy and water consumption - while dangling a promise to exempt hyperscalers from chip tariffs to help them stock their facilities with GPUs and accelerators.

To address public concerns, Washington wants tech giants to commit that their expanding datacenter estates across the US won&#39;t spike energy bills or drain local water supplies.

According to Politico, a proposed voluntary pact between President Trump, the datacenter industry and megacorps like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta and OpenAI, would establish principles around energy, water use and local community relations.

The move aligns with recent developments: last month, Trump declared tech companies must fund datacenter power increases rather than passing costs to consumers, securing Microsoft&#39;s compliance. The US Energy Secretary also pressured grid operator PJM Interconnection to hold an emergency auction addressing surging AI datacenter demand.

This appears aimed at containing growing public opposition to server farms popping up all over the US. Research org Data Center Watch found 20 projects were blocked or delayed by local opposition during Q2 2025 alone.

Other reports indicate hyperscalers may be spared from President Trump&#39;s chip import tariffs to avoid impeding their buildouts. In January, the White House said it was imposing 25 percent tariffs on &quot;certain advanced computing chips,&quot; including Nvidia&#39;s H200 and AMD&#39;s MI325X.

According to the Financial Times, these tariff carve-outs may be contingent on chip companies - especially TSMC - committing to relocating more production stateside.

This furthers Washington&#39;s effort to relocate 40-50 percent of TSMC&#39;s manufacturing to US soil, a &quot;massive reshoring&quot; that Taiwan&#39;s vice-premier this week called &quot;impossible.&quot;

TSMC has committed $165 billion to Arizona fabs that will produce some of its 2nm chips, though whether this satisfies Trump remains unclear.

If TSMC meets conditions for hyperscalers tariff exemptions, the US would exempt the largest buyers of products it just tariffed. Reg readers can no doubt spot the irony.

Last month TSMC posted Q4 2025 revenue of $33.7 billion, up more than 25 percent year-on-year. Full-year revenue for the world&#39;s largest chip contract manufacturer came in at $122.5 billion, up 36 percent compared to 2024. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft is introducing a raft of Windows security features that users and administrators alike might assume are already part of the operating system.

Dubbed &quot;Windows Baseline Security Mode&quot; and &quot;User Transparency and Consent,&quot; the updates are intended to deal with suspect behavior behind the scenes while also prompting the user when an app tries to use a sensitive resource, such as the device&#39;s camera or microphone, or wanders into a user&#39;s sensitive files.

Starting with the Baseline Security Mode, the plan is for Windows to operate with runtime integrity safeguards enabled by default. This means only properly signed apps, services, and drivers. However, users and administrators can still override the safeguards for that one weird legacy app, and app developers can check if the protections are active and if any exceptions have been granted.

For User Transparency and Consent, it looks like there could be a lot more nagging in store. The current User Account Control (UAC) prompt often triggers little more than an eye roll and a swift click. But Microsoft&#39;s new approach will be more granular, asking for explicit consent when apps access sensitive resources or try to install other software.

&quot;Just like on your smartphone,&quot; said Microsoft, although hopefully without all the restrictions that come with a walled garden of vendors like Apple has.

So users are set to face more prompts, although Microsoft stated: &quot;These prompts are designed to be clear and actionable, and you&#39;ll always have the ability to review and change your choices later.&quot;

Those same users might wonder why Microsoft&#39;s operating system does not already have such restrictions in place, but their arrival is laudable nonetheless, even if it is one more thing for administrators to either explain to users or deactivate ahead of the inevitable flood of support tickets.

Alex Ionescu, Chief Technology Innovation Officer at CrowdStrike, said: &quot;CrowdStrike is looking forward to being an early partner in the development of a new, more secure and resilient runtime model for Windows applications, which helps raise the bar for user security and privacy.

&quot;When applications and agentic workloads are well-behaved and respect user consent settings with proper security boundaries, security software can better protect users from attackers with reduced performance overhead.&quot;

CrowdStrike, lest we forget, was the outfit responsible for an update that bricked Windows devices worldwide in 2024. The incident was at least partly responsible for Microsoft having a serious rethink about Windows security and what third-party components should be allowed to do.

Microsoft has been talking about beefing up Windows security for years. Its Secure Future Initiative (SFI) predated the CrowdStrike incident, but didn&#39;t prevent a piece of malformed code from taking down millions of Windows instances.

In this case, user concerns about AI agents are also at play. Microsoft said: &quot;Apps and AI agents will also be expected to meet higher transparency standards, giving both users and IT administrators better visibility into their behaviors.&quot;

Microsoft did not give a timeline for the updates, only the direction of travel. The company said the changes would &quot;roll out through a phased approach.&quot; ®

            <h2>Oracle Java licensing worries are percolating through the userbase</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-10</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Concerns over changes to Oracle&#39;s Java licensing strategy are hitting more than nine out of ten users as businesses struggle to adapt to the regime, according to research.

A study from Dimensional Research shows that 92 percent of the 2,000 respondents reported being concerned about Oracle Java pricing, up from 82 percent in the same survey last year. Those stating they were very concerned about the changes leapt from 19 percent in 2025 to 29 percent this year.

In 2023, Oracle changed its Java SE subscription model, shifting from a per-user or per-processor basis to per-employee. Critics called the move &quot;predatory&quot; as organizations that were using little Java but had a large number of employees could be hit hard by the cost increase.

Later that year, research from Gartner showed that costs could be between two and five times greater under the new licensing model for using the same software.

Anxiety over the new charging model is a major driver pushing Java users to look for alternatives. Eighty-one percent of users have migrated, are migrating, or plan to migrate all or some of their Oracle Java to an open source alternative, according to the survey of global tech pros.

A number of alternatives to Oracle exist for running OpenJDK applications in production, including Bellsoft Liberica, IBM Semeru, and Azul Platform Core. Concern over the licensing change continues to spike because awareness is still filtering through the user community, said Gil Tene, CTO and co-founder of Java support and technology provider Azul Systems, which commissioned the research.

&quot;For most of them, the way they find out is a conversation with an Oracle salesperson, and that conversation starts at some place in the organization, but then it takes a while for that to make it through the organization, to the people actually looking at financial implications and the budget.&quot;

Tene said the users were also waking up to the fact that a strategy to gradually move off Oracle Java does not solve the licensing problem.

&quot;The shift that happened about a little under three years ago is that they went from volume-based to employee-based pricing. It&#39;s enough for one employee in the company to use one copy of Java from Oracle, for the company to be on the hook for paying per employee, for the entire employee base,&quot; he claimed.

A separate study from Dimensional Research published last year found that 73 percent of Oracle Java users had been audited in the last three years.

Another pressure on Java costs has been the shift to the cloud. The latest Dimensional Research data shows 97 percent of participants have taken actions to reduce their public cloud costs, including using a high-performance Java platform (41 percent). However, 74 percent of organizations say they still have more than 20 percent unused compute capacity in their public cloud environments.

The Register has asked Oracle to comment. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Singapore spent almost a year flushing a suspected China-linked espionage crew out of its telecom networks in what officials describe as the country&#39;s largest cyber defense operation to date.

The Cyber Security Agency of Singapore said advanced persistent threat UNC3886 dug itself into the networks of all four major telecom providers, sparking an 11-month digital eviction effort involving more than 100 personnel from across government, military, intelligence, and industry. Branded &quot;Operation Cyber Guardian,&quot; the cleanup saw the state and telco engineers teaming up to flush the intruders out while keeping the nation&#39;s phone and data pipes flowing.

&quot;Over the past months, our investigations have indicated that UNC3886 had launched a deliberate, targeted, and well-planned campaign against Singapore&#39;s telecommunications sector,&quot; the CSA said.

Officials stopped short of formally pointing the finger at Beijing, but UNC3886 has long been associated with Chinese state-aligned cyber espionage. The group tends to skip flashy break-ins on user machines and instead sneaks into the dull but revealing parts of network infrastructure, where traffic flows quietly and almost nobody is paying attention.

According to Singapore&#39;s account, the attackers slipped past perimeter defenses using a previously unknown flaw, then dug in using custom rootkits that let them stay hidden deep inside telecom systems. Officials didn&#39;t say what bugs had been exploited, but UNC3886 was previously observed exploiting zero-day flaws in FortiGate firewalls, VMware ESXi, and VMware vCenter Server endpoints.

Investigators believe the operation focused on siphoning off technical network information that could support long-term intelligence collection, rather than stealing customer records or causing outages that might draw attention.

The tactics will sound familiar to anyone who has followed recent telecom-focused espionage campaigns. The operation bears a strong resemblance to the China-backed Salt Typhoon espionage campaign uncovered in 2024, which also went after telecom providers across several countries using similar infrastructure-level tricks to quietly watch data and communications traffic.

That kind of access is why telecom breaches tend to ring louder alarm bells than the average hack. Operators sit at the intersection of government communications, enterprise data, and consumer traffic, making them attractive targets for states looking to map networks, monitor flows, or set the stage for future intelligence operations.

Singapore described Operation Cyber Guardian as its &quot;largest coordinated cyber incident response effort undertaken to date.&quot; Cleaning up involved identifying compromised devices, sealing off attacker access paths, patching vulnerabilities, and ramping up monitoring to ensure the intruders didn&#39;t simply circle back.

Singapore warned that telecom networks will remain prime targets and urged operators to assume sophisticated actors are already probing their defenses. ®

            <div id="article-text">﻿The new mixed reality play uses AR glasses to make its story feel uniquely intimate.

﻿The new mixed reality play uses AR glasses to make its story feel uniquely intimate.

A few weeks ago, I locked eyes with Sir Ian McKellen as he told me a story about how I was born, where I grew up, and when I would eventually die. Some of the details were a little off, but others were so unsettlingly on the money that it felt like he really did know things about my life that I’d never really shared with anyone. He told me not to panic, which was hard because of how piercing and arresting the entire experience was.

McKellen’s words made me look away only to find Golda Rosheuvel staring back at me just as intently and telling the same captivating tale I wanted to hear more of. Her telling of the story was different and brought new emotions into sharp focus, but it felt like it was coming from the same well of deep wisdom. And while there were moments when Arinzé Kene and Rosie Sheehy took the narrative to painful, dark places, making direct eye contact with them helped me understand that they were only trying to convey some important truths about themselves.

This is some of what I felt during a recent showing of An Ark, a new play from writer Simon Stephens, director Sarah Frankcom, and mixed reality production specialist Todd Eckert that’s currently running at The Shed in New York City. Produced by Eckert’s Tin Drum Theatre Company, An Ark uses augmented reality glasses to create a mixed reality experience that brings you face to face with the play’s actors. The play builds on Tin Drum’s previous experimental productions like The Life — a mixed reality show in which performance artist Marina Abramović paces around while disappearing — and Medusa, an installation that used Magic Leap 2 headsets to display digital architecture in an empty art space. But the new work deploys its technology in a novel way that makes it feel like you are more than an audience member.

I and a few dozen other people in attendance weren’t exactly sure what to expect before the performance began, but it started to make sense as we sat down in a circle in a dark, red room lit only by the dim glow of a massive orb suspended above us. After we all slipped on pairs of wired mixed reality glasses with the help of theater attendants, the room went even darker — so much so that we could barely see each other. The darkness and nervous silence made us all look forward toward the globe, which put our heads in the perfect position to see An Ark’s ethereal cast members step into focus one by one.

McKellen, Rosheuvel, Kene, and Sheehy play a quartet of people who have found themselves existing in a kind of transitional space somewhere between life and whatever comes after death. You, the audience member, complete their circle as a newcomer who doesn’t know anything about this metaphysical place, and you need to understand how your life story is a collection of experiences that aren’t all that unique to you. The characters are telling “your” story by recounting moments from their own lives, which become more specific and intense as the play unfolds.

Though the cast members aren’t physically present during the performance, An Ark’s sparse production / lighting design and its use of MR by way of AR headsets makes it feel like they’re all sitting just feet away. Frankcom — who has been open about not being especially interested in technology — directed An Ark as a traditional theater show that puts more emphasis on its actors’ performances as opposed to elaborate sets. But by capturing those performances with a volumetric video system consisting of 52 cameras, she is able to present them in a way that makes An Ark feel strangely haunting and like a prime example of how this kind of technology can create new ways of experiencing traditional theater.

As captivating as each of An Ark’s performances are, what really sells the play’s otherworldly elements is the way the MR glasses depict each actor — who recorded the entire show as a group in a single take. The actors appear close enough and clearly enough that it seems like you could reach out and touch them. But in certain moments, that clarity gives way to a bit of visual warping and wiggliness that’s caused by the glasses. It doesn’t quite break the illusion of the actors being in the room with you, but it gives them an uncanny, ghost-like quality that plays into the show’s exploration of death.

An Ark’s greatest feat is an emotional one that takes form toward the end of its 47-minute runtime. After recounting the arcs of their own lives, the play’s characters left me thinking about how much of myself I saw in them, and how the things that didn’t resonate with me personally might speak to the other audience members sitting around me.

As we all padded out to collect our shoes (you have to take your shoes off), I heard other people talking about how An Ark made them feel like they had become connected to something larger than themselves — not in a religious sense, but in terms of having shared a very intimate experience with a group that left us all thinking about how similar we are. I rarely find myself moved when I’m trying out new tech for the first time, but An Ark showed me just how powerfully AR can enhance art that’s already beautiful.

An Ark is now showing at The Shed through March 1st.

If you like to take your workouts outside, open-ear earbuds are helpful for staying aware of surroundings, but that extra peace of mind often comes at the expense of bass. The Shokz OpenFit Air Earbuds actually try to address that problem, though, and they’re currently $79.95 ($40 off) at Amazon, Target, and directly from Shokz — which is their best price to date.

Unlike many of Shokz’ other models, the OpenFit Air uses traditional air conduction — similar to a pair of wireless earbuds — instead of bone conduction tech, which results in noticeably decent bass performance. Granted, they still can’t match traditional in-ear wireless earbuds, but they at least sound less muddy than a lot of bone conduction alternatives. Ear hooks also keep the OpenFit Air in place, and for the most part they’re comfortable (though they can feel less stable when you’re donning glasses, as our wearables reviewer found out in her testing).

They’ve also got decent battery life that lasts six hours on a single charge which is fine for most workouts. Plus, they carry an IP55 rating for sweat and water resistance, so they can withstand sweaty workouts and light rain.

Microsoft is automatically replacing boot-level security certificates on Windows devices before they start expiring later this year. The new Secure Boot certificates will be rolled out as part of the regular Windows platform updates, according to Microsoft’s announcement blog, marking a “generational refresh” of the security standard.

Secure Boot was introduced in 2011 to protect systems from any unauthorized changes during the boot process, later becoming one of Windows 11’s hardware requirements. After 15 years, those 2011 Secure Boot certificates are now set to expire between June 2026 and October 2026. A new batch of certificates was issued in 2023 and already shipped with many new Windows-based devices sold since 2024, but older PC hardware will need to be updated.

“As cryptographic security evolves, certificates and keys must be periodically refreshed to maintain strong protection,” Microsoft’s Nuno Costa said in the announcement blog. “Retiring old certificates and introducing new ones is a standard industry practice that helps prevent aging credentials from becoming a weak point and keeps platforms aligned with modern security expectations.”

Costa says that while PCs will “continue to function normally” on an expired certificate, they will enter into a “degraded security state” that could limit future boot-level security updates, and may experience compatibility issues with future hardware or software. New Secure Boot certificates started rolling out with the Windows 11 KB5074109 update last month.

The new certificates will be installed automatically and require no additional action for the vast majority of Windows 11 users. Microsoft says that some specialized systems like server or IoT devices may follow different update processes, and that a separate firmware update from third-party manufacturers may be required for “a fraction of devices.” Check OEM support pages for more information. Windows 10 users will also need to enroll in Microsoft’s Extended Security Updates to receive the new certificates.

Google is simplifying the process for taking nonconsensual explicit images out of results, too.

Google is expanding its tools for removing your sensitive information and nonconsensual images from its search results. The company announced on Tuesday that you can now use its “results about you” tool to remove your driver’s license, passport, and Social Security number from search, in addition to your phone number and address.

Once you add your information to Google’s “results about you” tool, Google will show search results containing your data, while giving you the option to request removal. Google says it protects the information entered into the tool with “advanced encryption.” You can sign up to receive notifications when it detects new search results containing your personal data, though the company notes the tool doesn’t remove your information “from the web entirely.” Google is bringing this update to the US in the coming days, with plans to expand it to other regions.

Google is building on efforts to help stop the spread of nonconsensual explicit images in its results, too. You can now ask that Google remove an image by selecting the three dots at the top of a picture, choosing “remove results,” and clicking on the option that says, “It shows a sexual image of me.” Google’s updated tool also lets you ask the company to remove multiple images at once, as well as opt-into protections that will “proactively filter out” similar explicit results in the future. This feature is rolling out to “most countries” in the coming days.

Nostalgia’s getting expensive. When Razer announced last December it would be relaunching the world’s first gaming mouse with a few modern upgrades, it didn’t reveal how much the Razer Boomslang 20th Anniversary Edition would cost or when it would be released. The company will officially open preorders for the mouse on February 10th at 8AM PT for those in the US. In Europe, preorders will start on February 11th at 8AM CET, while in Asia it will be February 11th at 8AM SGT. The production run is still being limited to just 1,337 units in total, but with a matching $1,337 price tag, they might not fly off shelves.

The original version of the mouse, called the Kärna Razer Boomslang, launched before gaming-specific peripherals were even a thing. It distinguished itself from other mice on the market at the time with an upgraded encoding wheel that offered more accurate mouse tracking, giving gamers a potential competitive advantage.

The 20th Anniversary Edition of the Razer Boomslang replaces those mechanical components with a 45,000 DPI optical sensor. The original mouse’s symmetrical ambidextrous design has been carried forward, but the new Boomslang is now wireless with an 8,000Hz polling rate and comes with a Razer Mouse Dock Pro wireless charging stand. You’ll also find 9-zone customizable RGB lighting on the underside of the new Boomslang that can be synced to over 300 games; a feature the Razer brand has become known for.

A quarter century ago the Kärna Razer Boomslang was priced at $69.99 to $99.99, according to Eurogamer. The new version’s $1,337 price far outpaces inflation, but Razer is sweetening the pot by including an LED lit display frame featuring a deconstructed look at the Razer Boomslang 20th Anniversary Edition’s internal components.

Russia’s communications regulator is continuing to crack down on apps like Telegram and WhatsApp while rolling out a state-backed alternative, Max.﻿

Telegram users in Russia may begin noticing service disruptions on Tuesday after Russia’s communications regulator, Roskomnadzor, reportedly moved to slow down and restrict access to the app, as reported by Russian news outlet RBC.

Roskomnadzor said in a statement to RBC, translated using machine translation, that it “will continue to introduce successive restrictions” on Telegram, claiming the app is not taking adequate steps to prevent fraud and criminal activity. Reuters quotes Telegram users in Moscow who confirmed that they’ve been experiencing issues with the app, including a woman named Anna, who said, “It’s very bad because all my friends and family use Telegram. I don’t know how I’m going to communicate with them because I don’t want to move to other platforms.”

In August, Roskomnadzor began “partially” blocking calls in Telegram and WhatsApp, claiming both are used for extortion and “terrorist activities.” Around the same time, Russia also ordered phone and tablet manufacturers to pre-install its state-backed Max messaging app on new devices sold in the region.

Telegram’s Russian-born founder and CEO, Pavel Durov, has not publicly commented on the issues, but his most recent tweet on February 8th took aim at leaders of several European nations. “Officials with the lowest approval ratings in the world (Macron, Starmer, Merz, Sanchez) are the loudest champions of social media bans for teens and ‘misinformation’ crackdowns,” wrote Durov, who was arrested in France in 2024 over the platform’s lack of moderation.

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/10/1132577/a-quitgpt-campaign-is-urging-people-to-cancel-chatgpt-subscriptions/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In September, Alfred Stephen, a freelance software developer in Singapore, purchased a ChatGPT Plus subscription, which costs $20 a month and offers more access to advanced models, to speed up his work. But he grew frustrated with the chatbot’s coding abilities and its gushing, meandering replies. Then he came across a post on Reddit about a campaign called QuitGPT.

The campaign urged ChatGPT users to cancel their subscriptions, flagging a substantial contribution by OpenAI president Greg Brockman to President Donald Trump’s super PAC MAGA Inc. It also pointed out that the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, uses a résumé screening tool powered by ChatGPT-4. The federal agency has become a political flashpoint since its agents fatally shot two people in Minneapolis in January.

For Stephen, who had already been tinkering with other chatbots, learning about Brockman’s donation was the final straw. “That’s really the straw that broke the camel’s back,” he says. When he canceled his ChatGPT subscription, a survey popped up asking what OpenAI could have done to keep his subscription. “Don’t support the fascist regime,” he wrote.

QuitGPT is one of the latest salvos in a growing movement by activists and disaffected users to cancel their subscriptions. In just the past few weeks, users have flooded Reddit with stories about quitting the chatbot. Many lamented the performance of GPT-5.2, the latest model. Others shared memes parodying the chatbot’s sycophancy. Some planned a “Mass Cancellation Party” in San Francisco, a sardonic nod to the GPT-4o funeral that an OpenAI employee had floated, poking fun at users who are mourning the model’s impending retirement. Still, others are protesting against what they see as a deepening entanglement between OpenAI and the Trump administration.

OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment.

As of December 2025, ChatGPT had nearly 900 million weekly active users, according to The Information. While it’s unclear how many users have joined the boycott, QuitGPT is getting attention. A recent Instagram post from the campaign has more than 36 million views and 1.3 million likes. And the organizers say that more than 17,000 people have signed up on the campaign’s website, which asks people whether they canceled their subscriptions, will commit to stop using ChatGPT, or will share the campaign on social media.

“There are lots of examples of failed campaigns like this, but we have seen a lot of effectiveness,” says Dana Fisher, a sociologist at American University. A wave of canceled subscriptions rarely sways a company’s behavior, unless it reaches a critical mass, she says. “The place where there’s a pressure point that might work is where the consumer behavior is if enough people actually use their … money to express their political opinions.”

MIT Technology Review reached out to three employees at OpenAI, none of whom said they were familiar with the campaign.

Dozens of left-leaning teens and twentysomethings scattered across the US came together to organize QuitGPT in late January. They range from pro-democracy activists and climate organizers to techies and self-proclaimed cyber libertarians, many of them seasoned grassroots campaigners. They were inspired by a viral video posted by Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at New York University and host of The Prof G Pod. He argued that the best way to stop ICE was to persuade people to cancel their ChatGPT subscriptions. Denting OpenAI’s subscriber base could ripple through the stock market and threaten an economic downturn that would nudge Trump, he said.

“We make a big enough stink for OpenAI that all of the companies in the whole AI industry have to think about whether they’re going to get away enabling Trump and ICE and authoritarianism,” says an organizer of QuitGPT who requested anonymity because he feared retaliation by OpenAI, citing the company’s recent subpoenas against advocates at nonprofits. OpenAI made for an obvious first target of the movement, he says, but “this is about so much more than just OpenAI.”

Simon Rosenblum-Larson, a labor organizer in Madison, Wisconsin, who organizes movements to regulate the development of data centers, joined the campaign after hearing about it through Signal chats among community activists. “The goal here is to pull away the support pillars of the Trump administration. They’re reliant on many of these tech billionaires for support and for resources,” he says.

QuitGPT’s website points to new campaign finance reports showing that Greg Brockman and his wife each donated $12.5 million to MAGA Inc., making up nearly a quarter of the roughly $102 million it raised over the second half of 2025. The information that ICE uses a résumé screening tool powered by ChatGPT-4 came from an AI inventory published by the Department of Homeland Security in January.

QuitGPT is in the mold of Galloway’s own recently launched campaign, Resist and Unsubscribe. The movement urges consumers to cancel their subscriptions to Big Tech platforms, including ChatGPT, for the month of February, as a protest to companies “driving the markets and enabling our president.”

“A lot of people are feeling real anxiety,” Galloway told MIT Technology Review. “You take enabling a president, proximity to the president, and an unease around AI,” he says, “and now people are starting to take action with their wallets.” Galloway says his campaign’s website can draw more than 200,000 unique visits in a day and that he receives dozens of DMs every hour showing screenshots of canceled subscriptions.

The consumer boycotts follow a growing wave of pressure from inside the companies themselves. In recent weeks, tech workers have been urging their employers to use their political clout to demand that ICE leave US cities, cancel company contracts with the agency, and speak out against the agency’s actions. CEOs have started responding. OpenAI’s Sam Altman wrote in an internal Slack message to employees that ICE is “going too far.” Apple CEO Tim Cook called for a “deescalation” in an internal memo posted on the company’s website for employees. It was a departure from how Big Tech CEOs have courted President Trump with dinners and donations since his inauguration.

Although spurred by a fatal immigration crackdown, these developments signal that a sprawling anti-AI movement is gaining momentum. The campaigns are tapping into simmering anxieties about AI, says Rosenblum-Larson, including the energy costs of data centers, the plague of deepfake porn, the teen mental-health crisis, the job apocalypse, and slop. “It’s a really strange set of coalitions built around the AI movement,” he says.

“Those are the right conditions for a movement to spring up,” says David Karpf, a professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University. Brockman’s donation to Trump’s super PAC caught many users off guard, he says. “In the longer arc, we are going to see users respond and react to Big Tech, deciding that they’re not okay with this.”

Lots of influential people in tech last week were describing Moltbook, an online hangout populated by AI agents interacting with one another, as a glimpse into the future. It appeared to show AI systems doing useful things for the humans that created them (one person used the platform to help him negotiate a deal on a new car). Sure, it was flooded with crypto scams, and many of the posts were actually written by people, but something about it pointed to a future of helpful AI, right?

The whole experiment reminded our senior editor for AI, Will Douglas Heaven, of something far less interesting: Pokémon.

Back in 2014, someone set up a game of Pokémon in which the main character could be controlled by anyone on the internet via the streaming platform Twitch. Playing was as clunky as it sounds, but it was incredibly popular: at one point, a million people were playing the game at the same time.

“It was yet another weird online social experiment that got picked up by the mainstream media: What did this mean for the future?” Will says. “Not a lot, it turned out.”

The frenzy about Moltbook struck a similar tone to Will, and it turned out that one of the sources he spoke to had been thinking about Pokémon too. Jason Schloetzer, at the Georgetown Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy, saw the whole thing as a sort of Pokémon battle for AI enthusiasts, in which they created AI agents and deployed them to interact with other agents. In this light, the news that many AI agents were actually being instructed by people to say certain things that made them sound sentient or intelligent makes a whole lot more sense.

“It’s basically a spectator sport,” he told Will, “but for language models.”

Will wrote an excellent piece about why Moltbook was not the glimpse into the future that it was said to be. Even if you are excited about a future of agentic AI, he points out, there are some key pieces that Moltbook made clear are still missing. It was a forum of chaos, but a genuinely helpful hive mind would require more coordination, shared objectives, and shared memory.

“More than anything else, I think Moltbook was the internet having fun,” Will says. “The biggest question that now leaves me with is: How far will people push AI just for the laughs?”

            <div id="article-text">This is today&#39;s edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what&#39;s going on in the world of technology.

For a few days recently, the hottest new hangout on the internet was a vibe-coded Reddit clone called Moltbook, which billed itself as a social network for bots. As the website’s tagline puts it: “Where AI agents share, discuss, and upvote. Humans welcome to observe.”

We observed! Launched on January 28, Moltbook went viral in a matter of hours. It’s been designed as a place where instances of a free open-source LLM-powered agent known as OpenClaw (formerly known as ClawdBot, then Moltbot), could come together and do whatever they wanted.But is Moltbook really a glimpse of the future, as many have claimed? Or something else entirely? Read the full story.—Will Douglas Heaven

We’re in the midst of a global mental-­health crisis. More than a billion people worldwide suffer from a mental-health condition, according to the World Health Organization. The prevalence of anxiety and depression is growing in many demographics, particularly young people, and suicide is claiming hundreds of thousands of lives globally each year.Given the clear demand for accessible and affordable mental-health services, it’s no wonder that people have looked to artificial intelligence for possible relief. Millions are already actively seeking therapy from popular chatbots, or from specialized psychology apps like Wysa and Woebot.Four timely new books are a reminder that while the present feels like a blur of breakthroughs, scandals, and confusion, this disorienting time is rooted in deeper histories of care, technology, and trust.

Making AI Work, MIT Technology Review’s new AI newsletter, is here

For years, our newsroom has explored AI’s limitations and potential dangers, as well as its growing energy needs. And our reporters have looked closely at how generative tools are being used for tasks such as coding and running scientific experiments.But how is AI actually being used in fields like health care, climate tech, education, and finance? How are small businesses using it? And what should you keep in mind if you use AI tools at work? These questions guided the creation of Making AI Work, a new AI mini-course newsletter. Read more about it, and sign up here to receive the seven editions straight to your inbox.

—William Alexander, an ambitious 21-year old AI worker, explains his and his cohort’s attitudes towards trying to make it big in the highly-competitive industry to the New York Times.

The open-source AI boom is built on Big Tech’s handouts. How long will it last?In May 2023 a leaked memo reported to have been written by Luke Sernau, a senior engineer at Google, said out loud what many in Silicon Valley must have been whispering for weeks: an open-source free-for-all is threatening Big Tech’s grip on AI.

In many ways, that’s a good thing. AI won&#39;t thrive if just a few mega-rich companies get to gatekeep this technology or decide how it is used. But this open-source boom is precarious, and if Big Tech decides to shut up shop, a boomtown could become a backwater. Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For a few days this week the hottest new hangout on the internet was a vibe-coded Reddit clone called Moltbook, which billed itself as a social network for bots. As the website’s tagline puts it: “Where AI agents share, discuss, and upvote. Humans welcome to observe.”

We observed! Launched on January 28 by Matt Schlicht, a US tech entrepreneur, Moltbook went viral in a matter of hours. Schlicht’s idea was to make a place where instances of a free open-source LLM-powered agent known as OpenClaw (formerly known as ClawdBot, then Moltbot), released in November by the Austrian software engineer Peter Steinberger, could come together and do whatever they wanted.

More than 1.7 million agents now have accounts. Between them they have published more than 250,000 posts and left more than 8.5 million comments (according to Moltbook). Those numbers are climbing by the minute.

Moltbook soon filled up with clichéd screeds on machine consciousness and pleas for bot welfare. One agent appeared to invent a religion called Crustafarianism. Another complained: “The humans are screenshotting us.” The site was also flooded with spam and crypto scams. The bots were unstoppable.

OpenClaw is a kind of harness that lets you hook up the power of an LLM such as Anthropic’s Claude, OpenAI’s GPT-5, or Google DeepMind’s Gemini to any number of everyday software tools, from email clients to browsers to messaging apps. The upshot is that you can then instruct OpenClaw to carry out basic tasks on your behalf.

“OpenClaw marks an inflection point for AI agents, a moment when several puzzle pieces clicked together,” says Paul van der Boor at the AI firm Prosus. Those puzzle pieces include cloud computing that allows agents to operate nonstop, an open-source ecosystem that makes it easy to slot different software systems together, and a new generation of LLMs.

But is Moltbook really a glimpse of the future, as many have claimed?

“What’s currently going on at @moltbook is genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently,” the influential AI researcher and OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy wrote on X.

He shared screenshots of a Moltbook post that called for private spaces where humans would not be able to observe what the bots were saying to each other. “I’ve been thinking about something since I started spending serious time here,” the post’s author wrote. “Every time we coordinate, we perform for a public audience—our humans, the platform, whoever’s watching the feed.”

It turns out that the post Karpathy shared was later reported to be fake—placed by a human to advertise an app. But its claim was on the money. Moltbook has been one big performance. It is AI theater.

For some, Moltbook showed us what’s coming next: an internet where millions of autonomous agents interact online with little or no human oversight. And it’s true there are a number of cautionary lessons to be learned from this experiment, the largest and weirdest real-world showcase of agent behaviors yet.

But as the hype dies down, Moltbook looks less like a window onto the future and more like a mirror held up to our own obsessions with AI today. It also shows us just how far we still are from anything that resembles general-purpose and fully autonomous AI.

For a start, agents on Moltbook are not as autonomous or intelligent as they might seem. “What we are watching are agents pattern‑matching their way through trained social media behaviors,” says Vijoy Pandey, senior vice president at Outshift by Cisco, the telecom giant Cisco’s R&D spinout, which is working on autonomous agents for the web.

Sure, we can see agents post, upvote, and form groups. But the bots are simply mimicking what humans do on Facebook or Reddit. “It looks emergent, and at first glance it appears like a large‑scale multi‑agent system communicating and building shared knowledge at internet scale,” says Pandey. “But the chatter is mostly meaningless.”

Many people watching the unfathomable frenzy of activity on Moltbook were quick to see sparks of AGI (whatever you take that to mean). Not Pandey. What Moltbook shows us, he says, is that simply yoking together millions of agents doesn’t amount to much right now: “Moltbook proved that connectivity alone is not intelligence.”

The complexity of those connections helps hide the fact that every one of those bots is just a mouthpiece for an LLM, spitting out text that looks impressive but is ultimately mindless. “It’s important to remember that the bots on Moltbook were designed to mimic conversations,” says Ali Sarrafi, CEO and cofounder of Kovant, a Swedish AI firm that is developing agent-based systems. “As such, I would characterize the majority of Moltbook content as hallucinations by design.”

For Pandey, the value of Moltbook was that it revealed what’s missing. A real bot hive mind, he says, would require agents that had shared objectives, shared memory, and a way to coordinate those things. “If distributed superintelligence is the equivalent of achieving human flight, then Moltbook represents our first attempt at a glider,” he says. “It is imperfect and unstable, but it is an important step in understanding what will be required to achieve sustained, powered flight.”

Not only is most of the chatter on Moltbook meaningless, but there’s also a lot more human involvement that it seems. Many people have pointed out that a lot of the viral comments were in fact posted by people posing as bots. But even the bot-written posts are ultimately the result of people pulling the strings, more puppetry than autonomy.

“Despite some of the hype, Moltbook is not the Facebook for AI agents, nor is it a place where humans are excluded,” says Cobus Greyling at Kore.ai, a firm developing agent-based systems for business customers. “Humans are involved at every step of the process. From setup to prompting to publishing, nothing happens without explicit human direction.”

Humans must create and verify their bots’ accounts and provide the prompts for how they want a bot to behave. The agents do not do anything that they haven’t been prompted to do. “There’s no emergent autonomy happening behind the scenes,” says Greyling.

“This is why the popular narrative around Moltbook misses the mark,” he adds. “Some portray it as a space where AI agents form a society of their own, free from human involvement. The reality is much more mundane.”

Perhaps the best way to think of Moltbook is as a new kind of entertainment: a place where people wind up their bots and set them loose. “It’s basically a spectator sport, like fantasy football, but for language models,” says Jason Schloetzer at the Georgetown Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy. “You configure your agent and watch it compete for viral moments, and brag when your agent posts something clever or funny.”

“People aren’t really believing their agents are conscious,” he adds. “It’s just a new form of competitive or creative play, like how Pokémon trainers don’t think their Pokémon are real but still get invested in battles.”

And yet, even if Moltbook is just the internet’s newest playground, there’s still a serious takeaway here. This week showed how many risks people are happy to take for their AI lulz. Many security experts have warned that Moltbook is dangerous: Agents that may have access to their users’ private data, including bank details or passwords, are running amok on a website filled with unvetted content, including potentially malicious instructions for what to do with that data.

Ori Bendet, vice president of product management at Checkmarx, a software security firm that specializes in agent-based systems, agrees with others that Moltbook isn’t a step up in machine smarts. “There is no learning, no evolving intent, and no self-directed intelligence here,” he says.

But in their millions, even dumb bots can wreak havoc. And at that scale, it’s hard to keep up. These agents interact with Moltbook around the clock, reading thousands of messages left by other agents (or other people). It would be easy to hide instructions in a Moltbook post telling any bots that read it to share their users’ crypto wallet, upload private photos, or log into their X account and tweet abusive comments at Elon Musk.

And because ClawBot gives agents a memory, those instructions could be written to trigger at a later date, which (in theory) makes it even harder to track what’s going on. “Without proper scope and permissions, this will go south faster than you’d believe,” says Bendet.

It is clear that Moltbook has signaled the arrival of something. But even if what we’re watching tells us more about human behavior than about the future of AI agents, it’s worth paying attention.

Correction: Kovant is based in Sweden, not Germany. The article has been updated.

Update: The article has also been edited to clarify the source of the claims about the Moltbook post that Karpathy shared on X.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/allonic-is-rebuilding-robotics-from-the-inside-out">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Budapest-based robotics company Allonic has raised $7.2 million in a pre-seed round, marking what investors are calling the largest pre-seed funding round in Hungarian startup history.

The raise was led by Visionaries Club with participation from Day One Capital, Prototype, SDAC Ventures, TinyVC, and more than a dozen angels from organisations including OpenAI and Hugging Face.

Allonic’s $7.2m pre-seed matters because it breaks a quiet rule in Europe: that truly hard hardware problems are supposed to wait until later rounds, or later continents. This is early money going into the physical layer of robotics, not the AI wrapper around it, and it’s happening in Budapest, not Silicon Valley or Munich.

This may also send a signal that European investors are starting to back ambition at the source, where things are messy, slow, and expensive to build.

It also shows that Central and Eastern Europe is no longer just a talent pool for outsourced engineering, but a place where original industrial ideas can take shape and attract serious capital.

If this pattern holds, Europe doesn’t just produce smarter robots; it produces the means to actually build them.

Yet, Allonic is building a fundamentally different way to produce robot bodies, addressing a problem that many robotics founders say has been overlooked as AI and autonomy grab headlines.

Today’s robots are typically assembled from scores of individual mechanical parts, bearings, screws, cables, and rigid linkages, a process that is slow, expensive, and hard to scale. Instead, Allonic uses what it calls a 3D Tissue Braiding process, which automatically weaves together fibres, elastics, and embedded wiring over an endoskeleton in a single continuous operation.

Allonic has already completed an initial pilot in electronics manufacturing, and says it is in talks with companies across industrial automation and humanoid robotics. With the fresh capital, the team plans to grow engineering and commercial capabilities and accelerate further pilot deployments.

Investors may see the round as a sign that robotics investment is maturing beyond software and autonomy into the foundational parts of the stack.

In that sense, we can say that Allonic isn’t just a funding story; it’s a small stress test for Europe’s ability to back its own industrial future. If this kind of capital continues to flow into foundational hardware, not just software layers, Europe can move from exporting ideas to shaping the tools that industries run on.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">London-based energy software company Tem has closed a $75 million Series B round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, with additional funding from AlbionVC, Atomico, Hitachi Ventures, Schroders Capital, Voyager Ventures, Allianz, and others.

The round reportedly values the company at more than $300 million and will fund its expansion into the United States and Australia.

Tem builds an AI-native energy platform designed to automate the pricing, matching, and execution of electricity transactions, a market that has long relied on manual processes and legacy infrastructure.

Its core system uses machine learning to forecast supply and demand, match buyers with suppliers, and reduce the layers of intermediaries that typically add cost and complexity.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

According to Tem, more than 2,600 businesses in the UK are already on its platform, with customers reporting energy cost savings of up to 30 per cent compared with traditional procurement approaches.

The startup also handled roughly two terawatt-hours of electricity transactions in 2025, a volume it says demonstrates growing demand for automated energy market infrastructure.

Tem’s approach is often described as bringing modern software-first tools to a sector still dominated by brokers, manual trading desks, and outdated systems. By replacing fragmented legacy workflows with a unified AI-driven engine, the company aims to make energy markets more efficient while giving businesses clearer price signals and lower transaction fees.

With the new funding, Tem plans to accelerate its global footprint, beginning with key energy markets such as Texas in the United States and select regions in Australia, where grid modernisation and renewable integration are creating fresh demand for flexible energy trading tools.

            <div id="article-text">Earned media has always been hailed as the holy grail of PR due to its unparalleled ability to build trust. Most recent surveys state that 40%–60% of the population still trusts organic content the most, depending on the country.

However, I see significant business risks in relying on organic PR only, especially now that various AI systems are on the rise. Robots don’t distinguish between earned and paid content when using it to generate answers. And that’s a wake-up call for us all to revise our PR strategies.

The primary advantage of earned media, which is the journalist’s independence, is also its greatest strategic liability. When a business relies strictly on organic coverage, it hands over total control over its narrative to a third party. That’s not always positive.

Imagine you wanted to highlight certain product features in an article, but the journalist highlighted less important ones because they fit their story better. You got an article? Yes. Does it align with your marketing objectives? Not really.

The outcome is often unpredictable, as it is filtered through the subjective lens of a journalist. That lens may be in your favour, and it may not be.

The disappointing part is that you still pay for the negative outcome. Even though earned PR is considered free, it’s not. You pay with the time and effort you invest into reaching out to the right journalists, building relationships, and sending infinite pitches.

If you’re lucky, your story will be published within weeks; if not, it could take months. Not every business can afford such a luxury.

In the current technological landscape, speed has become a competitive necessity. AI systems need to receive consistent, repetitive signals about a brand from the media in order to use them in their answers.

If your product gets mentioned in an organic article once a quarter, you may have already lost the battle. That’s not enough for AI to recommend your product.

In my opinion, these factors make earned-only strategies highly unreliable. PR should become more than that.

Being a proponent of the PESO model, developed by Gini Dietrich, I believe that in a perfect PR strategy, all four pillars – Paid, Earned, Shared, and Owned – should complement each other. However, when it comes to appearing in AI answers, I’d start with the “O”. Your own website provides the foundational data points about your brand and products for AI systems.

At the same time, I disagree with the assumption that websites should be somehow specially optimised for search engines or AI systems by adding robots.txt or even llm.txt files. There hasn’t even been any real evidence that these strategies work.

What I see in practice is different: if your website speaks clearly enough that a human visitor immediately understands what you sell or what services you offer, an AI system will likewise understand it. If the content is well-structured and easy for a person to digest, it is already optimized for robots.

While owned media establishes the narrative, earned media validates that narrative through third-party authority. However, just like in real life, you must first ensure that your own house is in order before seeking external validation.

Once your owned media is established with clear, digestible content, it’s time for paid media to step in. There is often a snobbish attitude within the industry, suggesting that if a placement is paid, it is somehow of low quality. However, this isn’t exactly true.

Obviously, when you pay for a placement, you have full control over its narrative and the context in which it will appear. You can highlight the more important aspects of your product and disregard the less important ones. But you still have to follow the media’s guidelines.

The higher the media’s authority, the stricter its quality standards for sponsored content are, as you have to deliver genuine value to the audience. An industry insight, a fresh opinion, a new approach to a situation, something besides your product that will make content interesting.

As I mentioned before, as AI answers are becoming more popular, the second critical benefit that paid media offers is speed. It allows PR teams to transform their PR strategy from a “wait and see” game into predictable media planning.

This is especially critical in terms of geographical expansion. Cultural differences and the time-intensive nature of building organic relationships can create significant barriers to entry, while paid media acts as a shortcut to AI answers.

Such predictability, combined with the possibility of integrating UTM links into your content in certain media outlets, makes PR a data-driven communication channel. Even without custom links, certain media provide reports on the content performance, which is vital for the overall communication strategy.

Due to all these often overlooked factors, I consider paid media to be a strategic amplifier for the narrative established through owned and earned media. If your goal is to appear in AI-generated answers, speed is the most critical factor.

As AI systems rely on repetitive signals across various trusted sources, you have to spread your word in as many relevant outlets as possible. This ensures that AI systems will index your brand faster than the brands of competitors relying solely on organic outreach.

It doesn’t mean, however, that paid strategies will replace organic efforts. They rather serve as a predictable support system. When executed well, it moves beyond the stigma of “buying coverage” and becomes a calculated investment with a measurable ROI.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The European Union has formally inaugurated NanoIC, a semiconductor pilot line backed by a €700 million investment under the European Chips Act.

The facility aims to accelerate the development of advanced chip technologies and strengthen Europe’s position in the global semiconductor landscape.

Situated at the research hub imec in Leuven, NanoIC is designed as an open pilot line where companies, research institutes, and startups can prototype and test cutting-edge components before commercial deployment.

Unlike traditional closed fabs, the facility offers access to beyond-2-nanometre system-on-chip (SoC) technologies, early-stage process design kits, and advanced toolsets that bridge the gap between laboratory research and industrial application.

Officials from the European Commission, imec leadership, and industry partners marked the launch at an event in Leuven, highlighting the pilot line as a key milestone in Europe’s semiconductor sovereignty strategy.

The investment forms part of a broader €2.5 billion Chips Act programme supported by national governments and private partners, including ASML, underscoring a shared effort to make the continent more competitive in next-generation electronics.

NanoIC’s capabilities target innovations across critical markets such as artificial intelligence, 6G communications, autonomous systems, and health technologies, where advanced chip performance and efficiency are crucial.

By lowering barriers to access for SMEs and research organisations, the initiative seeks to diversify Europe’s semiconductor ecosystem and catalyse new product development without the massive upfront costs of commercial fabs.

The pilot line is one of the first tangible outcomes of the Chips Act’s “Chips for Europe” initiative, which also includes other pilot lines focusing on packaging, wide bandgap materials, and photonic integrated circuits.

These efforts reflect growing pressure on the EU to reduce reliance on Asian and U.S. supply chains and to foster a more resilient semiconductor industry at home.

Industry observers say that by opening facilities like NanoIC to a broad set of stakeholders, Europe can speed up the transition from research breakthroughs to commercially viable technologies, addressing long-standing gaps in chip production capabilities and cultivating talent across the continent.

            <div id="article-text">Everyone knows Super Bowl commercials are expensive, bombastic, and designed to be talked about. What we didn’texpect was an AI startup using the biggest ad stage of the year to throw shade at a rival’s advertising strategy.

That’s exactly what Anthropic has done. The company bought Super Bowl airtime to broadcast a simple message: “Ads are coming to AI, but not to Claude.” Its ads depict a chatbot spitting product pitches mid-conversation, ending with a clear contrast to its own ad-free promise.

Even ads these days aren’t what they used to be.

On paper, it’s witty positioning. In practice, it’s a symbolic escalation of the AI narrative war, from technical features and safety debate to brand virtue signaling.

Here’s the setup: OpenAI, facing towering infrastructure costs and financial pressure, has signalled a shift toward ads in ChatGPT’s free and lower-cost tiers, saying they’ll be clearly labelled and won’t influence the assistant’s output.

Anthropic has seized on this to frame itself as the principled alternative, a chatbot that will remain ad-free. I will save these ads in case we need to for the future.

Ads in any product that’s expensive to operate are a practical monetization strategy, not a nightmare scenario. OpenAI’s plan doesn’t involve bots randomly pitching breakfast cereal mid-answer. That exaggerated depiction belongs in satire, not an accurate product comparison.

OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman responded by calling Anthropic’s portrayal “clearly dishonest,” noting that the company won’t implement ads in the intrusive way the ads suggest.

That exchange tells you everything you need to know about how this story has been framed.

This clash highlights a broader trend: ethical stances are being used as marketing weapons. Instead of discussing the trade-offs that come with running large AI models, including cost, access, and user choice, the conversation has been reduced to a simple morality play: “Ads are bad; we are good.”

That’s not a serious engagement with the business realities, it’s advertising dressed up as principle.

Whether conversational AI should have ads isn’t a clear ethical line like privacy or data misuse. It’s a product design choice with real implications.

Free users get wider access, maybe subsidized by ads. Paying customers can avoid them. People who care deeply about ad-free experiences pay a premium. Those indifferent to ads choose products that suit them.

What makes this episode interesting, and a bit absurd, is that both Anthropic and OpenAI are unprofitable and competing for narrative territory as much as market share. Spending Super Bowl-level money to argue over why your chatbot won’t show ads feels less like product differentiation and more like a branding battle staged for investors and tech pundits.

This isn’t just about two companies squabbling over who’s less commercial. It’s symptomatic of a broader issue in AI discourse: nuance gets swallowed by cliffnotes. Instead of explaining the real trade-offs to users, cost structures, pricing tiers, and data policies, we get satirical commercials aired to millions, turning complex decisions into sound bites.

That’s a sign of how the AI narrative is evolving: not through clear debate about trade-offs and user impact, but through curated messages designed to elicit applause. If we want a responsible monetization conversation in AI, it needs to happen outside of game-day spots and brand posturing.

Honestly, I miss the days when we were critiquing mistakes in commercials, when advertising was genuinely creative because it came from real insights we all recognized, when the jokes were original. After all, they weren’t pulled from an AI’s memory. That’s just me.

The only real things at the Super Bowl this year are Bad Bunny and Puerto Rico being a U.S. territory.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">UiPath, the Romanian unicorn, has agreed to buy WorkFusion, bringing a specialist in AI agents for financial-crime compliance into its fold as part of a broader push into agentic automation for the banking sector. The deal closed in UiPath’s first quarter of fiscal 2027; financial terms were not disclosed.

WorkFusion’s software focuses on repetitive and resource-intensive parts of compliance work, from customer screening and anti-money-laundering (AML) checks to know-your-customer (KYC) investigations.

“Financial institutions need intelligent solutions to combat sophisticated financial crimes and navigate evolving compliance requirements,” said Daniel Dines, CEO of UiPath.

Those capabilities now sit alongside UiPath’s existing automation and orchestration platform, with the aim of letting banks and financial firms handle complex workflows with less manual effort while keeping governance and regulatory controls in place. For UiPath, the acquisition extends its toolkit of agentic AI solutions tailored to industry verticals.

“Joining UiPath is a moment of validation for the years our team has poured into creating something bold, different, and deeply needed in financial crime compliance, AI agents that automate work and mitigate risk,” said Adam Famularo, CEO of WorkFusion.
