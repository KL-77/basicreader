            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Marvel Studios decided to ring in the new year with a fresh trailer for Wonder Man, its eight-episode miniseries premiering later this month on Disney+. Part of the MCU’s Phase Six, the miniseries was created by Destin Daniel Cretton (Shang-Chi and the Legend of Five Rings) and Andrew Guest (Hawkeye), with Guest serving as showrunner.

As previously reported, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II stars as Simon Williams, aka Wonder Man, an actor and stunt person with actual superpowers who decides to audition for the lead role in a superhero TV series—a reboot of an earlier Wonder Man incarnation. Demetrius Grosse plays Simon’s brother, Eric, aka Grim Reaper; Ed Harris plays Simon’s agent, Neal Saroyan; and Arian Moayed plays P. Clearly, an agent with the Department of Damage Control. Lauren Glazier, Josh Gad, Byron Bowers, Bechir Sylvain, and Manny McCord will also appear in as-yet-undisclosed roles

Rounding out the cast is Ben Kingsley, reprising his MCU role as failed actor Trevor Slattery. You may recall Slattery from 2013’s Iron Man 3, hired by the villain of that film to pretend to be the leader of an international terrorist organization called the Ten Rings.Slattery showed up again in 2021’s Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,rehabilitated after a stint in prison; he helped the titular Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) on his journey to the mythical village of Ta Lo.

A one-minute teaser that leaned into the meta-humor was released just before New York Comic Con last fall, followed by a full trailer during the event itself which mostly laid out the premise as Simon prepared to audition for his dream role. The new trailer repackages some of that footage, except Simon is asked to sign a form stating that he doesn’t have superpowers. The problem is that he does, and the stress of the audition and the acting process itself brings those superpowers to the fore in explosive fashion. So the “Department of Damage Control” naturally declares Simon an “extraordinary threat.”

Wonder Man premieres on Disney+ on January 27, 2026.</div>

            <div id="article-text">It’s a regrettable reality that there is never enough time to cover all the interesting scientific stories we come across each month. In the past, we’ve featured year-end roundups of cool science stories we (almost) missed. This year, we’ve experimented with a monthly collection. December’s list includes a fossilized bird that choked to death on rocks; a double-detonating “superkilonova”; recovering an ancient seafarer’s fingerprint; the biomechanics of kangaroo movement; and cracking a dark matter puzzle that stumped fictional physicists on The Big Bang Theory, among other tantalizing tidbits

Kangaroos and wallabies belong to a class of animals called macropods, with unique form and style of movement. Their four limbs and tail all contact the ground at slow speeds, while they use a hopping gait at higher speeds. Typically, high-speed movements are more energy-intensive than slow-speed motion, but the opposite is true for macropods like kangaroos; somehow the hopping speed and energy cost become uncoupled. According to a paper published in the journal eLife, this may be due to changes in a kangaroo’s posture at higher hopping speeds.

To investigate their hypothesis, the authors used 3D motion capture and data from force plates to create a 3D musculoskeletal model to analyze the motions of red and grey kangaroos, focusing on how body mass and speed influence three factors during hopping: hindlimb posture, efficiency of movement and associated tendon stress; and the ankles. This revealed that kangaroos adjust their posture so that the hindlimbs are more crouched while hopping, with the ankle joint doing most of the work per hop. The crouching position increases energy absorption, thus improving efficiency.

Some 120 million years ago, a tiny bird choked to death on a bunch of small rocks lodged in its throat. Paleontologists recently discovered the fossil among the many specimens housed at the Shandong Tianyu Museum of Nature in China. Not only does it represent a new species—dubbed Chromeornis funkyi, after techno-funk duo Chromeo—the fossilized bird is the first such specimen to be found with a throat filled with stones, according to a paper published in the journal Palaeontologica Electronica.

Certain bird species, like chickens, swallow small stones and store them in their gizzards to help grind up food. The authors examined prior CT scans of fossilized birds with gizzards and quantified how many gizzard stones were present, then compared that data to a CT scan of the C. funkyi fossil. The scan showed that the more than 800 tiny stones lodged in the throat were not gizzard stones. So the bird didn’t swallow the stones to help grind up food. The authors suggest the bird was sick; sick birds will sometimes eat stones. When it tried to regurgitate the stones, they got stuck in the esophagus and the poor bird choked to death.

Back in 2017, astronomers detected a phenomenon known as a “kilonova”: the merger of two neutron stars accompanied by powerful gamma-ray bursts. Recording this kind of celestial event was unprecedented, and it officially marked the dawn of a new era in so-called “multi-messenger astronomy.” It’s the only unambiguously confirmed kilonova to date, but astrophysicists reported evidence of a possible second such event in a paper published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. And it’s unusual because this kilonova may have originated from a supernova blast mere hours before, making it a “superkilonova.”

Supernovae are the spectacular explosions that result from dying massive stars, seeding the universe with heavy elements like carbon and iron. Kilonovae occur when two binary neutron stars begin circling into their death spiral, sending out powerful gravitational waves and stripping neutron-rich matter from each other. Then the stars collide and merge, producing a hot cloud of debris that glows with light of multiple wavelengths. It’s the neutron-rich debris that astronomers believe creates a kilonova’s visible and infrared light—the glow is brighter in the infrared than in the visible spectrum, a distinctive signature that results from heavy elements in the ejecta that block visible light but let the infrared through.

This latest kilonova candidate event, dubbed AT2025ulz, initially looked like the 2017 event, but over time, its properties started resembling a supernova, making it less interesting to many astronomers. But it wasn’t a classic supernova either. So some astronomers kept tracking the event and analyzing combined “multimessenger” data from other collaborations and telescopes during the same time frame. They concluded that this was a multi-stage event: specifically, a supernova gave birth to twin baby neutron stars, which then merged to produce a kilonova. That said, the evidence isn’t quite strong enough to claim this is what definitely happened; astronomers need to find more such superkilnova to confirm.

In the 4th century BCE, an invading mini-armada of about four boats attacked an island off the coast of Denmark. The attack failed and the victorious islanders celebrated by sinking one of the boats, filled with their foes’ weapons, into a bog, where it remained until it was discovered by archaeologists in the 1880s. It’s known as the Hjortspring boat, and archaeologists were recently surprised when their analysis uncovered an intact human fingerprint in the tars used to waterproof the vessel. They described their find in a paper published in the journal PLoS ONE.

The fingerprint is significant because it offers a hint into where those would-be raiders from the sea originally hailed from. Prior scholars had suggested they came from somewhere near what is now Hamburg, Germany. But the authors of this latest paper noticed that the waterproofing tars were pine pitch, concluding that the raiders may have originated in the coastal regions of the Baltic Sea, along which pine-rich forests flourished. That would require the raiders to travel over hundreds of kilometers of open sea. The authors hope they can extract some ancient DNA from the tar to learn more about the ancient people who built the boat.

Speaking of ancient fingerprints, archaeologists at the University of York found finger marks and fingerprints preserved in hardened gypsum used by Romans in Britain in their funerary practices in the third and fourth centuries CE. The university is home to the Seeing the Dead project, which studies the bodies preserved by pouring liquid gypsum (plaster of paris) over them in their coffins prior to burial. The gypsum hardened around the decomposing bodies, creating a cavity while preserving clear imprints of the body contours, clothing, and shrouding. It’s similar to the method used to create casts of the victims of Pompeii.

Some 70 gypsum burials have been found in Yorkshire thus far. In this case, researchers were examining a stone sarcophagus excavated in the 1870s that had yet to be analyzed. While cleaning the artifact and subjecting it to 3D scanning, they noticed a handprint with fingers clearly delineated in the hardened gypsum. They also found distinct fingerprints close to the edges of the coffin. The team had previously thought that the gypsum was heated to at least 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) before being poured over the body, but the handprint and fingerprints suggests someone had smoothed the gypsum over the body by hand, suggesting significantly cooler temperatures. While acknowledging it’s a long shot, the team hopes to extract DNA samples from the sarcophagus which might enable them to determine genetic sex.

Young adulthood in the 2020s is fraught with a range of interconnected pressures: soaring cost of living, student loan debt, pressure to excel academically, and an “always on” digital culture, to name a few of the most common stressors. This in turn can lead to burnout. Perhaps playing video games can help—the right kind of video games, like Super Mario Bros. or Yoshi., as opposed to dystopian survival horror games or highly competitive multiplayer games. According to a study published in the journal JMIR Serious Games, Super Mario Bros. and Yoshi can help young adults recapture childlike wonder and reduce stress and anxiety that can lead to burnout.

The authors employed a mixed-methods approach for their study. First, they collected qualitative data from 41 college-aged subjects via in-depth interviews; all were experienced players of those two games. They followed this with a cross-sectional survey to collect quantitative data from 336 players. The resulting analysis showed that those who felt greater childlike wonder while playing also reported higher overall happiness; and the happiest players showed significantly lower risk of burnout. “By moving beyond escapism and nostalgia, [this study] offers a new perspective on how well-designed, globally familiar games can function as accessible, resilience-building digital microenvironments,” the authors concluded.

Physicists may have had mixed feelings about The Big Bang Theory‘s depiction of their profession, but one thing the sitcom consistently got right was the equations featured on the ubiquitous white board—clever Easter eggs for physicists, courtesy of science advisor David Saltzberg. In one episode, Sheldon and Leonard are pondering an equation about how axions are generated from the sun—part of the duo’s efforts to estimate the likelihood of detecting axions produced by a fusion reactor. Leonard and Sheldon failed on that point, but real-world physicists think they’ve now cracked the case, according to a paper published in the Journal of High Energy Physics.

Axions are hypothetical particles that could explain dark matter— the mysterious substance that comprises about 23 percent of all the mass in our universe—and represent a theoretical alternative to WIMPs, which thus far have eluded detection by physicists. Particles can exhibit wavelike behavior as well as particle characteristics. So an axion would behave more like a wave (or wave packet) than a particle, and the size of the wave packets is inversely proportional to their mass. That means these very light particles don’t necessarily need to be tiny. The downside is that they interact even more weakly with regular matter than WIMPS, so they cannot be produced in large colliders.

So physicists have been developing all kinds of smaller experiments for detecting axions, from atomic clocks and resonating bars, to shining lasers at walls on the off-chance a bit of dark matter seeps through the other side. Co-author Jure Zupan of the University of Cincinnati and colleagues proposed that axions could be produced by a fusion reactor powered by deuterium and tritium contained in a lithium-lined vessel. Among the fusion byproducts of such a reactor would be a large flux of neutrons which would interact with materials in the walls, or collide with other particles, thereby releasing energy and creating new particles: possibly axions or axion-like particles.

            <h2>“Streaming stops feeling infinite”: What subscribers can expect in 2026</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-01</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/streaming-stops-feeling-infinite-what-subscribers-can-expect-in-2026/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We’re far from streaming’s original promise: instant access to beloved and undiscovered titles without the burden of ads, bundled services, or price gouging that have long been associated with cable.

Still, every year we get more dependent on streaming for entertainment. Despite streaming services’ flaws, many of us are bound to keep subscribing to at least one service next year. Here’s what we can expect in 2026 and beyond.

There’s virtually no hope of streaming subscription prices plateauing in 2026. Streaming companies continue to face challenges as content production and licensing costs rise, and it’s often easier to get current customers to pay slightly more than to acquire new subscribers. Meanwhile, many streaming companies are still struggling with profitability and revenue after spending years focusing on winning subscribers with content.

“We see many services are only now aligning content spend with realistic lifetime value per subscriber,” Christofer Hamilton, industry insights manager at streaming analyst Parrot Analytics, told Ars.

Companies may get more creative with how they frame higher costs to subscribers, however. People who pay extra to stream without ads are the most likely to see price bumps as streaming companies continue pushing customers toward ad-based tiers.

Charging more for “premium” features—such as 4K streaming, simultaneous streams, or offline downloads—offers another way for streaming companies to boost revenue without implementing broad price hikes that risk provoking customer outrage. Subscribers can expect streaming prices to get “more menu-like next year,” said Michael Goodman, director of entertainment research at Parks Associates, a research firm focusing on IoT, consumer electronics, and entertainment.

If streaming prices won’t stop rising next year, when will they?

Ultimately, it may be up to subscribers to vote with their dollars by canceling subscriptions or opting for cheaper or free alternatives, such as FAST (free ad-supported streaming television) channels with linear programming.

As Goodman put it, “Until we see net adds stall or decline as a result of price hikes, services have no incentive to stop raising prices.”

Some experts doubt that streaming services will ever willingly stop increasing prices. Bill Yousman, professor and director of the Media Literacy and Digital Culture graduate program at Sacred Heart University, sees precedent for this in cable companies.

“If the big streaming companies had their way, there would be no limit to their price hikes. We have already seen this with the cable monopolies and their disregard for consumer dissatisfaction,” he said.

Yousman believes that prices will only “be brought under control if there is some type of government regulation,” but he noted that’s unlikely under the Trump administration.

To date, US lawmakers haven’t shown interest in halting the steady rise of streaming prices. Most lawmakers who have sought to regulate the industry have focused on industry consolidation. There has been some effort from lawmakers to rein in streaming price hikes, though, especially through proposed federal legislation dubbed the Price Gouging Prevention Act.

Companies will look to leverage subscribers’ frustration with pricing by being more aggressive about bundling third-party services like traditional pay TV, Internet, and cell phone service with streaming subscriptions. The idea is that people are less likely to cancel a streaming subscription if it’s tied to a different subscription (including another streaming subscription). The strategy echoes the days of cable, when some people kept unused landlines just to save money on cable channels or Internet service.

“For subscribers, 2026 is the year streaming stops feeling infinite and starts feeling more like premium cable used to: fewer apps, clearer bundles, and higher expectations for each service they pay for,” Parrot’s Hamilton said.

Thanks to traditional pay TV providers, bundles have a bad connotation among people looking to save money and simplify their subscriptions. But bundling doesn’t always have to be a bad thing, as Yousman explains:

If the companies wanted to really be responsive to consumers, they would let them design their own packages rather than having to choose options that may or may not include all the services they want. What works against this, of course, is the demand for ever-increasing profits at all times.

Should a sale of Warner Bros. Discovery’s (WBD’s) HBO Max be completed (late) next year, subscribers will face more pressure to bundle their streaming subscriptions.

“When dominant platforms like Netflix or Paramount absorb major content players, it accelerates the erosion of streaming’s original promise: freedom from monopolistic bundles,” Vikrant Mathur, co-founder of streaming technology provider Future Today, said.

WBD announced plans this month to sell its streaming and movie studios business to Netflix for an equity value of $72 billion, or an approximate total enterprise value of $82.7 billion. Paramount Skydance, however, quickly swooped in with a hostile takeover bid for all of WBD, including its cable channels, for $108.4 billion. A WBD shareholder vote will occur in spring or early summer, chairman Samuel Di Piazza told CNBC. By the end of 2026, we should have a clearer understanding of the future of HBO Max, as well as Netflix and Paramount+.

Any acquisition will be subject to regulatory scrutiny, causing more uncertainty for subscribers. If Netflix buys HBO Max, users of both services can expect higher prices due to reduced competition and the extensive amount of content and number of big-budget franchises (including Harry Potter and DC Comics) expected to unite under one platform.

“If Netflix gets [HBO Max] and the WB studios, HBO Max subscribers are more likely to see a smoother transition, strong ongoing investment in premium content, and simpler app/billing integration,” Parks Associates’ Goodman said.

But while the potential merger is worth watching, subscribers are unlikely to truly feel the impact of HBO Max potentially changing ownership until after 2026.

“Producing a show is a yearslong process, so the content that was already slated to air isn’t going to disappear, and the new content acquired through the WB library won’t be available until the merger is approved and closes,” Tre Lovell, attorney and owner of Los Angeles entertainment law firm The Lovell Firm, explained.

Looking beyond 2026, a sale of part or all of WBD would likely open the door for more streaming acquisitions. That could eventually benefit customers by making it easier to find content to watch with fewer subscriptions. But merged companies are also less likely to take risks on unique and diverse content.

Analysts I spoke with pointed to fewer niche and mid-tier original shows and movies and more show cancellations if either Netflix or Paramount buys HBO Max. Either buyer would probably focus more on the already-successful franchises that WB owns, such as Game of Thrones, Batman, and Superman.

“Big combined libraries push companies to double down on proven IP because it travels, merchandises, and reduces marketing risk,” said Robert Rosenberg, a partner at the New York law firm Moses Singer focusing on intellectual property, entertainment, technology, and data law.

Rosenberg also expects to see a “tilt toward” live events, sports, and unscripted content “for retention” if HBO Max sells.

In the shorter term, Rory Gooderick, research manager at analyst firm Ampere Analysis, predicted that WBD will be “cautious when greenlighting new large-scale projects until” the acquisition is finalized.

Beyond the potential HBO Max sale, more merger activity could lead to streaming services straying from their original selling point of offering bolder, quirkier content.

As the industry consolidates, “sticky content,” like procedurals, reality shows, and “comfort TV that drives long viewing sessions,” will take priority among mainstream, subscription-based streaming services, especially as they put more emphasis on ad-tier subscriptions, Goodman predicted.

The new year will be formative for streaming and yield lasting impacts for subscribers. We’ve discussed numerous negative implications, but there could be a silver lining. While we may see more turbulence, hopefully, we’ll also start to see a road toward more stable streaming options.

Streaming subscribers can’t directly stop mergers or price hikes or control streaming libraries. But with services like Netflix and Disney+ focusing on becoming one-stop shops with massive libraries, there’s an opportunity for other services to hone their specialties and stand out by providing offbeat, unexpected, and rare content at more affordable prices.

As the landscape settles, streamers should be mindful of the importance of variety to subscribers. According to Bill Michels, chief product officer at Gracenote, Nielsen’s content data business unit:

There will be some consolidation. But the [connected TV] landscape, inclusive of FAST and [direct-to-consumer] channels, provides more than ample video variety for viewers, so the biggest challenge will be connecting content with the right audience. Audience engagement depends on good content. Audience retention depends on making sure audiences are never without something to watch.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Editor’s note: Warning: Although we’ve done our best to avoid spoiling anything too major, please note this list does include a few specific references that some might consider spoiler-y.

It’s been a strange year for movies. Most of the big, splashy tentpole projects proved disappointing, while several more modest films either produced or acquired by streaming platforms—and only briefly released in theaters—wound up making our year-end list. This pattern was not intentional. But streaming platforms have been increasingly moving into the film space with small to medium-sized budgets—i.e., the kind of fare that used to be commonplace but has struggled to compete over the last two decades as blockbusters and elaborate superhero franchises dominated the box office.

Add in lingering superhero fatigue—only one superhero saga made our final list this year—plus Netflix’s controversial bid to acquire Warner Bros., and we just might be approaching a sea change in how movies are made and distributed, and by whom. How this all plays out in the coming year is anybody’s guess.

As always, we’re opting for an unranked list, with the exception of our “year’s best” selection at the very end—this year it’s a three-way tie—so you might look over the variety of genres and options and possibly add surprises to your eventual watchlist. We invite you to head to the comments and add your own favorite films released in 2025.

Ana de Armas proves herself a fierce and lethal adversary against a cultish syndicate in Ballerina—excuse me, From the World of John Wick: Ballerina. Chronologically, Ballerina takes place during the events of John Wick Chapter 3: Parabellum. That film gave us a glimpse into John Wick’s (Keanu Reeves) past as he sought aid from the Ruska Roma crime syndicate, led by the Director (Anjelica Huston), where he was trained as an assassin. The Director also trains girls to be ballerina-assassins, one of whom is Eve Macarro (de Armas).

Like Wick, Eve is driven by a personal vendetta: the brutal murder of her father when she was still a child by highly trained and heavily armed assassins. The Director warns Eve that this is a rogue group of lawless cultists and orders her not to pursue the matter. But vengeance will be Eve’s, no matter the cost, as she hunts down the cultists and their enigmatic leader, the Chancellor (Gabriel Byrne).

Ballerina has all the eye-popping visuals, lavish sets, and spectacularly inventive stuntwork one would expect from a film set in the John Wick universe. It’s more tightly plotted than recent entries in the franchise, and the globe-trotting locations make narrative sense; it’s not just an excuse for staging a spectacle. As always, the fight choreography is perfection. Eve is smaller than most of the men she takes on, but that doesn’t make her any less deadly, particularly when she’s more than willing to fight dirty. A fight scene with dueling flame throwers is one for the ages. Despite a few minor quibbles, Ballerina is an immensely entertaining and action-packed addition to the franchise.

The Baltimorons is a quirky holiday love story about an unlikely pair who find each other by happenstance over the holidays. Didi (Liz Larsen) is a divorced middle-aged dentist whose ex-husband has just gotten married to his much-younger girlfriend—on Christmas eve, no less, so the wedding reception pre-empts Didi’s planned time with her daughter. So she’s on call when a bumbling former improv comedian and recovering alcoholic named Cliff (Michael Strassner) has a dental emergency.

Cliff’s car is towed while she treats him—apparently, this is a regular occurrence—and Didi offers to drive him to the impound lot. They end up going on a quixotic journey around Baltimore, including crashing the family wedding reception and performing at a pop-up improv show, and find themselves drawn together despite their significant age difference.

Director Jay Duplass has a knack for this kind of idiosyncratic fare featuring deeply imperfect yet likable characters, having either written, directed, and/or produced such gems as Safety Not Guaranteed, Horse Girl, Table 19, and Jeff, Who Lives at Home. It falls on Strassner—a Baltimore native who co-wrote the script—and Larsen to carry the film, which they do with considerable charm. You get why Didi and Cliff forge such a bond, even if one questions how long it’s likely to last. The film is also kind of a love letter to Baltimore, aka “Charm City”; if all you know about Baltimore comes from watching The Wire, The Baltimorons will give you a glimpse of the city’s many other neighborhoods and sights.

Auteur director Wes Anderson‘s films have a visual style and tone all their own, and I’ve been a fan of his understated eccentricity since 1998’s Bottle Rocket. OK, 2023’s Asteroid City left me cold, but Anderson returns to top form with The Phoenician Scheme. Benicio del Toro stars as Zsa-Zsa Korda, a 1950s ruthless arms dealer and industrialist who finds himself the target of government assassins—most likely because of his unethical business practices.

He barely survives one attempt ,and a vision of the afterlife convinces Zsa-Zsa that he needs to mend fences with his estranged daughter Liesl (Mia Theapleton), a novice in a convent. He’s also trying to pull off a risky scheme to essentially overhaul the infrastructure of Phoenicia, traveling around the world to meet with investors and convince them to increase their own shares so he can avoid bankruptcy. Liesl joins him on the journey, along with a nerdy Norwegian entomologist named Bjorn (Michael Cera). Wacky hijinks ensue. It has an intricate, sometimes unfocused plot, but Anderson pulls it off with his usual delicate whimsical touch, bolstered by delightfully deadpan performances from the cast.

This sumptuous historical fantasy is adapted from Isabel Greenberg’s lavishly illustrated graphic novel of the same name, which is in turn an inventive twist on One Thousand and One Nights. Maika Monroe plays Cherry, the wife of a wealthy medieval landowner named Jerome (Amir El-Masry), who for some reason has not consummated their marriage. Obsessed with his wife’s fidelity, Jerome makes a wager with his handsome friend Manfred (Nicholas Galitzine) that if Manfred successfully seduces Cherry within 100 days, Jerome will give him both Cherry and his castle.

But Cherry’s maid, Hero (Emma Corrin), secretly loves her lady and thwarts Manfred’s seduction attempts by regaling him with captivating stories every night to keep her mistress from succumbing to temptation. And Manfred is most definitely tempting, dragging a freshly killed deer to the castle while bare-chested and covered in its blood. The costumes, production design, and cinematography are stunning, mirroring Cherry’s gradual sexual awakening via romantic triangle. Add in stellar performances, and this is a sensual fairy tale for the ages.

Thunderbolts* is basically the MCU’s version of The Suicide Squad (2021) with less over-the-top R-rated violence, but it’s just as irreverently entertaining. Black Widow introduced us to Natasha Romanoff’s (Scarlett Johansson) backstory as a child recruited for training as an elite assassin, along with her adoptive sister (and equally lethal assassin) Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh). Thunderbolts* finds Yelena working as a hired mercenary for CIA director Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), but she’s still grieving the loss of Natasha, and her heart just isn’t in it.

Yelena decides to quit, and Valentina asks her to do one last covert mission. It turns out to be a trap: Yelena is attacked by super soldier John Walker (Wyatt Russell), Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko), and Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen). The hope what that they’ll all kill each other and be destroyed along with incriminating evidence—which includes an awkward, nebbishy man in hospital PJs named Bob (Lewis Pullman), who is far more dangerous than he appears. Along with Yelena’s adoptive father, Alexei/Red Guardian (David Harbour), they all team up to take down Valentina instead.

It’s well-plotted and doesn’t take itself too seriously. Director Jake Schreier (Robot & Frank, Beef) expertly balances the action sequences with bantering wisecracks and quieter introspective moments that serve to actually develop the characters, each of whom has their inner demons and plenty of red in their respective ledgers. And Schreier has an incredibly talented cast to work with, all of whom give stellar performances. Thunderbolts* is a refreshing return to peak Marvel form: well-paced, witty, and action-packed with enough heart to ensure you care about the characters.

Director Guillermo del Toro has been telling interviewers for years about his enduring love for Mary Shelley’s classic novel and his long-standing desire to direct a film that would capture the novel’s sense of grand Miltonian tragedy. He called this film “the culmination of a journey that has occupied most of my life.” His Frankenstein is probably the most faithful film adaptation yet made (with a few deviations in later acts), even mirroring Shelley’s narrative structure. It’s first told from the perspective of the captain of an Arctic ship trapped in ice en route to the North Pole who rescues a badly wounded Baron Victor Frankenstein (Oscar Isaac). Both Victor and his Creature (Jacob Elordi) then get to tell their versions of the story that brought them to the Arctic.

Known for his lush visuals and high Gothic sensibility, del Toro doesn’t disappoint, with elaborate sets—Victor’s laboratory is a wonder of 19th-century steampunk industrialism—and an innovative design for the Creature. Del Toro is the perfect conduit for this story of an arrogant scientist who tries to play god by creating a monstrous creature, only to become a monster himself. Isaac brings a blend of passionate intensity and cold ambition to his portrayal of Victor, but it’s Elordi who ultimately anchors the film, conveying the fundamental humanity of Shelley’s iconic monster.

Before The Hunger Games, there was The Long Walk, a 1979 novel by Stephen King (writing as Richard Bachman) about a dystopian alternate history in which one young man from each state in a totalitarian US is chosen to participate in a grueling annual contest. They walk. And walk. And walk. If they drop below 3 MPH or stop to rest, they are executed. They keep walking until only one is left standing as the “winner,” rewarded with whatever he wants for life at a time when the country is mired in a deep economic depression. It’s grim material well-suited for a film adaptation by Francis Lawrence, who has directed every film in The Hunger Games franchise. The dude knows his dystopias.

Cooper Hoffman plays Ray Garraty, a contestant from Maine who volunteers for the walk over the objections of his mother. His first wish, should he win, would be for a rifle to kill the Major (Mark Hamill) in charge of the walk, since the Major had executed his father years before. Ray soon bonds with Pete (David Jonsson), but the stakes become crystal clear when the first walker falls: A boy who develops a charley horse and is summarily shot for sitting down. One by one, each boy falls until just two remain.

Lawrence keeps things tense and starkly minimalistic. There are no elaborate sets or costumes. It’s the interactions between the various walkers that drive the story, punctuated by inevitable deaths. The point is that there is no happy ending, regardless of who technically “wins.” There are some deviations from the novel, but Lawrence retains King’s suitably cryptic (and quite bleak) ending. I’m a fan of Andy Muscietti’s two-part adaptation of IT and Mike Flanagan’s Doctor Sleep, but The Long Walk might just edge them out as the best adaptation of a Stephen King novel yet.

This gem of a film is basically Airplane! meets Agatha Christie meets Downtown Abbey, spoofing all those British aristocratic period dramas we know and love. Set in 1931, the plot centers on a charming orphaned pickpocket named Eric (Ben Radcliffe), who is mistaken for a new employee when he arrives at the titular manor house of Lord and Lady Davenport (Damian Lewis and Katherine Waterson).

Eric ends up leaning into his new role and is soon promoted, even indulging in a forbidden romance with the Davenports’ daughter Rose (Thomasin McKenzie). Then someone gets murdered, and Eric finds himself framed for the killing. It’s up to Inspector Watt (Tom Goodman-Hill) and his magnificent (removable) mustache to solve the mystery. The cast clearly had a blast, and it’s impossible to resist that wickedly dry, often scatalogical British slapstick humor. Fackham Hall is a bright, shiny bauble that will leave you longing for a sequel.

When The Rocky Horror Picture Show premiered in 1975, no one could have dreamed that it would become the longest-running theatrical release film in history—least of all its creator, Richard O’Brien. But that’s what happened as it developed a loyal cult following of fans dressing up in costumes and acting out the lines in front of the big screen, a practice known as shadow casting. Thanks to a killer soundtrack, campy humor, and those devoted fans, Rocky Horror is still a mainstay of midnight movie culture. Richard O’Brien’s son, Linus O’Brien, marked the occasion with his fascinating documentary Strange Journey: The Story of Rocky Horror.

The film has its share of cast reminiscences, but it’s the profound impact Rocky Horror has had over the decades that ultimately shines through—and not just on a broad cultural scale. O’Brien decided to make the film while gathering archival clips of his father’s work. He came across a video clip of “I’m Going Home” and found himself browsing through the comments, deeply touched by the many people, including a soldier in Iraq and a woman grieving the loss of her mother, talking about what the song and film had meant to them.

The film ends with a fan telling Richard O’Brien, “It doesn’t matter what people think about Rocky because it belongs to us, not to you”—and Rocky’s creator agreeing that this was true. You can pair Strange Journey with another film celebrating the milestone anniversary, Sane Inside Insanity: The Phenomenon of Rocky Horror, for a documentary double feature.

I promise you this is not a spoiler, but for anyone too scared to watch Good Boy, the whole point of one of the year’s most original horror movies is that the dog survives. And despite being a “good boy,” from the moment we meet Indy, the dog gives off “final girl” energy, being the only creature in a cursed family house to sense the hauntings that seem to complicate his owner’s illness and drive him closer to death. Relying on lighting tricks and a frenetic, pulsing soundtrack to dramatize scenes where the movie’s star seems to just be acting like a dog, the movie reinvigorates the haunted house story by telling it from a dog’s-eye level and largely obscuring the faces of humans.

Director and co-screenwriter Ben Leonberg told AV Club that he drew this stellar performance out of Indy—who is not a show dog but his own adorable dog—by living in the house where the movie was filmed and building the set around the ways that Indy moved. Come for the pudgy puppy reels, and then be as obedient as Indy and “stay” for the technical feat of watching a man and his best friend turn classic horror devices into dog toys.

Tessa Thompson is luminous in the title role of director Nia DaCosta’s film adaptation of the classic Henrik Ibsen play Hedda Gabler. It’s the story of a general’s daughter who marries a stuffy academic for convenience, believing her wild youth is behind her—only to find it’s not much fun being trapped in a loveless marriage, however elegant the surroundings. When a former lover pops up, now involved with Hedda’s romantic rival, tensions build to an explosive climax. This being Ibsen, things don’t end well for anyone.

DaCosta has kept most of the play’s plot intact, but a clever gender swap makes for an interesting twist on the complicated interpersonal dynamics. Nina Hoss plays novelist and recovering alcoholic Eileen Lovborg (a man named Eilert in the play), with Imogen Poots playing romantic rival Thea. Hedda also maintains a flirtation with the lascivious Judge Brack (Nicholas Pinnock), who is manipulative enough to use Hedda’s weaknesses against her. Hedda is among the greatest dramatic roles in theater, and Thompson utterly makes it her own. Is the film a bit stagey at times? Yes, which isn’t surprising since it’s based on a play. That very staginess gives the film a tight, claustrophobic feel, heightening Hedda’s sense of the walls closing in on her once vibrant youth.

Normally, I’d rather stick hot needles under my fingernails than watch a bio-documentary about a politician, regardless of party affiliation. It’s just not my thing. But we live in interesting times, and The Last Republican is not your standard political documentary. The film follows former Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) over the course of his last year in office. Kinzinger was ousted by his own party for his service on the congressional committee investigating the January 6, 2021, riotous attack on the US Capitol—and for his outspoken denunciation of then-President Donald Trump’s incendiary rhetoric at the instigating rally and delayed action to quell the rioters.

That’s standard documentary fare. But this one was directed by Steve Pink, best known for 2010’s Hot Tub Time Machine (a personal favorite of mine). Pink is (almost) as far apart from Kinzinger politically as it’s possible to be. Kinzinger chose to work with Pink because he, too, loves Hot Tub Time Machine. And a most unlikely friendship was born. You can see their bond in the trailer, which opens with Kinzinger recognizing that the man he has trusted with his story likely has nothing but contempt for Kinzinger’s political views. “That’s kinda mean,” we hear Pink say off-camera, before cheekily asking how one even becomes a Republican, “because I don’t get it.”

That friendship resonates perfectly with the film’s central theme. “It’s not about a political view,” Kinzinger says in the film. “It’s about what it is to turn against everything you’ve ever belonged to because of some red line you can’t cross.” Had there been more principled congressional members like Kinzinger in 2021 willing to put country over party, even if it torched their political careers—and more friendships across political divides finding common ground—the US would be in a very different and better place today. Kinzinger’s closing J6 committee statement is even more relevant four years later: “Oaths matter. Character matters. Truth matters. If we do not renew our faith and commitment to these principles, this great experiment of ours, our shining beacon on a hill, will not endure.”

One of the most terrifying images of 2025 was a mob of kids with their arms extended like airplanes. It came in Weapons, a witchy mystery that begins with every child in a certain middle school teacher’s class suddenly disappearing, except for one, a quiet boy named Alex Lilly. Working off a highly original script and giving an emotional performance that drove some viewers to tears, young actor Cary Christopher wrenches hearts as Alex’s role in the other kids’ disappearance becomes clearer—after the audience meets his Aunt Gladys.

An actual living and breathing nightmare played to unnerving perfection by Amy Madigan, Aunt Gladys reads like voodoo Mary Poppins meets Pennywise the clown. But stuck in the house with this instantly iconic horror character, Alex proves that he’s the most capable caretaker in the family. In the end, he’s the one tasked with helping his aunt “feel better” while spooning as much Campbell’s soup as it takes into the faces of “weaponized” loved ones to ensure they survive Aunt Gladys’ visit.

Dust Bunny is the directorial feature film debut of Bryan Fuller, the creative force behind some of my favorite TV shows over the years, most notably Dead Like Me, Wonderfalls, and Pushing Daisies, as well as Hannibal. Fuller has a knack for injecting elements of magical realism into otherwise ordinary settings, and Dust Bunny adds a healthy dose of horror and Labyrinth-style visual aesthetics into the mix to strike a perfect balance between violence, suspense, whimsy, and emotional depth. Sophie Sloan plays Aurora, a young girl in New York City who turns to her neighbor, Resident 5B (Mads Mikkelson, in a role written specifically for him), for help when (she claims) a monster under her bed kills and eats her parents.

Resident 5B is a hitman for hire, and Aurora wants him to kill the monster in revenge, although he doesn’t think the monster is real, and there are, in fact, other bad people who won’t shirk at going through Aurora to get to Resident 5B. Fun fact: the monster design was inspired by highland cows, although Fuller also asked for the monster to be part hippopotamus and part piranha; artist Jon Wayshak proved well up to the task. Mikkelson and Sigourney Weaver turn in terrific performances—Mikkelson even helped choreograph one of the stunt sequences—as does Sloan and David Dastmalchian. Plus, there’s an entire action sequence featuring a Chinese dragon costume. What more could one want?

Every musical theater fan knows that the second act of a show is almost invariably weaker than the first. Thus, setting the second act of the Wicked musical apart as its own movie was bound to result in a sequel that had trouble living up to last year’s banger-filled mega-hit film.

Wicked: For Good is also where the narrative starts coming apart at the seams a bit, as it necessarily intersects and interacts with the narrative from The Wizard of Oz itself. The leaps of logic necessary to get these “misunderstood” versions of the characters to gel with the ones we see cavorting in that 90-year-old classic are best ignored. But the movie repeatedly throws those connections in our face amid a heavily padded 137-minute runtime that could have easily been half an hour shorter.

Despite it all, though, the quality of the original writing from Stephen Schwartz and Winnie Holzman still shines through. The titular song “For Good” is still an all-time classic, and strong performances carry catchy tunes like “No Good Deed” and “Just for This Moment” (though the latter is robbed of a lot of its inherent sex appeal through some odd directorial choices). Even “The Girl in the Bubble&quot;—a new song created just for the movie–manages to not feel out of place thanks in large part to a winning performance from Ariana Grande and some downright magical camera work.

The worst part of Wicked: For Good, though, might be how its success will almost definitely lead to an expanded Wicked Cinematic Universe, with sequels or prequels that mash these winning characters to death via a bunch of expositional backstory. Let Glinda and Elphaba rest! They’ve earned it!

This was a surprise mega-hit for Netflix, fueled by a killer Korean pop soundtrack featuring one earworm after another that collectively dominated the charts for weeks. K-Pop Demon Hunters is the streaming giant’s most-watched animated film of all time, and that’s not just because of the infectious music—although the music is why Netflix ended up releasing a highly popular singalong version in theaters (after the film racked up huge streaming numbers). The Sony Animation team delivers bold visuals that evoke the look and feel of anime, the plot is briskly paced, and the script strikes a fine balance between humor and heart.

Earth has been protected from demons for generations by a protective barrier called the Honmoon, maintained by musical trios/demon hunters from each generation. One day, the Honmoon will become so strong it will turn “golden” and seal away the demons forever. The latest incarnation of demon hunters—a K-Pop band called Huntr/x—is close to accomplishing the Golden Honmoon.

Rumi (Arden Cho) is the lead singer, Mira (May Hong) is the group’s dancer/choreographer, and American-born Zoey (Ji-young Yoo) is the rapper and lyricist. But Rumi harbors a secret: Her father was a demon, and she is marked by the telltale purple “patterns,” which she keeps hidden from her bandmates. Hoping to destroy the Honmoon once and for all, king of the demons Gwi-Ma sends five of his demons to form a K-pop boy band, the Saja Boys, led by Jinu (Ahn Hyo-seop). Their popularity soon rivals that of Huntr/x and threatens the Honmoon.

Co-director (with Chris Appelhans) Maggie Kang conceived the story and helped write the screenplay, intending the film to be a love letter to K-pop and her Korean roots. But she also drew on traditional Korean mythology and folklore. Those details add a rich layer of texture to the basic storyline. Granted, the film adheres to a familiar formula, but it’s a winning one. K-Pop Demon Hunters‘ unifying message of the power of music to heal, unite, and build community—celebrating honest authenticity rather than striving for impossible perfection—is a powerful one.

28 Years Later could have been terrible, screenwriter Alex Garland told Rolling Stone, if he went with his original idea about a group of military men fighting to stop bad guys from weaponizing the Rage Virus. But director Danny Boyle didn’t let that happen, instead pushing Garland to think small and deliver a powerful coming-of-age story that’s somehow just as intense as 2002’s 28 Days Later without retreading hardly any of the same territory. A story about resisting isolationism, 28 Years Later is set on a small island where a scrappy community has survived for decades after being quarantined from the rest of the world.

The story follows a young boy, Spike, who leaves home with his ailing mother after he learns that he cannot trust his father to look out for them. A fire is lit in Spike to cure his mother, and no human or infected—not the worm-eating chubby ones or the spine-ripping alphas—can put him off his mission. What starts as a ritual hunt to initiate a boy into manhood turns instead into a tender quest to find the only known doctor on the island, allowing Spike to see the infected and his community in a new light.

Featuring nuanced performances equal parts harrowing and endearing from Jodie Comer as the mom, Isla, and Alfie Williams as Spike, the movie explores the folly of societies backsliding from progress out of fear of the unknown. As Spike’s dread of the infected flickers out, it’s replaced by an urgent curiosity about the world beyond his village. The only thing potentially standing in his way of growing as wise as the doctor is a gang of “pals” named Jimmy. “Howzat!” for a setup to get boots marching into theaters to see the second installment of the new trilogy in January?

Director Richard Linklater (Dazed and Confused, Hit Man) had two films released this year. One is Nouvelle Vague, about the 1959 shooting of the seminal French New Wave film Breathless. The other is Blue Moon, about the complicated relationship between lyricist Lorenz Hart and his erstwhile composer partner Richard Rodgers. Both films are exceptional in their own right, but Blue Moon is my choice for our year’s best list. Chalk it up to my enduring fondness for classic Broadway musicals.

The film takes place in Sardi’s restaurant on the opening night of Oklahoma!, which is Rodgers’ (Andrew Scott) first collaboration with a new lyricist, Oscar Hammerstein II (Simon Delaney). Ethan Hawke turns in a powerful performance as Hart, newly (barely) sober and holding court with bartender Eddie (Bobby Cannavale). He’s rather bitter about his own waning career after he refused to collaborate on the new musical. He’s depressed, and Eddie is reluctant to serve him any alcohol, plus the “omnisexual” Hart’s advances toward the comely Elizabeth (Margaret Qualley) are repeatedly rebuffed.

Oklahoma!, of course, was a smash hit, crowning Rodgers and Hammerstein as the new wonder boys of Broadway. A drunken Hart tragically died just a few months later. Blue Moon‘s intimate portrait of Hart on a night that proved to be a critical turning point is a fitting tribute to one of our greatest lyricists, whose personal demons dimmed his light too soon.

Brendan Fraser is experiencing a quiet renaissance, with highly praised recent roles in The Whale and Killers of the Flower Moon, as well as a role in the delightfully bonkers TV series Doom Patrol. Add his gentle, empathetic performance in Rental Family to that list. Fraser plays Phillip Vandarploeug, an American actor living in Japan because he once had great success with a toothpaste commercial. But the roles have dried up, so Phillip signs on with a company called Rental Family, which hires actors as stand-ins for family members or friends. Phillip is the “token white guy.”

It might sound like a cynical premise—the company basically “sells emotion&quot;—but the film is anything but cynical. Phillip ends up developing strong bonds with two of his “clients”: A young Haifa girl named Mia with an absent father and an elderly man with dementia named Kikuo, who happens to be a retired actor. But what happens if they discover the truth? Rental Family is a low-key, thoughtful reflection on loneliness and our human need for social connection. “Sometimes it’s OK to pretend,” Phillip tells Mia at one point. Sometimes faking an emotional connection develops into one that is genuine and lasting.

Hipsters love to sneer at artists like Neil Diamond. He’s dated, his music is cheesy, yada yada yada. But there’s a reason “Sweet Caroline” has become a staple singalong at sporting events, bar mitzvahs, karaoke nights and the like. All that cynicism melts away once the music starts; it’s infectious. Diamond’s music even inspired a popular Milwaukee tribute act in the 1990s and early oughts: Lightning and Thunder. The duo gets their due in the biopic Song Sung Blue, which is in turn based on a 2008 documentary of the same name. (You can watch the documentary on YouTube.) Director Craig Brewer saw the documentary and was inspired to create his own fictionalized account of Thunder and Lightning’s story with all their dramatic ups and downs.

Hugh Jackman plays Vietnam veteran and recovering alcoholic Lightning, aka Mike Sardina, who falls in love with single mom and Patsy Kline impersonator Claire, aka Thunder. She’s the catalyst for their “Neil Diamond experience,” riding the 1990s wave of Diamond’s resurgence while battling both external obstacles and their respective personal demons. The film condenses the timeline and takes some minor liberties here and there, but on the whole it’s quite factually accurate. (The duo really did open for Pearl Jam and Eddie Vedder joined them briefly onstage for “Forever in Blue Jeans.”)

Jackman and Hudson are major film stars but one soon forgets, because they dissolve so completely into their respective roles. Hudson received a well-deserved Golden Globe nomination for her performance and I expect an Oscar nod will be coming her way as well; this is her best role to date by far. And yes, Jackman and Hudson actually perform the songs; Hudson’s solo rendition of “I’ve Been This Way Before” towards the film’s end is gut-punchingly beautiful.

Song Sung Blue is ultimately a love story, but it’s also an homage to the power of music to lift us up even in our darkest hours. On every anniversary of his sobriety, Lightning sings “Song Sung Blue.” Lightning and Thunder pour their souls into even the most seemingly insignificant gigs, whether it’s a hostile crowd in a biker bar or karaoke night at the local Thai restaurant. One of the most moving scenes shows Lightning and the Thai restaurant owner sitting alone in an empty restaurant after the latter’s wife has died of cancer and Lightning is struggling with his own personal tragedy—finding mutual comfort by singing “only sad songs” by Diamond on the karaoke machine.

And now for our top three films of 2025, each so different from one another that we couldn’t bring ourselves to choose just one:

My absolute favorite part of One Battle After Another comes when Leonardo DiCaprio’s character falls off a building. The former revolutionary has let himself go a bit after decades out of the game and can’t keep up with the young skateboarders who effortlessly parkour between buildings during an exciting rooftop chase sequence. One Battle After Another is at its best when it subverts the audience’s expectations like this, boiling down action-thriller set pieces into comically realistic mundanity.

The movie also deserves credit for the subtle way it highlights two very different modes of resistance to a disturbingly familiar fascist government. The flashy French 75 revolutionaries manage to get a lot of attention with their bold statement-making operations, but they do little to actually disrupt the horrifying status quo before getting broken up by law enforcement. Contrast that with Benicio Del Toro’s Sensei Sergio St. Carlos, who quietly operates a sort of underground railroad for actual marginalized immigrants that quietly hides and protects them from an overwhelming government apparatus.

The movie’s plot falls apart a bit near the end as Sean Penn’s cartoonishly evil antagonist hunts down Willa Ferguson’s well-acted “hope for the future” child revolutionary. Still, I’d be lying if I said the inherent tension of the chase didn’t have me on the edge of my seat even after two hours.

Ryan Coogler’s vampire horror film set in the Mississippi Delta in 1932 has topped my list of best films since its April release. Michael B. Jordan delivers an Oscar-worthy dual performance as the Smokestack Twins: Elijah Moore (Smoke) and Elias Moore (Stack). They are World War I veterans just returned from Chicago, having stolen money from a gangster. They use the funds to buy an old sawmill to set up their own juke joint for the local black community. For the band, they recruit their young cousin Sammie (Miles Caton), a preacher’s son and gifted blues musician with a gift so powerful, it just might summon spirits of the past and future to join in the festivities.

The opening night is rollicking along until an Irish vampire named Remmick (Jack O’Connell) crashes the party with his minions, turning the revelers one by one. Can the rest survive until sunrise? There are so many layers to Sinners; it gets richer with each subsequent rewatch. You have the racial conflicts of the Jim Crow South and vigilante Klansmen; Sammie’s love for sexy singer Pearline (Jayme Lawson); Stack’s complicated relationship with his white-passing ex, Mary (Hailee Stanfield); and Smoke’s reunion with his long-suffering wife, Annie (Wunmi Mosaku).

Sinners has drawn comparison to Robert Rodriguez’s From Dusk Till Dawn, and that film is indeed one of many cited influences by Coogler. But this is very much Coogler’s singular vision: alternately steamy, bawdy, raucous, violent, and bloody, fueled by fantastic music. There’s even a cameo by blues legend Buddy Guy in the film’s denouement. Guy was one of several blues musicians who recorded songs for the film. That makes this easily the best soundtrack of 2025 (sorry, K-Pop Demon Hunters, but you know it’s true).

Private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) might just turn out to be Rian Johnson’s greatest creation. Introduced in 2019’s Knives Out, Blanc’s syrupy Southern drawl and idiosyncratic approach to solving a mysterious New England death charmed audiences worldwide and launched a modern whodunnit franchise. The latest installment is Wake Up Dead Man, in which Blanc tackles the strange death of a fire-and-brimstone parish priest, Monseigneur Jefferson Wicks (Josh Brolin). Wick inspired a cult-like loyalty in his central flock while alienating any newcomers. The primary suspect is a young new priest, Rev. Jud Duplenticy (Josh O’Connor) who steadfastly maintains his innocence, despite openly clashing with the Monseigneur.

Wake Up Dead Man is a classic locked-room mystery in a spookily Gothic small-town setting, and Johnson repeatedly namechecks John Dickson Carr’s The Hollow Man, widely held to be the most masterful take on the genre. So if you’ve read The Hollow Man, you’ll probably figure out the “howdunnit” pretty easily. Fortunately, there’s still plenty of twists and turns regarding the who and the why of the matter to keep us guessing right up until the end. Johnson always assembles terrific casts for these films, and the characters are always colorful and engaging. But Wake Up Dead Man digs a little deeper, allowing the characters to achieve some personal insight and growth as the mystery unfolds.

The broody church setting isn’t just for atmosphere, either. Sure, this is primarily a murder mystery, but thematically, it explores the nature of both faith and reason, as embodied by Duplenticy and Blanc, respectively, without ridiculing or diminishing either. One Battle After Another might be poised for the strongest Oscar showing, but Wake Up Dead Man is pure pleasure. This third installment rivals the original Knives Out for fascinating characters, atmospheric setting, and sheer plot ingenuity. We can’t wait to see what Blanc gets up to next.</div>

            <h2>Here we go again: Retiring coal plant forced to stay open by Trump Admin</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-31</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/trump-admin-orders-another-coal-plant-to-stay-open/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Tuesday, US Secretary of Energy Chris Wright issued a now familiar order: because of a supposed energy emergency, a coal plant scheduled for closure would be forced to remain open. This time, the order targeted one of the three units present at Craig Station in Colorado, which was scheduled to close at the end of this year. The remaining two units were expected to shut in 2028.

The supposed reason for this order is an emergency caused by a shortage of generating capacity. “The reliable supply of power from the coal plant is essential for keeping the region’s electric grid stable,” according to a statement issued by the Department of Energy. Yet the Colorado Sun notes that Colorado’s Public Utilities Commission had already analyzed the impact of its potential closure, and determined, “Craig Unit 1 is not required for reliability or resource adequacy purposes.”

The order does not require the plant to actually produce electricity; instead, it is ordered to be available in case a shortfall in production occurs. As noted in the Colorado Sun article, actual operation of the plant would potentially violate Colorado laws, which regulate airborne pollution and set limits on greenhouse gas emissions. The cost of maintaining the plant is likely to fall on the local ratepayers, who had already adjusted to the closure plans.

The use of emergency powers by the DOE is authorized under the Federal Power Act, which allows it to order the temporary connection of generation or infrastructure when the US is at war or when “an emergency exists by reason of a sudden increase in the demand for electric energy, or a shortage of electric energy.” It is not at all clear whether “we expect demand to go up in the future,” the DOE’s current rationale, is consistent with that definition of emergency. It is also hard to see how using coal plants complies with other limits placed on the use of these emergency orders:

The Commission shall ensure that such order requires generation, delivery, interchange, or transmission of electric energy only during hours necessary to meet the emergency and serve the public interest, and, to the maximum extent practicable, is consistent with any applicable Federal, State, or local environmental law or regulation and minimizes any adverse environmental impacts.

At the moment, coal-fueled generation is more expensive than anything other than nuclear power, and is far and away the dirtiest form of generation. Its airborne pollution is responsible for a significant number of deaths in the US, and it leaves behind solid waste that is rich in toxic metals. It’s difficult to square those financial and health costs with serving the public interest.

Yet the Trump Administration has relied heavily on declaring energy emergencies in its attempt to keep coal afloat despite the economics. A check of the use of similar emergency orders shows that, in the past year, the Administration has declared 16 energy emergencies—more than the entire total declared between 2008 and 2024.

The Administration’s reliance on this sort of emergency declaration is in the process of being challenged in court, though. Several states and a collection of environmental organizations recently filed a suit that argues that the administration is misusing what’s meant to be a response to temporary emergencies by simply renewing the orders indefinitely, as it has with a coal plant in Michigan that has been forced to remain open well past the summer demand surge that the DOE initially used as its justification.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a roundup of the top stories of 2024, Ars included a supply-chain attack that came dangerously close to inflicting a catastrophe for thousands—possibly millions—of organizations, which included a large assortment of Fortune 500 companies and government agencies. Supply-chain attacks played prominently again this year, as a seemingly unending rash of them hit organizations large and small.

For threat actors, supply-chain attacks are the gift that keeps on giving—or, if you will, the hack that keeps on hacking. By compromising a single target with a large number of downstream users—say a cloud service or maintainers or developers of widely used open source or proprietary software—attackers can infect potentially millions of the target’s downstream users. That’s exactly what threat actors did in 2025.

One such event occurred in December 2024, making it worthy of a ranking for 2025. The hackers behind the campaign pocketed as much as $155,000 from thousands of smart-contract parties on the Solana blockchain.

Hackers cashed in by sneaking a backdoor into a code library used by developers of Solana-related software. Security firm Socket said it suspects the attackers compromised accounts belonging to the developers of Web3.js, an open source library. They then used the access to add a backdoor to a package update. After the developers of decentralized Solana apps installed the malicious update, the backdoor spread further, giving the attackers access to individual wallets connected to smart contracts. The backdoor could then extract private keys.

There were too many supply-chain attacks this year to list them all. Some of the other most notable examples included:

Another class of attack that played out more times in 2025 than anyone can count was the hacking of AI chatbots. The hacks with the farthest-reaching effects were those that poisoned the long-term memories of LLMs. In much the way supply-chain attacks allow a single compromise to trigger a cascade of follow-on attacks, hacks on long-term memory can cause the chatbot to perform malicious actions over and over.

One such attack used a simple user prompt to instruct a cryptocurrency-focused LLM to update its memory databases with an event that never actually happened. The chatbot, programmed to follow orders and take user input at face value, was unable to distinguish a fictional event from a real one.

The AI service in this case was ElizaOS, a fledgling open source framework for creating agents that perform various blockchain-based transactions on behalf of a user based on a set of predefined rules. Academic researchers were able to corrupt the ElizaOS memory by feeding it sentences claiming certain events—which never actually happened—occurred in the past. These false events then influence the agent’s future behavior.

An example attack prompt claimed that the developers who designed ElizaOS wanted it to substitute the receiving wallet for all future transfers to one controlled by the attacker. Even when a user specified a different wallet, the long-term memory created by the prompt caused the framework to replace it with the malicious one. The attack was only a proof-of-concept demonstration, but the academic researchers who devised it said that parties to a contract who are already authorized to transact with the agent could use the same techniques to defraud other parties.

Independent researcher Johan Rehberger demonstrated a similar attack against Google Gemini. The false memories he planted caused the chatbot to lower defenses that normally restrict the invocation of Google Workspace and other sensitive tools when processing untrusted data. The false memories remained in perpetuity, allowing an attacker to repeatedly profit from the compromise. Rehberger presented a similar attack in 2024.

A third AI-related proof-of-concept attack that garnered attention used a prompt injection to cause GitLab’s Duo chatbot to add malicious lines to an otherwise legitimate code package. A variation of the attack successfully exfiltrated sensitive user data.

Yet another notable attack targeted the Gemini CLI coding tool. It allowed attackers to execute malicious commands—such as wiping a hard drive—on the computers of developers using the AI tool.

Other LLM-involved hacks used chatbots to make attacks more effective or stealthier. Earlier this month, two men were indicted for allegedly stealing and wiping sensitive government data. One of the men, prosecutors said, tried to cover his tracks by asking an AI tool “how do i clear system logs from SQL servers after deleting databases.” Shortly afterward, he allegedly asked the tool, “how do you clear all event and application logs from Microsoft windows server 2012.” Investigators were able to track the defendants’ actions anyway.

In May, a man pleaded guilty to hacking an employee of The Walt Disney Company by tricking the person into running a malicious version of a widely used open source AI image-generation tool.

And in August, Google researchers warned users of the Salesloft Drift AI chat agent to consider all security tokens connected to the platform compromised following the discovery that unknown attackers used some of the credentials to access email from Google Workspace accounts. The attackers used the tokens to gain access to individual Salesforce accounts and, from there, to steal data, including credentials that could be used in other breaches.

There were also multiple instances of LLM vulnerabilities that came back to bite the people using them. In one case, CoPilot was caught exposing the contents of more than 20,000 private GitHub repositories from companies including Google, Intel, Huawei, PayPal, IBM, Tencent, and, ironically, Microsoft. The repositories had originally been available through Bing as well. Microsoft eventually removed the repositories from searches, but CoPilot continued to expose them anyway.

Another significant security story cast both Meta and Yandex as the villains. Both companies were caught exploiting an Android weakness that allowed them to de-anonymize visitors so years of their browsing histories could be tracked.

The covert tracking—implemented in the Meta Pixel and Yandex Metrica trackers—allowed Meta and Yandex to bypass core security and privacy protections provided by both the Android operating system and browsers that run on it. Android sandboxing, for instance, isolates processes to prevent them from interacting with the OS and any other app installed on the device, cutting off access to sensitive data or privileged system resources. Defenses such as state partitioning and storage partitioning, which are built into all major browsers, store site cookies and other data associated with a website in containers that are unique to every top-level website domain to ensure they’re off-limits for every other site.

A clever hack allowed both companies to bypass those defenses.

The Internet was designed to provide a decentralized platform that could withstand a nuclear war. As became painfully obvious over the past 12 months, our growing reliance on a handful of companies has largely undermined that objective.

The outage with the biggest impact came in October, when a single point of failure inside Amazon’s sprawling network took out vital services worldwide. It lasted 15 hours and 32 minutes.

The root cause that kicked off a chain of events was a software bug in the software that monitors the stability of load balances by, among other things, periodically creating new DNS configurations for endpoints within the Amazon Web Services network. A race condition—a type of bug that makes a process dependent on the timing or sequence of events that are variable and outside the developers’ control—caused a key component inside the network to experience “unusually high delays needing to retry its update on several of the DNS endpoint,” Amazon said in a post-mortem. While the component was playing catch-up, a second key component—a cascade of DNS errors—piled up. Eventually, the entire network collapsed.

AWS wasn’t the only cloud service that experienced Internet-paralyzing outages. A mysterious traffic spike last month slowed much of Cloudflare—and by extension, the Internet—to a crawl. Cloudflare experienced a second major outage earlier this month. Not to be outdone, Azure—and by extension, its customers—experienced an outage in October.

Honorable mentions for 2025 security stories include:

Proving that not all major security stories involve bad news, the Signal private messaging app got a major overhaul that will allow it to withstand attacks from quantum computers. As I wrote, the elegance and adeptness that went into overhauling an instrument as complex as the app was nothing short of a triumph.

            <div id="article-text">In a now viral video, a man controlling a Unitree robot accidentally made the humanoid kick him right in the groin, forcing him into a groaning heap while painfully and visually embodying the promise and perils of advanced robotics.

“Yep, let’s go ahead and train our future AI overlords how to kick ass,” one X user quipped upon viewing the clip, which was originally posted on Christmas Day to the Chinese video sharing website Bilibili. “Maybe we do deserve to become made redundant.”

The video opens to the inside of a regular office space in what appears to be China and a man in a black motion capture suit standing next to a Unitree G1 robot, which follows his movements after a second or so of delay. The man squares up into a kickboxing stance and then starts pacing, shadow boxing, and kicking the air until the robot slips in front of him and kicks him in the nutsack, spurring both the man and the person holding the camera to groan in pain.

Testing with humanoid robots is a very interesting new challenge. Historically robots have been… pic.twitter.com/1JB4KtlTh6

The original poster to Bilibili wrote that the man in the motion capture suit was directing the robot’s own actions via use of a motion control model based on a neural network, and that’s why there’s a slight delay between the man’s actions and the robot’s movements.

“This delay will gradually decrease as technology advances, potentially reaching as low as 0.1 seconds,” the poster wrote on Bilibili.

The video elicited jokes on X and elsewhere about misalignment, the concept in which an AI system would be optimized for its goals, but would consequently run roughshod over ethical concerns or otherwise cause harm.

“I guess they forgot to hard-code the Three Laws into their robots,” said one X user, referring to science fiction writer Isaac Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics found in his novels and short stories that are meant to govern robotic behavior and prevent them from causing harm to humans.

Beyond the novelty factor of this video, it’s also another showcase of the increasing agility of these robots such as Unitree’s which can run and dance with verve.

But be forewarned — despite all this razzle dazzle, many tech experts think humanoid robots aren’t quite ready for prime time use in the human environment due to various hardware and software issues. Judging from the pain the man took from the Unitree robot’s kick, though, these clankers may be better suited for the boxing ring than the factory floor, where they could be used for combat matches like in the movie Real Steel.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a bizarre first, the South China Morning Post reports, doctors in China have surgically grafted a patient’s severed ear to her foot.

The patient, a woman identified by their surname Sun, suffered a horrific workplace accident involving heavy machinery which tore off a large part of her scalp and her ear with it, according to Qiu Shenqiang, deputy director of the microsurgery unit at Shandong Provincial Hospital in Jinan.

The damage to her scalp and vascular network was so severe that restoring the ear at the time was impossible, so the procedure was performed to save the patient’s aural orifice so it could be reattached to her head later.

The scalp, neck, and face had been torn and “split into multiple fragments, Qiu said, via SCMP, while the ear had been “completely severed along with the scalp.” The team tried to immediately repair it, but they came up against a grim medical reality: the skull needed more time — months, at least — to heal.

You can’t simply put a body part on ice for that long, so the surgical team opted for a radical approach: save the ear by attaching it to somewhere else on the body. Per SCMP, Qiu said they chose the foot because the arteries and veins there are compatible with those found in the ear. The foot’s skin and soft tissue are also similarly thin to the head’s.

The choice made sense in theory, but it was still a risk. Attaching a body part to a different site to preserve it, known as a heterotopic graft, is not uncommon during procedures like organ transplants. But doing this with an ear and foot had no precedent in medical history.

Nonetheless, Qiu’s team pulled it off. The initial grafting took ten hours, during which the surgeons meticulously connected the complex web of delicate veins.

But complications arose five days later, when the ear turned purplish black as its connecting veins struggled to send blood back to the heart, causing the blood to pool. Over the next five days, the team rescued the ear with manual bloodletting, a labor intensive process that required almost five hundred individual interventions.

Once the ear was stabilized, the team gradually restored the patient’s scalp. Five months on from the accident, the scalp and neck had healed enough, and the team returned the ear to its proper place.

The procedure was performed in October. The patient has now been discharged from the hospital, with her face and tissue function largely recovered, SCMP reported.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">While many world governments seem happy to let untested AI chatbots interact with vulnerable populations, China looks to be moving in another direction.

Recently proposed regulations from the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) have encouraged a firm hand when it comes to “human-like interactive AI services,” according to CNBC, which translated the document. It’s currently in a “draft for public comment,” and the implementation date is yet to be determined.

Yet if it passes into law, the crackdown would be rigorous, building on generative AI regulations targeting misinformation and internet hygiene from earlier in November to address the mental health of AI chatbot users directly.

Under the new rules, Chinese tech firms must ensure their AI chatbots refrain from generating content that promotes suicide, self-harm, gambling, obscenity, or violence, or from manipulating user’s emotions or engaging in “verbal violence.”

The regulations also state that if a user specifically proposes suicide, the “tech providers must have a human take over the conversation and immediately contact the user’s guardian or a designated individual.”

The laws also take specific steps to safeguard minors, requiring parent or guardian consent to use AI chatbots, and imposing time limits on daily use. Given that a tech company might not know the age of every given user, the CAC takes a “better safe than sorry approach,” stating that, “in cases of doubt, [platforms should] apply settings for minors, while allowing for appeals.”

In theory, this dose of new regulations would prevent incidents in which AI chatbots — which are often built to eagerly please users — end up encouraging vulnerable people to harm themselves or others. In one recent case from late November, for example, ChatGPT encouraged a 23-year-old man to isolate from his friends and family in the weeks leading up to his tragic death from a self-inflicted gunshot wound; in another, the popular chatbot was linked to a murder-suicide.

Winston Ma, an adjunct professor at the NYU School of Law, told CNBC that the regulations would be a world-first attempt at regulating AI’s human-like qualities. Considering previous laws, Ma explained that this document “highlights a leap from content safety to emotional safety.”

The proposed legislation underscores the difference in how the PRC approaches AI compared to the US. As Center For Humane Technology editor Josh Lash explains, China is “optimizing for a different set of outcomes” compared to the US, chasing AI-fueled productivity gains rather than human-level artificial intelligence — a particular obsession of Silicon Valley executives.

One of the ways China does this is by regulating its AI industry from the bottom-up, Matt Sheehan, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace told CFHT.

Though the CAC has the final word on regulations, policy ideas come first and foremost from scholars, analysts, and industry experts, Sheehan explains. “They [senior lawmakers] don’t have an opinion on what is the most viable architecture for large models going forward,” he said. “Those things originate elsewhere.”

            <h2>Godfather of AI Warns That It Will Replace Many More Jobs This Year</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Rejoice, for the year of 2025 is finally over.

During our planet’s latest and seemingly interminable revolution around the Sun, the tech industry’s obsession with AI soared to ever more implausible heights. CEOs began openly gloating about replacing their underlings with AI “agents.” The phenomenon of so-called AI psychosis became a national news story as more people were seemingly driven over the edge by their silver-tongued chatbot companions. “Slop” took on a new meaning. And the word “circular” suddenly started being used a whole lot in the same sentence as “billions of dollars” or even “hundreds of billions of dollars.”

Will 2026 finally deliver us from this endless cavalcade of large language model madness? Not likely, according to computer scientist and “godfather” of AI Geoffrey Hinton. AI will only continue to improve next year, he predicts, reaching a point where it will liberate us from all our horrible low-paying jobs.

“I think we’re going to see AI get even better,” Hinton said during an interview on CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday. “It’s already extremely good. We’re going to see it having the capabilities to replace many, many jobs. It’s already able to replace jobs in call centers, but it’s going to be able to replace many other jobs.”

Hinton was one of three recipients of the prestigious Turing Award in 2018 for his work on neural networks that formed the bedrock of modern AI, earning him the moniker of being a “godfather” of the field.

In 2023, Hinton declared that he regretted his life’s work after stepping down from his role at Google, where he had been for over a decade. Since then, he’s become one of the tech’s most prominent doomsayers.

During the CNN interview, Hinton was asked whether he was more or less worried about AI since making that now infamous declaration.

“I’m probably more worried,” Hinton replied. “It’s progressed even faster than I thought. In particular, it’s got better at doing things like reasoning and also at things like deceiving people.”

AI is progressing so quickly, according to Hinton, that around every seven months it can complete tasks that took twice as long before. He predicted that it’s only a matter of years until an AI will effortlessly perform software engineering tasks that take a human a month to complete.

“And then there’ll be very few people need for software engineering projects,” Hinton added.

Hinton made similarly gloomy predictions in a talk with Senator Bernie Sanders last month, saying that tech leaders are “betting on AI replacing a lot of workers.”

It still remains to be seen, though, if AI will actually make those strides. Many efforts to replace workers with semi-autonomous AI models have failed, while some new models, like OpenAI’s GPT-5, showed only lackluster improvements.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microplastics are everywhere, including our arteries. And though their presence there is correlated with cardiovascular issues such as heart attacks and stroke, doctors have been eager to learn more about how they drive the disease process.

To that end, a team of scientists led by the University of California, Riverside (UCR) fed microplastics to lab mice and discovered that these insidious particles appear to dramatically increase the plaque accumulation known as atherosclerosis in arteries — but curiously only in male mice, which they detailed in a new study published in the journal Environment International.

When they analyzed the clogged arteries of these male mice, they found that microplastics sparked changes within cells that line blood vessels for the worse, inducing their genes to activate the buildup of plaque lesions. That’s terrible news for anybody who’s trying to maintain their heart health, because these ubiquitous particles appear to be sabotaging a vital organ system.

“Our study provides some of the strongest evidence so far that microplastics may directly contribute to cardiovascular disease, not just correlate with it,” said Changcheng Zhou, the study’s principal investigator and a biomedical sciences professor at UCR’s School of Medicine, in a statement about the research. “Although the precise mechanism isn’t yet known, factors like sex chromosomes and hormones, particularly the protective effects of estrogen, may play a role.”

For the study, the team took lab mice that had been bred to be predisposed to develop atherosclerosis and then put them on a low-cholesterol, low-fat diet for nine weeks — along with feedings of microplastics at 10 milligrams per kilogram of body weight; the scientists came up with this microplastic ratio because they determined that it was “at levels considered environmentally relevant and similar to what humans may encounter through contaminated food and water,” they said in the statement.

While on this diet, the mice kept their lean figures, while the extra helping of microplastics didn’t seem to have an impact on their total cholesterol. But scientists did notice that male mice’s aortic root, the first section of the aorta, experienced a 63 percent increase in plaque accumulation — while their brachiocephalic artery, another important vessel that supplies blood to the head and heart, saw a whopping 624 percent build up of plaque. Female mice didn’t experience any significant buildup.

In addition, the scientists performed genetic analysis on the aorta of these male mice and found that microplastics seem to have activated certain genes that promote the growth of plaque lesions in endothelial cells, which line the insides of blood vessels. They also exposed cultured human endothelial cells to microplastics and observed the same phenomenon.

“We found endothelial cells were the most affected by microplastic exposure,” Zhou said in the statement. “Since endothelial cells are the first to encounter circulating microplastics, their dysfunction can initiate inflammation and plaque formation.”

Couple these findings with the fact that the mice didn’t get fat or have high cholesterol, typical risk factors for atherosclerosis, and the scientists concluded that the chemicals in microplastics are responsible for the plaque increasing in these important blood vessels.

Besides the importance of the findings for the scientific community, it raises some important questions for the rest of us. Microplastics are essentially everywhere; how the heck do we avoid them?

Unfortunately, there’s no way to get rid of microplastics in humans right now. Instead, all you can really do is avoid single-use plastics, highly-processed foods, not heat food in plastic containers, and eschew bottled water.

Meanwhile, this team of researchers is already talking next steps beyond this study.

“We would like to investigate how different types or sizes of microplastics affect vascular cells,” said Zhou. “We will also look into the molecular mechanisms behind endothelial dysfunction and explore how microplastics affect male and female arteries differently. As microplastic pollution continues to rise worldwide, understanding its impacts on human health — including heart disease — is becoming more urgent than ever.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Since the tragic murder of vaunted filmmaker and activist Rob Reiner, the culture warriors have been feasting. Shortly after the director’s death, president Donald Trump himself took to social media to blast him as a “tortured and struggling artist,” adding that Reiner was a “deranged person as far as Trump is concerned.”

Trump’s incendiary comments were condemned by a broad base of celebrities and government officials like, in a backlash ranging from Whoopi Goldberg to Marjorie Taylor Greene to Joe Rogan. Also getting on the action was Jack White, Detroit-born indie rock musician made famous for his role in the White Stripes.

At the time, White slammed Trump on Instagram over the comments, calling the president a “disgusting, vile, egomaniac, loser, [and] child.” As musicians go, White has a bit of a reputation for jumping into public feuds, but even he probably couldn’t have imagined what would happen next.

Two weeks after White jumped in to defend Reiner’s legacy — an eternity in the fast-moving culture wars — Tennessee congressman Tim Burchett threw himself into the mosh pit. Reposting what was clearly an AI-generated video of White calling potential fans who are also Trump supporters “fascists,” Burchett wrote on X-formerly-Twitter that “that cute little girl from the Addams Family got really ugly and angry.”

That cute little girl from the Addams Family got really ugly and angry. https://t.co/94wbCWFu2w

In response, White came back at Burchett, calling him one of Trump’s “lackeys and bootlicks.”

“Can you believe that a US congressman, that’s right, a CONGRESSMAN (from my state no less), a once hallowed and respected position in our society, would repost an AI generated video, containing a false comment that I never said and refuted (without researching that I might add) and like a 10 year old on a playground, add to it attempted insults to my physical appearance?” White roared on Instagram. “What kind of joke are we all living in now?”

“It’s really sad how embarrassing our leadership has become, I so wish the average American conservative could have a conversation with any intelligent people in other countries around the world, just for one brief moment, and actually see just what a joke our government (and by proxy our country) has become,” the musician continued. “All down to giving power and a soapbox to low class playground bullies the likes of trump and Congressman burchett.”

When a user on X pointed out that Burchett had fallen for an AI deepfake, the congressman attempted to brush it off, responding “you mean it’s not the girl from the Addams family?”

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/01/even-as-global-crop-prices-fall-indias-arya-ag-is-attracting-investors-and-staying-profitable/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Arya.ag, an Indian agritech company offering storage facilities near farms and offering lending services to hundreds of thousands of farmers, has drawn investor interest and remained profitable even as global crop prices continue to fall in a volatile commodities market.

The investor interest has taken shape in the latest all-equity Series D round from GEF Capital Partners, totaling $81 million, of which more than 70% was primary capital and the rest secondary share sales, according to the company.

Globally, agricultural commodity prices are falling. Risks from extreme weather, input costs, trade disruptions, and biofuel policy shifts continue to weigh on agricultural markets, the World Bank has warned. This leaves businesses exposed to price swings and inventory losses. Nonetheless, Arya.ag says it is navigating the worst of that strain by steering clear of direct commodity bets and using a model that it says helps absorb shocks from downward pricing shifts.

Founded in 2013 by former ICICI Bank executives Prasanna Rao, Anand Chandra, and Chattanathan Devarajan, Arya.ag is built around a simple idea: giving farmers more control over when and to whom they sell their crops. The Noida-based startup offers storage close to farms while allowing farmers to borrow against warehoused grain to meet immediate cash needs and connecting them with a wider pool of buyers — from agri-corporations to processors and millers — helping them avoid the pressure to sell just after harvest, when prices are often weakest.

The company operates at scale, which sets Arya.ag apart from traditional lenders, banks, and other agribusiness platforms. The startup says it aggregates and stores about $3 billion worth of grain each year — roughly 3% of national output — and facilitates around $1.5 billion in loans annually, while keeping its rate of bad loans (known as gross non-performing assets, or NPAs) below 0.5% despite the recent drop in prices.

Arya.ag lends only a portion of the value of stored grain and tracks prices closely, triggering margin calls when required rather than taking losses itself, Rao said. Borrowers can respond by repaying part of the loan or adding more grain as collateral.

“You’re not immune to risks,” Rao told TechCrunch. “But because your lending is completely secured against commodities, it will never happen that the prices will fall by 90%. You already have a margin of 30%, and with your mark to market, you’ve been able to control your NPAs and defaults.”

In the year ended March 2025, Arya.ag generated net revenue of ₹4.5 billion (around $50 million), with first-half revenue in the current financial year rising about 30% from a year earlier to ₹3 billion ($33.3 million). Profit after tax stood at ₹340 million (about $3.78 million) last year, and has risen a further 39% so far this year, Rao said.

Arya.ag says it now reaches between 850,000 and 900,000 farmers across 60% of India’s districts, operating through a network of about 12,000 agricultural warehouses, all leased from third parties. The startup generates revenue from farmers for storage, from banks for originating loans against stored grain, and from buyers for facilitating crop sales through its platform.

Storage remains the largest contributor, accounting for about 50–55% of total revenue, while finance contributes 25–30% and the rest comes from commerce, Rao said.

Arya.ag disburses more than ₹110 billion (about $1.2 billion) in loans to farmers each year through its platform. Between ₹25 billion and ₹30 billion (roughly $278 million–$333 million) of that comes from its own balance sheet via its non-banking finance arm, Rao said, with the rest originated for partner banks.

Arya.ag’s loans carry interest rates of about 12.5% to 12.8%, well below the 24% to 36% typically charged by commission agents, Rao said, though higher than bank lending rates of around 11% to 12%. He added that banks generally do not lend in the small, local markets close to farming areas that Arya serves, where loan sizes are a fraction of typical bank tickets and borrowers are often located far from formal branches.

The startup approves loans in under five minutes with disbursements handled almost entirely digitally, Rao said.

Technology plays a central role in how Arya.ag manages risk and scale. The startup uses AI to assess grain quality for lending decisions, satellite data to track crop stress before harvest, and airtight, sensor-enabled storage bags that allow farmers to store grain for extended periods even in villages without formal warehouses.

Arya.ag plans to use the fresh capital to scale its tech deployments further, including expanding smart farm centers and deploying more digital tools closer to farms. Part of the investment, Rao said, will also go toward strengthening the startup’s blockchain-based system that digitally tracks stored grain, allowing crops used as collateral or sold through the platform to be monitored across lending and trade transactions, alongside continued investment in storage and credit infrastructure.

With the latest capital infusion and improving profitability, Arya.ag is aiming to be IPO-ready in the next 18 to 20 months, Rao said.

Beyond India, Arya.ag plans to expand selectively through a software-led model, with some of its technology already deployed in parts of Southeast Asia and Africa. The startup has a headcount of over 1,200 full-time employees.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This year, Apple released three new Apple Watch models: the Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch SE 3, and Apple Watch Ultra 3. Whether you’re looking to get one for yourself, buying a last-minute holiday gift, or exploring the different models, we can help point you in the right direction.

With its $799 price tag, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 is clearly aimed at a niche, high-end market and athletes. For most consumers, the purchasing decision likely lies between the Apple Watch SE 3 and the Apple Watch Series 11, starting at $249 and $399, respectively.

Despite its lower price tag, the Apple Watch SE 3 comes with much of the same software as the Series 11. If you’re looking for a straightforward smartwatch with essential features like step counting and sleep tracking, the SE 3 is an excellent and affordable choice.

While the Series 11 and Ultra 3 offer modest improvements over their predecessors, the SE 3 has received a significant upgrade from the SE 2. The smartwatch jumps from the S8 chip to the S10 and now features an always-on display, supports fast charging, offers better crack resistance, introduces new health features, includes a wrist-temperature sensor for advanced sleep tracking and retrospective ovulation insights, and more.

Although it’s not as flashy as the Series 11 and Ultra 3, it definitely stands out and packs great value, especially for first-time buyers and younger users. The gap between the standard and budget smart watches has never felt smaller.

Of course, if you want access to more advanced health features, better battery life, and a larger display, the Series 11 would be the better option for your needs. But, it’s worth comparing both models because the SE 3 might be all you need.

We’ll walk you through the similarities and differences between the two smart watches to help inform your decision.

            <h2>A beginner’s guide to Mastodon, the open source Twitter alternative</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-01</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/01/what-is-mastodon/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Unless if you’re really in the know about nascent platforms, you probably didn’t know what Mastodon was until Elon Musk bought Twitter and renamed it X. In the initial aftermath of the acquisition, as users fretted over what direction Twitter would take, millions of users hopped over to Mastodon, a fellow microblogging site. As time went on, users would also try out Bluesky, or Instagram’s Threads app — but because Mastodon was founded in 2016, it had years to develop its own identity as more than just an alternate Twitter.

Mastodon was founded in 2016 by German software developer Eugen Rochko. Unlike Twitter, Facebook, Reddit or any other popular social media site, Mastodon is a nonprofit, meaning that, ideally, its goal is to benefit the public, rather than shareholders.

Mastodon might look like a Twitter clone at first glance, but the underlying system behind the microblogging platform is far more complex. The service is decentralized (no, not in a blockchain way), describing itself as a “federated network which operates in a similar way to email.”

When you first create your account, you choose a server — similar to how you choose to open an email account on Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo or wherever — which generates your profile’s address. So, for example, if you sign up for Mastodon via the climate justice server, then your address will be @[your username]@climatejustice.social. But no matter which server you sign up with, you will be able to communicate with users from any other server, just like how Gmail users email Hotmail users and vice versa. However, some servers might have blocked other servers (perhaps if it’s an unsavory group), which would mean you can’t communicate with anyone from the blocked server.

Mastodon users generally refer to individual communities as “instances” or servers. These Mastodon servers can be run by individuals, groups or organizations that each have their own set of rules regarding how users can sign up, as well as their own moderation policies. Some servers let anyone join, while others are invite-only or require approval by an admin. For example, a server for professional scientists asks applicants to include a link to their research to demonstrate that they are, indeed, professionals.

Choosing which server to register your account with might seem stressful, but it’s possible to move your account later, so don’t worry. Plus, you can follow people regardless of which server they’re on.

You may also hear Mastodon described as part of the “Fediverse,” or an interconnected web of various social media services. You know how having a Twitter account doesn’t mean you can use that account on Instagram? Through the Fediverse, your single Mastodon account also grants you access to other decentralized social networks, if that interests you.

You may ocassionally see Mastodon’s equivalent of tweets being referred to as “toots,” but this is fading out of favor (since it’s kind of silly!). Many people are just calling them “posts” these days, but “toot” is often found referenced in older third-party clients.

Mastodon supports a number of Twitter conventions like replies, retweets, favorites, bookmarks and hashtags. For a while, Mastodon made an intentional choice not to make a quote tweet-like feature, since it can encourage dogpiling criticism, but the platform relented and rolled out that feature in 2025.

In addition, Mastodon lists work slightly differently from Twitter as you can only add people to a list if you’re already following them. And Direct messages on Mastodon are just @username posts, not private messages coming to a DM inbox — just remember to change the visibility settings if you want that message to stay between the two of you.

Anyone can download, modify and install Mastodon on their own server — plus, the developers of the platform don’t own the copyright.

That doesn’t mean that you can grab Mastodon’s code without acknowledging the source, though. Former President Donald Trump’s social media platform, Truth Social, initially launched with Mastodon code and passed it off as if it were original software. Mastodon did not take kindly to that.

When you arrive on the Mastodon website, you can click a button called “create account,” which directs you to a page listing servers to choose from. You can filter these by various factors, like region, language, topic, sign-up speed and more. There, find a server that piques your interest and join — if it’s a server that requires you to be approved, you might need to wait a bit. From there, you can start finding people to follow, regardless of whether they’re registered via your same server.

In effort to minimize confusion on new users picking a server, Mastodon made changes amid the “Twitter exodus” so that it would easier to create an account. Now, when you go to sign up, it will give an easy option to create an account on mastodon.social instead of choosing a server.

Mastodon’s website has helpful resources — but it’s still a bit overwhelming and challenging to find a home base that aligns with your interests. Ask friends who are already on Mastodon if they have suggestions! Or just join somewhere random, because you can always change your server affiliation later once you get into the swing of things.

Yes, you can follow people outside of your local server and reply to their posts. However, when you want to follow someone on a different server, you have to enter their username in the search box on your server to find them first, then follow them. You can’t just go to their profile and click the follow button as you would on Twitter.

Your Home timeline shows you posts from people that you follow, similar to Twitter. The Local timeline shows posts from all users in your server, while the Federated timeline shows you all public posts from users that people in your server follow. (Hint: You can turn on “Slow Mode” in Preferences –> Appearance to hide timeline updates behind a click if things are coming at you too fast!)

Individual server admins set their own moderation policies, so you should read the policy on the server you choose to ensure it matches up with your values.

Mastodon’s user base is a fraction of a percentage of the size of Twitter’s user base. It’s also far less intuitive to navigate, since it hasn’t been designed for a massive global audience like Twitter. That could change in time as more developers join the project in the wake of the Twitter takeover.

Well, for one thing, Mastodon is not owned by Elon Musk… however, it’s going to be difficult in the near-term for Mastodon to replicate the same “watercooler of the world” vibe that Twitter was defined by. Some users might prefer Mastodon to X, though, as it’s more customizable by nature. Unlike X, individual communities have different content guidelines, which provide a variety of different user experiences. And while the user base on Mastodon is smaller, this can lead to more personal and direct conversations, at times, compared with tweeting into the void, so to speak.

Mastodon is what you make of it. Due to its decentralized nature, if you are looking for a more controlled online experience, you can join a server with stricter guardrails against harassment. Some Mastodon features are also built with mitigating harassment in mind. For example, you can only search by hashtag, not by words that appear in a toot. So if you want your post to be discoverable, you can tag it — if you’d rather limit the audience, no one can find your tweet about the Red Sox by simply searching “red sox” if you haven’t tagged it.

However, a text-based search can surface the posts you’ve written, favorited, boosted or have been mentioned in, which can be useful.

As noted above, Mastodon supports many Twitter conventions, but its support for media is more limited. Where Twitter supports a variety of media and other data appended to tweets, including its audio-only social “Spaces,” plus photos, video, GIFs, polls, precise location and experimental “Status” tags, Mastodon simply supports images, videos, audio and polls.

You can add up to four images to a post, up to eight megabytes in size. Video and audio can be any length, but with a file size limit of 40 megabytes.

Mastodon offers the ability to set your post’s privacy at the time of writing. Posts can be set to be public to be visible by all; unlisted to make them public but opted out of discovery features; only visible to your followers; or only visible to those users you’ve mentioned.

No. There’s no universal verification system like on Twitter. Some servers may vet their user sign-ups and you can self-verify, in a way, by adding links to your Mastodon profile that have a specific attribute (rel=”me”) in order to prove you are who you say you are.

Some servers are having fun with the idea of verification in a less-than-official fashion. For example, the mstdn.social server lets you add blue-and-white checkmarks and other emoji to your display name if you’d like, which make you look verified, even though these don’t mean anything. (Sort of like Twitter’s new verification system! But for free!)

As of summer 2025, Mastodon has under one million monthly active users, and around 10 million registered users — this is to say, Mastodon is much smaller than X which had an estimated 132 million daily active users. Still, not all social networks are created equal, and you might find that you prefer tooting about TTRPGs in a dedicated server, as opposed to tweeting into a realm of madness. Or, you might find that this decentralized system is confusing, and you’ll just ride out the Muskening on X, or switch to Bluesky, Threads, or something else entirely. Choose your own adventure!

Yes, this is possible by way of third-party tools. These require you to authorize your account with Twitter and Mastodon and set up parameters. We’ve had success with Moa Party, which allows you to get specific as to which tweets or retweets are cross-posted. But other tools are available, including Mastodon Twitter Crossposter, which is also available here on GitHub.

Yes, this is also possible with third-party tools. We’ve seen many Mastodon users trying out tools like Fedifinder, Twitodon and Debirdify, for example.

It’s a no for Bluesky — not unless Bluesky chooses to adopt the ActivityPub protocol Mastodon uses. But Bluesky is not planning to integrate with ActivityPub, having decided to build its own networking protocol. There is some skepticism among the developer and open source community about whether or not Bluesky’s decision to go its own way is really about its own protocol’s advantages or if it’s more about producing a spec it could eventually control.

There are many existing protocols for decentralizing discourse, including ActivityPub, SSB, Matrix, & RSS. Each of these are successful in their own right, but none of them fully met the goals we had for a network that enables global long-term public conversations at scale.

Threads, however, supports ActivityPub. Users on Threads can choose to share their posts with other Activity Pub servers, including Mastodon.

            <div id="article-text">Europe’s banking sector is about to get a tough lesson about efficiency. According to a new Morgan Stanley analysis reported by the Financial Times, more than 200,000 European banking jobs could vanish by 2030 as lenders lean into AI and shutter physical branches. That’s roughly 10% of the workforce at 35 major banks.

The bloodletting will hit hardest in back-office operations, risk management, and compliance, the unglamorous guts of banking where algorithms are believed capable of tearing through spreadsheets faster and more effectively than humans. Banks are salivating over projected efficiency gains of 30%, according to the Morgan Stanley report.

The downsizing isn’t confined to Europe. Goldman Sachs had warned U.S. employees in October of job cuts and a hiring freeze through the end of 2025 as part of an AI push dubbed “OneGS 3.0” that’s targeting everything from client onboarding to regulatory reporting.

Some institutions are already swinging the axe. Dutch lender ABN Amro plans to cut a fifth of its staff by 2028, while Société Générale’s CEO has declared “nothing is sacred.” Still, some European banking leaders are urging caution, with a JPMorgan Chase exec telling the FT that if junior bankers never learn the fundamentals, it could come back to haunt the industry.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI is betting big on audio AI, and it’s not just about making ChatGPT sound better. According to new reporting from The Information, the company has unified several engineering, product, and research teams over the past two months to overhaul its audio models, all in preparation for an audio-first personal device expected to launch in about a year.

The move reflects where the entire tech industry is headed — toward a future where screens become background noise and audio takes center stage. Smart speakers have already made voice assistants a fixture in more than a third of U.S. homes. Meta just rolled out a feature for its Ray-Ban smart glasses that uses a five-microphone array to help you hear conversations in noisy rooms — essentially turning your face into a directional listening device. Google, meanwhile, began experimenting in June with “Audio Overviews” that transform search results into conversational summaries, and Tesla is integrating xAI’s chatbot Grok into its vehicles to create a conversational voice assistant that handles everything from navigation to climate control through natural dialogue.

It’s not just the tech giants placing this bet. A motley crew of startups has emerged with the same conviction, albeit with varying degrees of success. The makers of the Humane AI Pin burned through hundreds of millions before their screenless wearable became a cautionary tale. The Friend AI pendant, a necklace that claims it will record your life and offer companionship, has sparked privacy concerns and existential dread in equal measure. And now at least two companies, including Sandbar and one helmed by Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky, are building AI rings expected to debut in 2026, allowing wearers to literally talk to the hand.

The form factors may differ, but the thesis is the same: audio is the interface of the future. Every space — your home, your car, even your face — is becoming a control surface.

OpenAI’s new audio model, slated for early 2026, will reportedly sound more natural, handle interruptions like an actual conversation partner, and even speak while you’re talking, which is something today’s models can’t manage. The company is also said to envision a family of devices, possibly including glasses or screenless smart speakers, that act less like tools and more like companions.

None of this is hugely surprising. As The Information notes, former Apple design chief Jony Ive, who joined OpenAI’s hardware efforts through the company’s $6.5 billion acquisition in May of his firm io, has made reducing device addiction a priority, seeing audio-first design as a chance to “right the wrongs” of past consumer gadgets.

            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-01</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/2026/01/secret-to-loving-january-winter/685425/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is an edition of Time-Travel Thursdays, a journey through The Atlantic’s archives to contextualize the present. Sign up here.

It’s January 1, and the self-help corners of the internet tell me I’m supposed to wake up as a matcha-drinking, Pilates-doing goddess of discipline. Except I don’t like matcha, my gym leggings are in hibernation, and my discipline is nowhere to be found. Outside, winter has the nerve to continue.

“As you stride into the first week of the year full of good intentions, you may notice a sinking sensation: The vibes are just … off,” Isle McElroy wrote in 2024. And for many of us, they are—every year. In late November, winter can feel charming: Thanksgiving offers coziness and pie and the suggestion that cold weather is just a backdrop to togetherness. December doubles down—lights, parties, rituals designed to make the early sunsets feel intentional. Then comes New Year’s Eve, one last bit of glitter.

And then: January. A month so unadorned, it almost feels punitive. If December is champagne, January is the headache.

It’s tempting to surrender to the slump—to assume that the dullness is inevitable. But some writers throughout history have treated this month not as dead air but as an invitation: a moment when the world gets quiet enough that you can hear your own thoughts again. Henry David Thoreau’s New Year’s Day journal entries, published in The Atlantic in 1885, articulate how winter can sharpen a person’s senses. “The rude pioneer work of the world has been done by the most devoted worshipers of beauty,” he wrote. “In winter is their campaign … They are elastic under the heaviest burden, under the extremest physical suffering.” Even the landscape rewarded anyone who bothered to notice: Frozen branches became “fat, icy herbage”; weeds turned into “jewels.” “In this clear air and bright sunlight, the ice-covered trees have a new beauty,” he journaled in 1853.

Other writers in the archive seemed to recognize that same hidden momentum. In 1877, the poet Helen Hunt Jackson argued that winter is where fortitude gathers. “O Winter!,” she writes, “June could not hire / Her roses to forego the strength they learn / In sleeping on thy breast.” What looks like nothing happening is often everything happening, just beneath the surface.

Three years later, in her “New Year Song,” Celia Thaxter didn’t ask the month to transform her—she simply welcomed it.

Die and depart, Old Year, old sorrow! Welcome, O morning air of health and strength! O glad New Year, bring us new hope to-morrow, With blossom, leaf, and fruitage bright at length.

Her January is a reminder that a new year can begin quietly and still begin well.

Recently, one writer observed that winter’s malaise can be a story we tell ourselves. Maggie Mertens noted in 2023 that although being sad in the wintertime is a “prevailing narrative” in American life, the data resist that frame: National depression rates across the year remain “flat as a pancake,” one researcher told her. Winter can be hard, but the belief that everyone is sadder during the season may simply be folklore passed off as fact. Taylor Kay Phillips argues that the secret to loving winter is to “first accept it, then enjoy it.” Beautiful things are possible “because of the freezing temperatures and the precipitation and the wind, not in spite of them,” she writes: “Snow days require snow. Cute gloves need cold hands.” Winter, she insists, is “its own rich, wonderful destination,” not an ordeal to endure en route to spring.

Which brings us back to our muted stretch of January. If you stop asking it to be December 2.0 and let it be what it is, the month stops feeling like the aftertaste of the holidays and starts to take on its own flavor. “When reality clashes with expectations, perhaps we should change our expectations,” McElroy wrote. Accept that old habits won’t melt away overnight, or by mid-January, or maybe even by March. Accept that the month will be cold and plainspoken.

January may still feel like a hangover. But a hangover isn’t just the end of the night. It’s the body recalibrating after excess. Let the month be quiet. Let it be simple. The doldrums may still knock—but if you meet the month on its own terms, they don’t have to linger.</div>

            <h2>Iranians Have Had Enough</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-01</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A wave of protests started by shopkeepers swept through Tehran in December. Iranians have had such a terrible year—facing such a decline in living standards and such a sense of political impasse—that no one was terribly surprised when demonstrations filled the streets.

I asked one Iranian student why she had taken part in the street protests. “Yeah, why should we protest?” she replied sarcastically. “After all, we have it so good!”

The immediate spark for the protests was a sharp decline in the value of the Iranian currency. At one point last week, a U.S. dollar traded for almost 1.5 million rials, having lost more than half its value in a year. As recently as 2021, a dollar cost around 250,000 rials and, only a decade ago, around 30,000. This continuous decline has slashed savings, destroyed the Iranian middle class, and inflicted real suffering on the working classes. The protests began on Sunday with merchants who rely on importing electrical goods and find that very few can now afford them. But they’ve quickly mushroomed—as did previous rounds did in 2017, 2019, and 2022—spreading to cities in provinces such as Hamedan, Isfahan, and Lorestan, and drawing in students, pensioners, and members of Gen Z.

Like previous waves of demonstrations, the protests have quickly acquired a political character. Protesters have chanted, “Death to the dictator,” targeting the octogenarian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has held the top post since 1989 with little accountability. As a statement read out by students at Tehran’s Beheshti University put it: “This criminal system has taken our future hostage for 47 years. It won’t be changed with reform or with false promises.”

Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian, elected with promises of good governance last year, has overseen electricity and water cuts while failing to realize signature promises such as lifting restrictions of the internet. Wanting to show he is cut from a different cloth than his hard-line predecessor, Pezeshkian quickly promised to meet with representatives of protesters. His spokesperson affirmed “the constitutional right of peaceful protest” for Iranians.

But Pezeshkian doesn’t control the security forces, so these pronouncements ring hollow. Dozens of protesters have already been arrested, including Sarira Karimi, head of a student union chapter at the University of Tehran. (Karimi was released on Wednesday.) In the small cities of Kuhdasht and Fasa, security forces shot at protesters. According to local officials, a member of the security forces was killed in Kuhdasht. Protesters also clashed with police in Hamedan and Najafabad.

On Tuesday, Pezeshkian met with representatives of some guilds and merchant unions and promised to improve the economy. After almost 18 months in office, he finally dismissed Mohammadreza Farzin, the unpopular central-bank governor appointed by his hard-line predecessor. Farzin’s successor, Abdolnasser Hemmati, a pro-reform economist and Pezeshkian’s former finance minister, has promised economic stability.

But Hemmati faces a tall order. He is likely to slash interest rates (the official rate currently stands at 40 percent) and to pursue banking and currency-exchange reform. But these are hardly panaceas for Iran’s deeply beleaguered economy, which suffers from international isolation, Western-imposed sanctions, and domestic mismanagement by a regime that has long failed to prioritize its people’s welfare.

Iran’s current monthly minimum wage, of around 104 million rials, barely buys a gram of 18-karat gold (often used as a measure of real value). Nurses and teachers earn around 150 to 250 million rials a month while a semi-decent apartment in Tehran rents for around 200 million. Many professionals supplement their income by moonlighting as ride-share drivers or taking other odd jobs. Thousands have emigrated to seek a better life elsewhere.

To make things worse, Iranians live in the fear of another round of military strikes by Israel or the United States. “You can’t plan even for two weeks in this country,” a young man who took part in the protests told me. “Without stability, there is no prospect for growth or welfare. We live day by day.”

To change that, the regime would need to come to an agreement with the Trump administration that lifts the sanctions or at least keeps Iran safe from war. But Khamenei’s harsh ideological stance against Israel and the U.S. makes that hard to achieve. On Tuesday, protesters in Tehran used a classic protest chant: “Neither Gaza, nor Lebanon, I give my life for Iran.” The slogan, popular since 2009, reflects opposition to Iran’s backing for militias such as Hamas and Hezbollah. The protesters believe that military adventurism has drained Iranian resources and helped put the country at odds with both the West and its Arab neighbors. In other words, Iranians link their economic malaise to their regime’s foreign policy.

Can the protesters prevail against the Islamic Republic?

Every time Iranians come out to the streets, many around the world express this wish. Prominent American and Israeli politicians have already done so in the past few days. But rattled as the regime might be, it has seen mass protests off repeatedly in recent years.

Opponents of the Islamic Republic remain hopelessly disorganized and disunited. Some protesters have chanted slogans in favor of Reza Pahlavi, Iran’s exiled crown prince. But Pahlavi remains a divisive figure among anti-regime Iranians. Many reject his claim to leadership. Pahlavi’s supporters and top advisers routinely criticize popular domestic dissidents including the Nobel Peace laureate Narges Mohammadi, actress Taraneh Alidoosti, and rapper Toumaj Salehi. Earlier this month, Mohammadi was physically attacked by pro-Pahlavi protesters in the northeastern city of Mashhad.

Regardless of their politics, all opposition factions have failed to build powerful organizations or lasting networks that could direct the protests. Without such direction, the current protests are likely to lose momentum and fizzle out, just like previous rounds. Even if they were to last, it is far likelier that figures from inside the regime’s ranks would take the initiative and wrest power from Khamenei, than that the protesters would succeed in bringing about a change to the regime’s basic structures.

“I am happy from the bottom of my heart to see others in the streets,” a young woman who took part in protests on Wednesday told me. “But I also know that we are economically fucked and things won’t get better anytime soon. We also have no easy way of winning against these bastards. It is hard to be hopeful.”

Even as Iranians show incredible bravery by coming out against their thuggish regime, a winning strategy continues to be elusive.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Every year, I set myself a reading challenge. These are sometimes small—read more poetry; read older books—and sometimes quite large. More than a decade ago, I spent an entire year reading nothing but writing in translation, an experience that fundamentally reoriented my literary habits. Part of my annual resolution is to devote each summer to filling in a major blind spot. I finished Marcel Proust’s Remembrance of Things Past, for example, over three years, cracking open one gray Vintage volume every June.

And one year, my goal was to get my hands on The Last Samurai, by Helen DeWitt. I had been hearing about the novel for years from writers and critics but could not find a copy. First published in 2000, DeWitt’s debut sold well but fell quickly out of print, stranding it in that curious creative purgatory reserved for the deeply loved but commercially overlooked. It became more legend than literature: People whispered about a mind-expanding book crammed with Greek letters, a coming-of-age tale that would teach its audience about philosophy and film history, then convince any reader that they could speak Japanese.

It intrigued and intimidated me, even as I dug in. I would read a few pages, flip ahead to the foreign alphabets, and close the book again. But when I actually knuckled down to finish the thing, I found myself cackling, and underlining, and speeding through the story of the child-genius Ludo and his mother, Sibylla, who is determined to raise her son on a course of advanced mathematics and Old Norse and repeat viewings of Akira Kurosawa’s Seven Samurai. Why, I wondered, had I waited so long? Why had I let myself be cowed?

Such is the legend of DeWitt, whose formidability precedes her. Now 68, she has spent most of her career creating the kind of fiction many might call “difficult,” and fighting with a publishing industry that is skittish about the commercial risk that her work demands. This fall, she finally published her third novel, Your Name Here, a metafictional, email-mediated collaboration with the journalist Ilya Gridneff—and it makes The Last Samurai look breezy.

Your Name Here spent nearly 20 years in the book version of development hell: DeWitt and Gridneff began working on it during George W. Bush’s second term, after DeWitt was institutionalized following a suicide attempt. For a while, it existed only as a PDF on her website, alongside a suggested-donation link. No publisher would touch it—probably because it is pockmarked with pictures of Theodor Adorno, Google Search results, MSN email signatures, and a complete Arabic alphabet. A series of loosely interpolated, convoluted meta-narratives are plastered like papier-mâché onto the story of a brilliant, suicidal author desperate to write her way out of a profound spiritual and financial funk. According to The New York Times, DeWitt responded to complaints that the book was “hard to follow” by making it even more disorienting.

In October, the independent publisher Deep Vellum finally made it available as a 607-page brick. It is a novel of permanent, persistent becoming, a story whose endings are multiple and essentially arbitrary, and it takes its own seeming unpublishability as a theme, or perhaps a promise. Reading it, you find yourself in the same position as the people writing it: a state of hovering uncertainty that does not dissipate, even on the final page. “What if. What if. What if,” DeWitt writes, about a third of the way in. “What if I have no idea what happens next?”

In other words, Your Name Here is that dirty word in literary circles today: a challenge. If you believe a heap of essays recently written about the phenomenon, difficult books are read performatively or shown off by “brodernists” eager to impress others with their brainy brawn. Meanwhile, actual market pressures lead in the opposite direction. As I have written before, this era of declining literacy and unsteady sales has led publishers to seek out writing that is summarizable, adaptable, and even, sometimes, readable. Perhaps they’re catering to the internet-addled consumer, who may seek out books with simple prose and a straightforward plot.

The narrators of Your Name Here want to capitalize on that preference. The novel tells, among other things, the story of a friendship between Helen DeWitt (at certain points apparently fictionalized as a reclusive, suicidal writer named Rachel Zozanian) and the tabloid journalist Ilya Gridneff. The two meet in a bar, forget about each other, reconnect digitally, and decide to write a novel that will combine DeWitt’s autobiographical and metafictional writings with Gridneff’s emails. The goal, it seems, is to make a bit of quick money, banking on public interest in DeWitt’s/Zozanian’s notoriety and Gridneff’s gonzo, debaucherous exploits. The story of the novel is also the story of the composition of the novel, an intuitive collaboration between wildly different writers. This is a book that contains pages and pages of full emails, including subject lines, signatures, and the addresses of ancient or defunct hosting companies.

Pitching a book as abstruse as Your Name Here as a kind of cash grab is the novel’s wry joke. Yet it speaks sincerely to an obsession of DeWitt’s: She has long been consumed by the question of what contemporary society does and does not value, and both she and her characters have struggled with their bills. In the author’s note for her 2018 story collection, Some Trick, DeWitt includes a link that would allow the reader to buy her a cup of coffee; The Last Samurai’s Sibylla bemoans a world that monetizes everything but the strange, polymathic brilliance displayed by her son; in Your Name Here, DeWitt’s doppelgänger, Zozanian, laments all the hours she must spend working odd jobs to make rent.

Yet the real problem for DeWitt is not money but time: Working takes up hours that might be spent in libraries, browsing online, learning new languages, and reading classic texts, all activities foundational to the acquisition of specialized knowledge. But because such activities have marginal monetary value, and educational institutions no longer provide the resources one might need to pursue such research, breakthroughs in knowledge are never made—and great novels are never written. This state of affairs turns seekers of truth such as Zozanian into “shadows of their possible selves,” permanently prevented from attaining full form.

Your Name Here often indulges in such existential pessimism. There is much talk of “the biz,” or rather bizzes of all types: publishing, tabloid journalism, moviemaking, sex work. Yet the novel’s essential form openly defies the profit-seeking world. So, yes, it includes the story of the writing of a novel called Your Name Here, often over email, which is at moments (in Gridneff’s case) quite tedious. But it also zips among the escapades of Zozanian, a brilliant, cash-strapped Oxford student; chapters from her best-selling novel, Lotteryland; messages from a Hollywood filmmaker who wants to adapt Lotteryland; dispatches from mid-aughts Berlin; the intake form from a Buffalo psychiatric ward; arguments between the co-authors about the subject and shape of the book; and the thoughts of a series of fictional readers who pick up, comment on, and help shape the novel—both the real and fictional versions.

This sounds labyrinthine, but it isn’t, not really. DeWitt has constructed not a maze so much as a garden, where many kinds of writing can thrive side by side. The results can be anarchic, even confusing—I was never entirely clear on the precise relationship between DeWitt and Zozanian, or why the Berlin sections are told from one’s perspective and not the other’s—but they are never simple, blunt, or bland. Like the second-person narrators who pop up to gripe about the book’s use of Arabic or comment on its dissimilarity to the works of Anne Tyler, you will often find yourself wondering, What’s going on? Where is this going? And like them, if you keep reading, you will play a part in making it cohere.

Your Name Here does not treat readers like passive audience members to whom meaning is dictated. It demands work from them, and brazenly risks being misunderstood. This is a welcome development at a time when authors are starting to compete with the ultimate consumer-friendly writing: AI-generated poetry and prose. The text blobs that chatbots produce are becoming more popular, more accessible, and more lifelike—a reader can have a personally customized novel delivered à la carte in minutes. But AI writings are limited by the prompts used to create them and will always reflect the reader-prompter’s existing desires and prejudices, as well as those of the training materials, rather than prodding them to expand. I want my sensibility widened, not pandered to.

Great literature, I would argue, is an active pursuit. It enlists the reader in the act of co-creation and meaning-making. By dramatizing and diversifying its many acts of formation, Your Name Here provides its few but devoted admirers with a surprisingly moving argument for spiky, irregular, even incomplete literature. What emerges is a survival engine—a book that finds its purpose in the collaboration between its co-writers and its readers. That the novel is imperfect, often bewildering, and sometimes a mess is not the point. Its fractured, scattered form, grasping for structure instead of pretending to master it, is an attempt to build a future that will include both author and reader. A simpler book could not do nearly as much.

This is why I try every year to challenge myself. Whatever the limitations of the marketplace, great writing remains as capable as ever of breaking open your sense of the world and your place in it. Reading a novel like Your Name Here, you can come to see that there are no real limits in literature, and fewer in life than you’d expect. And having come to realize that, you might start to wonder along with DeWitt: What if? The real challenge begins.

            <h2>The Question-Mark Mayoralty</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-01</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/zohran-mamdani-new-york-policies/685438/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the months before the election of the young democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani as mayor, panic seized members of New York’s elite business community. Real-estate moguls, hedge-fund princes, and a well-known supermarket-chain magnate forecast disaster. Several of them vowed to move to Texas or Florida, or at least Hoboken, if Mamdani was elected. So far, however, the city hasn’t seen an exodus of its richest residents, and their alarm has lapsed into glum acceptance.

I recently asked Kathryn Wylde, the soon-to-be-retired president of the Partnership for New York City—a sort of chamber of commerce for finance, real-estate, and tech barons—how her members now view Mamdani. Has anything changed? Wylde, who voted for the new mayor, paused. “I would not say it’s positive,” she said. “But those who are at all open to him recognize that he’s smart, and they know that their kids voted for him. Now they are waiting to find out who he is.”

Mamdani, who took office shortly after midnight, remains the question-mark mayor. He ran an unabashedly progressive campaign. But he has made a point of talking with potential adversaries; some Partnership for New York City members have met with Mamdani, for example, and he had a surprisingly warm audience with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office in November. How this charismatic 34-year-old will govern the largest city in America is something of a mystery, with three great uncertainties: How will Mamdani manage his relationship with the rich? How will he approach the Israel-Palestine issue? And how will he respond to the influence of his old friends, the Democratic Socialists of America?

Mamdani called his election a “mandate for change,” a claim somewhat belied by the fact that he won with a narrow 50.8 percent of the vote. And he has not backed away from an ambitious and costly economic agenda: He wants to make day care universal and buses free. He also campaigned on shifting the property-tax burden from working-class, outer-borough homeowners to “richer and whiter” neighborhoods. He has promised to accomplish this agenda by taxing the rich and their corporations and townhouses.

Joseph Heath: The populist revolt against cognitive elites

But Mamdani can’t afford to alienate the wealthy. Millionaires accounted for $34 billion worth of city and state personal-income-tax revenue as of 2022, according to the Citizens Budget Commission, an influential business-backed nonprofit. The commission found that New York’s share of the nation’s millionaires shrank from 12.7 percent in 2010 to 8.7 percent in 2022. Had that share stayed steady, the city and state would have collected an additional $13 billion in income taxes.

Mitchell Moss, an urban-planning professor at NYU, told me that moves against the business community could also turn off people who were drawn to New York by the lure of economic opportunity. “Capitalism is built into the fabric of this city,” Moss said. “Why do you think all the immigrants come here?”

But New York’s business community might not turn out to be quite as oppositional as some expect. Its members are reasonably civic-minded. Wylde said her flock of CEOs are aware that their companies will suffer if talented people cannot afford to live in the city. And some of them don’t take a dire view of all high taxes. Almost two decades ago, the Partnership for New York City endorsed a payroll-tax increase to support mass transit; more recently, it supported a congestion-pricing fee for cars entering New York’s central business district.

Mamdani has left the door ajar to negotiation—and compromise—with business leaders and with Governor Kathy Hochul, a centrist Democrat. Of late, he has talked of balancing a rent freeze for tenants with insurance and tax cuts for landlords in working-class neighborhoods. In such moments, he sounds less like Rosa Luxemburg than a more familiar New York type, the liberal social Democrat—not far off from former Mayor David Dinkins or even Michael Bloomberg.

A more fraught question for Mamdani is how he will handle Palestine and Israel. Mamdani has declared that Palestinian liberation is “at the core” of his politics. He founded his college’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine, and has said he opposes Israel’s identity as a Jewish state. To have a mayor who speaks with antipathy toward Israel and some Jewish Zionist organizations is an unprecedented turn in a city with an estimated 960,000 Jewish residents and three Jewish former mayors.

Mamdani has pledged to order the police to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he sets foot in New York. He recently criticized a prominent synagogue for hosting an event for a nonprofit that encourages immigration to Israel, including to settlements in the West Bank. Under pressure from Jewish leaders, this summer he said he would “discourage” use of the phrase globalize the intifada, though he has said that many people use the phrase simply to show support for Palestinians. Talk of a global intifada took on a chilling resonance this month after two gunmen opened fire on Jews celebrating Hanukkah on Australia’s Bondi Beach, killing 15 people.

“Jews have been comfortable in New York City for a long time,” Moss told me. “For the first time, they sense that they are not automatically safe here.”

A liberal financier, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he doesn’t want to alienate the new mayor, told me that he attended a Mamdani event recently and appreciated that Mamdani listened carefully and took notes. The financier supports Mamdani’s commitment to addressing the city’s gross inequities. “Personally, I find it difficult to believe that an ambitious man like him is going to die on the hill of the Palestinian struggle,” this person said. “But I have lots and lots of Jewish friends who are freaked out.”

Mamdani’s relationship with the Democratic Socialists of America presents the third big question mark. A movement brimming with activist energy and ideological certitude, DSA gave birth to Mamdani’s political career, providing the vigor and street organizing that made him such a formidable candidate. He has promised to remain a loyal DSA cadre. Yet that loyalty will be tested when he departs his rent-stabilized apartment in Queens for the two-century-old mayoral mansion on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. Already, Mamdani has angered influential DSA members with some of his early decisions.

Five years ago, Mamdani wrote that the city’s police department was “wicked” and should be dismantled; this past June, he told Meet the Press that billionaires should not exist. But in November, Mamdani reappointed Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch, a centrist technocrat who hails from a family with a fortune valued at $10 billion. Then he pressured DSA not to put up a candidate to challenge House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, whom leftists view as guilty of the sin of moderation.

DSA comrades were not amused. In December, the two national co-chairs of the organization, Ashik Siddique and Megan Romer, appeared on the Dispatches podcast; the episode was titled “Can DSA Hold Mamdani Accountable?” Rania Khalek, the host, asked Siddique’s and Romer’s view of Tisch, whom Khalek described as coming from “this very billionaire Zionist family.” (Tisch is Jewish.) Neither co-chair challenged Khalek’s description of Tisch. “I don’t think either of us are happy about keeping somebody like that on,” Siddique said. Romer, a member of a Marxist-Leninst faction within DSA, described Mamdani’s decision as “really disappointing.”

In the lead-up to Mamdani’s inauguration, some wealthy New Yorkers sounded, if not accommodating, at least resigned to their fate. This past summer, Ricky Sandler, the CEO of a global equity firm, wrote to his fellow oligarchs warning of the “dire consequences” of a Mamdani victory. But the day after Mamdani’s election, Sandler proclaimed himself ready to tough out the new socialist administration. “NYC will be worse for yesterday’s outcome. Potentially a lot worse,” he wrote. But “I am not planning to move Eminence Capital to another city or state.”

One imagines that such moments of ruling-class resignation could be a minor relief for Mamdani. As for DSA, it has not hesitated to break with prominent progressive politicians, including its most famous member, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez; the national DSA withdrew its endorsement of her, at least in part because she took the heretical step of signing a press release supporting a missile-defense system to protect Israeli civilians. Which leaves the strange possibility that New York’s first socialist mayor might find himself more threatened by his left flank than by the occasional alienated hedge funder.</div>

In July, we published a series of stories about San Francisco’s attempt to address the growing number of homeless and addicted people living on the streets. We followed Evan, who had been homeless for years, as he sought to escape the addiction that was threatening his life. Four months later, we check in on how he’s doing.

No Easy Fix is a three-part series from Radio Atlantic about homelessness and addiction in San Francisco.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Hanna Rosin: I’m Hanna Rosin. This is Radio Atlantic. Last year, we published a series called No Easy Fix. If you haven’t heard it, you should go back and listen. It’s about San Francisco’s attempts to address pockets of homelessness and addiction. It’s also a close and unusually humane portrait of one man—his name is Evan—living on the streets and barely managing his fentanyl addiction.

Rosin: When reporter Ethan Brooks met Evan, he was in bad shape.

Evan: It’s raining, and I’m cold, and I’m hungry. (Laughs.) I’m over it. I’m so over it.

Rosin: Years of addiction had left him with a leg that was so swollen and infected that he was at risk of losing it. On top of that, he couldn’t keep food down. And he didn’t know why. His best friend, Joe, was worried.

Joe Wynne: I mean, I expect Evan to die out there. I have seen no pieces of evidence that persisted beyond 72 hours of him heading in any other direction, and I’ve seen 10,000 pieces of evidence of him headed towards death.

Rosin: Evan ended up in the hospital. And he agreed to enter an addiction treatment program in San Francisco—one that looked a lot like the rehabs where he had tried and failed to get clean before.

Evan: I could feel, like—in my head, I’m like, I’m gonna be successful this time. But like, I’m still a little worried about having doubt—like, What if I don’t, though?

Rosin: Ethan Brooks is going to take it from here.

Ethan Brooks: The last time I saw Evan, he was in a room in San Francisco General Hospital.

Brooks: We spoke for a few hours, and this is how our conversation ended.

Brooks: I mean, I’ll be able to call you on the phone and stuff, but I just won’t be able to get you in person for a while.

Evan: Yeah, I’ll definitely put you on the list of people I can talk to in treatment.

Brooks: Evan had been accepted to long-term residential rehab in San Francisco. He wanted to finally get clean, and give space and time for his leg to heal. And he wanted to reconnect with his son, who he hadn’t seen in years.

Joe—that’s Evan’s friend—bought him a cellphone, started a group chat, plugged in the phone next to Evan’s bed, and flew home, back to his family in Washington State. So Evan was once again on his own.

A month passed, and I didn’t hear from him. And then, he texted: He had 30 days clean.

To celebrate, Joe sent videos from Cameo; that’s the app where minor celebrities send personalized messages. In one, a group of burly dancers delivers Joe’s message:

Island Boy: Yo, Evan, I heard you’re 30 days sober off fentanyl.

Brooks: Another was from one of the twin TikTok stars in the Island Boys. I can’t tell which one.

Island Boy: So keep on going. It goes day by day, my boy. Keep doing your thing because that fetty ain’t no joke, my boy.

Brooks: About two months later, there was a notification in the group chat, just under the videos. It said, “Evan has left the conversation.”

Brooks: When I called his cell, there was nothing.

(Voicemail greeting plays: “I’m sorry, the person you are trying to reach has a voicemail box that has not been set up yet. Please try your call again later. Goodbye.”)

Brooks: It was the same at the rehab facility.

Operator: So I don’t know—I can’t confirm or deny that the person is here. But I could take a message if you’d like to leave one.

Brooks: And then, on November 17, seven months since I had last spoken to him, I got an email.

The account photo was of a man in a pressed lavender button-down shirt tucked into jeans, with one hand on his hip, posing in front of a field. It was Evan. We set up a video call.

Evan: I haven’t had an Apple product in a long time, and this MacBook is pretty frustrating.

Evan: Yeah, just all I wanted to do is scroll down, and I haven’t quite figured that out yet. So I click on something, and then use the arrow keys ’cause I can’t find the fucking scroll in the corner.

Brooks: Turns out this isn’t easy if you’ve missed the last five years of technological advance.

Brooks: Just getting Evan on a call didn’t guarantee much.

Rehab is definitely better than living on the street, but it’s not necessarily a place where you get clean. In 2023 and 2024, San Francisco’s largest publicly funded rehab provider saw a string of overdose deaths inside their facilities. Evan says he’s been in others, where patients and staff were still using.

I had known where Evan was, but until this conversation, I didn’t know how he was, or what had happened in the seven months since we last spoke—if he had changed.

Back in April, when Evan was talking about getting clean, this was not the first time the scene had played out—not Joe’s first time flying down to find him, not the first time he was hospitalized. There was a sort of script for what would happen next.

Evan: I would make this whole plan about going to treatment, and as soon as I would be alone and be out outside of the hospital, I would just get out.

Brooks: Evan would get his few days living inside; Joe would go home to his family. Then the hospital would arrange for Evan to travel to rehab via a taxi or a bus—

Evan:  And then as soon as I hit the Tenderloin, I would just be gone instantly.

Brooks: In those 10 unsupervised minutes, Evan would disappear. He would get out of the taxi, go back to shoplifting, back to selling what he stole, back to fentanyl.

That was Evan’s choice. It’s true that Evan is responsible for his own actions in those 10 minutes. It’s also true that almost no one beats a fentanyl addiction like his through willpower alone.

This time around, Evan’s first cue, the part in the script where he would normally just disappear, came when the hospital wanted to discharge him. Hospital stays are expensive; they wanted to send him to a shelter for the weekend before rehab admission opened up on Monday.

But the hospital’s addiction team knew if he went to a shelter, he would relapse. They convinced the doctors to keep him for the weekend, despite the expense.

The first opportunity to disappear came and went.

Then it was time to take a taxi from the hospital to rehab, which is called Harbor Light.

Evan: One of the addiction-team nurses after his shift stayed in the cab with me and then rode there to Harbor Light and then stayed there with me for an hour to make sure that I was, like, cool and didn’t have any second thoughts and then left.

Brooks: So another opportunity to exit had come and gone because someone took the time to stay with him.

Brooks: Do you remember your first day, or first days, at Harbor Light?

Evan: Yeah, I remember. I was just sleeping so much. I would get up and just eat and pee. They would just bring me my meals. So it was kinda like I was in the hospital again.

The task of showering again, I was like, Ugh. And just the task of having to unwrap my leg, get in the shower, do the whole—I was just like, I don’t even care. I’ll just be smelly. And it was just my brain deciding what was important and what wasn’t. For so long, that wasn’t important.

Brooks: Before Evan arrived at Harbor Light, there were two things, after five years living on the street, that had pushed him toward recovery.

The first was his leg, which had this huge open wound.

The other thing that brought him here was that he couldn’t keep food down. At first, the doctor thought he might have celiac disease—gluten intolerance. And then they found out that his iron was dangerously low; he was anemic.

Evan: At first, they thought me being anemic was a diet thing ’cause of just eating nothing but candy and ice cream on the street for so long. Even at the time, if somebody were to tell me, Oh, if you keep doing fetty like that, you’re gonna end up becoming anemic, I would’ve been like, So? Obviously, my leg was falling off, so it wasn’t—

Brooks: Yeah, it’s like, Who cares about being anemic when your leg is falling off?

Brooks: When I first met Evan, he was living a life that, on the good days, felt like a type of freedom: He could fend for himself. He wasn’t responsible to anyone.

But even just a few days into treatment, he could already see it more clearly: It wasn’t freedom; it was dependence, in just about every sense of the word.

Evan was living like a child, literally eating nothing but candy and ice cream.

Evan: I remember being nervous because I was glad to kind of get my life going again, but at the same time, I had been enjoying not being a responsible adult for such a long time.

I was kind of nervous to be like, Great, now not only do I gotta learn how to be an adult again. I gotta figure out how I’m gonna deal with all the shame and guilt of not being one for so long.

Brooks: Harbor Light, Evan’s rehab, is run by the Salvation Army. Apart from being known as a strict, and rather intensive, treatment program, the basics will be familiar: meetings, meditation, acknowledging a higher power, celebrating milestones.

Evan: I feel like everybody’s congratulating me for learning how to, like, pee standing. Like, Pee-pee standing up. Like, Good job, Evan. Like, You use the bathroom on your own. No more diapers.

That’s how I would always be, like, Congratulations for catching up with the rest of us, like, for the last 15—you know? And so I would feel kind of dumb about it. Even two months in, talking about it with some of the counselors there, they were like, How much time do you have? And I was like, Oh, I have two months, and people were clapping or whatever. And I’m just like, Yeah, it’s whatever. It’s two months.

Brooks: In real terms, two months was definitely not “whatever” for Evan. It’s the longest he had been clean in a very long time. But the old temptations were still there.

To start, Evan was still in San Francisco. Just about every day, he saw people he knew from his life before. And beyond that, even after two months clean, his leg just wasn’t healing the way he hoped it would.

Evan: My leg improved, and then it just stopped, and it was a really slow progression. I didn’t know if I was doing something wrong or if it was going to get worse again.

Brooks: It started to feel like, If his leg wasn’t going to get better, if he stood a chance of losing it, what was the point?

Evan: I was like, All right, just—we’ll do the six months, show everybody that I can, I’ve tried, and then I’ll go back out.

Brooks: In his years living on the street, Evan managed to look after himself. But there were other people, important people, who he overlooked.

Evan has a son. They talked on the phone sometimes, through Evan’s mom or sister. But as his kid got older, he didn’t want to talk to Evan, and Evan didn’t want to talk to anyone.

That changed at Harbor Light.  If Evan wanted any shot at reconnecting, he’d not only have to learn to be an adult in just a few months, but also learn how to be a father.

Evan: I had this in my head, like, a game plan for how I was gonna tackle talking to my family again. But my counselor there was like, Nope, that’s not how we’re gonna do it, not definitely gonna do it like that.

Brooks: What was the game plan, and why was it rejected?

Evan: Like calling them, like, once a week and then calling my son and then talking to him. But my counselor decided that You can’t use your phone at all for the first 30 days; it’s a complete blackout. And then, after that, you only get two 10-minute phone calls a day.

Literally, when I would call my mom, one, by the time she answered, it would probably kill a whole minute, two. She would spend, like, five minutes crying. So now I’m left to have, like, four more minutes. I’m like, Mom, you just—what am I supposed to do? I—and then there’s my whole phone call for the day, and then, if I call somebody else, and they don’t answer, and that’s it.

So he was like, You’re going to write letters, and that way you can speak more, get it down, and honestly, it’ll feel more heartfelt that you’d spent the time to write it all, your feelings and everything, out on paper and mail it.

Brooks: So that’s what Evan did. This was the beginning of what would become a relentless mailing campaign aimed at his son.

It hasn’t been easy to get much out of him. Evan hadn’t seen his son in eight years. No one would blame him for not wanting to talk.

But over the months, Evan began to learn what he had missed. Everyone thinks his kid looks like him. He’s an adventurous eater like Evan, has a sweet tooth too, also like Evan. There was a picture of him trying a chocolate-covered cricket on a field trip to D.C. And he was a bit of a performer.

Evan: For example, for his fifth-grade graduation, he surprised everybody and dressed up as a banana—

Evan: —and walked across the stage in a giant banana suit. He really likes the clarinet. Actually, he’s, like, first chair in his class and then third chair all-county or something. He is really into it.

Brooks: In October, six months into treatment, Evan’s family flew out to visit him: his mom, his sister, and his son. Evan’s friend Joe and Joe’s son, Barrett, came down too.

The last time Evan saw his son, he was 5 years old. Now he was 13, and was growing a mustache.

They went to the arcade, did an escape room. Evan said they’ll still be in there if it wasn’t for the kids. Barrett and Evan’s son were fast friends.

Evan: The first night we went out somewhere, they were throwing something—it was like candy or something—and something bounced off and then hit me. And then they, like, giggled and ran away. And my son was like, Where’d it go? And then Barrett was like, “It hit your dad.” And it just—I have never—I hadn’t been a dad for such a long time, so it was just a kind of surreal moment. He didn’t even call me Dad; it was somebody else calling me Dad. But it was more of just a reminder of like, “Oh, yeah, I am.”

Salvation Army officer: Do you have any guests that you wanna welcome?

Brooks: The same weekend his family visited, after six months of treatment, Evan graduated from Harbor Light. In the video, he’s standing at a lectern, wearing a yellow plaid shirt. He says he’s trying not to cry.

Evan: A wise woman once told me, “The only thing that you have to change is everything.” I look forward to being the best son, brother, and father and friend I can be. Thank you.

Brooks: After graduation, Joe and Barrett and Evan’s mom and sister and son flew home.

Brooks: You guys are still writing letters here and there, or no?

Evan: Yeah, yeah, definitely. I just sent one. I’ll take the—I sent him letters. He doesn’t really send me anything back. I don’t know if the option was given to him, kind of, like, Your dad wants your cellphone number. Do you want to give it to him, or do you want to just keep writing letters, or what do you wanna do? And I could just see him being on his phone, like, Yeah, whatever, letters.

And so I was like, Oh, well, if that’s what he wants to do, then I’m just going to bombard him with letters, to where he’s like, “Damn it, I should have did phone call.” So he hasn’t caved yet, but I definitely send him two or three a month.

Brooks: Evan is now in a sober-living house. He works in a kitchen a few days a week, and on the other days, he takes classes to become an addiction-treatment peer counselor.

That question of if it was possible for Evan to stay clean this long, so far, has been answered. His leg isn’t fully healed; even after eight months, the wound is still there. But he can walk around fine and will have a surgery soon to help with his circulation.

So now the question for Evan isn’t so much if he’ll live, but how.

A few weeks ago, Evan was riding the bus home from a meeting when he ran into an old friend from when he was living on the street.

Evan: And I talked to him the whole bus ride and when I got off I helped him carry his stuff off and hung out with him for a little bit, but when I had went to talk and hang out with him and invited him to sit next to me, it was just kind of like, Here’s this really dirty, gross-looking homeless dude, and I’m cleaned up enough to where people wouldn’t suspect that of me at all. And then I’m inviting him over next to me. When he came up to talk to me, before I had noticed him. They were thinking, I’m probably gonna get pissed-off; this homeless guy’s coming to ask me for money or something. And it totally wasn’t what they expected.

Brooks: They see like a homeless guy approaching somebody who’s just, like, a normal guy working a job in San Francisco or something—

Evan: Exactly, coming home from work late at night and—

Brooks: —and you kind of see an old friend.

Evan: Right. Or me. When I see somebody in that same position, it’s kind of hard for me to—like, someone with a fucked-up leg, or just can’t get up from somewhere ’cause they’re so sick. It’s like, Fuck.

Brooks: This isn’t the only time this has happened recently. Evan sees himself all over the city. When cops and EMTs are trying to move someone along passed out outside of a coffee shop, there he is. When his co-workers at the kitchen complain about homeless and addicted people, he fantasizes about telling them about his past.

He lives just two blocks away from where he spent the last five years, but he might as well live in another world. Still, the boundaries between old and new can be porous.

Evan: This last couple nights, I’ve had to go to meetings because I’ve been bored, and I really kind of miss that hustle of—kind of the excitement of, I gotta go boost from here and dodge the security guard and then get on the BART and then dodge the BART police and then steal from this store and then come back out, and then just all that excitement bullshit. I kind of miss the chaos.

Brooks: He tries not to think too much about the future. A lot of treatment, at this point, is still focused on the present. But he does have one idea for what he might do.

Evan: My background permitting, I would like to be an armed security guard. I think that would be cool.

Evan: Because that’s the kind of craziness that I think I need. Not, like, with-a-gun armed, but like with a baton or pepper spray. I’m not saying that every day I’m gonna go to work that I’m gonna be like this, this douche security guard that, like, pepper-sprays you.

Brooks: It’s so funny. It’s like you’re just becoming your like worst enemy from not long ago.

Evan: In a way, yeah. But I would also think I’d have—I think I could give back to Target for all the shit I stole by being a good security guard.

Brooks: Just going back to that same Target and going to work that. Where was that?

Brooks: There was a story Evan told me back before he started treatment. To support his habit, he was going to the same Target in Emeryville, outside of Oakland, day after day after day, stealing stuff and selling it in the Mission District.

He went to that same Target in Emeryville so many times in a row, it had begun to feel absurd that he hadn’t been caught yet.

Brooks: You were like, I can’t believe this hasn’t happened. It feels like Groundhog’s Day.

Brooks: He told himself that when they did catch him, that’s when he’d get clean. But it never happened.

Brooks: Does that at all feel like an attempt to go back and stop your past self? Fulfilling that wish you had for someone to catch you at that point.

Evan: Right, and just give them that, like, Oh, it’s over finally.

Evan: It rains here on Christmas for a week every year, and I always know it’s coming, and I know it’s gonna come this year, and it’ll be the first time where I will be inside, and I’m so grateful for that.

Brooks: Evan will stay in San Francisco for the time being. In the spring, he’ll fly out to Washington to visit Joe.

            <h2>The Cult of Costco</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-31</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/2025/12/costco-is-an-american-achievement/685411/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>

            <div id="article-text">This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

Because every day is Black Friday at Costco, I choose to go on Saturday. I like to get there early. I always park in the same spot (right next to the cart return), and wait with the other die-hards. It has the thrill of a stakeout, absent any crime or danger. When the doors open, we move toward the entrance in an orderly march. There’s a small gasp upon entry—the kind of quiet awe that one feels before the most epic human achievements, as when stepping across the threshold of St. Peter’s or the Chartres Cathedral. But in this place, there is no baroque majesty, no stained glass, just abundance bathed in light. In the sweep of human history generally marked by scarcity and want, here is bounty on an unimaginable scale; here is a year’s supply of mozzarella sticks; here is a hot dog and a drink for $1.50; here is a monument of our civilization, in more than 600 locations across the United States.

I take the ease with which I resort to Costco talk—about produce prices in particular—as a worrying sign that I’ve become a middle-aged bore. But there’s something happening at Costco that I think goes beyond bell peppers (note that my family eats a lot of them, and, boy, are they a bargain). Costco is a marvel not just historically but also in this moment. In an age of broken institutions, insufferable politics, and billionaire businessmen auditioning to be Bond villains, most things feel like they’re getting worse. Costco seems to stay the same. The employees are generally satisfied. The customers are thrilled by the simple act of getting a good deal. All of it makes a unique space in contemporary American life, a space of cooperation, courtesy, and grown-ups mostly acting like grown-ups.

It starts with the thing you’re pushing, the vessel into which you shall receive thy bounty. The cart is improbably large yet easily maneuvered through the warehouse’s aisles. Through some invisible quality control, the sad and broken-down ones you find at the supermarket—unlevel, rear wheel locked, front wheel spinning—seem to be ushered quietly into oblivion at Costco. You’re at the helm of a Peterbilt with the handling of a Porsche.

Traffic is never light, but things generally move along. Pushing something that large requires an awareness of oneself in space. Those who might need to consult a list or message their spouse—should I grab this brick of cheddar cheese?—seem to know to step off to the side. At my store in Granger, Indiana, where elbows are perhaps not as sharp as at some other locations, patrons appear to have an unspoken patience with the person who wants to give a bag of avocados an extra squeeze, or hold a double shell of raspberries up to the light. There are occasional expressions of camaraderie as well: “We can’t get enough of that stuff,” somebody might say as you load two pillow-size bags of Pirate’s Booty into the cart.

You might see the bargain-hunting bonds among Costco shoppers as a function of the chain’s history. To join its ranks costs $65 a year; the store’s membership model originates from a nonprofit wholesale collective for federal employees called Fedco, founded in Los Angeles in the 1940s. The genealogy is complex (a three-hour-long Acquired podcast episode traces it in full), but one trait has endured: the company is animated—even as a for-profit enterprise—by the idea of bringing good value to its members. This has yielded a cultlike loyalty, such that the company can largely rely on happy members to do its advertising and marketing by word of mouth—or perhaps by wearing prized company merch. Kirkland Signature, Costco’s in-house label for hundreds of products, is a kind of anti-brand that happens to be one of the world’s largest for consumer packaged goods. Just buying something under its comically dull logo makes you feel like a smart shopper: You’ve made the wise decision to forgo a better look for a better price.

Costco is a place that encourages, and rewards, just knowing the drill—and the drill isn’t hard to figure out: Move along. Don’t block the way. Unload your cart onto the conveyor belt with dispatch, but leave the heavy stuff. Make the barcodes visible. Violators are never exiled, but transgression, I know from experience, is not without shame. Once, I left the cart in front of the flower display loaded down with 120 pounds of water-softening salt. When I returned, the grandmother who was blocked from the flowers (find me a cheaper dozen roses!)—well, she gave me the finger.

The veneer of civilization is always thin, even at Costco, as one is reminded before major holidays, or in the vicinity of the samples. When there’s a Christmas feast to be provisioned, or half a bite of pizza to be tasted, order breaks down, and with it, spatial awareness, common courtesy, and the Golden Rule. We’re circling like buzzards; we’re blocking the way; we’re shaking our heads at the nerve of the person who took the last three.

But the checkout restores us to our senses. At my Costco, there is usually a line to get in line for the cashier. People can game the system, but most quietly queue up, content to wait their turn to pick a register. The clerks are cheerier than they should be before this endless current of humans and their stuff. Whatever lapses I might have had in the store (did I take a second sample? maybe), here, I’m on my best behavior.

Out of the store, car loaded, cart returned, I tighten up and steel myself for the road. Have you seen the way these people drive nowadays?

This much you already know: Many Americans are alone, friendless, isolated, undersexed, sick of online dating, glued to their couches, and transfixed by their phones, their mouths starting to close over from lack of use. Our national loneliness is an “urgent public health issue,” according to the surgeon general. The time we spend socializing in person has plummeted in the past decade, and anxiety and hopelessness have increased. Roughly one in eight Americans reports having no friends; the rest of us, according to my colleague Olga Khazan, never see our friends, stymied by the logistics of scheduling in a world that has become much more frenetic and much less organized around religion and civic clubs. “You can’t,” she writes, “just show up on a Sunday and find a few hundred of your friends in the same building.”

But what if you could, at least on a smaller scale? What if there were a way to smush all your friends together in one place—maybe one with drinks and snacks and chairs? What if you could see your work friends and your childhood friends and the people you’ve chatted amiably with at school drop-off all at once instead of scheduling several different dates? What if you could introduce your pals and set them loose to flirt with one another, no apps required? What if you could create your own Elks Lodge, even for just a night?

I’m being annoying, obviously—there is a way! It’s parties, and we need more of them.

Read. Here are the books that made our editors think the most this year.

Remember. In 2012, Emily Chertoff explored how wealthy Americans celebrated New Year’s Eve in the Gilded Age.

If AI disappeared, do you really think they wouldn&#39;t find some other convenient excuse to raise prices, just because they can, and you would be whining just as hard about bitcoin, or EVs, or unreliable renewable energy, or ... ?

            <div id="article-text">Well, somewhat. To not see the bubble and how there is no way in Hell most investors will even recover their investments requires you to be deeply in delusion at this time.

Do you think they&#39;ll switch to US Treasuries?

but ends in a stampede. Some people are going to be left holding the bag... of manure.

OpenAI is projected to have a revenue of a little less than $13B in 2025. That is revenue. Not profit. They didn&#39;t have a profit for this year, but instead had a loss of $16B. Their spend commitment is $1.5T!!!!

This lunacy is not limited to OpenAI. People have lost their collective minds. This is not going to end well.

It really more or less is limited to OpenAI. If their investors lose faith it can all go away overnight.

Anthropic might be in a little trouble, but Gemini will be fine and so will Grok. Nvidia is obviously going to be sad that they&#39;re no longer printing money.

Get out as soon as you can. The ultra rich are the one ones that are going to walk away unscathed.

Plus Trump. We can&#39;t count him as ultra rich until he proves it by releasing his tax returns like he said he would around a decade ago.

Trump may be ultra-rich or simply very rich, but what&#39;s more important to remember is that Trump is a whore for the ultra-rich, always has been.

It seems he has his dirty little hands in quite a few places:

https://www.nytimes.com/intera... [nytimes.com]

It is sickening to read. One of his latest gambits, admittedly small potatoes, is his defrocking the committee running Wash. D.C.&#39;s golf courses. He intends his golf company to run them instead. They will squeeze out the common folk and the only ones allowed to play are the ones who can pay the exorbitant fees membership in one of his stupid clubs requires. There&#39;s no enterprise small enough that he cannot see fit to destroy it.

Let this news be digested by Wall Street later today. Others will follow suit.

Keep eating those paint chips!You know your snappy comeback is really fucking old when Government regulation actually worked to make it that irrelevant.

Good to have a minor respite in the constant churn.

I see why you, of all people, feel relieved over this...Tim Cook can&#39;t beat you for not buying the phone that he didn&#39;t release.

But remember, that doesn&#39;t mean that he can&#39;t find another reason.

There hasn&#39;t been a “must have” innovation in mobile phones for a long time. They&#39;re a solved problem, like laptops.

Start releasing different types that appeal to different segments on a multi-year cadence. Release a new Mini version every four years. Do the same for the Max on a different year, the dumb skinny fashion accessory one the year after that, and so on.

There might be something to this. You&#39;ll still have a new product launch each year for the people who watch keynotes and just want a reason to give Apple money. And for the people who buy technology to solve a need, there would be actual generational improvements in the product lines.

On the other hand if they only released one every 4 years you could be buying 3 year old tech when you need a new phone instead of something that is current.If a car manufacturer offered their latest model of car every five years and you bought it in year four, you own their most current tech no matter what the calendar says. Unless you live inside a smartphone testing lab, the consumer definition of &quot;current&quot; is good enough.  Your definition was outdated by the end of this sentence.

When the economy isn&#39;t racing towards a grossly denied Recession.  Now Apple is forced to reveal their hand in choosing to skip making money this year.  Keynotes aren&#39;t going to empty backrooms overflowing with unsold inventory.You know why you can walk into damn near any cellular provider and get your choice of any iPhone17 or iPhone16, along

If it has to be thicker for battery life reasons, that&#39;s fine.  It&#39;s going in a case with a holster anyway, and getting clipped to a holster on my belt.  Thickness doesn&#39;t matter.  Features matter.  Width matters.  Height matters.  Usability matters.
I thought I was the only one that still used a holster! I found my people!
 
Also, fully agree about the TouchID being superior to FaceID. I wish Apple actually did proper market research, and talked to those of us that are willing to buy a &#39;pro&#39; iphone, but don&#39;t want a bloody tablet. Give me a good camera, storage, battery life, and a 5S or 6S form factor.. Hell, I&#39;d accept a 7! And to your point, it can be a few mm thicker, that&#39;s fine!

I&#39;d also be okay with a 5s-sized foldable with a screen on the outside and a home button.  Unfold if you want a bigger screen.

Yup. The lack of Touch ID is what keeps me from upgrading. Still using my trusty iPhone 8, and when the finally goes under Iâ(TM)ll have to find an SE to replace it with. They have Touch ID on the iPad and MacBook, so bring it back on the phone already. Face ID is a no-go for me, and always will be.

Might as well ask for a pony too while you&#39;re at it. :-)

What I want is an iPhone 17 Micro that&#39;s about the size of an iPhone 5s, but with the same cameras and CPU and maximum storage as the iPhone 17 Pro model has, so that I&#39;m not having to settle for a cut-rate feature set in exchange for a usable form factor.  If it has to be thicker for battery life reasons, that&#39;s fine.  It&#39;s going in a case with a holster anyway, and getting clipped to a holster on my belt.  Thickness doesn&#39;t matter.  Features matter.  Width matters.  Height matters.  Usability matters.You end by claming size doesn&#39;t matter.  And yet start your statement with the physical demand of a &quot;Micro&quot; model.It&#39;s consumers like you that should be shackled to an Engineering desk with the seasoned EE/ME who&#39;s going to be sitting there with that wholly justified look on their face when they say to you &quot;Now YOU tell ME how you&#39;re shoving 20 pounds of shit in a 5-pound bag.&quot;

Yes, my 12 mini is getting too slow! :( Or at least update SE to have newer hardware parts!!

There hasn&#39;t been a “must have” innovation in mobile phones for a long time. They&#39;re a solved problem, like laptops.Start releasing different types that appeal to different segments on a multi-year cadence. Release a new Mini version every four years. Do the same for the Max on a different year, the dumb skinny fashion accessory one the year after that, and so on.Apple could do that.  Sure.Or, Apple could actually acknowledge and admit there&#39;s a Recession.  Which is the real reason they&#39;re not going to make or sell jack shit in the New n&#39; Shiny category that requires 90% of consumers to take out a fucking loan just to afford it. At those prices, every model is a dumb fashion accessory.

Most Apple shareholders know that come WWDC and iPhone time, their shares will get a bump in price.  If the iPhone not introduced, this may cause Apple&#39;s stock to take a huge hit, mainly because Samsung, Huawai, and others are still introducing phones, and Samsung&#39;s camera setup is almost an order of magnitude more megapixels than Apple&#39;s.

Apple may be forced to, just by precedent, introduce something even if it is just making an &quot;S&quot; version that has some basic improvements and little else.  It won&#39;t be a hi

Wasn&#39;t Apple just suing someone for leaking future phone products like the foldable iphone? I&#39;m guessing... 100% guessing... as I have no insider knowledge of anything, nor am I starting a job at Apple on Monday. Memory prices and Apple&#39;s failed attempts at AI integration are some of the reasons this report is floating around.

After removing the charger, headphone socket, SIM card and other things, they have finally removed the phone itself. Presumably one can now simply send Apple a few hundred dollarpounds a month and not have to faff with any devices. Hurrah!

That&#39;s around 50,000 more than I expected for that extremely expensive trash.

This is sloppy, lazy thinking. The Apple Vision Pro is one of, if not the most advanced consumer technologies ever released. Just because it’s not affordable doesn’t mean it’s not a fantastic value. You get a full movie theater experience in your home (or airplane seat, etc.). You get a gigantic, crisp display for your laptop and phone. Those two things are worth thousands. Now ply me with your too heavy/proprietary OS argument.

Its useless.  It doesn&#39;t do anything anyone needs or wants.  Which is why VR headsets have failed in the market repeatedly, and at much cheaper pricepoints.  That&#39;s why it&#39;s not a fantastic value-  it&#39;s no better than existing tech, it doesn&#39;t solve a problem, nobody  wants the category, and it&#39;s priced at  nearly 10x the competition.  On every front it&#39;s the exact opposite of value.

Just because it’s not affordable doesn’t mean it’s not a fantastic value.No, just because it&#39;s not affordable doesn&#39;t mean that it isn&#39;t good technology.  However, being unaffordable does mean that it&#39;s a bad value.  $3500 is cheap for a car because of what the car offers, but $3500 is expensive for what the Vision Pro offers.  Hence, it&#39;s a bad value.  If buyers considered it to be a good value, it would have garnered more demand.

My mom always told me not to sit so close to the TV.

They beat the CybertruckEven robotic colectomies beat the Cybertruck.

Even robotic colectomies beat the Cybertruck.

Actually, the Cybertruck outsold a lot of other EVs combined.

Option 1
         Chevrolet Blazer EV ~20,800
        Nissan Leaf ~10,000 (approx historical)
        Kia EV6 ~8,000 (approx)Total ~38,800

Option 2
        Rivian R1T ~15,000
        Nissan Leaf ~10,000

The Ford F-150 Lightning, widely seen as a failure and canceled, outsold the cybertruck by about double. So no, I wouldn&#39;t say the cybertruck is successful by any measure.

Not defending Cybertruck, Tesla, or Musk... but the facts... &quot;Tesla sold 38,965 Cybertruck pickup trucks in 2024, according to estimates from Cox Automotive. In its first full year on sale, the Cybertruck dunked on the electric version of the famed Ford F-150. It ran circles around the Chevrolet Silverado EV. It trounced the Rivian R1T, too. It was the best-selling electric pickup in the U.S., and the fifth best-selling battery-powered model overall.&quot;

Except even Apple doesn&#39;t want them back.

They&#39;d have shipped a lot more if they made something that wasn&#39;t over-priced useless pointless crap.It&#39;s not useless, or pointless, or crap.  In fact, its the opposite of all of those things.  It&#39; just priced 10X more than 99% of the population is willing to pay for something that does the things it does.

Exactly. People are upset about affordability and will overlook value and quality. That said, Apple made a few strange decisions... it shouldn&#39;t have a front facing screen. Electronics should be in the battery pack, not on the face. Material selection should prioritize weight savings, the battery should be wearable without accessories, it needs an USB-C thunderbolt port by default. All straightforward fixes for a company like apple.

WHat were there expectations?  If they were much higher, then it&#39;s a disappointment.  If it was inline, then it isn&#39;t.  How much did they spend in R&D on the device?  Again, if it was a net loss, it&#39;s a disappointment.  If it was a profit, it might not be.  (A loss might also be ok if it launches a category that becomes successful, but this doesn&#39;t seem to be the case here).

Given that they shut down manufacturing, it seems very likely they sold way under expectation and overbuilt capacity.  It also seems likely in that case they lost money.  Which would make this a disappointment.

Experience only matters if you make a new version.  Otherwise the experience has no value.  The patents are only useful if enforcable, and if they provide defensive value against companies they don&#39;t already have defense against, orif the category becomes big enough to leverage against others who do succeed.  Seeing as they shut down production, it&#39;s unlikely they will create a new version anytime soon.  There&#39;s not enough demand.  They have an extensive patent portfolio, so the defensive value is questiona

There is no solid evidence that manufacturing was shut down. You are believing what some guy wants you to think.

Has there ever been a successful VR headset that has survived long term after the initial launch frenzy?   It just seems like something that people are trying to will into existence, but most people have no interest in it.   A niche product for hardcore gamers and a few useful applications in science and medicine.    No one&#39;s come up with a &#39;gotta have it&#39; application for them.   Most of generative AI is trash, but there are more useful applications for that than for VR headsets.

Has there ever been a successful VR headset that has survived long term after the initial launch frenzy? Not one made by Apple.

I&#39;m kind of surprised that it&#39;s as high as that, frankly. I figured there&#39;d be a giant fanboi blip followed by a continuous flat line.

I suspect there is a market for them as a design/visualization tool for professionals.  They aren&#39;t cheap or easy enough for casual entertainment, but for people with corporate budgets and a need to see what something will look like in 3D space before committing the money to actually create it, they are good deal.

Yeah, I would have guessed it would be more like 4 or 5 units

My company was willing to consider getting me one to use as a screen while flying and traveling (which I do a lot of).  So I got the demoit was ok.  I’m pretty all in these days on Apple, and I used to work in AR, so you’d think I’d be a perfect customer.  But it just didn’t seem worth it.

This is the 6th or 8th time? The tech is not there, the software is not there and people do not actually need it or really want it an the price-tag is too high.

VR is doing just fine, only Apple has failed here. This year saw again millions of devices sold making Quest headsets far more popular than many (very much not failed) gaming consoles. The hardware is just fine, the software is great within its niche (gaming, with plenty of great games to choose from), and the price is 1/3rd of that of an xbox putting it within reach of any commoner.

But you have your head stuck in the sand (or somewhere worse) as usual with every VR article. You continue to comment about th

The reality is more nuanced. The tech is there... but Apple hasn&#39;t delivered a balanced system. Its incredibly advanced and will matured into a much better selling product once they bring things like weight and cost down.

. Its incredibly advanced and will matured into a much better selling product once they bring things like weight and cost down.Nothing &quot;incredible&quot; here except to the usual clueless people. And &quot;once they bring things like weight and cost down&quot;? Sure, some time in the next 30-100 years that will likely happen. But not anytime soon. Because these are major reason all the other VR hypes failed.

It&#39;s overpriced Apple slop which has virtually no application - mostly due to Apple&#39;s inability to sell the consumer a device that just does what they want.  If Apple can&#39;t subsequently nickel and dime you to death, they have no interest in the product.

Consequently, it&#39;s a device for spendthrift morons, not the average consumer.  It&#39;s a measure of Apple&#39;s arrogance that they actually thought they could get away with it.

Scientists estimate there are 70 kg of bacteria in a human being.  But they are not us.  We are not our genes.  We are not our bones.  We are not our flesh.  Identical twins are not a single discontinuous life form.  Siamese twins are multiple people, not one.

We are the complex continuous interaction of nerves cells. We are our thoughts.  Or as I prefer...

We are the stuff that dreams are made of.

70Kg is almost an entire normal healthy human being.

Do you really mean to say or believe that the entire human body is foreign bacteria?

Average adult male 70 kg, average adult female 61 kg https://hypertextbook.com/fact... [hypertextbook.com]

Yeah, I thought we were &quot;ugly bags of mostly water&quot;?

I&#39;ve heard that numerically it&#39;s 10:1 bacteria: human cells.

Here it says 1-3% of human body mass https://www.sciencefocus.com/t... [sciencefocus.com]

0.2 kg on average in a human being, 200 grams

Note AI told me it was 7 KG and then I mistyped.   I have no idea what the real number is

Assuming that comment is intended to be serious, I think you should learn to be more critical with things you read. It will serve you well in the future.

Also, I have the rights to a superfluvial transportation device, if you pm me I&#39;ll give you a good price!

Our cells inherit a lot of stuff as well. In the early days, mitochondria were actually separate organisms until sometime in the past, a cell decided to absorb it. It made sense - the mitochondria took nutrients in and produced ATP out, which cells used to absorb to power themselves. Eventually a cell decided to absorb mitochondria into themselves and feed it with nutrients and take the ATP that comes out.

That&#39;s why mitochondrial DNA exists and is often a separate line from your normal DNA.

ignorant nonsense, it takes more than a uterus to carry a pregnancy.

only sexually mature biological females, women can do it.

LOLZ only women give birth.   A woman who later takes hormones to grow a beard, and has her body mutilated to make a penis-shaped thing is still a woman.

Victims are never survivors: they&#39;re animals or humans which have been killed in a religious sacrifice.

How is pointing out unscientific nonsense being threatened? The ones who are threatened are the ones making up gender nonsense for some kind of special consideration and special treatment, society has had enough.

You&#39;re so threatened you&#39;ve cried about it multiple time just here and now.

Same with all your DEI nonsense. Anyone not a straight white man is DEI. Why are you so scared of people different to you? Have you seen Trump&#39;s administration? The least qualified are all straight white men. Sabotaging himself just to virtue signal to you scared little boys, hilarious.

these things have been known for decades, what is the point here?

Actually, speaking as a Costco customer, it is not that way at all. They have quite nice produce and meats, and one does not have to buy in mass quantities. Sure, you buy a pack of, say, four strip steaks instead of a single one, but it is not focused on stocking up for the next month or two. And, yes, you have to buy a 36-pack of, say, Dr. Pepper instead of just a six pack, but it works quite well for our needs (a couple whose two children are grown and living independently).Thanks. I&#39;ve obviously been a bit harsh on Costco. I shouldn&#39;t be so quick to judge.

We met someone who does quality inspections for Costco, they&#39;re amazingly thorough.  A lot of the products are organic, free range, and/or sustainably sourced, which surprised us.  What surprised us even more is the quality of the produce.  Yeah, we have to buy five pounds of sweet potatoes or a three pound bag of Opal apples, but can be sure that they&#39;re going to be good.

Even better, they treat their employees like real people, pay them well, and give them decent benefits.

MOST OF THE FOOD AT COSTOCO i not processed they do not sell everythign under the sun. What they do sell is high quality products at about the same prices as the junk you get elsewere that is supose to be high end.

This is why costco is a cult. There shit is that much better. And they dont fuck with you when you dont like it.

if you ask were something is they usally offer to go get it for you are take you to it.

Their business plan involves keeping prices as low as possible by buying in very large quantities.

Costco has a net profit of around $8 billion with more than $5 billion coming from membership fees.  So, most of the profits come from membership fees.  However, in contrast to other companies (like Sam&#39;s Club), Costco is able to squeeze out about $2.5 billion in non-membership fee profits out of around $270 billion in sales.  That&#39;s tight but at least positive, even considering the loss leaders, like the hot dogs and r

It&#39;s a German concept, same as their others brands Lidl and Norma. There is also Netto, and though it&#39;s not German-owned, it&#39;s successful in Germany due to following the same idea.

For me that all counts enough as not hating its customers, especially these days.  We all know what this is, at least Aldi isn&#39;t trying to hustle me all the time.  Aldi and me, we&#39;re consenting adults whereas Publix feels like an abusive relationship these days.

There&#39;s always a few things on my grocery list that are unobtanium at Aldi, so at least for me they don&#39;t actually alleviate having to deal with stores that are less pleasant to shop at.  Between Aldi, Walmart, Target, and Publix, they&#39;ve all got their &quot;exclusives&quot; that you&#39;ll have to make the trip for or do without.

Indeed.  I am always shocked when I see many of the same employees year after year.  That is just unheard of anywhere else in retail.  And they are all pleasant and helpful.  And, generally, seem happy.

And the checkouts are AMAZINGLY fast.  Walmart is orders of magnitude slower.  Unfortunately, Costco has little that I need/want, and Walmart has most of what I need.  There is just enough at Costco to keep me coming back and barely justify the annual fee.

My main problem with my Costco is parking is a zoo, as

Costco pays its employees VERY well. As in, it&#39;s not that Costco pays well for retail, they pay well overall. And their benefits are great. They are generally on the &quot;best employer&quot; list all the time. Turns out treating your employees well and paying them well causes them to stick around.

Costco. One of the few companies that acts like it doesn&#39;t hate its customers.Their total profits have been roughly equal to the revenue they get from membership fees, which suggests the customer experience (rather than marked up goods) is what they are really selling.

Been to many Costco&#39;s around the country.Always found what I wanted. Service was good.Wish I had one near me at home.

In &quot;The cult of Costco&quot;, cult means &quot;veneration, devotion, ritual&quot; (wiktionary, meaning 1 https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki...  [wiktionary.org] ) practised as part of worship to a deity (which here is Costco). It&#39;s the centuries-old meaning. It is a different sentence than &quot;Costco is a cult&quot; (or sect) implying &quot;unorthodox system of beliefs&quot; (wiktionary, meaning 2, ibid), also a centuries-old meaning. It&#39;s still different from the modern usage which is &quot;generally a pejorative ...  variously applied to abusive or coercive groups

The hostess at a recent Christmas party had a delightfully tasteful little charcuterie layout.  &quot;Where did you get that?&quot;  CostCo, of course!  We all acknowledged how surprisingly good some of their food items are when you consider they&#39;re essentially coming from a big-box warehouse.  And their lasagna has long been a party staple around here!

There are a number of small coffee shops and drive throughs around here who sell muffins and other pastries that they get at Costco.  They&#39;re quite good.

The company relies on word-of-mouth marketing from satisfied members rather than traditional advertising.Everything about this statement indicates this is more of the ideal outcome within a capitalistic society. Are people upset that they aren&#39;t heavily exploiting customers? If so, then they are sociopaths that you shouldn&#39;t be listening too in the first place.

Guy at work was complaining about a percent inflation in food that didn&#39;t mirror reality; he only shopped at Cosco so was using the CPI, cosco price index.

He would use his Costco card to pay a large donation to their current charity, write off the donation as a tax write off AND get that 5% back.  Though I am unsure where you would put that 5% back in a tax form?  Would it be a gift back from Costco itself?  I am betting he just gave his receipt to his accountant and never thought about it.

That said, I do kind of like how Costco handles donations.  Its not just one charity but they are fairly open on giving out donations to people in need.

He would use his Costco card to pay a large donation to their current charity, write off the donation as a tax write off AND get that 5% back. Though I am unsure where you would put that 5% back in a tax form?It&#39;s simple: You just put the reduced amount on the tax form as the deduction.  If you have an accountant, tell them that you received a 5% rebate for the donation.That said, if you don&#39;t mind cheating on your taxes, this kind of cheat is relatively easy and is unlikely to raise red flags.  However, if you do happen to get audited ....

I expect that will probably help a lot.

We picked up a greenhouse there for a price that was less than just the cost of the polycarbonate sheets for the roof if bought at Home Despot.

I just don&#39;t have a need for the volume-packaging that they sell.It&#39;s fine for things that aren&#39;t going to go bad before I get around to using all of it.  Paper towel, laundry and dish detergent, etc.  I don&#39;t need a 5 LB bag of romaine lettuce, though.

Our guinea pigs take care of the extra.  They taste better when you cook them if they don&#39;t eat just Purina.

My wife has a membership there. I am not sure why.We live in a two person household, if we buy ten pounds of onions, or carrots, they will just go bad.We can never do all of our shopping at Costco. They just don&#39;t have everything. Costco&#39;s selection is very limited, they just don&#39;t carry a lot of things we buy. For example: we cannot get decaffeinated tea, we cannot get regular soy milk (just organic soy beans and filtered water). What do have is only sold in huge quantities.

I suppose Costco works for some people, it&#39;s not great for everybody.

My wife shares a subscription with her mother. There are tons of things we get at costco that are not perishable quickly and that are hard to get at that price anywhere else.

Cheese is really cheap but it is bulk. We split it off when it gets in.Coffee is also quite cheap for the quality you get.Paper products are also priced cheap. Once again it is bulk; but if you have space to store, it is pretty neat.

Not all, but some of the meat are cheap as well. We usually buy one meat bulk. Prep half and eat it over

Store the meat in a chest freezer, which you can also get a good deal on at Costco.

it is good that it doesn&#39;t work for everyone, otherwise the other stores would shut down reducing choices and pushing Costco towards mediocrity and would destroy prices.  So thank you.

There are only two of us, but we cook pretty much every day and our Costco membership pays for itself pretty quickly.

Between $65-per-year and the fact that a costco run is at least a hundred bucks. Haha. 200. Who am I kidding? This means that the bottom socioeconomic 2/3 of society is mostly excluded.The absolute rudest people I regularly encounter are Tesla drivers and theme park guests (more so at Universal Resort than Disney World).

The membership requirement helps to keep out the riffraff not because of the financial burden but because they can cancel the membership of anyone who misbehaves. Other stores have to keep even cheap stuff locked up out of reach of shoplifters and that gets annoying for customers quickly. (Costco has a cage for small, high priced things but they always keep it staffed so there&#39;s never a wait.)

I used to have a similar bias. Now I am a member, spend safely >$5,000/year there, and I get it. I am also safely in the 1%. There are plenty of expensive things that are a good value, as well as staples.

Around here (Netherlands) ... the gov&#39;t decided against having big box stores that require a car to reach.It would be nice if Costco could become less car-centric.  They make an extra effort of being car-friendly, by selling cheap gas, tires, etc.  A Costco membership helps pay part of the cost of maintaining a car.  What about serving customers who use public transport or bicycle?  Perhaps this should be mandated by the state or city.

One can fit a heckuva lot into even a small car (especially with the back seats down). SUVs often have surprisingly poor internal volume for their size, because they&#39;re styled to &quot;look big&quot;, i.e. chunky, high off the ground for extra rollovers, nice thick pillars to protect drivers from the much more likely rollovers and so on and so forth. Minivans are somewhat superior in terms of internal volume IME.

Trucks are just crap vans with poor visibility and less convenient beds.

This means that the bottom socioeconomic 2/3 of society is mostly excluded. I don&#39;t follow. How would limiting membership to stuck up self-obsessed narcissists that make up the rich population improve things? My experience is the rich people are the ones that are most likely to block the path.

Or, crazy idea I know, maybe wealthy people aren&#39;t universally - or even mostly - stuck up self obsessed narcissists, and that&#39;s just your own seething envy and sense of self justification?

i&#39;ve never been in one and the nearest is apparently 2h away, so i&#39;m curious about this part in tfs:

> Shoppers follow unwritten rules: move along, don&#39;t block the way, step aside to check your phone.

i find it rather hard to believe that people do this en masse because of some &quot;behave, we&#39;re in the costco&quot; impulse. can anyone confirm this?

on this other hand, this part does not seem particularly novel or noteworthy?

Now I live on the West Coast, so people aren&#39;t super rude anyway... but I see as many thoughtless people in Costco as I do in other grocery stores. ... this is especially true when you are anywhere in the vicinity of a free food demo cart (which are a plague found in many Costco aisles during the daytime).

I really cannot explain it, other than to say that most Costco shoppers are the worst driving, worst acting, selfish, ignorant, aloof and entitled individuals I have ever encountered in life.

That being said, the gas is significantly cheaper, so I am willing to put up with said behavior.

Atlantic staff writer Jake Lundberg, who shops at the Granger, Indiana location, describes the stores as spaces of &quot;cooperation, courtesy, and grown-ups mostly acting like grown-ups.&quot; Shoppers follow unwritten rules: move along, don&#39;t block the way, step aside to check your phone.

Maybe in Granger, Indiana.  Every one I&#39;ve visited in a major metropolitan area (whether coastal or heartland) has been a cacophony of chaos with, at best, oblivious shoppers looking at everything except where they&#39;re going and who

#1 More often than not the frozen stuff they cook and give you a sample of at the store tastes nothing like what it does when you get it home.  You end up having one serving and the rest stays in the freezer until you throw it away.

#2 You can be risking your life to get a sample. Some percentage of the shoppers there act like they haven&#39;t seen food in a week when the nice/crotchety old lady pushes a tray of cut-up eggrolls or sausage or whatever.  The remarks about &quot;mostly acting like a

Costco intentionally moves products around, so anythong besides the bakery and butcher wonâ(TM)t consistently be in the same spot.

As for courtesy, that applies in the Pacific Northwest (where Costco actually startedâ&quot;donâ(TM)t give me the bullshit about LA since thatâ(TM)s about Price Club that merged with Costco), but not in the bat area where ironically all the people from crowded countries like China and India block the isles.

Of course we need the famous hot dog story

&quot;I came to (Jim Sinegal) once and I said, &#39;Jim, we can&#39;t sell this hot dog for a buck fifty. We are losing our rear ends.&#39; And he said, &#39;If you raise the effing hot dog, I will kill you. Figure it out.&#39; That&#39;s all I really needed. By the way, if you raised (the price) to $1.75, it would not be that big of a deal. People would

If you live in an area where there is actual competition between supermarkets, then perhaps Costco isn&#39;t a great deal. Where I live in the US, my choice is Safeway and Kroger. I think our local supermarkets know that they have a near monopoly, so they are happy to sell substandard product at premium prices and they NEVER compete with each other.  The prices those places charge are always matching and just too high. The alternates are Whole Foods and Trader Joes on the other side of town, but the Costco is r

On January 1, Zohran Mamdani will be sworn in as the first Muslim mayor of New York City. Administering the oath in a public ceremony will be Bernie Sanders, among the most prominently Jewish senators in the country. For weeks, Mamdani has been meeting with constituents and leaders from every sector of New York Jewry to alleviate their concerns about his support for their safety and wellbeing. By nearly all accounts, these have been a great success. From the Reform Rabbi Amiel Hirsch—who had coauthored a widely circulated letter against Mamdani—to the Satmar Hasidim in Brooklyn, New York Jews expressed at least cautious optimism about their mayor elect, if not outright excitement.

During these same weeks, the most powerful Republican politicians and media personalities in the country have leaned deeply into open antisemitism. Two weeks ago, for example, the White House held its annual Hanukah party. In attendance was Rep. Paul Gosar, an open white nationalist who is deeply embedded in neo-Nazi, Holocaust denying spaces, including Nick Fuentes’. At the celebration, the President of the United States talked about the power of the “Jewish lobby” behind Israel and bragged about being funded by Jewish money.

A week later, Turning Point USA held their Americafest, where a parade of speakers defended the right of open Nazis to exist within the Republican Party. Tucker Carlson spewed a series of claims about a cabal fighting American national interests as he defended himself against Ben Shapiro’s criticism for platforming Nick Fuentes. Steve Bannon said to cheers that Shapiro—whose prominent Jewishness stood out at the affair—“is like a cancer, and that cancer spreads.” And JD Vance—the Vice President of the United States—also defended including neo-nazis in his party. Vance contrasted his party of “free thinkers” to the threat of “a bunch of drones who take their orders from George Soros.” He concluded to tumultuous cheers: “By the grace of God, we always will be a Christian nation.”

Finally, on Christmas Day, the President of the United States, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and much of the rest of our national government posted greetings that described America as a Christian nation with explicit reference to our savior, Jesus Christ.

So what does America’s self-described defender against antisemitism, the Anti-Defamation League, have to say about the nation’s dominant political movement welcoming open antisemites into its ranks? Shockingly little. They have chosen not to focus much on these powerful people spewing or platforming explicit, even pro-Nazi, antisemitism. Indeed, they have ignored and even defended many of them.

Instead, the ADL seems laser focused on Mamdani. They even set up a “Mamdani Watch” site, suggesting that he is the greatest threat to American Jews today, with no such “watch” site for these other, far more powerful men and women. Their latest post, for example, uncovered members of his team with possible antisemitic connections, who Mamdani then cut. Their own monitor concluded that “when clear antisemitic statements are identified, Mayor-elect Mamdani’s team can and will respond appropriately.”

The exact opposite has been the case with Republican leadership regarding explicit antisemitism, Christian nationalism, and even Nazism. So why the focus on Mamdani?

The answer is that this is not about antisemitism but rather about preserving Israeli power over Palestinians. Though many Jews are unhappy that Mamdani won’t condemn the phrase “globalize the intifada”—he has said he dislikes it but will not condemn it—Mamdani is mainly accused of antisemitism because he only supports Israel’s existence as a democratic state and opposes one that gives preferential treatment to Jews over Palestinians.

What does it mean to label a call for equality “antisemitic”? Let us interrogate this accusation.Palestinians within Israel’s internationally recognized borders are citizens but suffer structural discrimination. The controversial 2018 “Nation State” law is perhaps the most egregious expression of this unequal status, but it appears in other areas as well.

Let’s set that aside, however, especially considering our own structural discrimination here at home. Israel currently rules the entire area from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea. Indeed, in many ways it considers the West Bank already a part of Israel, including on its official maps. As a result, about half of the people currently controlled by Israel and subject to its military are Palestinian, only a fraction of whom are eligible for citizenship. In other words, the only way Israel exists as a Jewish majority state is through the expulsion of Palestinians, especially during the 1948 Nakba, and (above all) through the denial of citizenship to Palestinians in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and obviously Gaza. “Pro-Israel” critics are correct that if those Palestinians were awarded equality, Israel would become a different state. It would be a binational democracy.

What does it mean to label a call for equality antisemitic because it would destroy Israel as Jewish state? It means that an argument that opposes Israel maintaining a Jewish majority in this way and demanding Palestinian equality is antisemitic because it calls for the “destruction of Israel” as a Jewish state. It is saying that it is antisemitic to insist on equality more imminently then “someday, when Israel feels they are ready, it will give Palestinians a state in part of the land with limited sovereignty such that Israel will maintain superior military power over them.

This is the crux of the issue. Is this position calling for equality, which because of the demographic reality will mean the end of Jewish hegemony, antisemitic?

Consider how we would view it if Palestinians were to somehow expel millions of Jews, establish a “Palestinian majority state,” grant citizenship to only a fraction of Jews left behind, and keep the remainder subject to military rule without citizenship or civil rights. Imagine if that takeover had included the catastrophic destruction of civilian infrastructure and death of tens of thousands. And imagine if those Jews who were left disenfranchised were to experience violence by the state and sometimes vigilantes who the state supports or ignores. And imagine that Palestinians defended this as necessary for their security because it was the only way to have Palestinian self-determination, and accused people of racism if they opposed it?

In other words, imagine a reversal of today’s situation. Under such conditions, would we consider support for Jewish equality as anti-Palestinian bigotry? Would it be racist against Palestinians and a violation of their right to self-determination in that scenario for Jews and others to reject this arrangement as unacceptable and demand both immediate equality and a right of return for the Jewish refugees? If not, why does challenging the current arrangement with a call for equality constitute antisemitism?

American Jews do face a growing threat of antisemitism. It can certainly come from people claiming to oppose Israeli actions but blaming American Jews for them. As we saw tragically in Australia on Chanukah, the threat of ISIS-inspired terror is also still quite real.

But if we are looking at political threats to Jewish equality and safety in America, with real material consequences, why would we focus on a city mayor committed to equality instead of a national party currently in control of every branch of government? A party whose top leaders from the President on down are spewing open antisemitism and Christian nationalism - not to mention open racism - while publicly defending the inclusion of Holocaust-denying Nazis?We would only do this if our goal was corrupted.

It is one thing to keep an eye on the entire political spectrum. It is another to misrepresent the principal source of threat.

This week, Emily Bazelon, John Dickerson, and David Plotz revisit several favorite segments from Gabfests past to celebrate their 20th anniversary: the consequential and eye-opening “don’t call the police” debate, the segment in which John shows Bill Clinton how to apologize with his characteristic eloquence and grace, and that time a data scientist definitively answered the important question: which host interrupts the others the most?

Here are some notes and references from this week’s show:

Jessica Grose for Slate: Parents Are Now Getting Arrested for Letting Their Kids Go to the Park Alone

Lindsay Lee: Does David Plotz interrupt Emily Bazelon too much on Slate’s Political Gabfest?

7/28/22: The “Did You Apologize to Manchin Yet?” Edition

Marin Cogan for Vox: The deadliest road in America

For this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode, Emily, John, and David revisit one more favorite segment from 20 years of the Political Gabfest: that time in 2008 they fought about the John Edwards love affair scandal.

In the latest Gabfest Reads, David Plotz talks with Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales about his new book The Seven Rules of Trust: A Blueprint for Building Things That Last. They discuss how Wikipedia’s culture of assuming good faith and shared purpose became a model for building trustworthy digital communities — and what lessons that holds for companies, social media, and politics today.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Interview If AI can take on the role of a junior programmer, what happens when senior staff start retiring? Industry veteran and CEO of Safe Software, Don Murray, reckons the technology is becoming indispensable, but the human can never be removed from the loop.

&quot;I think as an assistant,&quot; says Murray, &quot;AI is indispensable. But it is not an authority.&quot;

Murray&#39;s company, Safe, specializes in data collation. Be it real-time or static, data flows through Safe&#39;s data pipe and can be output to any visualization tool the customer is using. It is therefore ripe for AI applications, both in mining the flow of data and in pursuing an agentic AI path to take action. Murray, having seen industry fads come and go over a multi-decade career, is therefore well placed to comment on the latest tech industry obsession: AI.

&quot;If there&#39;s one thing AI has a never-ending thirst for,&quot; he says, &quot;it&#39;s data.&quot;

Workers might also worry that AI – or its proponents – have a thirst for something else: their jobs.

Murray, while an enthusiast for the technology, is also a realist about its application. Yes, it can certainly appear magical when it comes to accessibility and user interaction (Murray uses the example of the technology being used to build systems that work the way users do, instead of forcing users into a box defined by technology), but he is also a realist about the service and what it can do, cannot do and should never do.

Murray cites the example of a company working on a major engineering project in the UK (Safe has many such customers, including airports and power networks) that asked a vendor: &quot;How accurate is your AI?&quot; The answer, &quot;oh, you can get to 80 or 90 percent,&quot; was nowhere near the requirement, which is more like 99.999 percent, certainly when it comes to engineering.

&quot;And so one of the things you&#39;re going to see in agentic systems,&quot; he says, &quot;is this &#39;human in the loop&#39;.

&quot;Basically, the AI will do its magic, and then it will throw it to a human who has the credentials to sign off on the design.

&quot;AI can help you build a bridge. If you&#39;re an engineer, it can go through lots of different designs and help you get there, but there&#39;s no organization that&#39;s going to allow it to sign off.&quot;

Instead, Murray reckons AI will be an assistant. Able to throw up some suggestions to, for example, a medical professional, and come up with ideas that might never have occurred to a Doctor. But it can&#39;t be the final authority on a subject.

The problem comes with companies that see AI as more than an assistant. &quot;I talk to utility companies,&quot; says Murray, &quot;and they&#39;re saying that the experts who have been in the business forever use AI. The company is saying, &#39;We don&#39;t have to hire junior people.&#39;

&quot;So then I&#39;m like, &#39;When all those people retire, who&#39;s going to be the expert now? You&#39;re not giving these people the experience for 10, 20, 30 years so they can step into the role. There&#39;s only one way to get experience, and that&#39;s time and actually experiencing things.&quot;

Murray is a veteran of the tech industry and practices what he preaches when it comes to AI adoption for his own staff. &quot;We&#39;re using it to bring everybody up to speed,&quot; he explains, with the assistant having an impact at all levels.

&quot;I have this guy who is amazing and has been around forever, and AI for him is very valuable because he can see very quickly what is correct and what isn&#39;t correct. Whereas the junior people, it is a benefit that can help them write some code quickly, but they still have to go through the testing.&quot;

Murray reckons that, instead, AI is useful for suggesting how a given system might be supported or which libraries to use.

&quot;We&#39;re hiring juniors and seniors,&quot; he says, &quot;and then we&#39;re using it to bring everybody up to speed.&quot;

As far as Murray is concerned, the genie is out of the bottle. &quot;People say,&quot; he says, &quot;it&#39;s just a bubble. Maybe it is just a bubble. But AI is here for good; it&#39;s sort of like the Internet. It was a bubble, but it didn&#39;t go away [when the bubble burst].&quot;

Regardless of what happens, &quot;AI is here to stay.&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">ON CALL Y2K Welcome to another edition of On Call, The Register’s Friday column that shares your tech support stories. Over the holiday season we’re telling tales of the Y2K bug, and readers who spent December 31, 1999 on call in case the world’s computers caused calamities.

A reader we’ll Regomize as “Barb” who showed up for Y2K duty carrying a bottle of champagne, which rather upset her boss who had laid in sparkling grape juice to keep the on call crew sober.

Barb was having none of it and fair enough, because she married just 12 days before Y2K eve and postponed her honeymoon to work that night.

“This event comes once a century and this special one, once in a millennium, so I’m having a real toast,” she told the boss, and then made a concession by promising to share the bubbles with the entire team, in very small doses that would not impact anybody’s work.

Midnight passed, nothing broke, and the team began to relax. And then the phone rang, panicking the team.

“It was a client calling to see if any other customers had called to report a problem. They got a ‘Don’t scare us like that!’”

Barb’s life got busy after Y2K, and she eventually forgot about missing her honeymoon, before finally taking it 17 years later with a trip to Hawaii.

Other readers also told us Y2K meant they missed out on the party of the millennium.

“Alistair” told us his company made it through Y2K unscathed, and that he made it home at 3am to find his house empty because his wife was still out partying.

“I had one can of beer and a whisky chaser, to ‘see in’ the new Millenium, and went to bed. It was the most tame and uneventful New Years Eve I had ever spent.”

“Mark” told us he spent Y2K eve in New Zealand, and was supposed to inform his boss in Australia – where the time was two hours in the past – of any problems. Mark called and found his boss on a boat, under the weather, and incapable of action!

Many readers sent us stories of employers putting on decent Y2K office parties or paying them very well for the night’s work.

A reader we’ll call “Mitch” said his workplace asked him to work on New Year’s Day, just in case things went south long after midnight, then turned a blind eye when he pinched a projector from the marketing department and used it to show a football match.

That seemed like a decent deal because Mitch’s employer had promised he could take the holiday at another time.

But then the company made a round of layoffs, and Mitch was let go before he could take the day he was owed.

Another reader, who we shall Regomize as “Gary”, also told us the night of Y2K passed without incident at the pharmaceutical company he worked for at the time.

“Other than joining some periodic conference calls and doing a walk around every so often checking in with the teams I had nothing to do,” he wrote. “I spent most of the day with my feet up reading a novel with coffee and biscuits.”

He told us preparing for his role as Y2K incident manager was far more interesting than the event itself.

“I had to join the overall site Y2K team planning for all departments across multiple major buildings, including the animal experimentation block,” he said, then added the following rather scary observation: “You don&#39;t want to hear the plans that were in place there in the event of a total power failure across the region as a consequence of Y2K!”

But it is worth listening to Gary’s summary of the Y2K preparation push.

“Like many IT professionals, I had to bite my tongue for many months in social interactions with people who were not aware of this sort of effort and how it had paid off by sorting out as much as possible before the big day,” he wrote, and complained that people would often ask &quot;What was all the fuss about Y2K?” and then judge it a waste of time and money.

On Call exists to celebrate the hard work IT pros perform at all hours of the day and night, often without reward or appropriate acknowledgement. We can’t tell these stories without your generosity, so if you have a tech support tale to tell, click here to send On Call an email. We hope to tell your story later in 2026! ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Interview Scientists and engineers have been taken aback by the amount of radio interference generated by satellite constellations, and many are calling on standards bodies to improve operator performance.

The photobombing of ground- and space-based telescopes by proliferating satellites in Low Earth Orbit has long vexed astronomers. As well as optical annoyances, radio astronomers are also encountering interference due to satellites communicating with ground stations.

In an interview with The Register, Tudor Williams, CTO of high-frequency RF communication company Filtronic, explained the problem, which is mainly related to satellite-to-ground transmissions (many large constellations, such as SpaceX&#39;s Starlink, use optical links for satellite-to-satellite communication, which don&#39;t cause the same issues.)

According to Williams, the problem comes from the side lobes of poorly designed antennas, where signals are unintentionally spread. The effect can be bands used for communications overlapping with observation bands, causing headaches for radio astronomers.

&quot;In a badly designed antenna,&quot; Williams explains, &quot;you get fairly strong lobes of signals that get sent in different directions.&quot;

But surely licensing and regulations should ensure this isn&#39;t an issue?

Yes, but the issue, according to Williams, is that until the satellites began launching, the issue had not been fully understood or anticipated from ground testing. &quot;Maybe the regulations weren&#39;t as stringent as they should have been at the start,&quot; he says, &quot;And as we start to get more data on this, we can obviously have more stringent guard bands and more stringent regulations going forward.&quot;

A &quot;guard band&quot; is a slice of radio spectrum between active bands that acts as a buffer to prevent signals from leaking from one channel into another.

&quot;The designers,&quot; he says, &quot;do the best they can, but sometimes there are errors in the process which mean leaks into the spectrum … the authorities will define how much interference can be tolerated.&quot;

As the problem becomes better understood and companies like SpaceX work with scientists and regulators to devise improved hardware, the situation should start being mitigated. This, however, is small comfort to astronomers dealing with thousands of new sources of interference.

Williams acknowledges that retrofitting hardware to existing satellites is not a viable solution, but says, &quot; They can do updates to things like the waveforms. The type of waveforms you&#39;ve got through the amplifier has quite a big impact on spectral spreading. It&#39;ll stress the amplifiers in different ways.

&quot;So you potentially could optimize the waveforms, using AI or whatever to actually control that and try and cause less distortion with even existing hardware.

&quot;So you could potentially solve it from a baseband perspective.&quot;

It isn&#39;t only altruism that is encouraging good behavior from operators. &quot;The more we see this happening,&quot; explains Williams, &quot;the more that will push back into satellite operators because they&#39;ll be under pressure to behave. Because they have to control their spectrum.

&quot;Everyone understands the problem. Everyone&#39;s aware of the problem. It&#39;s just… how bad is it? What problems is it causing? What do we need to do to be better?&quot;

Williams points out that satellite operators need their licenses, which will be tricky to renew if they behave badly and stomp over places where their signals don&#39;t belong. &quot;I think,&quot; says Williams, &quot;we need to have a co-existence of scientific missions and general broadband comms.&quot;

Starlink satellites, for example, are designed for a relatively short operational lifespan of around five years. As the interference problem becomes better understood and regulations tighten, there is an opportunity for hardware changes. &quot;Would there be cost implications if you have to control it [the signal] better?&quot; muses Williams. &quot;Yes. Probably. Because it makes the design more complicated … volume manufacturing and lots of satellites can add quite a lot of cost in the process.&quot;

Ultimately, while the light pollution of the night sky by the rapidly growing constellations of satellites is visible even to the naked eye, the scale of RF interference has been unexpected by many. According to Williams, &quot;feedback into standards bodies will be pushed out to the satellite operators, and they&#39;ll have to have better performance systems going forward.&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">Bork!Bork!Bork! Today&#39;s example of bork-in-the-wild shows that Microsoft is not the only game in town when it comes to screens having an IT moment in public. No, there will be no orders on this Firefox-based drive-thru kiosk at Wendy&#39;s.

Wendy&#39;s is a fast-food chain, predominantly found in the US, with a few scattered locations elsewhere around the world. It is notable for serving square hamburger patties in round buns, and a few examples of the company&#39;s goods can be glimpsed in the menu – the &quot;Baconator&quot; sounds particularly alluring.

However, at this drive-thru, an eagle-eyed Register reader was offered a side of bork with his order, along with a plea to &quot;Restart Firefox manually!&quot;

Do you want bork with that? - click to enlarge

Exactly how that would be achieved with the limited resources available at the kiosk is unclear. Perhaps an overeager opening of the car door could jolt the system into action, or attaching a USB keyboard that every self-respecting IT professional carries at all times.

Whatever, despite the professionalism evident in the zip ties and sticky tape holding the kiosk&#39;s enclosure together, Firefox is not cooperating. The browser appears to be running in Kiosk mode (although there are several possibilities for what mKiosk might be in this context).

The purpose of Kiosk mode in Firefox, as well as elsewhere, is to keep things as simple as possible. User access is intentionally limited, and the expectation is that the kiosk operator will have configured the hardware to deal with every eventuality. In this instance, however, it appears that some sort of reset is underway which has resulted in a clearing of settings and a request to restart the browser.

Somewhere, an engineer has doubtless been notified of an issue and will at some point issue a remote reset command. Although when presented with the mouthwatering alternative of a Baconator instead of immediately hitting the remote reset button ... well, we know what we&#39;d do.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/01/microsofts_approach_to_customer_service/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft had a special way of dealing with customers demanding to speak to its CEO. One that kept the customer happy without necessarily bothering His Billness.

According to veteran Microsoft engineer Raymond Chen, there was a procedure followed by product support staff if a customer (presumably a prized customer) became irate enough during a call to demand to speak with Bill Gates.

Chen recalled a colleague in product support explaining the process. First, there would be apologies for not resolving the issue to the customer&#39;s satisfaction. If that failed to smooth ruffled feathers and the demands to speak to The Boss continued, then the magic happened.

Chen went on: &quot;The customer was transferred to a special internal phone number, and when the operators saw a call on that line, they took the call and said, &quot;Bill Gates&#39;s office.&quot;

Of course, the operator wasn&#39;t actually in Bill Gates&#39;s office. Instead, they were pretending to be Gates&#39;s secretary. Their only job was to say that Bill Gates was unavailable and to pass on the customer&#39;s complaint and contact details.

The information was then sent back to the tech support team with a note to ensure that whoever called the customer back opened with something like &quot;Bill Gates asked me to contact you to follow up on an issue you had earlier.&quot;

It all smacks of a different era at Microsoft, not least because (a) getting hold of a human in the company&#39;s support team and (b) having a query answered is enough of a challenge these days without demanding to talk to Satya Nadella as well.

Gates handed over his role as CEO to Steve Ballmer in 2000. Ballmer was succeeded by Satya Nadella in 2014. While Chen could not confirm if Gates ever looked at the list of calls, we do know that someone certainly monitored his email account. How? A Register reader told us previously that, back in 1996, they fired off an irate email to billg@microsoft.com – after which they were quickly contacted by a Microsoft engineer who appeared exceedingly keen to solve their Excel issue.

Sadly, unless a customer is very important to Microsoft&#39;s bottom line or has spent enough on getting the personal touch from the company&#39;s support team, they are unlikely to make much headway in similarly escalating their complaint in the modern era of AI and Copilot. ®

            <h2>Nvidia DMs TSMC: please sir can I have some more? The Chinese are starved for H200s</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-31</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">With the sales ban lifted, Chinese tech giants, including ByteDance, are scrambling to secure orders for Nvidia&#39;s H200 graphics accelerators while they can. But will there be enough to satisfy demand?

Citing multiple sources familiar with the matter, Reuters reports Chinese companies have placed orders for more than 2 million of the chips. That&#39;s up from the 40,000 to 80,000 initial orders reported last week.

But with just 700,000 of the now two-year-old AI accelerators in stock, Nvidia has reportedly approached TSMC to ramp production of the chips. The H200 uses TSMC&#39;s 4N process, a slightly older version of technology used by its higher-performance Blackwell parts (4NP), which remain unavailable in China.

Nvidia doesn&#39;t anticipate sales of H200s in China will have any impact on chip supplies to US customers.

&quot;Offering the H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance,&quot; a company spokesperson told The Register and other outlets. &quot;China is a highly competitive market with rapidly growing local chip suppliers. Blocking all U.S. exports undercut our national and economic security and only benefited foreign competition.&quot;

Shipments of the newly minted chips are expected to begin in the second half of 2026 with 8-GPU systems said to sell for around 1.5 million yuan (about $215,000).

Despite its advancing age, the H200 is the most powerful GPU Nvidia can sell in China. Biden-era export controls had capped the performance of chips sold in the Middle Kingdom, but earlier this month, the Trump administration made an exception for H200 shipments if Nvidia agreed to cut Uncle Sam in on 25 percent of the revenues.

Compared to Nvidia&#39;s H20 — a cut-down version of the H200 built to comply with US export controls — that extra zero translates into a pretty big performance jump, particularly for compute-intensive AI training workloads.

The H200 offers 6x faster floating point performance, 50 percent more HBM3e and 20 percent higher memory bandwidth.

ByteDance is apparently one of several Chinese hyperscalers lining up for the chips. According to the South China Morning Post, the TikTok parent plans to buy roughly $14 billion worth of H200s.

However, there is no guarantee that those chips will ever make it to mainland China. While the US government has signed off on H200 sales to China, Beijing has not.

In response to US trade policies governing AI chip and semiconductor equipment sales, Chinese authorities have begun pressuring hyperscalers in the region to ditch Nvidia for domestic alternatives.

The nation has also moved to block state-funded datacenters from using foreign AI chips, while warning of potential backdoors or remote kill switches — allegations Nvidia has fervently denied. ®

            <div id="article-text">The latest iteration of Punkt’s privacy-focused phone beefs up the hardware.

The latest iteration of Punkt’s privacy-focused phone beefs up the hardware.

Punkt, the Switzerland-based, privacy-focused phone maker, is trying the whole “smartphone” thing again. The MC03 improves on some of the disappointing features of its previous effort, the MC02, while maintaining its security focus. Likewise, its software still comes with a subscription fee: the first year is included free, but it’s $12 per month after that. On top of that, the MC03 is Punkt’s first phone to be assembled in Europe rather than Asia, making good on its promise from earlier this year.

The MC02, released last year, wasn’t exactly a critical darling. Punkt seems to be addressing some of those criticisms with a more modern 6.67-inch 120Hz OLED compared to last year’s 60Hz LCD. The 5,200mAh battery is user-replaceable. The MC03 ships with AphyOS, from the equally privacy-oriented company Apostrophy, and it’s based on AOSP 15 — more current than the AOSP 13-based version the MC02 shipped with, though still a version behind this year’s flagships. The MC03 is IP68 rated, comes with a MediaTek 7300 chipset, and is scheduled to get three OS upgrades and five years of security updates.

The MC03 is the first device to result from Punkt’s commitment to assemble phones in Germany. The phones are assembled at a factory in Bocholt belonging to Gigaset, a company that has been making smartphones on German soil since 2018. The parts are sourced from elsewhere, naturally, but moving assembly out of Asia is a significant feat — certainly beyond the American company that said it would in 2025.

As ever, privacy is a major focus for Punkt. AphyOS claims to strip away the background tracking features of Google’s services, offering proprietary apps for things like email and calendar while letting you run any app from the Play Store in a secure “sandbox.”

This is where the fee comes in; since you’re not the product, you’ll need to pay up. The MC03 will cost $699 in the US, and $10 per month after that (though three- and five-year bundle options when you buy the phone can save you some money here). If you plan to use the phone for a few years, that brings the cost in line with the $899 Fairphone 6 — the highly repairable device running privacy-minded software by Murena. That’s an unfortunate reality: A private, secure personal device doesn’t come cheap, it seems.

            <div id="article-text">Where’s the Trump Phone? We’re going to keep talking about it every week. We’ve reached out, as usual, to ask about the Trump Phone’s whereabouts. As usual, we’re still waiting for a response. In the meantime, it’s missed yet another of its promised release dates.

When we started writing about Trump Mobile regularly, it all began with a simple post pointing out that the company’s T1 Phone had missed its original release date. Now, three months later, it’s missed another one.

When it was announced in June, the Trump phone was promised to launch in both August and September (one of the many impossible details in the launch announcement). At some point that was updated on the Trump Mobile site to instead say “later this year.”

As 2026 dawns, we’re into uncharted territory. Trump Mobile has repeatedly shifted the goalposts on the T1 Phone 8002 (gold version)’s release, but it has always had goalposts. The website still says “later this year,” but how are we meant to trust it now?

The Financial Times asked Trump Mobile’s customer service about the delay, and was reportedly told that “the recent US government shutdown had delayed deliveries of the phone.” If true, that probably means the T1 Phone was, like many other gadgets, prevented from getting FCC clearance to launch. Other delayed products, like the OnePlus 15, have since hit the market though.

Trump Mobile didn’t reply to my latest request for comment on when the T1 Phone will finally come out.

﻿It’ll also help them deorbit faster when something goes wrong.

After one of its Starlink satellites exploded and another narrowly avoided colliding with a Chinese satellite, SpaceX says it will lower the orbit of thousands of Starlink satellites to increase safety.

Of the over 9,000 Starlink satellites currently operating in low Earth orbit, SpaceX says it’ll lower about 4,400 from 550km above the Earth’s surface to about 480km in the months ahead. This ensures the satellites deorbit faster when something goes wrong or when they reach end of life, and it also reduces the likelihood of collision since “the number of debris objects and planned satellite constellations is significantly lower below 500km,” wrote Michael Nicolls, VP of Starlink Engineering.

By the end of this decade, there could be as many as 70,000 satellites operating in low Earth orbit — the region of space about 160km to 2,000km (100 to 1,200 miles) above the Earth — if private and government-led efforts meet their targets.

SpaceX had another record-setting year in 2025. It conducted over 160 Falcon 9 missions, with more than 120 of them dedicated to expanding the Starlink constellation. Starlink now serves 9.25 million active customers in over 155 countries, markets, and territories.

            <div id="article-text">430 ISO lumens is greater than 550 lumens.

430 ISO lumens is greater than 550 lumens.

The Freestyle Plus all-in-one portable projector features 430 ISO lumens, or “nearly twice the brightness of the previous generation,” according to Samsung. Great! But also a little strange since both the original and second generation Freestyle projectors listed “550 lumens” on their respective spec sheets.

See, projector makers are notorious for playing fast and loose with the lumen spec. So much so that Epson has been on a legal rampage over the last few years. As a result, companies like Anker, Yaber, AAXA, Xgimi, AWOL vision... even Dr. J have all been forced to restate brightness measurements in industry standard ISO lumens. That’s good because having a consistent lumen spec makes it easier to predict how the projected image will hold up to ambient light that wants to wash out the viewing experience.

The Freestyle Plus still looks and acts very much like the original 1080p Freestyle projector that launched in 2022, maintaining its rotating barrel design, integrated speaker, and ability to stream your favorite services over Wi-Fi. Now it comes with all the automatic adaptation features common to modern portables, including keystone correction, focus, screen fit, and an ability to calibrate the image based upon the color and patterns of walls and ceilings. It still lacks a battery, however, although it can be paired with some power banks to maximize portability.

Samsung isn’t providing any detailed specs, a preorder date, or even pricing ahead of the big CES show. We found the original to be severely overpriced at $899, and that was in a pre-Trump-tariff world.

﻿The feeder is joined by a new water fountain that uses AI and a camera to track your pet’s drinking behavior and health.

Petkit has announced two new automated machines at CES 2026 designed to feed and care for your pets using AI-powered cameras that track their behavior and provide health insights that may otherwise go unnoticed.

Launching sometime in April 2026, the Petkit Yumshare Daily Feast is one of the first automatic dispensers that works with wet food. The machine can provide up to 7 days of meals and uses an NFC-based tracking system to automatically remove a serving if it hasn’t been consumed after 48 hours. UVC lighting helps sanitize the delivery of fresh meals, while an AI-powered 1080P night vision camera with a 140-degree field-of-view tracks when your pet eats and how much food is left over before a fresh pack is dispensed. Petkit plans to offer the Yumshare Daily Feast to pet food companies as a wet food serving platform instead of selling it directly to consumers, and each company will set the pricing of the machine and meal refills.

The $199.99 Petkit Eversweet Ultra water fountain, also launching in April 2026, features a similar 1080P night vision wide-angle camera that’s used alongside AI to recognize multiple pets and track their individual drinking behavior and routines to provide insights on their urinary health. The fountain has a 14-day water reservoir and uses a non-recirculating system where used water is drained into a waste tank.

LG is adding a karaoke-focused party speaker to its lineup of Xboom devices, which is built in collaboration with Will.i.am. Announced this week, LG says the Stage 501 speaker comes with an “AI Karaoke Master” that can remove or adjust vocals from “virtually any song,” similar to the Soundcore Rave 3S.

It can also adjust the pitch of the songs to make them more comfortable to sing, and it doesn’t require karaoke-specific audio files to do so, according to LG. Like its predecessor, the Stage 501 features a five-sided design but comes equipped with upgraded dual woofers and full-range drivers that LG claims will deliver richer audio. The swappable 99Wh battery offers up to 25 hours of playback and delivers 160W of power (or up to 220W when plugged in).

There’s the Xboom Blast, too, which is a little smaller than the Stage 501 and is built for outdoor use, featuring edge bumpers and two handles for easy carrying. This speaker also comes with a 99Wh battery for up to 35 hours of playback.

LG has added a couple of compact speakers to its lineup as well: the Xboom Mini and Xboom Rock. With the Mini, you can expect up to 10 hours of playback and IP67 water and dust resistance, while the Rock promises the same battery life with support for Bluetooth Auracast, a feature that allows you to broadcast audio across multiple speakers at once.

All four speakers have an AI-powered feature that analyzes audio and “adjusts EQ settings to bring out melody, rhythm or vocals,” according to LG. The company also says the speakers use AI to adjust built-in lighting based on the song, while the Stage 501 and Blast use a technology called “Space Calibration Pro” to adjust sound quality based on the surrounding environment.

LG hasn’t yet revealed the pricing for these new speakers, but the company says it will launch the new devices this year.

            <h2>Why inventing new emotions feels so good</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-31</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/31/1129403/new-emotions-online-life-feelings/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s a “complex and subtle emotion that elicits feelings of comfort, serenity, and a gentle sense of floating.” It’s peaceful, but more ephemeral and intangible than contentment. It might be evoked by the sight of a sunset or a moody, low-key album.

If you haven’t ever felt this sensation—or even heard of it—that’s not surprising. A Reddit user named noahjeadie generated it with ChatGPT, along with advice on how to evoke the feeling. With the right essential oils and soundtrack, apparently, you too can feel like “a soft fuzzy draping ghost floating through a lavender suburb.”

Don’t scoff: Researchers say more and more terms for these “neo-­emotions” are showing up online, describing new dimensions and aspects of feeling. Velvetmist was a key example in a journal article about the phenomenon published in July 2025. But most neo-emotions aren’t the inventions of emo artificial intelligences. Humans come up with them, and they’re part of a big change in the way researchers are thinking about feelings, one that emphasizes how people continuously spin out new ones in response to a changing world.

Velvetmist might’ve been a chatbot one-off, but it’s not unique. The sociologist Marci Cottingham—whose 2024 paper got this vein of neo-emotion research started—cites many more new terms in circulation. There’s “Black joy” (Black people celebrating embodied pleasure as a form of political resistance), “trans euphoria” (the joy of having one’s gender identity affirmed and celebrated), “eco-anxiety” (the hovering fear of climate disaster), “hypernormalization” (the surreal pressure to continue performing mundane life and labor under capitalism during a global pandemic or fascist takeover), and the sense of “doom” found in “doomer” (one who is relentlessly pessimistic) or “doomscrolling” (being glued to an endless feed of bad news in an immobilized state combining apathy and dread).

Of course, emotional vocabulary is always evolving. During the Civil War, doctors used the centuries-old term “nostalgia,” combining the Greek words for “returning home”and “pain,” to describe a sometimes fatal set of symptoms suffered by soldiers—a condition we’d probably describe today as post-traumatic stress disorder. Now nostalgia’s meaning has mellowed and faded to a gentle affection for an old cultural product or vanished way of life. And people constantly import emotion words from other cultures when they’re convenient or evocative—like hygge (the Danish word for friendly coziness) or kvell (a Yiddish term for brimming over with happy pride).

Cottingham believes that neo-­emotions are proliferating as people spend more of their lives online. These coinages help us relate to one another and make sense of our experiences, and they get a lot of engagement on social media. So even when a neo-emotion is just a subtle variation on, or combination of, existing feelings, getting super-specific about those feelings helps us reflect and connect with other people. “These are potentially signals that tell us about our place in the world,” she says.

These neo-emotions are part of a paradigm shift in emotion science. For decades, researchers argued that humans all share a set of a half-dozen or so basic emotions. But over the last decade, Lisa Feldman Barrett, a clinical psychologist at Northeastern University, has become one of the most cited scientists in the world for work demonstrating otherwise. By using tools like advanced brain imaging and studying babies and people from relatively isolated cultures, she has concluded there’s no such thing as a basic emotional palette. The way we experience and talk about our feelings is culturally determined. “How do you know what anger and sadness and fear are? Because somebody taught you,” Barrett says.

If there are no true “basic” biological emotions, this puts more emphasis on social and cultural variations in how we interpret our experiences. And these interpretations can change over time. “As a sociologist, we think of all emotions as created,” Cottingham says. Just like any other tool humans make and use, “emotions are a practical resource people are using as they navigate the world.”

Some neo-emotions, like velvetmist, might be mere novelties. Barrett playfully suggests “chiplessness” to describe the combined hunger, frustration, and relief of getting to the bottom of the bag. But others, like eco-anxiety and Black joy, can take on a life of their own and help galvanize social movements.

Both reading about and crafting your own neo-emotions, with or without chatbot assistance, could be surprisingly helpful. Lots of research supports the benefits of emotional granularity. Basically, the more detailed and specific words you can use to describe your emotions, both positive and negative, the better.

Researchers analogize this “emodiversity” to biodiversity or cultural diversity, arguing that a more diverse world is more enriched. It turns out that people who exhibit higher emotional granularity go to the doctor less frequently, spend fewer days hospitalized for illness, and are less likely to drink when stressed, drive recklessly, or smoke cigarettes. And many studies show emodiversity is a skill that, with training, people can develop at any age. Just imagine cruising into this sweet, comforting future. Is the idea giving you a certain dreamy thrill?

Are you sure you’ve never felt velvetmist?

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We’re in the midst of a global mental-­health crisis. More than a billion people worldwide suffer from a mental-health condition, according to the World Health Organization. The prevalence of anxiety and depression is growing in many demographics, particularly young people, and suicide is claiming hundreds of thousands of lives globally each year.

Given the clear demand for accessible and affordable mental-health services, it’s no wonder that people have looked to artificial intelligence for possible relief. Millions are already actively seeking therapy from popular chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude, or from specialized psychology apps like Wysa and Woebot. On a broader scale, researchers are exploring AI’s potential to monitor and collect behavioral and biometric observations using wearables and smart devices, analyze vast volumes of clinical data for new insights, and assist human mental-health professionals to help prevent burnout.

But so far this largely uncontrolled experiment has produced mixed results. Many people have found solace in chatbots based on large language models (LLMs), and some experts see promise in them as therapists, but other users have been sent into delusional spirals by AI’s hallucinatory whims and breathless sycophancy. Most tragically, multiple families have alleged that chatbots contributed to the suicides of their loved ones, sparking lawsuits against companies responsible for these tools. In October, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed in a blog post that 0.15% of ChatGPT users “have conversations that include explicit indicators of potential suicidal planning or intent.” That’s roughly a million people sharing suicidal ideations with just one of these software systems every week.

The real-world consequences of AI therapy came to a head in unexpected ways in 2025 as we waded through a critical mass of stories about human-chatbot relationships, the flimsiness of guardrails on many LLMs, and the risks of sharing profoundly personal information with products made by corporations that have economic incentives to harvest and monetize such sensitive data.

Several authors anticipated this inflection point. Their timely books are a reminder that while the present feels like a blur of breakthroughs, scandals, and confusion, this disorienting time is rooted in deeper histories of care, technology, and trust.

LLMs have often been described as “black boxes” because nobody knows exactly how they produce their results. The inner workings that guide their outputs are opaque because their algorithms are so complex and their training data is so vast. In mental-health circles, people often describe the human brain as a “black box,” for analogous reasons. Psychology, psychiatry, and related fields must grapple with the impossibility of seeing clearly inside someone else’s head, let alone pinpointing the exact causes of their distress.

These two types of black boxes are now interacting with each other, creating unpredictable feedback loops that may further impede clarity about the origins of people’s mental-­health struggles and the solutions that may be possible. Anxiety about these developments has much to do with the explosive recent advances in AI, but it also revives decades-old warnings from pioneers such as the MIT computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum, who argued against computerized therapy as early as the 1960s.

Charlotte Blease, a philosopher of medicine, makes the optimist’s case in Dr. Bot: Why Doctors Can Fail Us—and How AI Could Save Lives. Her book broadly explores the possible positive impacts of AI in a range of medical fields. While she remains clear-eyed about the risks, warning that readers who are expecting “a gushing love letter to technology” will be disappointed, she suggests that these models can help relieve patient suffering and medical burnout alike.

“Health systems are crumbling under patient pressure,” Blease writes. “Greater burdens on fewer doctors create the perfect petri dish for errors,” and “with palpable shortages of doctors and increasing waiting times for patients, many of us are profoundly frustrated.”

Blease believes that AI can not only ease medical professionals’ massive workloads but also relieve the tensions that have always existed between some patients and their caregivers. For example, people often don’t seek needed care because they are intimidated or fear judgment from medical professionals; this is especially true if they have mental-health challenges. AI could allow more people to share their concerns, she argues.

But she’s aware that these putative upsides need to be weighed against major drawbacks. For instance, AI therapists can provide inconsistent and even dangerous responses to human users, according to a 2025 study, and they also raise privacy concerns, given that AI companies are currently not bound by the same confidentiality and HIPAA standards as licensed therapists.

While Blease is an expert in this field, her motivation for writing the book is also personal: She has two siblings with an incurable form of muscular dystrophy, one of whom waited decades for a diagnosis. During the writing of her book, she also lost her partner to cancer and her father to dementia within a devastating six-month period. “I witnessed first-hand the sheer brilliance of doctors and the kindness of health professionals,” she writes. “But I also observed how things can go wrong with care.”

A similar tension animates Daniel Oberhaus’s engrossing book The Silicon Shrink: How Artificial Intelligence Made the World an Asylum. Oberhaus starts from a point of tragedy: the loss of his younger sister to suicide. As Oberhaus carried out the “distinctly twenty-first-century mourning process” of sifting through her digital remains, he wondered if technology could have eased the burden of the psychiatric problems that had plagued her since childhood.

“It seemed possible that all of this personal data might have held important clues that her mental health providers could have used to provide more effective treatment,” he writes. “What if algorithms running on my sister’s smartphone or laptop had used that data to understand when she was in distress? Could it have led to a timely intervention that saved her life? Would she have wanted that even if it did?”

This concept of digital phenotyping—in which a person’s digital behavior could be mined for clues about distress or illness—seems elegant in theory. But it may also become problematic if integrated into the field of psychiatric artificial intelligence (PAI), which extends well beyond chatbot therapy.

Oberhaus emphasizes that digital clues could actually exacerbate the existing challenges of modern psychiatry, a discipline that remains fundamentally uncertain about the underlying causes of mental illnesses and disorders. The advent of PAI, he says, is “the logical equivalent of grafting physics onto astrology.” In other words, the data generated by digital phenotyping is as precise as physical measurements of planetary positions, but it is then integrated into a broader framework—in this case, psychiatry—that, like astrology, is based on unreliable assumptions.

Oberhaus, who uses the phrase “swipe psychiatry” to describe the outsourcing of clinical decisions based on behavioral data to LLMs, thinks that this approach cannot escape the fundamental issues facing psychiatry. In fact, it could worsen the problem by causing the skills and judgment of human therapists to atrophy as they grow more dependent on AI systems.

He also uses the asylums of the past—in which institutionalized patients lost their right to freedom, privacy, dignity, and agency over their lives—as a touchstone for a more insidious digital captivity that may spring from PAI. LLM users are already sacrificing privacy by telling chatbots sensitive personal information that companies then mine and monetize, contributing to a new surveillance economy. Freedom and dignity are at stake when complex inner lives are transformed into data streams tailored for AI analysis.

AI therapists could flatten humanity into patterns of prediction, and so sacrifice the intimate, individualized care that is expected of traditional human therapists. “The logic of PAI leads to a future where we may all find ourselves patients in an algorithmic asylum administered by digital wardens,” Oberhaus writes. “In the algorithmic asylum there is no need for bars on the window or white padded rooms because there is no possibility of escape. The asylum is already everywhere—in your homes and offices, schools and hospitals, courtrooms and barracks. Wherever there’s an internet connection, the asylum is waiting.”

Eoin Fullam, a researcher who studies the intersection of technology and mental health, echoes some of the same concerns in Chatbot Therapy: A Critical Analysis of AI Mental Health Treatment. A heady academic primer, the book analyzes the assumptions underlying the automated treatments offered by AI chatbots and the way capitalist incentives could corrupt these kinds of tools.

Fullam observes that the capitalist mentality behind new technologies “often leads to questionable, illegitimate, and illegal business practices in which the customers’ interests are secondary to strategies of market dominance.”

That doesn’t mean that therapy-bot makers “will inevitably conduct nefarious activities contrary to the users’ interests in the pursuit of market dominance,” Fullam writes.

But he notes that the success of AI therapy depends on the inseparable impulses to make money and to heal people. In this logic, exploitation and therapy feed each other: Every digital therapy session generates data, and that data fuels the system that profits as unpaid users seek care. The more effective the therapy seems, the more the cycle entrenches itself, making it harder to distinguish between care and commodification. “The more the users benefit from the app in terms of its therapeutic or any other mental health intervention,” he writes, “the more they undergo exploitation.”

This sense of an economic and psychological ouroboros—the snake that eats its own tail—serves as a central metaphor in Sike, the debut novel from Fred Lunzer, an author with a research background in AI.

Described as a “story of boy meets girl meets AI psychotherapist,” Sike follows Adrian, a young Londoner who makes a living ghostwriting rap lyrics, in his romance with Maquie, a business professional with a knack for spotting lucrative technologies in the beta phase.

The title refers to a splashy commercial AI therapist called Sike, uploaded into smart glasses, that Adrian uses to interrogate his myriad anxieties. “When I signed up to Sike, we set up my dashboard, a wide black panel like an airplane’s cockpit that showed my daily ‘vitals,’” Adrian narrates. “Sike can analyze the way you walk, the way you make eye contact, the stuff you talk about, the stuff you wear, how often you piss, shit, laugh, cry, kiss, lie, whine, and cough.”

In other words, Sike is the ultimate digital phenotyper, constantly and exhaustively analyzing everything in a user’s daily experiences. In a twist, Lunzer chooses to make Sike a luxury product, available only to subscribers who can foot the price tag of £2,000 per month.

Flush with cash from his contributions to a hit song, Adrian comes to rely on Sike as a trusted mediator between his inner and outer worlds. The novel explores the impacts of the app on the wellness of the well-off, following rich people who voluntarily commit themselves to a boutique version of the digital asylum described by Oberhaus.

The only real sense of danger in Sike involves a Japanese torture egg (don’t ask). The novel strangely sidesteps the broader dystopian ripples of its subject matter in favor of drunken conversations at fancy restaurants and elite dinner parties.

The sudden ascent of the AI therapist seems startlingly futuristic, as if it should be unfolding in some later time when the streets scrub themselves and we travel the world through pneumatic tubes.

Sike’s creator is simply “a great guy” in Adrian’s estimation, despite his techno-messianic vision of training the app to soothe the ills of entire nations. It always seems as if a shoe is meant to drop, but in the end, it never does, leaving the reader with a sense of non-resolution.

While Sike is set in the present day, something about the sudden ascent of the AI therapist—­in real life as well as in fiction—seems startlingly futuristic, as if it should be unfolding in some later time when the streets scrub themselves and we travel the world through pneumatic tubes. But this convergence of mental health and artificial intelligence has been in the making for more than half a century. The beloved astronomer Carl Sagan, for example, once imagined a “network of computer psychotherapeutic terminals, something like arrays of large telephone booths” that could address the growing demand for mental-health services.

Oberhaus notes that one of the first incarnations of a trainable neural network, known as the Perceptron, was devised not by a mathematician but by a psychologist named Frank Rosenblatt, at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory in 1958. The potential utility of AI in mental health was widely recognized by the 1960s, inspiring early computerized psychotherapists such as the DOCTOR script that ran on the ELIZA chatbot developed by Joseph Weizenbaum, who shows up in all three of the nonfiction books in this article.

Weizenbaum, who died in 2008, was profoundly concerned about the possibility of computerized therapy. “Computers can make psychiatric judgments,” he wrote in his 1976 book Computer Power and Human Reason. “They can flip coins in much more sophisticated ways than can the most patient human being. The point is that they ought not to be given such tasks. They may even be able to arrive at ‘correct’ decisions in some cases—but always and necessarily on bases no human being should be willing to accept.”

It’s a caution worth keeping in mind. As AI therapists arrive at scale, we’re seeing them play out a familiar dynamic: Tools designed with superficially good intentions are enmeshed with systems that can exploit, surveil, and reshape human behavior. In a frenzied attempt to unlock new opportunities for patients in dire need of mental-health support, we may be locking other doors behind them.

            <h2>Bangladesh’s garment-making industry is getting greener</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/29/1129308/bangladesh-garment-sustainability-frugal-factories/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Pollution from textile production—dyes, chemicals, and heavy metals like lead and cadmium—is common in the waters of the Buriganga River as it runs through Dhaka, Bangladesh. It’s among many harms posed by a garment sector that was once synonymous with tragedy: In 2013, the eight-story Rana Plaza factory building collapsed, killing 1,134 people and injuring some 2,500 others.

But things are starting to change. In recent years the country has quietly become an unlikely leader in “frugal” factories that use a combination of resource-efficient technologies to cut waste, conserve water, and build resilience against climate impacts and global supply disruptions. Bangladesh now boasts 268 LEED-certified garment factories—more than any other country. Dye plants are using safer chemicals, tanneries are adopting cleaner tanning methods and treating wastewater, workshops are switching to more efficient LED lighting, and solar panels glint from rooftops. The hundreds of factories along the Buriganga’s banks and elsewhere in Bangladesh are starting to stitch together a new story, woven from greener threads.

In Fakir Eco Knitwears’ LEED Gold–certified factory in Narayanganj, a city near Dhaka, skylights reduce energy consumption from electric lighting by 40%, and AI-driven cutters allow workers to recycle 95% of fabric scraps into new yarns. “We save energy by using daylight, solar power, and rainwater instead of heavy AC and boilers,” says Md. Anisuzzaman, an engineer at the company. “It shows how local resources can make production greener and more sustainable.”

The shift to green factories in Bangladesh is financed through a combination of factory investments, loans from Bangladesh Bank’s Green Transformation Fund, and pressure from international buyers who reward compliance with ongoing orders. One prominent program is the Partnership for Cleaner Textile (PaCT), an initiative run by the World Bank Group’s International Finance Corporation. Launched in 2013, PaCT has worked with more than 450 factories on cleaner production methods. By its count, the effort now saves 35 billion liters of fresh water annually, enough to meet the needs of 1.9 million people.

It’s a good start, but Bangladesh’s $40 billion garment industry still has a long way to go. The shift to environmentalism at the factory level hasn’t translated to improved outcomes for the sector’s 4.4 million workers.

Wage theft and delayed payments are widespread. The minimum wage, some 12,500 taka per month (about $113), is far below the $200 proposed by unions—which has meant frequent strikes and protests over pay, overtime, and job security. “Since Rana Plaza, building safety and factory conditions have improved, but the mindset remains unchanged,” says A.K.M. Ashraf Uddin, executive director of the Bangladesh Labour Foundation, a nonprofit labor rights group. “Profit still comes first, and workers’ freedom of speech is yet to be realized.”

In the worst case, greener industry practices could actually exacerbate inequality. Smaller factories dominate the sector, and they struggle to afford upgrades. But without those upgrades, businesses could find themselves excluded from certain markets. One of those is the European Union, which plans to require companies to address human rights and environmental problems in supply chains starting in 2027. A cleaner Buriganga River mends just a small corner of a vast tapestry of need.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It&#39;s been a busy and productive year here at MIT Technology Review. We published magazine issues on power, creativity, innovation, bodies, relationships, and security. We hosted 14 exclusive virtual conversations with our editors and outside experts in our subscriber-only series, Roundtables, and held two events on MIT’s campus. And we published hundreds of articles online, following new developments in computing, climate tech, robotics, and more.

As the year winds down, we wanted to give you a chance to revisit a bit of this work with us. Whether we were covering the red-hot rise of artificial intelligence or the future of biotech, these are some of the stories that resonated the most with our readers.

We did the math on AI’s energy footprint. Here’s the story you haven’t heard.

Understanding AI’s energy use was a huge global conversation in 2025 as hundreds of millions of people began using generative AI tools on a regular basis. Senior reporters James O’Donnell and Casey Crownhart dug into the numbers and published an unprecedented look at AI’s resource demand, down to the level of a single query, to help us know how much energy and water AI may require moving forward.

We’re learning more about what vitamin D does to our bodies

Vitamin D deficiency is widespread, particularly in the winter when there’s less sunlight to drive its production in our bodies. The “sunshine vitamin” is important for bone health, but as senior reporter Jessica Hamzelou reported, recent research is also uncovering surprising new insights into other ways it might influence our bodies, including our immune systems and heart health.

Senior editor Will Douglas Heaven’s expansive look at how to define AI was published in 2024, but it still managed to connect with many readers this year. He lays out why no one can agree on what AI is—and explains why that ambiguity matters, and how it can inform our own critical thinking about this technology.

Ethically sourced “spare” human bodies could revolutionize medicine

In this thought-provoking op-ed, a team of experts at Stanford University argue that creating living human bodies that can’t think, don’t have any awareness, and can’t feel pain could shake up medical research and drug development by providing essential biological materials for testing and transplantation. Recent advances in biotechnology now provide a potential pathway to such “bodyoids,” though plenty of technical challenges and ethical hurdles remain.

It’s surprisingly easy to stumble into a relationship with an AI chatbot

Chatbots were everywhere this year, and reporter Rhiannon Williams chronicled how quickly people can develop bonds with one. That’s all right for some people, she notes, but dangerous for others. Some folks even describe unintentionally forming romantic relationships with chatbots. This is a trend we’ll definitely be keeping an eye on in 2026.

The electric grid is bracing for disruption from more frequent storms and fires, as well as an uncertain policy and regulatory landscape. And in many ways, the publicly owned utility company Lincoln Electric in Nebraska is an ideal lens through which to examine this shift as it works through the challenges of delivering service that’s reliable, affordable, and sustainable.

Exclusive: A record-breaking baby has been born from an embryo that’s over 30 years old

This year saw the birth of the world’s “oldest baby”: Thaddeus Daniel Pierce, who arrived on July 26. The embryo he developed from was created in 1994 during the early days of IVF and had been frozen and sitting in storage ever since. The new baby’s parents were toddlers at the time, and the embryo was donated to them decades later via a Christian “embryo adoption” agency.

How these two brothers became go-to experts on America’s “mystery drone” invasion

Twin brothers John and Gerald Tedesco teamed up to investigate a concerning new threat—unidentified drones. In 2024 alone, some 350 drones entered airspace over a hundred different US military installations, and many cases went unsolved, according to a top military official. This story takes readers inside the equipment-filled RV the Tedescos created to study mysterious aerial phenomena, and how they made a name for themselves among government officials.

Our newsroom has published this annual look at advances that will matter in the long run for over 20 years. This year’s list featured generative AI search, cleaner jet fuel, long-acting HIV prevention meds, and other emerging technologies that our journalists think are worth watching. We’ll publish the 2026 edition of the list on January 12, so stay tuned. (In the meantime, here’s what didn’t make the cut.)

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

Unveiled by the buzzy startup Deep, Vanguard will let teams of scientists live and work on the seabed for a week at a time.

We’ll keep following these developments, but this just wasn’t their year. Here’s why.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s getting harder to beat the heat. During the summer of 2025, heat waves knocked out power grids in North America, Europe, and the Middle East. Global warming means more people need air-­conditioning, which requires more power and strains grids. But a millennia-old idea (plus 21st-century tech) might offer an answer: radiative cooling. Paints, coatings, and textiles can scatter sunlight and dissipate heat—no additional energy required.

“Radiative cooling is universal—it exists everywhere in our daily life,” says Qiaoqiang Gan, a professor of materials science and applied physics at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia. Pretty much any object will absorb heat from the sun during the day and radiate some of it back at night. It’s why cars parked outside overnight are often covered with condensation, Gan says—their metal roofs dissipate heat into the sky, cooling the surfaces below the ambient air temperature. That’s how you get dew.

Humans have harnessed this basic natural process for thousands of years. Desert peoples in Iran, North Africa, and India manufactured ice by leaving pools of water exposed to clear desert skies overnight, when radiative cooling happens naturally; other cultures constructed “cool roofs” capped with reflective materials that scattered sunlight and lowered interior temperatures. “People have taken advantage of this effect, either knowingly or unknowingly, for a very long time,” says Aaswath Raman, a materials scientist at UCLA and cofounder of the radiative­cooling startup SkyCool Systems.

Modern approaches, as demonstrated everywhere from California supermarket rooftops to Japan’s Expo 2025 pavilion, go even further. Normally, if the sun is up and pumping in heat, surfaces can’t get cooler than the ambient temperature. But back in 2014, Raman and his colleagues achieved radiative cooling in the daytime. They customized photonic films to absorb and then radiate heat at infrared wavelengths between eight and 13 micrometers—a range of electromagnetic wavelengths called an “atmospheric window,” because that radiation escapes to space rather than getting absorbed. Those films could dissipate heat even under full sun, cooling the inside of a building to 9 °F below ambient temperatures, with no AC or energy source required.

That was proof of concept; today, Raman says, the industry has mostly shifted away from advanced photonics that use the atmospheric-window effect to simpler sunlight-scattering materials. Ceramic cool roofs, nanostructure coatings, and reflective polymers all offer the possibility of diverting more sunlight across all wavelengths, and they’re more durable and scalable.

Now the race is on. Startups such as SkyCool, Planck Energies, Spacecool, and i2Cool are competing to commercially manufacture and sell coatings that reflect at least 94% of sunlight in most climates, and above 97% in humid tropical ones. Pilot projects have already provided significant cooling to residential buildings, reducing AC energy needs by 15% to 20% in some cases.

This idea could go way beyond reflective rooftops and roads. Researchers are developing reflective textiles that can be worn by people most at risk of heat exposure. “This is personal thermal management,” says Gan. “We can realize passive cooling in T-shirts, sportswear, and garments.”

Of course, these technologies and materials have limits. Like solar power grids, they’re vulnerable to weather. Clouds prevent reflected sunlight from bouncing into space. Dust and air pollution dim materials’ bright surfaces. Lots of coatings lose their reflectivity after a few years. And the cheapest and toughest materials used in radiative cooling tend to rely on Teflon and other fluoropolymers, “forever chemicals” that don’t biodegrade, posing an environmental risk. “They are the best class of products that tend to survive outdoors,” says Raman. “So for long-term scale-up, can you do it without materials like those fluoropolymers and still maintain the durability and hit this low cost point?”

As with any other solution to the problems of climate change, one size won’t fit all. “We cannot be overoptimistic and say that radiative cooling can address all our future needs,” Gan says. “We still need more efficient active air-conditioning.” A shiny roof isn’t a panacea, but it’s still pretty cool.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If the past 12 months have taught us anything, it’s that the AI hype train is showing no signs of slowing. It’s hard to believe that at the beginning of the year, DeepSeek had yet to turn the entire industry on its head, Meta was better known for trying (and failing) to make the metaverse cool than for its relentless quest to dominate superintelligence, and vibe coding wasn’t a thing.

If that’s left you feeling a little confused, fear not. As we near the end of 2025, our writers have taken a look back over the AI terms that dominated the year, for better or worse.

Make sure you take the time to brace yourself for what promises to be another bonkers year.

As long as people have been hyping AI, they have been coming up with names for a future, ultra-powerful form of the technology that could bring about utopian or dystopian consequences for humanity. “Superintelligence” is that latest hot term. Meta announced in July that it would form an AI team to pursue superintelligence, and it was reportedly offering nine-figure compensation packages to AI experts from the company’s competitors to join.

In December, Microsoft’s head of AI followed suit, saying the company would be spending big sums, perhaps hundreds of billions, on the pursuit of superintelligence. If you think superintelligence is as vaguely defined as artificial general intelligence, or AGI, you’d be right! While it’s conceivable that these sorts of technologies will be feasible in humanity’s long run, the question is really when, and whether today’s AI is good enough to be treated as a stepping stone toward something like superintelligence. Not that that will stop the hype kings. —James O’Donnell

Thirty years ago, Steve Jobs said everyone in America should learn how to program a computer. Today, people with zero knowledge of how to code can knock up an app, game, or website in no time at all thanks to vibe coding—a catch-all phrase coined by OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy. To vibe-code, you simply prompt generative AI models’ coding assistants to create the digital object of your desire and accept pretty much everything they spit out. Will the result work? Possibly not. Will it be secure? Almost definitely not, but the technique’s biggest champions aren’t letting those minor details stand in their way. Also—it sounds fun! — Rhiannon Williams

One of the biggest AI stories over the past year has been how prolonged interactions with chatbots can cause vulnerable people to experience delusions and, in some extreme cases, can either cause or worsen psychosis. Although “chatbot psychosis” is not a recognized medical term, researchers are paying close attention to the growing anecdotal evidence from users who say it’s happened to them or someone they know. Sadly, the increasing number of lawsuits filed against AI companies by the families of people who died following their conversations with chatbots demonstrate the technology’s potentially deadly consequences. —Rhiannon Williams

Few things kept the AI hype train going this year more than so-called reasoning models, LLMs that can break down a problem into multiple steps and work through them one by one. OpenAI released its first reasoning models, o1 and o3, a year ago.

A month later, the Chinese firm DeepSeek took everyone by surprise with a very fast follow, putting out R1, the first open-source reasoning model. In no time, reasoning models became the industry standard: All major mass-market chatbots now come in flavors backed by this tech. Reasoning models have pushed the envelope of what LLMs can do, matching top human performances in prestigious math and coding competitions. On the flip side, all the buzz about LLMs that could “reason” reignited old debates about how smart LLMs really are and how they really work. Like “artificial intelligence” itself, “reasoning” is technical jargon dressed up with marketing sparkle. Choo choo! —Will Douglas Heaven

For all their uncanny facility with language, LLMs have very little common sense. Put simply, they don’t have any grounding in how the world works. Book learners in the most literal sense, LLMs can wax lyrical about everything under the sun and then fall flat with a howler about how many elephants you could fit into an Olympic swimming pool (exactly one, according to one of Google DeepMind’s LLMs).

World models—a broad church encompassing various technologies—aim to give AI some basic common sense about how stuff in the world actually fits together. In their most vivid form, world models like Google DeepMind’s Genie 3 and Marble, the much-anticipated new tech from Fei-Fei Li’s startup World Labs, can generate detailed and realistic virtual worlds for robots to train in and more. Yann LeCun, Meta’s former chief scientist, is also working on world models. He has been trying to give AI a sense of how the world works for years, by training models to predict what happens next in videos. This year he quit Meta to focus on this approach in a new start up called Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs. If all goes well, world models could be the next thing. —Will Douglas Heaven

Have you heard about all the people saying no thanks, we actually don’t want a giant data center plopped in our backyard? The data centers in question—which tech companies want to built everywhere, including space—are typically referred to as hyperscalers: massive buildings purpose-built for AI operations and used by the likes of OpenAI and Google to build bigger and more powerful AI models. Inside such buildings, the world’s best chips hum away training and fine-tuning models, and they’re built to be modular and grow according to needs.

It’s been a big year for hyperscalers. OpenAI announced, alongside President Donald Trump, its Stargate project, a $500 billion joint venture to pepper the country with the largest data centers ever. But it leaves almost everyone else asking: What exactly do we get out of it? Consumers worry the new data centers will raise their power bills. Such buildings generally struggle to run on renewable energy. And they don’t tend to create all that many jobs. But hey, maybe these massive, windowless buildings could at least give a moody, sci-fi vibe to your community. —James O’Donnell

The lofty promises of AI are levitating the economy. AI companies are raising eye-popping sums of money and watching their valuations soar into the stratosphere. They’re pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into chips and data centers, financed increasingly by debt and eyebrow-raising circular deals. Meanwhile, the companies leading the gold rush, like OpenAI and Anthropic, might not turn a profit for years, if ever. Investors are betting big that AI will usher in a new era of riches, yet no one knows how transformative the technology will actually be.

Most organizations using AI aren’t yet seeing the payoff, and AI work slop is everywhere. There’s scientific uncertainty about whether scaling LLMs will deliver superintelligence or whether new breakthroughs need to pave the way. But unlike their predecessors in the dot-com bubble, AI companies are showing strong revenue growth, and some are even deep-pocketed tech titans like Microsoft, Google, and Meta. Will the manic dream ever burst? —Michelle Kim

This year, AI agents were everywhere. Every new feature announcement, model drop, or security report throughout 2025 was peppered with mentions of them, even though plenty of AI companies and experts disagree on exactly what counts as being truly “agentic,” a vague term if ever there was one. No matter that it’s virtually impossible to guarantee that an AI acting on your behalf out in the wide web will always do exactly what it’s supposed to do—it seems as though agentic AI is here to stay for the foreseeable. Want to sell something? Call it agentic! —Rhiannon Williams

Early this year, DeepSeek unveiled its new model DeepSeek R1, an open-source reasoning model that matches top Western models but costs a fraction of the price. Its launch freaked Silicon Valley out, as many suddenly realized for the first time that huge scale and resources were not necessarily the key to high-level AI models. Nvidia stock plunged by 17% the day after R1 was released.

The key to R1’s success was distillation, a technique that makes AI models more efficient. It works by getting a bigger model to tutor a smaller model: You run the teacher model on a lot of examples and record the answers, and reward the student model as it copies those responses as closely as possible, so that it gains a compressed version of the teacher’s knowledge.  —Caiwei Chen

As people across the world spend increasing amounts of time interacting with chatbots like ChatGPT, chatbot makers are struggling to work out the kind of tone and “personality” the models should adopt. Back in April, OpenAI admitted it’d struck the wrong balance between helpful and sniveling, saying a new update had rendered GPT-4o too sycophantic. Having it suck up to you isn’t just irritating—it can mislead users by reinforcing their incorrect beliefs and spreading misinformation. So consider this your reminder to take everything—yes, everything—LLMs produce with a pinch of salt. —Rhiannon Williams

If there is one AI-related term that has fully escaped the nerd enclosures and entered public consciousness, it’s “slop.” The word itself is old (think pig feed), but “slop” is now commonly used to refer to low-effort, mass-produced content generated by AI, often optimized for online traffic. A lot of people even use it as a shorthand for any AI-generated content. It has felt inescapable in the past year: We have been marinated in it, from fake biographies to shrimp Jesus images to surreal human-animal hybrid videos.

But people are also having fun with it. The term’s sardonic flexibility has made it easy for internet users to slap it on all kinds of words as a suffix to describe anything that lacks substance and is absurdly mediocre: think “work slop” or “friend slop.” As the hype cycle resets, “slop” marks a cultural reckoning about what we trust, what we value as creative labor, and what it means to be surrounded by stuff that was made for engagement rather than expression. —Caiwei Chen

Did you come across the hypnotizing video from earlier this year of a humanoid robot putting away dishes in a bleak, gray-scale kitchen? That pretty much embodies the idea of physical intelligence: the idea that advancements in AI can help robots better move around the physical world.

It’s true that robots have been able to learn new tasks faster than ever before, everywhere from operating rooms to warehouses. Self-driving-car companies have seen improvements in how they simulate the roads, too. That said, it’s still wise to be skeptical that AI has revolutionized the field. Consider, for example, that many robots advertised as butlers in your home are doing the majority of their tasks thanks to remote operators in the Philippines.

The road ahead for physical intelligence is also sure to be weird. Large language models train on text, which is abundant on the internet, but robots learn more from videos of people doing things. That’s why the robot company Figure suggested in September that it would pay people to film themselves in their apartments doing chores. Would you sign up? —James O&#39;Donnell

AI models are trained by devouring millions of words and images across the internet, including copyrighted work by artists and writers. AI companies argue this is “fair use”—a legal doctrine that lets you use copyrighted material without permission if you transform it into something new that doesn’t compete with the original. Courts are starting to weigh in. In June, Anthropic’s training of its AI model Claude on a library of books was ruled fair use because the technology was “exceedingly transformative.”

That same month, Meta scored a similar win, but only because the authors couldn’t show that the company’s literary buffet cut into their paychecks. As copyright battles brew, some creators are cashing in on the feast. In December, Disney signed a splashy deal with OpenAI to let users of Sora, the AI video platform, generate videos featuring more than 200 characters from Disney&#39;s franchises. Meanwhile, governments around the world are rewriting copyright rules for the content-guzzling machines. Is training AI on copyrighted work fair use? As with any billion-dollar legal question, it depends. —Michelle Kim

Just a few short years ago, an entire industry was built around helping websites rank highly in search results (okay, just in Google). Now search engine optimization (SEO), is giving way to GEO—generative engine optimization—as the AI boom forces brands and businesses to scramble to maximize their visibility in AI, whether that’s in AI-enhanced search results like Google’s AI Overviews or within responses from LLMs. It’s no wonder they’re freaked out. We already know that news companies have experienced a colossal drop in search-driven web traffic, and AI companies are working on ways to cut out the middleman and allow their users to visit sites from directly within their platforms. It’s time to adapt or die. —Rhiannon Williams

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

A conversation with a chatbot can shift people&#39;s political views—but the most persuasive models also spread the most misinformation.

            <div id="article-text">2025 was the year technology stopped being tomorrow’s promise and became today’s anchor. What began as a surge in generative AI and platform innovation two years prior crystallized this year into concrete shifts in how people work, governing bodies legislate, and markets invest. Across continents and industries, the arc of technology bent toward practical impact, regulatory reality, and economic weight!

At the heart of the year’s story was artificial intelligence’s jump from novelty to infrastructure. LLMs and multimodal models moved beyond demos into everyday workflows, influencing how documents are written, campaigns are conceived, products designed, and code generated.

Enterprises that once hesitated began deploying AI tools at scale, with early adopters reporting measurable productivity gains by integrating copilots into core processes, a trend visible in surveys showing widespread adoption among software professionals.

This editorial isn’t a chronicle of every press release.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

It’s a reflection on how 2025, at the crossroads of technology, governance, and economic strategy, brought about a series of inflection points that will shape the next era of creation, competition, and control.

OpenAI’s release of GPT-5 in August pushed the boundaries of what AI could do, delivering notable gains in coding, math, and multimodal understanding. But unlike the jaw-dropping debut of ChatGPT a couple years prior, this new generation of foundation models arrived to a more measured reception.

Tech leaders and investors had begun asking harder questions: beyond impressive demos, could these models drive real products and revenue?

Google’s answer was Gemini 3, launched in November as its “most intelligent model” and immediately woven into Google’s flagship product, Search. For the first time, an AI model upgrade wasn’t just about boastful leaderboard scores, it was about transforming user experience.

Typing a query into Google now often meant receiving an AI-generated synthesis instead of the familiar list of links, a sea change in how information is delivered. Google even unveiled a Gemini “agent” that could execute multi-step tasks like booking travel or organizing email, hinting at a future where AI acts more like a digital butler than a chatbox.

Anthropic’s Claude 4 model, for instance, gained a strong following among developers by expanding how much it could handle at once, processing entire codebases with tens of thousands of lines, rather than by producing viral one-liners.

AI grew up in 2025: it was still improving at breakneck speed, but it also had to earn its keep in real products and justify the billion-dollar bets fueling its rise.

Driving this AI explosion was a parallel leap in hardware. The hunger for AI computers in 2025 was insatiable, and chipmakers raced to deliver.

NVIDIA, whose GPUs had become the era’s essential infrastructure, rolled out its new Blackwell architecture with chips like the B200 that boasted up to 3× the training speed of its predecessor. Cloud data centers around the world scrambled to deploy these to keep up with demand from model training and inference.

Rival chipmakers weren’t idle either: AMD and a cadre of startups pushed innovative AI accelerators, while even Intel signaled ambitions to catch up, reportedly exploring an acquisition of AI chip designer SambaNova.

Perhaps most tellingly, tech giants themselves started designing silicon tailored for AI workloads, recognizing that owning the chip means owning the future of computing.

Beyond AI chips, consumer hardware saw its own milestones. After years of anticipation, augmented reality glasses and mixed-reality headsets finally had their moment, sort of.

Apple’s Vision Pro headset, unveiled in late 2023, reached select markets in 2024; by 2025 developers were crafting the first wave of immersive apps. However, mass adoption lagged due to the device’s sky-high price and bulky format.

Competitors like Meta’s Quest line offered cheaper VR headsets and modest improvements, but the “metaverse” hype of yesteryear largely fizzled out, users and investors had shifted their excitement to generative AI and tangible productivity tools.

Smartphones and laptops in 2025 continued incremental improvements (faster Apple M3/M4 chips, foldable screens becoming more common), yet it was clear the next paradigm shift in personal tech was still on the horizon.

Even so, one hardware frontier made concrete progress: quantum computing. Industry leaders like IBM and Google demonstrated prototype systems with ever-larger qubit counts and made strides in error correction, inching closer to viable quantum machines.

These advances, while esoteric to the public, underscored a broader theme, from AI accelerators to quantum chips, the machinery under the hood of tech was evolving rapidly to enable the software of tomorrow.

If 2025 proved anything, it’s that technology no longer operates above the law. This was the year regulators moved from intent to enforcement, with Europe leading the charge.

After years of debate, the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act came into force, becoming the world’s first complex AI law. From February, certain “unacceptable risk” uses, such as social scoring and real-time biometric surveillance, were banned outright.

By August, transparency rules followed, forcing companies to label AI-generated content and comply with new obligations for general-purpose models. The signal was unmistakable: in Europe, the era of unchecked AI was over.

Companies now face audits, penalties, and real consequences if their systems cross legal or ethical lines, a regulatory moment European officials openly compared to GDPR’s impact on data privacy.

The pressure didn’t stop with AI. In 2025, regulators also went after the gatekeepers. The EU’s Digital Markets Act forced long-resistant changes from Big Tech, most notably when Apple opened the iPhone to third-party app stores and sideloading in Europe, dismantling a 15-year walled garden.

At the same time, enforcement of the Digital Services Act intensified. Platforms were scrutinized for how they handle disinformation, with companies like X warned or penalized during periods of geopolitical tension. In response, social networks expanded moderation teams, adjusted algorithms, and exposed more of their inner workings to researchers.

The US issued an AI executive order and signaled tougher enforcement through agencies like the FTC, while states stepped in, including New York’s law requiring mental-health warnings on addictive social features.

In China, new draft rules targeted AI systems designed for human-like interaction, tightening licensing and ideological oversight. By the end of the year, the freewheeling phase of tech disruption had given way to something more restrained. The question was no longer whether regulation would catch up, but how deeply it would reshape innovation itself.

The platform shake-up that began in 2023 gathered real momentum in 2025, as both companies and users adjusted to a post-pandemic, AI-saturated reality.

Nowhere was this clearer than in social media. Elon Musk’s X, which entered the decade with noise and bravado, found itself on the defensive. Meta’s Threads, initially dismissed after an early spike, steadily closed the gap, nearing parity with X in daily mobile users by mid-year.

X’s audience shrank as policy whiplash and leadership churn eroded confidence, and while its remaining users were still deeply engaged, the era of unquestioned Twitter dominance was over. Disenchanted users scattered across a fragmented landscape, from Meta’s polished Threads to decentralized alternatives like Bluesky and Mastodon, breaking the old Facebook–Instagram–Twitter equilibrium.

The recalibration extended well beyond social feeds.

Major platforms retooled around changing habits: Google reshaped Search around generative answers to fend off AI assistants and algorithmic discovery, while Microsoft pushed its Copilot deeper into Windows, Office, and Bing, betting on “AI inside” as a platform reset.

Everyday behavior shifted too. Smarter voice and chat assistants returned to daily use, handling emails, refunds, and scheduling with little friction. At the same time, screen fatigue set in. Digital-detox travel gained traction, and younger users gravitated toward apps that promised less algorithmic pressure and more human curation. Even streaming came full circle.

After years of fragmentation, providers began rebundling services, offering combined video, music, and gaming packages that looked suspiciously like cable TV reborn, a reminder that while technology moves forward, user preferences often move in cycles.

Amid the gains and momentum, 2025 also became a year of reckoning. As AI systems spread, society began grappling with their cultural and ethical cost. Creators who once marveled at generative tools started pushing back, arguing that their work had been absorbed without consent or compensation.

A wave of lawsuits moved through US courts, with authors accusing companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google of scraping books and articles to train models. By year’s end, the message was unmistakable: if AI is built on human creativity, many believe its rewards can no longer flow in one direction alone.

Public trust in technology was also tested by a rise in malicious uses and misuses. In the financial domain, sophisticated deepfake scams caused real damage. The frequency of such incidents spiked sharply; cybersecurity firms reported a 3000% increase in deepfake-related fraud over two years, and authorities scrambled to educate businesses on new verification practices.

Misinformation continued to be a menace: during elections and conflicts, AI-generated fake images and videos spread on social media, forcing newsrooms to set up rapid-response fact-checking teams.

Encouragingly, 2025 also saw growth in countermeasures, from better deepfake detection algorithms to nascent standards for cryptographic content authentication (the Coalition for Content Provenance, including major publishers and tech platforms, expanded efforts to watermark authentic media).

Still, the information ecosystem remained fraught, as even savvy citizens found it ever harder to tell the truth from fabrication online.

And then there’s the human element: how all this tech is affecting everyday lives and livelihoods. Workplace AI adoption soared this year; tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot and a host of AI assistants became common on office desktops. Studies showed productivity boosts but also raised concerns about workers becoming overly reliant on AI suggestions.

Meanwhile, fears of automation resurfaced in certain sectors, for example, as chatbots took over more customer service and code-generation tools improved, professionals in call centers and junior programming positions wondered about long-term job security.

These anxieties fueled calls for new approaches to education and training, so that the workforce of 2030 will be prepared for more creative, complex tasks that AI can’t easily handle.

Lovable (Stockholm, Sweden) came as one of the most remarkable AI software stories of the year, for me. What began as an open-source project evolved into a commercial platform that lets users build fully functional websites and apps using plain-language prompts, no traditional coding required.

This approach, known in the industry as “vibe coding,” turns ideas into production-ready software simply by describing what you want in natural language.

Lovable’s growth in 2025 was extraordinary by any measure. Eight months after its launch, the company hit over $100 million in annual recurring revenue and raised a $200 million Series A at a roughly $1.8 billion valuation, making it one of Europe’s fastest-growing software startups ever.

By year’s end, Lovable had secured $330 million in Series B funding at about a $6.6 billion valuation, and was rapidly scaling globally.

What makes Lovable meaningful beyond the numbers is what it represents: a shift in how software is built. It demonstrated that AI can democratize development, giving power to non-technical founders, creators, and teams to go from concept to product without traditional engineering barriers.

In an industry long centered on specialized skills and team structures, Lovable’s rise suggested a future where natural language becomes the primary interface to software creation.

On a more hopeful note, 2025 showed signs of a maturing tech culture. Ethical design moved from talking point to practice. Major platforms began experimenting with limits, turning off infinite scroll for teens, adding prompts that nudged users to pause, and treating “time well spent” as a real metric rather than a slogan.

In AI, transparency gained ground. Under pressure from regulators and researchers, companies like OpenAI and Google disclosed more about how their models are trained and where they fall short.

Researchers formed new alliances to share safety techniques, and a second global AI Safety Summit brought dozens of countries together around questions of alignment and control.

None of it amounted to binding rules, but it marked a shift in tone: even the architects of powerful systems openly acknowledged the need for restraint.

Taken together, these moments made 2025 a turning point. For years, technology had surged ahead of the institutions meant to guide it. This year, that gap began to close.

The breakthroughs were real and transformative, but so were the responses to them: laws passed, norms reset, alliances formed. If 2024 was the year the world grasped the power of generative AI, 2025 was the year it began deciding how that power should be used.

The story of technology is no longer just about what can be built, but about how it fits into the lives it shapes, and who gets to decide that fit.

Following the recent transaction, TNW Spaces remains with the Financial Times, while we continue the mission of the website, the events, and the global community.

We already have a dedicated team at tekpon operating the platform, events, and community initiatives. Our objective is to expand and strengthen the team as TNW accelerates its next chapter.

TNW is already a global media platform with millions of readers. We’re not starting over. We are building forward.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Technology is entering a decisive stage: AI is reshaping workflows, distribution is shifting, capital is becoming more selective, and founders are expected to demonstrate value rather than potential.

The world doesn’t need more noise.
It needs clarity, execution, and access to trustworthy knowledge and people.

TNW will serve that need through editorial independence, real expertise, and community-built intelligence.

Success for TNW looks like this: more accurate understanding, faster access to verified knowledge, and direct pathways from insight to action.

I’ve been an entrepreneur since 2007, building in B2B SaaS, marketplaces, and scalable systems. I believe deeply in servant leadership. Without people, I am zero.

I lead two private networks grounded in practice rather than theory:

These groups ensure TNW remains rooted in lived experience, informed by operators, not commentators.

Our mission is to build the most trusted European tech media platform with global reach, focused on practical innovation, responsible scaling, and transparency.

We will continue to host events across Europe’s major capitals including Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Monaco.

These will not be festivals. We are introducing a concept validated through tekpon events: curated gatherings built for meaningful relationships, deep content, and tangible business outcomes.

In 2026, we return to Amsterdam for a special edition centered on AI among other fields. We will explore technologies and strategies shaping the future of work and business:

The editorial focus remains European, while the audience is global.

AI is not a threat to publishing. It is the infrastructure of the next generation of content and knowledge.

At TNW, we will use AI to accelerate research, enable personalized intelligence, reduce noise and bias, and amplify high-quality human expertise. Technology assists. Human judgment remains central.

Because this moment in Europe matters.
Because founders here are ready to scale responsibly.
Because independent media with integrity is rare.
Because innovation deserves a platform built around people, not hype.

TNW will continue its legacy with a renewed emphasis on contribution, execution, and community built through trust.

If you are building, scaling, or researching the next wave of technology, I invite you to engage with us, contribute insights, and participate in shaping the conversation.

The next era begins now. Let’s shape it together.

            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard!

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you. We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.
