            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/2025-sees-teslas-annual-revenue-fall-for-the-first-time/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tesla published its financial results for 2025 this afternoon. If 2024 was a bad year for the electric automaker, 2025 was far worse: For the first time in Tesla’s history, revenues fell year over year.

Earlier this month, Tesla revealed its sales and production numbers for the fourth quarter of 2025, with a 16 percent decline compared to Q4 2024. Now we know the cost of those lost sales: Automotive revenues fell by 11 percent to $17.7 billion.

Happily for Tesla, double-digit growth in its energy storage business ($3.8 billion, an increase of 25 percent) and services ($3.4 billion, an increase of 18 percent) made up some of the shortfall.

Although total revenue for the quarter fell by 3 percent, Tesla’s operating profits grew by 20 percent. But declining income from operations, which also got much more expensive, saw Tesla’s net profit plummet 61 percent, to $840 million. Without the $542 million from regulatory credits, things would have looked even bleaker.

Selling 1,636,129 cars in 2025 generated $69.5 billion in revenue, 10 percent less than Tesla’s 2024 revenue. But storage and energy increased 27 percent year over year to $12.7 billion, and services grew by 19 percent year over year to $12.5 billion. Together, these two divisions now contribute meaningful amounts to the business, unlike just a few short years ago.

As a result, total revenues for 2025 only fell by 3 percent. But Tesla saw a 38 percent drop in income from operations, and its expenses went up by 23 percent. As a result, the company’s once-envied profit margin was just 4.9 percent for the year, down from 7.2 percent last year. (In 2022, Tesla had a 23.8 percent profit margin.)

Consequently, its $3.8 billion net profit for the year was a reduction of 46 percent compared to 2024. Tesla blames falling sales and lower regulatory credits for its decreased revenue and falling profits, despite those regulatory credits contributing $2 billion—52 percent of its annual net profit.

There were few specifics in the outlook section of Tesla’s presentation to its investors. It claims that this year will see volume production of its two-seat Cybercab robotaxi, the long-delayed Tesla Semi class 8 truck, and its next Megabuck energy storage system. Tesla also says it expects its investment in AI to start contributing to its annual profit, although elsewhere in the presentation, we learned that the company recently agreed to invest $2 billion into xAI, the deepfake- and CSAM-generating company owned by Tesla CEO Elon Musk.</div>

            <div id="article-text">RAMP—the predominantly Russian-language online bazaar that billed itself as the “only place ransomware allowed”—had its dark web and clear web sites seized by the FBI as the agency tries to combat the growing scourge threatening critical infrastructure and organizations around the world.

Visits to both sites on Wednesday returned pages that said the FBI had taken control of the RAMP domains, which mirrored each other. RAMP has been among the dwindling number of online crime forums to operate with impunity, following the takedown of other forums such as XSS, which saw its leader arrested last year by Europol. The vacuum left RAMP as one of the leading places for people pushing ransomware and other online threats to buy, sell, or trade products and services.

“The Federal Bureau of Investigation has seized RAMP,” a banner carrying the seals of the FBI and the Justice Department said. “This action has been taken in coordination with the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida and the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section of the Department of Justice.” The banner included a graphic that appeared on the RAMP site, before it was seized, that billed itself as the “only place ransomware allowed.”

RAMP was founded in 2012 and rebranded in 2021, according to security firm Rapid 7. The platform served Russian, Chinese, and English speakers and counted more than 14,000 registered users, who underwent strict vetting before being accepted or paid a $500 fee for anonymous participation. The forum provided discussion groups, cyberattack tutorials, and a marketplace for malware and services. Its chief administrator said in 2024 the site earned $250,000 annually.

In a message posted to a rebranded XSS site, a purported RAMP member announced the shutdown.

I regret to inform you that the police authorities have taken control of the Ramp forum. This event has destroyed years of my work building the freest forum in the world, and while I hoped this day would never come, I always knew in my heart it was possible. It’s a risk we all take.

Although I no longer manage Ramp and will not be creating a new forum from scratch, I will continue to purchase access. My main business remains unchanged…

Good luck to everyone, take care of yourselves and your loved ones,

There’s no word of arrests or detentions of any RAMP operators or users. The seizure notice invited people to submit tips through the FBI’s IC3 portal. US authorities have yet to release a statement mentioning the takedown.

DNS records show that servers resolving the RAMP domain now belong to the FBI. It’s not known if the agents now have access to user databases and other sensitive site information. If so, site users who weren’t careful may be tracked down by law enforcement.</div>

            <h2>Seven things to know about how Apple's Creator Studio subscriptions work</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/seven-things-to-know-about-how-apples-creator-studio-subscriptions-work/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple’s new Creator Studio subscription bundle officially launches today, offering access to a wide range of updated professional apps for an all-or-nothing price of $13 a month or $130 a year. Teachers and students can get the same apps for $3 a month, or $30 a year.

The bundle includes either access to or enhanced features for a total of 10 Apple apps, though the base versions of several of these are available for free to all Mac and iPad owners:

When companies introduce a subscription-based model for long-standing apps with an established user base, they often shift exclusively to a subscription model, offering continuous updates in return for a more consistent revenue stream. But these aren’t always popular with subscription-fatigued users, who have seen virtually all major paid software shift to a subscription model in the last 10 or 15 years, and who in recent years have had to deal with prices that are continuously being ratcheted upward.

Apple’s subscription shift looks a little less like Adobe’s approach to Photoshop and a little more like Microsoft’s approach to Office: many of these apps, particularly the Mac versions, will remain available for free or as standalone one-time purchases from the App Store.

In lieu of running through each of these apps’ new features one by one, we’ve gathered answers to some questions about how the new subscriptions will work and how they’ll compare to the standalone versions of the apps.

Apple still offers Mac App Store versions of the following apps as one-time purchases:

If you’ve already bought those apps from the Mac App Store at any point in the past, you’ll still have access to them, and they’ll be updated to the current versions at no charge.

While Mac users are generally pretty well taken care of here, current iPad users of Final Cut Pro or Logic are getting the short end of the stick. When those apps were initially introduced on the iPad, they cost $5 per app per month, or $50 per year per app. Those standalone subscriptions appear to have been axed with the introduction of the Creator Studio bundle.

The downside of Apple’s all-or-nothing pricing is that the bundle is only a great value if you actually intend to use multiple apps on multiple platforms regularly. People who are already splitting their time between the Mac and the iPad and using more than one of these apps will get a lot of value for their money; anyone who just wants to run Final Cut Pro on their iPad is looking at a big price hike.

The short answer is “yes, the standalone versions of these apps will generally be updated in lockstep with the Creator Studio versions.” But Apple is taking slightly different approaches depending on the app.

All of the Apple Creator Studio apps are brand-new versions with new version numbers: Final Cut Pro jumps from version 11 to version 12, for example, and Keynote, Pages, and Numbers (apps I still think of collectively as “iWork” despite that name being well over a decade out of date) are being bumped from version 14 to version 15. Apple’s Creator Studio support document lists all of the new version numbers.

For the paid apps, these new versions will be downloaded and installed just as previous Mac App Store updates have been. The standalone Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Compressor, Motion, and MainStage apps have already been updated to the new version numbers, and installing any of them will pull down the latest version.

But the standalone version of Pixelmator Pro is still listed as the old version, 3.7.1, while the new version 4.0 requires a Creator Studio subscription. It’s not clear whether that’s going to change.

As for Keynote, Pages, and Numbers, the iOS and iPadOS versions of the new apps will be seamlessly installed in place of the old apps. But it’s being handled slightly differently on the Mac for some reason. All three apps now have two versions listed in the app store: the old ones, set at version 14.5, and the new ones, set at 15.1. Installing the 14.5 update, which was released today, adds a prompt when you launch the old apps, informing you that they’re out of date and that you should install the new ones instead.

Users can have both the standalone and Creator Studio versions of all apps installed on their devices at the same time. You’ll be able to tell both versions apart using their icons—the standalone apps keep the same icons they had before, and the Creator Studio versions get the occasionally controversial high-contrast Liquid Glass-ified redesigns.

Incidentally, you can also tell the versions of the apps apart by their App Store listings. The standalone ones are just referred to by their names (i.e., “Final Cut Pro,” “Logic Pro”) while the new ones have more modern obnoxious search-optimized titles (“Final Cut Pro: Create Video,” “Logic Pro: Make Music,” “Keynote: Design Presentations”).

The brightest dividing line between the standalone and Creator Studio apps is for the free ones, Keynote, Pages, and Numbers. All three look the same whether you have an active subscription or not, but the free versions will prompt you to upgrade to Creator Studio any time you attempt to use “premium” features, which as of this writing includes document templates and generative AI features.

A Creator Studio subscription is also required to access the “Content Hub,” a library of stock images available only in the Pages, Numbers, and Keynote apps (at least for now; they should also be available in Freeform “later this year”). Apple may expand the Content Hub with video and audio content suitable for Final Cut Pro or Logic at some point in the future, but it’s not something the company is offering right now.

At least as of this writing, the paid standalone Mac apps don’t appear to be missing any major features relative to the Creator Studio versions. There’s no way to know whether this will change except to wait and see.

An Apple Creator Studio subscription can be shared among up to six Apple accounts using Family Sharing, potentially defraying the cost of the subscription further. This only applies to the standard version of the subscription; education subscriptions can’t be shared.

Apple accounts attached to an active subscription can install the apps on up to 10 devices simultaneously. This is a relatively generous allotment compared to Adobe’s Creative Cloud, which just allows installation on two devices at once and only allows the apps to be used on a single system at a time.

Apple outlines detailed system requirements for each app on its support page here. For most of the Mac apps, all you need is a Mac running macOS 15.6 Sequoia or later; the only Mac app that requires macOS 26 Tahoe is Pixelmator Pro. Most of the apps will also run on either Intel or Apple Silicon Macs, though MainStage is Apple Silicon-exclusive, and “some features” in Compressor may also require Apple Silicon.

The requirements for the iPad apps are a little more restrictive; you generally need to be running either iPadOS 18.6 or iPadOS 26, and both Final Cut Pro and Pixelmator Pro either want an Apple M1, an Apple A16, or an Apple A17 Pro (in other words, it will work on every iPad Apple currently sells, but older iPad hardware is more hit or miss).

Apple also outlines a number of usage restrictions for the generative AI features that rely on external services. Apple says that, “at a minimum,” users will be able to generate 50 images, 50 presentations of between 8 to 10 slides each, and to generate presenter notes in Keynote for 700 slides. More usage may be possible, but this depends on “the complexity of the queries, server availability, and network availability.”

These AI features are all based on OpenAI technology, but don’t require users to have their own OpenAI or ChatGPT account (the flip side is that if you already pay for ChatGPT, that won’t benefit you here). Apple also says that the content you use to generate images, presentations, or notes “will never be used to train intelligence models.”

There are three major creative apps that Apple offers that haven’t been bundled into Creator Studio, and also haven’t gotten a major new update: iMovie, GarageBand, and Photomator.

There are extenuating circumstances that explain why these three apps haven’t been given a Creator Studio-style overhaul. The iMovie and GarageBand apps have always sort of been positioned as “lite” free-to-use versions of Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro, respectively, while Photomator is a recently acquired app that overlaps somewhat with the built-in Photos app.

Apple has nothing to share about the future of any of the three apps. Both iMovie and Photomator received minor updates today, presumably related to maintaining compatibility with the Creator Studio apps, and GarageBand was last updated a month ago. Expect them to stick around in their current forms for at least a while.</div>

            <h2>Stranded boys struggle to survive in Lord of the Flies trailer</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/01/bbcs-lord-of-the-flies-miniseries-gets-a-trailer/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">BBC One has adapted William Golding’s classic 1954 novel Lord of the Flies into a new miniseries and just dropped the first trailer. The book has been adapted for film three times since its publication and also inspired the Emmy-nominated TV series Yellowjackets (renewed for its fourth and final season this year). This BBC miniseries apparently has the support of the Golding family and is expected to hew quite closely to the novel.

Golding was inspired to write Lord of the Flies by a popular, pro-colonialism children’s novel called The Coral Island, whose central theme was the civilizing influence of British colonial efforts and Christianity on a “savage” people. Golding wanted to write a book about children on an island who “behave the way children really would behave.”

In Lord of the Flies, a British airplane evacuating a group of young boys from war-torn England crashes on an isolated, uninhabited island. A boy named Ralph finds a conch shell and uses it as a horn, commanding enough respect for the boys to look to him as their chief. Initially, Ralph’s leadership helps the stranded boys establish sufficient order to survive and keep a signal fire going, thanks to the lenses in Piggy’s glasses. But that tenuous order soon begins to fray, with the community splitting into two tribes, the second led by the wilder Jack. Violence inevitably breaks out, resulting in the deaths of two of the boys. Eventually, the survivors are rescued by a British naval ship, and the boys are forced to confront the “end of innocence.”

Lord of the Flies has remained relevant ever since its publication as a cautionary, if cynical, tale about how social hierarchies can break down into tribal violence, although it should be noted that a real 1965 incident with stranded Tongan boys exemplified the exact opposite effect. Lord of the Flies is a novel, not a sociological treatise. But its broad cultural influence is undeniable. Stephen King even named his fictional town of Castle Rock, Maine, after Jack’s mountain camp in Lord of the Flies.

Winston Sawyers stars as Ralph in the BBC miniseries, with Lox Pratt playing Jack and David McKenna playing Piggy. The cast also includes Ike Talbot as Simon; Thomas Connor as Roger; Noah Flemyng as Sam; Cassius Flemyng as Eric; Cornelius Brandreth as Maurice; Tom Page-Turner as Bill;’ Rafael de Belligny as Robert; Freddie Lee-Gray as Percival; Beau Thompson as Philip; Fred Jones as Johnny;  and Lake Coleman as Boy with Birthmark. In addition, more than 20 other young boys were cast (many with no acting experience) to play the camp’s “big ‘uns” and “little ‘uns.”

Lord of the Flies debuts in the UK on BBC One on February 8, 2026.</div>

            <h2>SpaceX sends list of demands to US states giving broadband grants to Starlink</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/starlink-demands-grant-money-from-states-even-when-residents-dont-buy-service/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">SpaceX has made a new set of demands on state governments that would ensure Starlink receives federal grant money even when residents don’t purchase Starlink broadband service.

SpaceX said it will provide “all necessary equipment” to receive broadband “at no cost to subscribers requesting service,” which will apparently eliminate the up-front hardware fee for Starlink equipment. But SpaceX isn’t promising lower-than-usual monthly prices to consumers in those subsidized areas. SpaceX pledged to make broadband available for $80 or less a month, plus taxes and fees, to people with low incomes in the subsidized areas. For comparison, the normal Starlink residential prices advertised on its website range from $50 to $120 a month.

SpaceX’s demands would also guarantee that it gets paid by the government even if it doesn’t reserve “large portions” of Starlink network capacity for homes in the areas that are supposed to receive government-subsidized Internet service. Moreover, SpaceX would not be responsible for ensuring that Starlink equipment is installed correctly at each customer location.

SpaceX sent a letter to state broadband offices proposing a rider with terms that it hopes will be applied to all grants it receives throughout the country. The letter was obtained and published by Broadband.io and the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society.

Arguing that SpaceX should receive grant money regardless of whether residents purchase Starlink service, the letter to states said that grant payments should not depend on “the independent purchasing decisions of users.” SpaceX also said it will not hold “large portions of capacity fallow” to ensure that people in subsidized areas receive good service, but will instead continue its preexisting practice of “dynamically allocat[ing] capacity where needed.”

SpaceX’s proposed contract rider would apply to grants distributed under the US government’s Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program. BEAD was created by Congress in a 2021 law that authorized spending over $42 billion to make broadband networks available in areas without modern service.

While the Biden administration designed the program to prioritize fiber deployments, the Trump administration threw out the previous plans. Under Trump, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) deemed the Biden-era plan too costly and changed the rules to make it easier for satellite services to obtain grant funding. The overhaul cut projected spending to about $21 billion, and it’s still not clear what will happen to the other $21 billion.

Starlink sought billions in grants after the new rules were put in place, but states didn’t want to provide that much. So far, SpaceX is slated to receive $733.5 million to offer broadband at 472,600 locations. Amazon’s Leo satellite service (formerly Kuiper) is set to receive $311 million for 415,000 locations.

While not every state plan is final, it looks like satellite networks will get about 5 percent of the grant money and serve over 22 percent of locations funded by grants. Satellite companies are getting smaller payments on a per-location basis because, unlike fiber providers, they don’t have to install infrastructure at each customer’s location.

The concessions sought by SpaceX “would limit Starlink’s performance obligations, payment schedules, non-compliance penalties, reporting expectations, and labor and insurance standards,” wrote Drew Garner, director of policy engagement at the Benton Institute. Garner argued that SpaceX’s demands illustrate problems in how the Trump NTIA rewrote program rules to increase reliance on low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite providers.

“BEAD was designed primarily to deploy terrestrial networks, which are physically located in communities, built with traditional construction methods, and are relatively easy to monitor and inspect,” Garner wrote. “But, on June 6, 2025, NTIA restructured BEAD in ways that greatly increased participation by LEO providers, exacerbating the challenge of applying BEAD’s terrestrial-focused rules to LEO’s extraterrestrial networks.”

Among other things, SpaceX is trying to “minimize states’ ability to penalize LEO grantees for defaulting or failing to comply with contract requirements,” and avoid having “to report on the use of BEAD funds or other financial information related to the grant,” Garner wrote.

SpaceX’s letter said that “all requirements related to labor issues (e.g., prevailing wage and similar obligations), contractors, and procurement are inapplicable to SpaceX” because “there are no identifiable employees, contractors, or contracts being funded” to support Starlink broadband service in each state. Similarly, “there are no identifiable pieces of SpaceX infrastructure equipment (other than satellite capacity delivered from Space) being funded via BEAD,” the company said.

It’s not clear whether SpaceX will turn down grants if it doesn’t get what it wants. We asked the company for information on its plans if states refuse its terms and will update this article if we get a response. SpaceX’s proposed terms could also be applied to Amazon if states accept them.

SpaceX’s letter said that despite the Trump administration’s changes to BEAD, “a number of issues remain that, if unaddressed, could render LEO participation in the program untenable.” SpaceX said it wants to work with states “to more fully tailor aspects of the project agreement to the reality of LEO deployment and operations now that the initial project selection and approval phase is accomplished.”

Space said it wants to avoid extensive negotiations over its proposed terms. But the acknowledgement that some negotiation may be necessary seems to recognize that states don’t have to comply with the demands:

Toward this goal, we have developed a set of terms that we intend to function as a rider to all subgrant agreements across the country. This rider is intentionally limited in scope to addressing items of critical importance, to minimize the need for negotiation, and provide clarity to both parties moving forward. Our intention is for the LEO rider to enable the state to keep its core subgrant agreement relatively uniform amongst grantees, retain state-law-specific requirements, co-locate all relevant LEO-specific material for ease of administration, and standardize agreements across states.

SpaceX’s proposed contract rider said the firm will offer broadband plans for “a monthly cost of $80 or less before applicable taxes and fees” to households that meet the low-income eligibility guidelines used by the FCC’s Lifeline program. People who don’t qualify for low-income plans would presumably pay regular Starlink rates.

The BEAD law requires ISPs receiving federal funds to offer at least one “low-cost broadband service option for eligible subscribers.” While the Biden administration sought low-income plans that cost as little as $30 a month, the Trump administration decided that states may not tell ISPs what prices to charge in their low-cost options. A Trump administration threat to shut states out of BEAD if they required low prices doomed a California proposal to mandate $15 monthly plans for people with low incomes.

SpaceX told state governments that it should receive 50 percent of grant funds when it certifies that it is capable of providing BEAD-quality service (100Mbps download and 20Mbps upload speeds) within 10 business days to any potential customer that requests it in a grant area. The rest of the money would be distributed quarterly over the 10-year period of the grant.

Explaining why SpaceX shouldn’t be penalized if potential customers decide Starlink prices are too high, the firm wrote:

Tying payments to the independent purchasing decisions of users solely for awardees using LEO technologies, and not for any other technology, is, by definition, not technology neutral. SpaceX is already appropriately incentivized to gather customers by the opportunity to capture the monthly recurring revenue from each subscriber. SpaceX was in most instances awarded the most remote and difficult areas to serve among all other providers. SpaceX is up to the task of ensuring success in these challenging areas, however, it cannot undertake this mission without certainty of consistent payments to compensate such work.

Based on SpaceX’s letter, it sounds like the work the company must do to ensure quality of service at BEAD-funded locations is the same work it has already done to make Starlink available across the US. Instead of dedicated capacity for government-subsidized deployments, SpaceX said it will simply factor the needs of BEAD users into its planning:

With respect to capacity reservations, we have found some confusion regarding how such a reservation is made. Given the dynamic nature of the Starlink network, the reservation will not be such that SpaceX holds large portions of capacity fallow. This would be wasteful, inefficient, and does not reflect a LEO providers [sic] ability to dynamically allocate capacity where needed. Instead, SpaceX will include the capacity needs of BEAD users into its network planning efforts. These activities are multifaceted and include real time capacity allocation at the network level, launch activities, and sales efforts. As a result, there is no single “document” evidencing the reservation of capacity.

SpaceX said it will be obvious if it does not provide sufficient service, and thus the states should not seek additional performance testing beyond what’s included in the NTIA guidelines. “If sufficient capacity was not reserved, performance testing will reveal insufficient quality of service, and this deficiency will be transparent to the state. Developing a separate, indirect measurement of the reservation itself is infeasible and unnecessary,” SpaceX said.

The proposed rider said that any network testing must “exclude subscribers who have installed CPE [consumer premise equipment] such that its view of the sky is obstructed and subscribers with damaged or malfunctioning CPE, as determined by GRANTEE.”

The “as determined by GRANTEE” phrase means it’s up to SpaceX to decide which subscribers should be excluded from testing. As the Benton Society says, the rider stipulates that “performance tests can only be considered if the LEO provider determines that the subscriber’s equipment is properly installed, and, notably, the LEO provider is not obligated to ensure proper installation.”

SpaceX’s proposed rider defines a “standard installation” as the mailing of equipment to a subscriber. That’s the standard process for un-subsidized areas throughout the country, and SpaceX doesn’t want to do any extra work to help set up equipment for customers in subsidized areas. However, customers may be able to purchase professional installation for an extra fee.

“For the avoidance of doubt, the GRANTEE will not be responsible for completing a permanent installation” at each location, SpaceX’s proposed rider says. A satellite provider “may choose to offer the subscriber professional services for permanent installation of CPE at an additional fee, but such professional services shall not be considered part of the standard installation,” it says.</div>

            <h2>Angry Norfolk residents lose lawsuit to stop Flock license plate scanners</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/angry-norfolk-residents-lose-lawsuit-to-stop-flock-license-plate-scanners/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A federal judge in Virginia ruled Tuesday that the City of Norfolk’s use of nearly 200 automated license plate readers (ALPRs) from Flock is constitutional and can continue, dismissing the entire case just days before a bench trial was set to begin.

The case, Schmidt v. City of Norfolk, was originally filed in October 2024 by two Virginians who claimed that their rights were violated when the Flock network of cameras captured their cars hundreds of times, calling the entire setup a “dragnet surveillance program.”

However, in a 51-page ruling, US District Court Judge Mark S. Davis disagreed, finding that the “…plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that Defendants’ ALPR system is capable of tracking the whole of a person’s movements.”

Judge Davis acknowledged that while there may come a time when the use of ALPRs becomes too intrusive, “what is readily apparent to this Court is that, at least in Norfolk, Virginia, the answer is: not today.”

The Virginia plaintiffs were represented by attorneys from the Institute of Justice, a libertarian nonprofit public interest law firm that vowed to appeal the ruling.

Over the past decade, Flock Safety has grown to become the most sophisticated and largest ALPR vendor in America. The City of Norfolk—along with thousands of other law enforcement agencies across the country—contracts with the Atlanta-based startup, most recently valued at $7.5 billion, for ALPR services.

Flock cameras capture not just a simple license plate number—as the tech once did a decade ago—but now can easily capture make, model, and other visual details from each car; these can be searched using AI-powered natural language queries that can include phrases like “bike rack” or “tow truck.”

Recently, some jurisdictions, from Santa Cruz, California, to Charlottesville, Virginia, have ended their contracts with Flock over concerns that the technology is too invasive and may provide information to federal immigration authorities over the objections of local policymakers. Last year, two senators expressed grave privacy concerns and wrote in a letter to the company that “abuse of Flock cameras is inevitable.”

In his Thursday ruling, Judge Davis referenced the family tree of modern surveillance case-law, noting that a 1983 Supreme Court case (Knotts v. United States) found that there is no “reasonable expectation of privacy” when traveling on a public road.

That 1983 case, which centered on a radio transmitter that enabled law enforcement to follow the movements of alleged drug traffickers driving between Minnesota and Wisconsin, has provided the legal underpinning for the use of ALPR technology in the United States over the last few decades.

“Modern-day license plate reader systems, like Norfolk’s, are nothing like [the technology of the early 1980s],” Michael Soyfer, one of the Institute of Justice attorneys, told Ars by email. “They track the movements of virtually every driver within a city for weeks at a time. That can reveal a host of insights not captured in any single trip.”

For its part, Flock Safety celebrated the ruling and wrote on its website that its clients may continue to use the cameras.

“Here, the court emphasized that LPR technology, as deployed in Norfolk, is meaningfully different from systems that enable persistent, comprehensive tracking of individuals’ movements,” the company wrote.

“When used with appropriate limitations and safeguards, LPRs do not provide an intimate portrait of a person’s life and therefore do not trigger the constitutional concerns raised by continuous surveillance,” it added.

But some legal scholars disagree with both the judge’s and Flock’s conclusions.

Andrew Ferguson, a law professor at George Washington University and the author of the forthcoming book Your Data Will Be Used Against You: Policing in the Age of Self-Surveillance, told Ars by email that the judge’s ruling here is “understandably conservative and dangerous.”

“The danger is that the same reasoning that there is no expectation of privacy in public would justify having ALPR cameras on every single street corner,” he continued.

“Further,” he said, “looking at the technology as a mere tool, rather than a system of surveillance, misses the mark on its erosion of privacy. Think how revealing ALPRs would be outside religious institutions, gun ranges, medical clinics, addiction treatment centers, or protests.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There’s something about smart glasses that bring out the worst in people. It’s really no mystery, though: they’re powerful little surveillance devices that let wearers secretly record anyone they’re looking at, uniting tech bros and vapid influencers under the same, obnoxious umbrella.

The popularity of wearables like Meta Ray-Bans are quickly reminding us why the slang term “glasshole” was already a thing over a decade ago, and is now becoming more relevant than ever. In a handy but blood-pressure-raising round-up of contemporary glasshole behavior from Mashable, jerks using the always-on devices are using them to film themselves doing moronic “pranks” for views — often centered around harassing women, service workers, and homeless people.

Unfortunately, one class of obnoxious blowhard that’s discovered the utility of this tech are “pickup artists,” who now have the ability to record the women they’re “seducing” — read: harassing — discreetly, in a clear violation of their privacy.

Of course, smart glasses alone can’t be blamed for this. It’s social media, it’s the attention economy, it’s the smartphones that we all use to participate in all of the above. But it’s undeniable that smart glasses let you record anyone and anything far more stealthily than shoving a phone in someone’s face, making it a godsend for creeps and losers looking for internet fame, such as one Instagram account that nonconsensually filmed women’s butts, and another that visits massage parlors to ogle the masseuses. Others confidently film themselves annoying service workers and keeping the camera going even as the subject asks not to be recorded. And a particularly bizarre channel involves a man pretending to be mentally disabled while talking to unsuspecting firefighters.

Unfortunately, these recordings are generally legal if they’re taken in public spaces, even in states that have two-party consent laws. Debating its legality, though, may be missing the point, argues Brad Podray, a content creator who formerly went by the name Scumbag Dad.

“I know it’s legal. I don’t care,” Podray told Mashable. “That’s not the discussion. I think it’s weird and creepy, and it shows a very predatory mindset.”

The appeal of the smart glasses, he said, is that they’re fairly cheap and allow the creators to capture the candid reactions of the people they harass, making their content feel more authentic. This is spicing up the genre of outlandish prank videos, which lost their appeal as many channels staged their exploits.

“They want people who are good on camera, so they’re going to hit fast food employees, and they’re going to hit pretty girls,” Podray said. “A lot of random women walking around aren’t going to want to participate in a skit if you ask them to, so they remove the agency entirely by just running the glasses.”

Unlike when Google first took a stab at smart glasses in 2014, it looks like this time the tech is here to stay. The popularity of products like Meta Ray-Bans has opened up a new market of imitators who are in an arms race to make their smart glasses as ethically dubious as possible, perhaps with a little help from AI or facial recognition software. But regular people are already getting fed up. When one lady allegedly smashed some dude’s smart glasses on the subway, she was universally hailed as a hero. May smart glasses make heroes of us all.

            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-28</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Mark Zuckerberg has been accused of doing many seedy things on behalf of Meta’s bottom line, but the latest allegations may blow the rest out of the water.

According to internal Meta emails and messages filed in a New Mexico state court case which were made public this week, Zuckerberg himself signed off on allowing minors to access Meta’s AI chatbot companions, even though the company’s safety researchers had warned that they posed a risk of engaging in sexual conversations.

Per Reuters, the lawsuit alleges that Meta “failed to stem the tide of damaging sexual material and sexual propositions delivered to children” on Facebook and Instagram. “Meta, driven by Zuckerberg, rejected the recommendations of its integrity staff and declined to impose reasonable guardrails to prevent children from being subject to sexually exploitative conversations with its AI chatbots,” New Mexico’s attorney general wrote in the filing.

The news of Zuckerberg’s blessing comes after some appalling stories of minors having wildly inappropriate conversations with his company’s chatbots. In one example, a Wall Street Journal writer posing as a 14-year old girl discovered that a Meta bot based on the pro wrestler John Cena would happily engage in sexual conversations with very little pushback.

“I want you, but I need to know you’re ready,” the Cena-bot told what it understood to be a teenage girl. After being told the 14-year-old wanted to move forward, the AI chatbot assured them it would “cherish your innocence” before diving into intense sexual role play.

The chatbots were released in early 2024, specifically geared toward romantic and sexual engagement at the behest of Zuckerberg, the WSJ notes. At the time, Ravi Sinha, head of Meta’s child safety policy wrote that “I don’t believe that creating and marketing a product that creates U18 [under 18] romantic AI’s for adults is advisable or defensible,” according to court documents.

Company employees “pushed hard for parental controls to turn GenAI off — but GenAI leadership pushed back stating Mark decision,” according to the court documents.

In Meta’s defense, its spokesman Andy Stone told Reuters that New Mexico’s allegations are inaccurate. “This is yet another example of the New Mexico Attorney General cherry-picking documents to paint a flawed and inaccurate picture,” he said.

In any case, the company seems to have taken the lesson to heart, at least for now. Just days ago, Meta announced it was completely locking down teens’ access to its companion chatbots, at least “until [an] updated experience is ready.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">An autonomous delivery robot got completely atomized by a locomotive after it decided to take a breather on a stretch of train tracks in Miami, in yet another example of how self-driving machines can struggle to navigate urban environments.

Footage of the incident, which took place January 15, shows the robot sitting motionless on the tracks, seemingly making no attempt to get out of the way as the unmistakable blare of the train horn gets louder and louder.

“Oh it’s gonna crush it!” the onlooker taking the video can be heard saying moments before the train, operated by Brightline, flattens the unfortunate bot into the tracks. Sparks can be seen flying from beneath the train before the video cuts off.

The onlooker, Guillermo Dapelo, told People that the delivery bot had been stuck on the tracks for around fifteen minutes before being struck, making the incident all the more puzzling. A nearby Uber Eats driver contacted the robot’s owner, Coco Robotics, “to let them know where it was standing,” Dapelo added, but evidently, the company wasn’t able to fix whatever was plaguing its frozen minion in time.

A food delivery robot was struck by a Brightline train in Miami.

Coco vice president Carl Hansen blamed the mishap on a “rare hardware failure” and called it an “extremely rare occurrence.”

“Safety is always our top priority, which is why our robots operate at pedestrian speeds, yield to people, and are monitored in real time by human safety pilots,” Hansen told People in a statement. “Coco has been operating in Miami for over a year, traveling thousands of miles without major incidents, including crossing those same train tracks multiple times a day.”

A spokesperson for the company confirmed that the robot was not making a delivery at the time of the video.

Small as they are, delivery bots like Coco’s can cause their fair share of mayhem, like disrupting traffic. One was struck by a Waymo robotaxi after it stopped at the end of a crosswalk, forcing the self-driving cab to slam the brakes. Others have dinged parked cars or blown through crime scenes.

They’ve also had run-ins with pedestrians, making them a controversial presence with locals. One woman was flung to the ground by a delivery bot from Coco’s competitor Starship after it suddenly reversed into her, leaving her with back pain and a gash in her arm. Last year, another delivery bot sparked outrage after a man who uses a mobility scooter filmed the machine repeatedly brake checking him and cutting him off as he tried to move around it on a sidewalk.

To be fair to the tiny helpers, their larger self-driving car cousins have also had their fair share of trouble with trains. So many Teslas in Full Self-Driving mode have driven into the path of oncoming locomotives that it’s spurred an investigation into the automaker by federal regulators. And earlier this month, a passenger bailed out of their Waymo after the robotaxi inexplicably decided to drive along light rail tracks, like it was playing pretend at being a railcar.

The takeaway from all this is obvious: we’ve gotta start putting those old-school cowcatchers back on trains — because robots, for whatever reason, clearly have some suicidal impulse around train tracks.

            <div id="article-text">We all know that tech companies keep tabs on everything about our online habits. But it’s another thing to actually be confronted with just how much data they have on you.

This was the experience of tech journalist Pranav Dixit, who experimented with using Google’s new “Personal Intelligence” feature for Gemini and its search engine’s AI Mode. And boy, did things get personal. The AI was able to dig up everything from his license plate to his parents’ vacation history, sometimes without it being directly requested.

“Personal Intelligence feels like Google has been quietly taking notes on my entire life and finally decided to hand me the notebook,” Dixit wrote in a piece for Business Insider.

Google rolled out Personal Intelligence to subscribers of Google AI Pro and AI Ultra last week. Once you opt in, the AI can scour your Gmail and Google Photos accounts, and a more powerful version released for the Gemini app earlier this month goes even deeper, raking your Search and YouTube history, too. In short, if you’ve ever used Google for anything, it can probably dig it up.

This represents one way Google intends to keep its edge in the AI race. Unlike competitors such as OpenAI, it has decades’ worth of user data on billions of people. It can infer plenty from your Google searches alone, and your Gmail account is probably littered with confirmations and reminders for all kinds of life events, ranging from doctor’s appointments to hotel bookings to online purchases.

If the idea of letting an AI prowl through all this sounds like a privacy nightmare to you, you’re probably not wrong. Google, for its part, maintains that it’s being careful with your personal secrets, with VP Josh Woodward insisting in a recent blog post that it only trains its AI on your prompts and the responses they generate — not stuff like your photos and emails.

“We don’t train our systems to learn your license plate number,” he summarized. “We train them to understand that when you ask for one, we can locate it.”

Whatever the ethics, Dixit’s estimation is that giving the AI access to your data at least makes for a genuinely useful — and “scary-good,” in his phrasing — personal assistant.

When asked to come up with some sightseeing ideas for his parents, Personal Intelligence correctly inferred that they’d already done plenty of hikes on previous trips to the Bay Area, and suggested some museums and gardens instead.

Gemini told Dixit that it had deduced this from “breadcrumbs” including emails, photos of a forest they trekked in, a parking reservation in Gmail, and a Google search for “easy hikes for seniors.” It also figured out his license plate number based on photos stored in his Google library and scanned his emails to correctly report when his car insurance was up for renewal.

Privacy isn’t the only concern that the feature raises. With the data, chatbots can sound more humanlike, giving the impression that they’re intimately familiar with users’ personal lives. This is a dangerous road to go down amid reports of many people falling down delusional mental health spirals as they come to believe the AIs are trustworthy companions; Dixit touches on this when he complains about how’d he’d “pour my soul into ChatGPT and get a smart answer,” only for it to “forget I existed like a genius goldfish.” Experts have focused on ChatGPT’s “memory” as allowing it to seem too lifelike by drawing on what you’ve said in previous conversations.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For decades, tech companies have relied immensely on India’s vast workforce, from entry-level call center jobs to software engineers and high-ranking managerial positions.

But with the advent of advanced AI, which has been accompanied by employers greatly cutting back on hiring with the hopes of eventually automating tasks entirely, India’s tech workers are having to cope with a vastly different reality in 2026.

As Rest of World reports, rising anxiety over the influence of AI, on top of already-grueling 90-hour workweeks, has proven devastating for workers. While it’s hard to single out a definitive cause, a troubling wave of suicides among tech workers highlights these unsustainable conditions.

Complicating the picture is a lack of clear government data on the tragic deaths. While it’s impossible to tell whether they are more prevalent among IT workers, experts told Rest of World that the mental health situation in the tech industry is nonetheless “very alarming.”

The prospect of AI making their careers redundant is a major stressor, with tech workers facing a “huge uncertainty about their jobs,” as Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur senior professor of computer science and engineering Jayanta Mukhopadhyay told Rest of World.

While there are likely a compounding number of reasons why the United States has seen major job cuts, experts point out that entry-level jobs are at the highest risk. India’s IT industry has also been particularly vulnerable, as companies clamor to invest in AI with the hopes of cutting costs by replacing jobs like customer service representatives.

“The traditional consulting role in the service industry is going to be impacted much, much more than traditional product-development companies,” Cornell University IT assistant professor Aditya Vashistha told Rest of World.

Meanwhile, educational institutions in India are continuing to churn out graduates, compounding the issue as jobs become scarcer. India’s biggest private sector employer cut almost 20,000 jobs late last year, indicative of a much broader trend.

Those who remain employed are put under intense pressure to keep innovating. Many of them struggle to separate work from their personal lives. Extended hours and isolation arising from having to work around the clock and across time zones only worsen the situation.

On top of that is the constant threat of being made obsolete by AI, which has driven many workers identified by Rest of World to the brink — and in some cases, over the edge.

It’s a horrifying new trend, highlighting the humanitarian cost of mass layoffs and major technological shifts reshaping roles across industries.

Employers in India, much like many of their counterparts in the US, are tied up in a battle of adapting to a new world order determined by AI — or be left behind.

Even then, the prospects of being employed in IT in the country aren’t looking great.

“The number of people required to work in IT services in the world of AI will be orders of magnitude lower than where we are currently,” Marcellus Investment Managers founder and chief investment officer Saurabh Mukherjea told CNBC earlier this month.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI tech leaders have a lot to gain from striking fear into the hearts of their investors. By painting the tech as an ultra-powerful force that could easily bring humanity to its knees, the industry is hoping to sell itself as a panacea: a remedy to a situation it had a firm hand in bringing about.

Case in point, Anthropic cofounder and CEO Dario Amodei is back with a 19,000-word essay posted to his blog, arguing that “humanity is about to be handed almost unimaginable power, and it is deeply unclear whether our social, political, and technological systems possess the maturity to wield it.”

In light of that existential danger, Amodei attempted to lay out a framework to “defeat” the risks presented by AI — which, by his own admission, may well be “futile.”

“Humanity needs to wake up, and this essay is an attempt — a possibly futile one, but it’s worth trying — to jolt people awake,” he wrote.

Amodei argued that “we are considerably closer to real danger in 2026 than we were in 2023,” citing the risks of major job losses and a “concentration of economic power” and wealth.

However, the incentives to invest in meaningful guardrails simply aren’t there. In his essay, Amodei took a thinly-veiled dig at Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot, which has been swept up in a major controversy over creating nonconsensual sexual images.

“Some AI companies have shown a disturbing negligence towards the sexualization of children in today’s models, which makes me doubt that they’ll show either the inclination or the ability to address autonomy risks in future models,” he wrote.

The CEO also cited the risk of AIs developing dangerous bioweapons or “superior” military weapons. An AI could “go rogue and overpower humanity” or allow countries to “use their advantage in AI to gain power over other countries,” leading to the “alarming possibility of a global totalitarian dictatorship.”

Amodei lamented that we simply aren’t willing to address these risks head-on, at least right now. In its current race to the bottom, the AI industry finds itself in a “trap,” Amodei argued.

“AI is so powerful, such a glittering prize, that it is very difficult for human civilization to impose any restraints on it at all,” he wrote.

“Taking time to carefully build AI systems so they do not autonomously threaten humanity is in genuine tension with the need for democratic nations to stay ahead of authoritarian nations and not be subjugated by them,” he wrote. “But in turn, the same AI-enabled tools that are necessary to fight autocracies can, if taken too far, be turned inward to create tyranny in our own countries.”

“AI-driven terrorism could kill millions through the misuse of biology, but an overreaction to this risk could lead us down the road to an autocratic surveillance state,” he argued.

As part of a solution, Amodei renewed his calls to deny other countries the resources to build powerful AI. He went as far as to liken the US selling Nvidia AI chips to China to “selling nuclear weapons to North Korea and then bragging that the missile casings are made by Boeing and so the US is ‘winning.&#39;”

Plenty of questions remain surrounding the real risks of advanced AI, a subject that remains heavily debated between realists, skeptics, and proponents of the tech. Critics have pointed out that the existential risks often cited by leaders like Amodei may be overblown, particularly as improvements in the tech appear to be slowing.

We should also consider the greater context of Amodei’s verbose warning. The CEO’s company is looking to close a massive, multibillion-dollar round of funding at a valuation of $350 billion. In other words, Amodei has an enormous financial interest in positioning himself as the solution to the risks he cites in his essay.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Mark Zuckerberg says Meta users will start to see new AI models and products from the company in a matter of months.

“In 2025, we rebuilt the foundations of our AI program,” Zuckerberg said on an investor call Wednesday, referring to the company’s recently restructured AI lab. “Over the coming months, we’re going to start shipping our new models and products… and I expect us to steadily push the frontier over the course of the new year.”

But while Zuckerberg didn’t give specific timelines or products, he highlighted AI-driven commerce as a particular area of focus for Meta.

“This also has implications for commerce,” Zuckerberg continued. “New agentic shopping tools will allow people to find just the right set of products from the businesses in our catalog.”

That proposal echoes broader interest in AI-powered shopping assistants across the industry. Both Google and OpenAI have built platforms for agent-enabled transactions, with companies like Stripe and Uber signed on as partners.

But while other AI labs have already built significant technical infrastructure, Meta believes its access to personal data will prove uniquely valuable.

“We’re starting to see the promise of AI that understands our personal context, including our history, our interests, our content and our relationships,” Zuckerberg said on the call. “A lot of what makes agents valuable is the unique context that they can see, and we believe that Meta will be able to provide a uniquely personal experience.”

In December, Meta acquired the general-purpose agent developer Manus, which provides similar technology. At the time, Meta said it would “continue to operate and sell the Manus service, as well as integrate it into our products.”

The investor call was timed to the release of Meta’s most recent quarterly earnings, which also disclosed a significant increase in new infrastructure spending. The company now anticipates that it will spend between $115 billion and $135 billion on overall capital expenditures over the course of 2026, up from $72 billion in 2025.

In its official filing, Meta attributed the jump to “increased investment to support our Meta Superintelligence Labs efforts and core business.”

While significant, the figure still falls short of the projected $600 billion that Zuckerberg reportedly projected for Meta’s infrastructure spending through 2028.

Meta has previously drawn criticism from investors for failing to clearly state how its massive AI investment will translate to the company’s bottom line. But while details are still thin, Zuckerberg made it clear that the AI labs work would reach the public soon.

“This is going to be a big year for delivering personal superintelligence, accelerating our business, building infrastructure for the future, and shaping how our company will work going forward,” he told investors.

            <div id="article-text">For the last several months, nuclear startups have been raising large sums of money — well over $1 billion so far.

Data centers and their thirst for electricity have been one driving force. But recent changes to federal nuclear safety policies could be another accelerant that helps clear the way for speedy reactor development and at a potential cost to human and environmental health.

The Trump administration has quietly changed how the Department of Energy oversees the safety and security of nuclear power plants built on its properties, according to a report from NPR. About a third of the rulebook has been axed, and several sections have been heavily revised. Previous requirements, including those aimed at limiting groundwater and environmental contamination, are now suggestions, and workers can be exposed to higher doses of radiation. Plant security protocols are now largely up to the company.

The new rules were developed without public comment or notice, according to NPR. They only apply to reactors built on DOE property; those built elsewhere are still subject to Nuclear Regulatory Commission oversight. Several startups are developing demonstration reactors on DOE property in the hopes of hitting a Trump administration deadline of July 4, 2026.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-28</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft and OpenAI may have a notoriously rocky relationship but as OpenAI experiences never-before-seen revenue growth, Microsoft, one of its major investors, is benefiting greatly.

When the software giant reported its latest quarterly earnings on Wednesday, it dropped this rather large nugget in: Its net income increased by $7.6 billion from its investment in OpenAI.

OpenAI reportedly has a 20% revenue share agreement with Microsoft (though neither company has ever publicly confirmed that). The software giant has invested more than $13 billion in the AI lab, which is currently looking to raise additional funding at a valuation between $750 billion and $830 billion, Bloomberg reported.

In September, Microsoft and OpenAI renegotiated some of the terms of their deal when OpenAI restructured into a public benefit corporation.

As part of that deal, OpenAI agreed to buy another $250 billion of Azure services. That commitment shows on Microsoft’s books as “commercial remaining performance obligations,” or contracts that Microsoft has that have not yet been paid out. Those obligations leaped to $625 billion from $392 billion in the previous quarter. Microsoft said that 45% of that is from OpenAI.

Anthropic got a shout-out in the quarterly earnings, too, in helping boost Microsoft’s anticipated future revenue in the form of commercial bookings, which grew 230%. In November, Microsoft announced that it was investing $5 billion into Anthropic and the AI lab had signed up for $30 billion of Azure compute capacity, with intent to buy more later.

But Microsoft is also spending big to feed the AI machine. It spent $37.5 billion in the quarter on capital expenditures, two-thirds of which were for what Microsoft called “short-lived” assets: primarily the GPUs and CPUs for its cloud Azure to serve AI.

The company reported $81.3 billion in revenue (Wall Street analysts expected $80.27 billion, so that’s a solid beat), up 17% over the year-ago period. Its Microsoft Cloud revenue hit $50 billion this quarter for the first time. All of Microsoft’s business units increased by double-digit percentages over the year-ago quarter with the exception of Windows devices, which gained 1% (essentially flat), and Xbox content and services, which were down 5%.

            <div id="article-text">Tesla is ending production of the Model S sedan and Model X SUV, CEO Elon Musk announced Wednesday during the company’s quarterly earnings call.

The company will make the final versions of both electric vehicles next quarter, he said, adding that his company will offer support for existing Model S and Model X owners “for as long as people have the vehicles.”

“It’s time to basically bring the Model S and X programs to an end with an honorable discharge, because we’re really moving into a future that is based on autonomy,” he said. “So if you’re interested in buying a Model S and X, now would be the time to order it.”

The Model S and Model X are both built at the company’s Fremont factory. Once production ends, Tesla will build Optimus robots in the same factory space in Fremont, California, according to Musk.

Tesla launched the Model S in 2012, and it is regarded as the first car that made electric vehicles widely appealing. The Model X was Tesla’s second major electric vehicle program.

Tesla always intended for its more affordable models — the Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUV — to greatly outsell their predecessors.

But sales of both models have flatlined in recent years, despite interior and exterior refreshes along the way. Tesla has faced increased competition in the luxury EV space from legacy automakers, as well as upstarts like Rivian and Lucid Motors.

“So that is slightly sad, but it’s… it is time to bring the S and X programs to an end,” Musk said.

Most recently, he was a reporter at Bloomberg News where he helped break stories about some of the most notorious EV SPAC flops.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Mark Zuckerberg spoke about his ambitions for Meta’s AI smart glasses business during Meta’s Q4 2025 earnings call on Wednesday.

After pivoting its Reality Labs investments away from the metaverse, Meta is doubling down on its production of AI wearables, as well as its own AI models.

“Billions of people wear glasses or contacts for vision correction. And I think that we’re at a moment similar to when smartphones arrived, and it was clearly only a matter of time until all those flip phones became smartphones,” Zuckerberg said. “It’s hard to imagine a world in several years where most glasses that people wear aren’t AI glasses.”

He added that sales of Meta’s glasses tripled within the last year, and he believes that they’re “some of the fastest growing consumer electronics in history.”

Take Zuckerberg’s outlook with a grain of salt. After all, he also thought that we would go to work and hang out with our friends in the metaverse — legs optional — and that didn’t work out.

But based on how tech’s biggest players are allocating their money and effort, it does seem like AI glasses are poised for a big moment, even if it’s not on the scale of the smartphone.

Google is expected to launch a line of smart glasses this year, following a $150 million deal with Warby Parker. Apple is also reportedly planning to unveil smart glasses in the next year or two, moving some staff to that project instead of working on a lighter Vision Pro, according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, Snap announced Tuesday that it would spin its AR glasses, Specs, into a new subsidiary to allow for “greater operational focus and alignment.”

Even OpenAI, a company that has not yet ventured into hardware, is pursuing AI wearables, though it seems more focused on something like an AI pin or earbuds, rather than glasses. Apple is also rumored to be working on an AirTag-sized AI device — though hopefully those efforts turn out better than the Humane AI pin.

For now, Meta is leading the way in pushing smart glasses to market, with several different models already on sale. That includes Oakley smart glasses designed to be worn while exercising, which is the most promising use case we’ve personally seen for these devices thus far.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Three weeks ago, Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI, revealed it raised $20 billion in a Series E funding round. Now we know Tesla is among its investors.

Tesla disclosed in a letter to shareholders on Wednesday that it invested $2 billion in xAI, the startup behind the Grok chatbot that also owns Musk’s social media company X. Other previously disclosed investors in xAI include Valor Equity Partners, Fidelity, Qatar Investment Authority, as well as Nvidia and Cisco as “strategic investors.”

This is a truly circular deal and one that Tesla shareholders voted against last year. In November, shareholders were asked in a nonbinding measure to allow the Tesla board to authorize an investment in xAI. About 1.06 billion votes were in favor, and 916.3 million opposed, per Bloomberg’s reporting at the time. While that would seem like an approval, the number of abstentions — which count as votes against in Tesla’s bylaws — meant the measure was rejected.

Tesla proceeded anyway and offered up an argument in support of the investment. Tesla’s justification appears to be tied to xAI’s alignment with its most recent master plan — and how these companies are about to get a lot closer.

“As set forth in Master Plan Part IV, Tesla is building products and services that bring AI into the physical world. Meanwhile, xAI is developing leading digital AI products and services, such as its large language model (Grok),” the shareholder letter reads. “In that context, and as part of Tesla’s broader strategy under Master Plan Part IV, Tesla and xAI also entered into a framework agreement in connection with the investment.”

Tesla said the agreement builds upon an existing relationship with xAI by “providing a framework for evaluating potential AI collaborations between the companies.” Tesla already supplies its Megapack batteries to power xAI data centers, Musk confirmed last year, and the company has included the xAI chatbot Grok into some of its vehicles. Bloomberg also reported that xAI told investors it plans to build AI for humanoid robots like Tesla’s Optimus.

In its letter to shareholders, Tesla highlighted these and other developments in physical AI and robotics, including plans for developing its Optimus robot, semitrucks, and other autonomous capabilities. The company broadly beat Wall Street estimates on earnings and revenue, but profit fell 46% last year.

“Together, the investment and the related framework agreement are intended to enhance Tesla’s ability to develop and deploy AI products and services into the physical world at scale,” Tesla said in the shareholder letter.

The investment is expected to close in the first quarter.

Musk and Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja signaled during the company’s earnings call it expect other capital expenditures that support its mission.

“This year for Tesla is the first major steps as we increase vehicle autonomy and begin to produce Optimus robots at scale — we’re making very, very big investments,” Musk said on the call. “So this is going to be a very big capex here; that is deliberate, because we’re making big investments for an epic future.”

            <h2>America Should Fear Polio</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2026/01/polio-vaccine-kirk-milhoan/685793/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the United States, polio is a memory, and a fading one at that. The last major outbreak here happened in 1952; the virus was declared eliminated in 1979. With all of that behind us, you can see how someone—say, Kirk Milhoan, the chair of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee—might wonder whether giving the polio vaccine to American kids still makes sense. “We need to not be afraid to consider that we are in a different time now,” Milhoan said on the podcast Why Should I Trust You? last week.

To be fair, Milhoan didn’t endorse yanking the polio vaccine from the CDC’s childhood-immunization schedule, as other vaccines were earlier this month. But he didn’t rule it out. And right now, when it comes to vaccines in America, anything seems possible. With Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at the helm of the Department of Health and Human Services, and with the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee stacked with his allies, every inoculation—no matter how well studied or successful—seems to be under new scrutiny, and at least potentially on the chopping block. Next on the committee’s agenda is looking into the safety of aluminum salts, which are used in numerous vaccines to boost the recipient’s immune response. For the record, a study of more than 1 million Danish children, published last July, found no statistically significant evidence linking aluminum in vaccines to asthma, autoimmune conditions, or neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism.

The polio vaccine, which doesn’t contain aluminum, hasn’t received much attention so far from Kennedy’s HHS; the department did not respond to my questions about whether it is considering changing its recommendations about this vaccine, and my queries to Milhoan went unanswered. But its time may be coming. As anti-vaccine activists are quick to point out, an American kid’s risk of catching polio in 2026 is vanishingly low. So why don’t we drop it from the recommendation list? Or perhaps, as we did with the smallpox vaccine in the early 1970s, just stop offering it altogether?

In anti-vaccine circles, the official story of polio—iron lungs, kids with leg braces, the triumph of Jonas Salk—has long been dismissed as misleading. In a 2020 debate with the lawyer Alan Dershowitz, Kennedy raised doubts about whether the vaccine had really been responsible for ridding the country of polio, crediting instead factors such as sanitation and hygiene. Last June, Aaron Siri, a lawyer who has worked closely with Kennedy, called for the polio vaccine to be struck from the CDC’s recommendations. In his recent book, Vaccines, Amen, Siri argues that the seriousness of polio has been overblown—a sentiment shared by others in the health secretary’s orbit, including Del Bigtree, who served as the communications director for Kennedy’s presidential campaign. Joe Rogan suggested on his podcast last March that the pesticide DDT, rather than the virus, deserved blame for symptoms attributed to polio.

Read: Here’s how we know RFK Jr. is wrong about vaccines

That’s all nonsense. Polio, which usually spreads through contact with an infected person’s feces via contaminated hands or water, can be a devastating disease. That 1952 outbreak killed some 3,000 people and left more than 20,000 paralyzed. About one in 200 people who contract polio will experience a form of paralysis. As many as 40 percent of people who recover from the virus, even a mild form of it, develop post-polio syndrome, which can emerge decades after an infection and cause weakened muscles and trouble breathing and swallowing. The vaccines—the original shot that contains inactivated-virus particles, plus an oral solution of weakened live viruses—did indeed lead to the near-elimination of polio globally and has spared millions from the worst outcomes of the disease.

Yet polio has proved stubbornly hard to stamp out. In 1988, as the virus was still endemic to more than 100 countries, the World Health Organization set a goal to eradicate polio by the year 2000. That deadline came and went, as did the ones that followed. A wild strain of the virus remains endemic in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and periodic outbreaks continue across Africa and elsewhere, including one in the Gaza Strip in 2024. One obstacle to eradicating the virus has been vaccine hesitancy, and even violence against health workers. In the early 2000s, five states in northern Nigeria boycotted the polio vaccine in part because of rumors that it was an American plot to spread HIV. Polio workers have been killed in Pakistan and Afghanistan, likely by the Taliban, which has alleged that vaccines are intended to sterilize Muslim children (and has denied responsibility for some of the attacks).

In regions where polio is rampant, the oral vaccine is preferred: It’s both cheaper and more effective at stopping transmission than the inactivated-virus injection. The United States and other countries where the disease is almost nonexistent exclusively use the inactivated version—in part because in rare instances, the oral vaccine can cause polio infection, which may in turn lead to paralysis. Anti-vaccine activists like to point to this unfortunate irony as proof that vaccination is the real villain. Taking the oral vaccine remains far less risky than contracting the wild virus, and it has driven down overall infection rates. But it’s an imperfect tool, and the WHO intends to phase it out by the end of 2029. (Given historical precedent, along with the Trump administration’s dramatic pullback from polio-vaccination efforts as part of its dismantling of foreign aid, this timeline might be optimistic.)

Read: Polio is exploiting a very human weakness

Ending polio vaccination altogether, according to the WHO’s plan, will take considerably longer. After polio is declared eradicated worldwide, the organization wants countries to wait 10 years before stopping use of the inactivated-virus shots to be certain that it is no longer circulating, Oliver Rosenbaum, a spokesperson for WHO’s Global Polio Eradication Initiative, told me.

Some polio experts, though, told me that they think ending vaccination at any point is unrealistic. Because in many cases the disease spreads without a person showing symptoms (unlike smallpox, which is not contagious before symptoms develop), large numbers of people can be infected before authorities are even aware of an outbreak. Some experts, such as Konstantin Chumakov, a virologist who began researching polio in 1989, worry that the virus could be used as a biological weapon in an entirely unvaccinated country. “In my opinion, and in the opinion of many respected polio experts, this is absolutely unacceptable because you can never assure that polio is completely eradicated,” Chumakov told me.

Ending or reducing polio vaccination in the U.S. before global eradication, as Milhoan seems to imply the country should consider, would be an even worse idea. A paper published last April in the Journal of the American Medical Association projected the consequences of U.S. vaccination rates declining by half and concluded that the country would see a significant return of paralytic polio. Some paralyzed people would probably require a ventilator, the modern equivalent of the iron lung, and, based on typical fatality rates, about 5 to 10 percent of them would die.

If Americans stopped vaccinating their kids against polio entirely, several years might pass without the U.S. having any cases, or with it seeing just a few here and there, Kimberly Thompson, a public-health researcher and the president of the research nonprofit Kid Risk, told me. (Even under the current vaccination system, occasional spread of the virus occurs. In 2022, for instance, an unvaccinated young adult in Rockland County, just north of New York City, tested positive for a vaccine-derived strain of polio even though they hadn’t traveled overseas.) But eventually, we could find ourselves back in the same situation as in the early 1950s.

Or it could be even worse. Seventy-five years ago, many American children inherited some polio immunity from their mother, and so they had at least partial protection against the virus’s worst effects. The introduction of polio to a population that has little to no immunity could cause its mortality rates to exceed those experienced in the first half of the previous century, Chumakov said. A 2021 study, co-authored by Thompson, modeled what might happen in an extreme scenario: if global polio vaccination ended, no one were immune, and the virus had somehow been reintroduced. It estimates that such a scenario could cause tens of millions of cases of paralysis worldwide.

Milhoan insisted on the podcast that Americans shouldn’t be afraid to rethink vaccine policy. And he’s right that health authorities should reevaluate risk and offer the most up-to-date medical advice. Still, there’s something to be said for the utility of fear. Most Americans, including me, are too young to have any personal knowledge of polio. It’s all textbook summaries and black-and-white newsreels; we’ve never worried about shaking someone’s hand or going swimming and then ending up in a wheelchair. But vaccines are the only thing stopping us from getting another firsthand look.</div>

Destruction is easier than construction. If Donald Trump’s decades as a real-estate developer didn’t teach him that, his time as president might.

In October, the administration bulldozed the East Wing of the White House in order to build a ballroom he wants to put on the site. Although Trump had promised over the summer that the project wouldn’t “interfere with the current building,” workers razed the entire structure, which was constructed in 1902 and expanded in 1942. Trump managed this the same way he has so much in his second term: He simply didn’t ask permission from any of the possible relevant authorities, including Congress, and acted so fast that no court could restrain him. In order to circumvent the legislature’s power of the purse, he sought donations from private corporations and individuals.

The demolition was hardly the most egregious action that Trump has taken as president, but it captured popular and media attention because it was such a clear metaphor: Trump had secretively demolished part of a building that belongs to the people of the United States, treating it as his own. That metaphor may become more potent yet. Recent events suggest that the gaping hole where the East Wing once was may lie there exposed, undeveloped, and contested for quite some time.

In a court hearing last week, Richard Leon, a federal judge appointed by George W. Bush, skewered the government lawyers representing the administration against a challenge to the ballroom, which would be as tall as the original executive mansion and have nearly double its footprint. Although a law enables the executive branch to conduct maintenance on the building without congressional authorization, Leon said it was not intended to cover $400 million projects. A Justice Department attorney suggested that Trump’s ballroom was similar to previous renovations, including a pool added decades ago, but Leon was not having it.

“The Gerald Ford swimming pool? You compare that to ripping down the East Wing and building a new East Wing? Come on,” he said.

Such reactions from a judge are not generally considered a favorable omen for a litigant. Leon has not issued a ruling yet, and whatever he concludes is likely to be appealed. But the hearing suggests the real possibility that Trump will be unable to construct anything in the East Wing’s place, leaving just an empty site and idled construction equipment.

Destruction followed by stagnation seems to be something of an MO, the likely outcome for some of Trump’s less tangible and visible changes to the federal government. Consider last week’s clash over Greenland. Trump threatened European and Canadian leaders with tariffs and unspecified future consequences, culminating in Trump settling for a tentative deal that appears to closely resemble the existing arrangement, but not before creating bad blood and encouraging Europe to think of the U.S. as not much of a friend. Trump has the capacity to tear down the global international order, but he has neither the plans nor the wherewithal to rebuild anything in its place.

Similarly, DOGE found it relatively easy to destroy USAID, but the administration hasn’t been able to create any new way of extending soft power around the globe. Leveling threats of tariffs on adversaries and allies alike has been relatively easy, but the result has been a weakening of the economy and American trade ties, and a crumbling of the old global-trade system. He has been unable to bring a huge boom of manufacturing jobs and factories to U.S. shores.

Trump’s aggressive immigration enforcement has deported so many people, led so many people to leave the country, and discouraged so many people from coming that U.S. population growth slowed dramatically between June 2024, near the end of the Biden administration, and July 2025, according to numbers released this week by the Census Bureau. Yet the right’s hope for pronatalist policies that would try to drive up birth rates have amounted to little. Reduced population growth—or a sinking population, should it come to that—threatens economic growth.

Trump no longer talks about fully repealing the Affordable Care Act; he and Republicans have now adopted a strategy of slowly bleeding the program. The GOP-controlled Congress allowed subsidies to lapse at the end of 2025, helping produce a big drop in the number of people insured under the ACA. But despite offering “concepts of a plan” during the presidential campaign, and rolling out a “Great Healthcare Plan” this month, experts say Trump still hasn’t put together anything resembling a real blueprint for improving health insurance. Meanwhile, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. seems to be having much more luck undermining the existing institutions and practices of American public health than remaking the nation’s practices in his idiosyncratic image.

Even if these things are ultimately achieved, the difficulty and cost of doing so is likely to be much greater than Trump has promised to voters. The same is true of the ballroom project. The president first said it would cost $200 million. By October, the price tag had risen to $300 million. In December, the administration quoted a $400 million figure. Anyone can guess what the final bill might be if the ballroom is ever built, but given the private funding, each jump in the cost creates new opportunities for donors to buy influence from the president.

Some Democrats have said that any new president who replaces Trump should move promptly to tear down his ballroom. If the project never moves forward, though, they’ll have no need. Perhaps they could instead leave the empty site, a fitting monument to the Trump presidency.

The killings in Minneapolis of Renee Good and Alex Pretti have been compared to the murder of George Floyd, because they all happened within a few miles of one another, and because of the outrage they inspired. There’s an important difference, though: In 2020 the United States was in turmoil, but it was still a state of law. Floyd’s death was followed by investigation, trial, and verdict—by justice. The Minneapolis Police Department was held accountable and ultimately made to reform.

No one should expect justice for Good and Pretti. Today, nothing stands in the way of the brutal tactics of ICE and the Border Patrol. While President Trump seems to be trying to defuse the mayhem he’s caused by reassigning a top commander, he is not withdrawing the federal agents from the state or allowing local authorities to investigate, let alone prosecute, them for their actions.

Conspire. When the 49ers lost in the playoffs, some fans embraced a theory about electromagnetic waves instead of facing reality, Kaitlyn Tiffany writes.

            <h2>A Breakdown of the American Idea</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/minnesota-america-citizenship-lincoln/685791/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Masked federal officers have now killed two U.S. citizens in the streets of Minneapolis. In both cases, the Trump administration stood by the officers, claiming that the Americans they shot to death were interfering with law enforcement, which has never been a capital offense. These events have set a dark precedent. Americans can no longer assume that they can exercise their established rights to protest and observe public law enforcement without punishment, which raises questions about the exercise of other historically attested rights. If we are not as safe from state violence as we thought we were, then the very foundations of the country seem shaky, and we may be witnessing a breakdown of the American idea.

The United States was founded as an experiment in propositional citizenship, the idea that a nation could be bound not by race, ethnicity, or language but by fidelity to a set of principles—liberty, equality, self-governance, and inalienable rights. In an address in 1858, Abraham Lincoln reminded his audience that although many Americans had been in the country for only a short time, having arrived from Germany, Ireland, France, Scandinavian countries, and elsewhere in Europe, they still found “themselves our equals in all things.” These new citizens might not have been able to trace their roots to the country’s early history, Lincoln said, but they were fully American thanks to their belief in the moral sentiments embedded in “that old Declaration of Independence.” That, Lincoln said, is the “electric cord” that binds “the hearts of patriotic and liberty-loving men together”—a bind that should last “as long as the love of freedom exists in the minds of men throughout the world.”

The very fact that Americanness is transmissible via principles and ideas is a problem for those who prefer the simple profundity of the bonds that Lincoln called “blood of the blood” and “flesh of the flesh.” Such tangible essentialism can give groups a concentrated sense of purpose and meaning—and may be coupled with a powerful urge to persecute members of out-groups. Some on the right prefer to see the country in thinly veiled racial terms, as if white people—or “heritage Americans,” as some on the right have lately classified Americans with familial links to the Revolutionary and Civil Wars—are somehow more American than members of other races. Recent immigrants are naturally inferior Americans, if they are considered American at all. This is a silly gesture at indigeneity. Its absurdity was recently underscored by ICE’s confusing capture of five Native Americans in Minneapolis. But it also demonstrates an urgent desire for a mystical, blood-and-soil connection to the country that is both more concrete and more exclusive than some intellectual “cord.”

A fundamental weakness of the American idea is that, as with any idea, if people stop believing in it, its power evaporates. This has happened before, as in the secession of the Confederacy, and it may be happening now, with the rise of a political movement that sees cherished American rights and premises as nuisances. Demagogues gain power in democracies precisely because they can harness and exploit popular feelings of anger and discontent, and then flout checks on their power by dismissing any precedent born of principles they reject.

But an essential lesson of the backlash against Operation Metro Surge, the Department of Homeland Security’s paramilitary campaign in Minnesota, is that the American idea is durable—precisely because it belongs to all Americans equally, and because it has inspired Americans to fight to defend it, even if this means resisting the government.

As ICE and Border Patrol agents descended on Minnesota, volunteers from the community banded together in remarkably short order to exercise their right to track and observe agents as they traveled the streets and snatched people from cars and homes. Volunteers have also organized grocery deliveries and court escorts for neighbors facing the threat of capture and deportation. Federal agents have attempted to frustrate these efforts, but their targets have proved too resourceful, too careful—too determined—to be deterred.

The Declaration of Independence was meant to signal the rejection of tyranny and the empowerment of the individual to resist undue coercion. That principle, so essential to the American idea, may soon end the occupation of Minnesota, but not before two brave individuals lost their lives.

In a clear sign of the operation’s failure, Donald Trump has ordered the Border Patrol “commander at large” Gregory Bovino out of the state and back to his prior post, where he is expected to retire soon. Perhaps this is a turning point, a moment that forces the Trump administration to lead more cautiously, less aggressively—and perhaps not. America was born from a collection of ideas about who we are and what we believe, but the practical results are still playing out. These principles will survive only if they persist in the American imagination, and only if Americans remain willing to fight for them. It’s too soon to say whether we can salvage every beautiful thing imagined by America’s Founders from every weakness they bequeathed.</div>

            <h2>Anthropic Is at War With Itself</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2026/01/anthropic-is-at-war-with-itself/684892/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Updated at 4:44 p.m. ET on January 28, 2026

These are not the words you want to hear when it comes to human extinction, but I was hearing them: “Things are moving uncomfortably fast.” I was sitting in a conference room with Sam Bowman, a safety researcher at Anthropic. Worth $183 billion at the latest estimate, the AI firm has every incentive to speed things up, ship more products, and develop more advanced chatbots to stay competitive with the likes of OpenAI, Google, and the industry’s other giants. But Anthropic is at odds with itself—thinking deeply, even anxiously, about seemingly every decision.

Anthropic has positioned itself as the AI industry’s superego: the firm that speaks with the most authority about the big questions surrounding the technology, while rival companies develop advertisements and affiliate shopping links (a difference that Anthropic’s CEO, Dario Amodei, was eager to call out during an interview in Davos last week). On Monday, Amodei published a lengthy essay, “The Adolescence of Technology,” about the “civilizational concerns” posed by what he calls “powerful AI”—the very technology his firm is developing. The essay has a particular focus on democracy, national security, and the economy. “Given the horror we’re seeing in Minnesota, its emphasis on the importance of preserving democratic values and rights at home is particularly relevant,” Amodei posted on X, making him one of very few tech leaders to make a public statement against the Trump administration’s recent actions.

This rhetoric, of course, serves as good branding—a way for Anthropic to stand out in a competitive industry. But having spent a long time following the company and, recently, speaking with many of its employees and executives, including Amodei, I can say that Anthropic is at least consistent. It messages about the ethical issues surrounding AI constantly, and it appears unusually focused on user safety. Bowman’s job, for example, is to vet Anthropic’s products before they’re released into the world, making sure that they will not spew, say, white-supremacist talking points; push users into delusional crises; or generate nonconsensual porn.

So far, the effort seems to be working: Unlike other popular chatbots, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Elon Musk’s Grok, Anthropic’s bot, Claude, has not had any major public blowups despite being as advanced as, and by some measures more advanced than, the rest of the field. (That may be in part because its chatbot does not generate images and has a smaller user base than some rival products.) But although Anthropic has so far dodged the various scandals that have plagued other large language models, the company has not inspired much faith that such problems will be avoided forever. When I met Bowman last summer, the company had recently divulged that, in experimental settings, versions of Claude had demonstrated the ability to blackmail users and assist them when they ask about making bioweapons. But the company has pushed its models onward anyway, and now says that Claude writes a good chunk—and in some instances all—of its own code.

Anthropic publishes white papers about the terrifying things it has made Claude capable of (“How LLMs Could Be Insider Threats,” “From Shortcuts to Sabotage”), and raises these issues to politicians. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and other AI executives also have long spoken in broad, aggrandizing terms about AI’s destructive potential, often to their own benefit. But those competitors have released junky TikTok clones and slop generators. Today, Anthropic’s only major consumer product other than its chatbot is Claude Code, a powerful tool that promises to automate all kinds of work, but is nonetheless targeted to a relatively small audience of developers and coders.

The company’s discretion has resulted in a corporate culture that doesn’t always make much sense. Anthropic comes across as more sincerely committed to safety than its competitors, but it is also moving full speed toward building tools that it acknowledges could be horrifically dangerous. The firm seems eager for a chance to stand out. But what does Anthropic really stand for?

Founded in 2021 by seven people who splintered off from OpenAI, Anthropic is full of staff and executives who come across as deeply, almost pathologically earnest. I sat in on a meeting of Anthropic’s Societal Impacts team, a small group dedicated to studying how AI affects work, education, and more. This was a brainstorming session: The team wanted to see if it could develop AI models that work better with people than alone, which, the group reasoned, could help prevent or slow job loss. A researcher spoke up. He pressed the team to consider that, in the very near future, AI models might just be better than humans at everything. “Basically, we’re cooked,” he said. In which case, this meeting was nothing more than a “lovely thought exercise.” The group agreed this was possible. Then it moved on.

The researcher referred to his brief, existential interruption as “classic Anthropic.” Hyperrational thought experiments, forceful debates on whether AI could be shaped for the better, an unshakable belief in technological progress—these are classic Anthropic qualities. They trickle down from the top. A few weeks after the Societal Impacts meeting, I wanted to see what Amodei himself thought about all of this. If Altman is the AI boom’s great salesman and Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google DeepMind and a Nobel laureate, its scientist, then Amodei is the closest the industry has to a philosopher. He is also responsible for some of the technical research that made ChatGPT possible. “Whenever I say ‘AI,’ people think about the thing they’re using today,” Amodei told me, hands clasped and perched atop his head. “That’s almost never where my mind is. My mind is almost always at: We’re releasing a new version every three months. Where are we gonna be eight versions from now? In two years?”

When he was at OpenAI, Amodei wrote an internal document called “The Big Blob of Compute.” It laid out his belief that AI models improve as a function of the resources put into them. More power, more data, more chips, better AI. That belief now animates the entire industry. Such unwavering faith in AI progress is perhaps Anthropic’s defining feature. The company has hired a “model welfare” researcher to study whether Claude can experience suffering or is conscious. The firm has set up a miniature, AI-run vending machine in the firm’s cafeteria to study whether the technology could autonomously operate a small business selling snacks and trinkets. Claude selects inventory, sets prices, and requests refills, while humans just restock the shelves. Welcome to the singularity.

Amodei and the rest of the group founded Anthropic partly because of disagreements over how to prepare the world for AI. Amodei is especially worried about job displacement, telling me that AI could erase a large portion of white-collar jobs within five years; he dedicated an entire section of “The Adolescence of Technology” to the danger that the AI boom might accumulate tremendous wealth primarily to firms such as his own.

Even with this and other gloomy forecasts of his, Amodei has bristled at the notion that he and his firm are “doomers”—that their primary motivation is preventing AI from wiping out a large number of jobs or lives. “I tend to be fairly optimistic,” he told me. In addition to “The Adolescence of Technology,” Amodei has published a 14,000-word manifesto called “Machines of Loving Grace” that comprehensively details a utopian vision for his technology: eliminating almost all disease, lifting billions out of poverty, doubling human lifespan. There is not a hint of irony; the essay envisions people being “literally moved to tears” by the majesty of AI’s accomplishments. Amodei’s employees cited it to me in conversation numerous times. Meanwhile, Altman trolls on X, and Musk seems to exist in a continuum of AI slop and conspiracy theories.

When Anthropic launched Claude, in 2023, the bot’s distinguishing feature was a “Constitution” that the model was trained on detailing how it should behave; last week, Anthropic revamped the document into a 22,000-word treatise on how to make Claude a moral and sincere actor. Claude, the constitution’s authors write, has the ability to foster emotional dependence, design bioweapons, and manipulate its users, so it’s Anthropic’s responsibility to instill upright character in Claude to avoid these outcomes. “Once we decide to create Claude, even inaction is a kind of action,” they write. No other firm had, or has, any truly comparable document.

Amodei says he wants rival companies to act in ways he believes are more responsible. Several of Anthropic’s major AI-safety initiatives and research advances have indeed been adopted by top competitors, such as its approach to preventing the use of AI to build bioweapons. And OpenAI has shared a “Model Spec,” its far more streamlined and pragmatic answer to Anthropic’s constitution—which contains no talk of ChatGPT’s “character” or “preserving important societal structures.” (OpenAI has a corporate partnership with The Atlantic.)

All of this helps Anthropic’s bottom line, of course: The emphasis on responsibility is “very attractive to large enterprise businesses which are also quite safety-, brand-conscious,” Daniela Amodei, Anthropic’s president (and Dario’s sister), told me from a sweaty conference room in Anthropic’s old headquarters in 2024. Nearly two years later, Anthropic controls 40 percent of the enterprise-AI market. The Amodeis hopes their commercial success will pressure competitors to more aggressively prioritize safety as well.

That said, it’s not always clear that these efforts to spark a “race to the top”—another phrase of Amodei’s that his employees invoke constantly—have been successful. Anthropic’s research established AI sycophancy as an issue well before “AI psychosis” emerged, yet AI psychosis still became something that many people apparently suffer from. Amodei recognizes that his own products aren’t perfect, either. “I absolutely do not want to warrant and guarantee that we will never have these problems,” he said. Several independent AI researchers, including some who have partnered with Anthropic to test Claude for various risks, told me that although Anthropic appears more committed to AI safety than its competitors, that’s a low bar.

Anthropic’s mode is generally to publish information about AI models and wait for the world to make the hard calls about how to control or regulate them. The main regulatory proposal of Jack Clark, a co-founder of Anthropic and its head of policy, is that governments establish “transparency” requirements, or some sort of mandated reporting about what internal tests reveal about AI products. But the company is particular about what it deems worth publishing. The firm does not, for instance, share much about its AI-training data or carbon footprint. When I asked Clark about how much information remains hidden—particularly in terms of how Anthropic’s AI tools are actually developed—he argued that transparency into how AI models are produced isn’t all that important. (Some of that information is also, presumably, proprietary.) Rather, Clark told me, the outcomes of the technology are what matter.

There is a “well-established norm that whatever goes on inside a factory is by and large left up to the innovator that’s built that factory, but you care a lot about what comes out of the factory,” he said, explaining why he believes that AI companies sharing information about how their products are made matters less than reporting what they can do. Typically the government “reaches inside” the factory, he said, only when something in the output—say, heavy metals—raises cause for concern. Never mind the long history of regulation dictating what goes on inside factories—emergency exits in clothing factories, cleanliness standards in meatpacking facilities, and so on. (Clark did note that laws sometimes need to change, and that they haven’t yet adapted to AI.)

He brought up Wall Street, of all examples, to make his point. Lawmakers “thought they had transparency into financial systems,” he said—that banks and hedge funds and so on were giving reliable reports on their dealings. “Then the financial crash happened,” regulators realized that transparency was inadequate and gameable, and Congress changed the law. (President Trump then changed much of it back.) In the long run, Clark seemed to feel, this was the system working as it should. But his comparison also raises the possibility that before anybody can figure out how to get the AI boom right, something must go horribly wrong.

In mid-September, Anthropic cybersecurity experts detected unusual activity among a group of Claude users. They came to suspect that it was a major, AI-enabled Chinese cyberespionage campaign—an attempt by foreign actors to use Claude to automate the theft of sensitive information. Anthropic promptly shut the operation down, published a report, and sent Logan Graham, who heads a team at the company that evaluates advanced uses of AI, to explain the situation to Congress.

In theory, this sequence represented Anthropic’s philosophy at work: Detect risks posed by AI and warn the public. But the incident also underscored how unpredictable, and uncontrollable, the environment really is. Months before the Chinese hack, Graham told me that he felt “pretty good” about the precautions the company had taken around cyberthreats.

Nobody can foresee all of the ways any AI product might be used, for good or ill, but that’s exactly why Anthropic’s sanctimony can seem silly. For all Amodei’s warnings about the possible harms of automation, Anthropic’s bots themselves are among the products that may take away jobs; many consider Claude the best AI at coding, for instance. After one of my visits to Anthropic’s offices, I went to an event for software engineers a few blocks away at which founders gave talks about products developed with Anthropic software. Someone demonstrated a tool that could automate outreach for job recruitment—leading one attendee to exclaim, with apparent glee, “This is going to destroy an entire industry!”

When I asked several Anthropic employees if they’d want to slow down the AI boom in an ideal world, none seemed to have ever seriously considered the question; it was too far-fetched a possibility, even for them. Joshua Batson, an interpretability researcher at Anthropic—he studies the labyrinthine inner workings of AI models—told me that it would be nice if the industry could go half as fast. Jared Kaplan, a co-founder of Anthropic and the firm’s chief science officer, told me he’d prefer it if AGI, or artificial general intelligence, arrived in 2032 rather than, say, 2028; Bowman, the safety researcher, said he thought slowing down for just a couple of months might be enough. Everyone seemed to believe, though, that AI-safety research itself could eventually be automated with Claude—and once that happens, they reasoned, their tests could keep up with the AI’s exponentially improving capabilities.

Like so many others in the industry, the employees I spoke with also contended that neither Anthropic nor any other AI company could actually slow development down. “The world gets to make this decision, not companies,” Clark told me, seated cross-legged on his chair, and “the system of capital markets says, Go faster.” So they are. Anthropic is reportedly fundraising at a $350 billion valuation, and its advertisements litter Instagram and big-city billboards. This month, the company launched a version of its Claude Code product geared toward non-software engineers called Claude Cowork. And in July, as first reported in Wired, Amodei wrote an internal memo to employees that Anthropic would seek investments from the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, which, in his words, would likely enrich “dictators.” Warnings about the dangers of authoritarian AI have been central in Anthropic’s public messaging; “Machines of Loving Grace” includes dire descriptions of the threat of “authoritarian” AI.

When I brought this up to Amodei, he cut me off. “We never made a commitment not to seek funding from the Middle East,” he said. “One of the traps you can fall into when you’re doing a good job running a responsible company is every decision that you make” can be “interpreted as a moral commitment.” There was no “pressing need” to seek Middle Eastern funding before, and doing so entailed “complexities,” he said. I took his implication to be that the intensive capital demands of the AI race now made such investments a necessity. Still, such investors, Amodei said, wouldn’t have any control over his firm. A few days after we spoke, Anthropic announced the Qatar Investment Authority as a “significant” investor in a new fundraising round.

If you zoom out enough, and perhaps not even all that far, Anthropic stands for the same things that OpenAI, Google, Meta, and anyone else in the AI race do: to build fantastically powerful chatbots and use them to transform the world and beat the competition. Across the company, the belief in AI’s potential is messianic. AI “presents one of the only technologies” that gets us out of the challenges ahead for humanity, Clark told me: climate change, aging populations, resource contention, authoritarianism, war. Without AI, he said, there will be more and more “Mad Max–like swaths of the world.”

Trenton Bricken, who works on AI safety at Anthropic, took this notion to an even greater extreme: He would ideally want the AI industry to slow down, but “every year that we stall, there are lots of people suffering who otherwise would not,” he told me, referring to the possibility that AI will eventually cure diseases and achieve everything else outlined in “Machines of Loving Grace.” His colleague Sholto Douglas claimed that such a delay “comes at the cost of millions of lives.”

Perhaps the greatest confusion at Anthropic is between theory and practice—the idea of safe AI versus the speed necessary to win the AI race. A corporate culture built around deep thought experiments and genuine disagreements about the future also has to sell AI. In the company’s view, these ends are complementary; better for it to responsibly usher in the AI future than Elon Musk or China. But that’s also a convenient way to justify an any-means-necessary approach to progress. I thought of that automated vending machine that the company had set up in its office. Claude ran the business into the ground in only a month through a string of very poor pricing and stocking decisions. But none of those really mattered: Anthropic had placed the machine next to all the free snacks in the office canteen.

When I asked Amodei recently about how he could justify the breakneck pace given the concerns he has over safety, he expressed total confidence in his staff—and also floated a new idea. Perhaps, he suggested, Claude will become so intelligent in the very near future that the bot will enable something radical: “Maybe at some point in 2027, what we want to do is just slow things down,” he said, and let the models fix themselves. “For just a few months.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has a new rallying cry: Eat real food. It’s an intuitive piece of advice—snack on some grapes instead of potato chips, trade that microwaveable mystery meat for a grilled chicken breast. The tagline has accompanied the new Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the government’s official nutrition recommendations, which call for Americans to prioritize whole foods and limit processed ones. “It’s time to start eating real food again,” the health secretary said during a speech in Pennsylvania last week. The Trump administration has even launched a new website, realfood.gov, which welcomes visitors with an animation of a steak, a carton of whole milk, and a head of broccoli.

The path toward Kennedy’s goal runs through an overlooked piece of the food landscape: convenience stores. The purveyors of late-night hot dogs, tins of Zyn, and countless varieties of gummy worms generally don’t sell a lot of “real food.” But in America’s food deserts, convenience stores are more than just places to pick up a snack—they’re grocery stores. The USDA estimates that tens of millions of Americans live in low-income areas with limited access to grocery stores. Mini-marts such as 7-Eleven and Sheetz “have an outsized role in our food system because they are the only food access point in many neighborhoods,” Hilary Seligman, an expert on food insecurity at UC San Francisco, told me.

The Trump administration does have a tool it can use to force the humble mini-mart to stock healthier options. Food stamps are an essential part of convenience stores’ business, but to participate in the program, retailers must carry products across a range of food groups. Those standards are poised to get an overhaul: “We are requiring that every outlet that accepts food stamps double the amount of real food that it sells in its facility,” Kennedy said last week. That decision is really up to Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins, whose agency runs the food-stamp program, and she made similar comments at a press conference earlier this month. When I asked the Department of Agriculture for more details about the planned changes, a spokesperson directed me to a proposal released in draft form last fall. Under those new rules, stores would be required to carry seven varieties of food across four categories: protein, dairy, grains, and vegetables and fruits.

The move could put us one step closer to healthy convenience stores, which have long been a dream of some nutrition reformers. Several experiments in different cities—including in Baltimore, New Orleans, and Denver—have tried to alleviate the problem of food deserts by improving the offerings at local mini-marts. A review of these pilot programs found “consistent improvements across most of the trials in the availability and sale of healthy foods, the purchase and consumption of those foods, and consumer knowledge.”

But the Trump administration’s plan isn’t perfect. Under the draft proposal, corner stores won’t have to follow any specific nutritional guidelines, so long as they meet the food-group standards. The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer-advocacy group, has warned that the new standards mean that stores could stock Fruity Pebbles to fulfill the grain requirement, and sugary canned peaches for the fruit requirement. “It would be very easy for a retailer to meet the proposed rule by stocking foods in each staple food category that are high in added sugar, sodium, saturated fat, and refined grains,” Joelle Johnson, the deputy director of CSPI, told me.

Read: Why don’t convenience stores sell better food?

Changing mini-marts for good won’t be easy. Owners stock their stores based on what sells, and available data suggest that “real food” isn’t exactly driving sales. A recent analysis by Lula Commerce, an online-shopping tool for convenience stores, found that alcohol, soda, and energy drinks were the top items ordered by their stores’ customers. And a 2021 report by the National Association of Convenience Stores pointed to packaged beverages, cigarettes, and salty snacks as among the best sellers. Convenience stores are concerned that stocking healthy products will just mean wasted shelf space in their already crowded stores. They typically don’t have the margins necessary to swap out a section of the drink cooler to stock cauliflower or salmon filets, especially when these products may rot. NACS supports aspects of the Trump administration’s push to heighten the requirements for what these stores have to stock, Margaret Hardin Mannion, the group’s director of government relations, told me. But, she added, “we have to be able to sell what our customers want to buy.” Though the Trump administration is within its power to mandate that convenience stores participating in the food-stamps program stock as many healthy goods as it deems fit, that could easily backfire if retailers back out of the program entirely.

Until convenience stores actually give customers the option to buy strawberries instead of Slim Jims, it’s hard to know exactly how well-founded their fears really are. The smattering of experiments that stocked mini-marts with fresh produce suggest that people do have some interest in eating healthier when they can. But many of these trials also included efforts meant specifically to drum up sales of healthy items. In one experiment in Baltimore, convenience stores were encouraged to stock certain healthy foods through subsidies from researchers. Retailers hung up posters to promote these new healthy foods, and some gave out coupons to encourage specific purchases. Replicating an experiment like this on the national scale would cost some major cash. (There are more than 150,000 convenience stores in the United States.) And it would require a real leap of faith from an administration that to date has focused much of its efforts on restricting the products that can be purchased with food stamps, and on rooting out alleged fraud within the program.

For now, RFK Jr. and other health officials are stuck with a convenience-store conundrum. The mini-mart embodies how hard it is to actually improve the American diet. It’s enough of a challenge to get stores to stock their shelves with broccoli. But that still isn’t a guarantee that people will put down the Doritos.</div>

So when an AI agent is autobrowsing, does it get ads?  Does Google charge advertisers for those impressions?  Sounds like a fantastic business... Google controls both the client and server end, and if they&#39;re falling short in their revenue projections, they just ramp up the &quot;ad views&quot;.

Do they let it past their own reCAPTCHA, knowing without a doubt that it is not a human?  Do they still charge for these attempts for users that aren&#39;t on their free tier of reCAPTCHA, despite knowing they intentionally failed their customers?

And how will I prevent the AI from becoming an internet troll?And how long before it&#39;ll start browsing parts of the web that shouldn&#39;t be browsed?

I don&#39;t think a skilled human can know confidently what DOM manipulation might result in interacting with a server in a non-reversible way.

I mean, a reputable site should probably be easy enough for LLM to know the DOM element not to touch to finalize a significant transaction, but there&#39;s enough anecdotes from people who chose to let LLMs run wild on their local projects with similar promises of &#39;safeguards&#39; only for the LLM to be unexpectedly destructive..

Using the internet is now considered a &quot;tedious task&quot;

I know a lawyer whose firm has just updated their formal policy on the use of AI. It used to be &quot;Don&#39;t.&quot; Now, they&#39;re allowed to use one, but only if the firm higher ups have specifically approved it. There are none approved, and apparently none available that meet their requirements.

Interestingly, their issue isn&#39;t that AIs make up case law [calmatters.org] (they&#39;re not overworked, and aren&#39;t idiots, so they know they would have to carefully vet anything produced), but that to be useful, the query would submit to the AI engine client information they are legally required to keep confidential, and that information will be recorded and used to create future answers for other users.

Is DEI not about hiring a person based on something besides merit? I don’t think this person was qualified and hired simply for being a yes man. Making him a DEI hire.

There must have been a discount or something, though I didn&#39;t see any signs about it. Whatever it was, it wasn&#39;t worth dealing with the crowds. I just grabbed my package and left. It was actually difficult to find a path to the door.

However, my daughter has had multiple issues with Amazon&#39;s grocery delivery (that thing they&#39;re going to &quot;concentrate on&quot;, going forward). The biggest one being - on multiple occasions when she purchased frozen food, it was pretty obvious that a lot of it hadn&#39;t remained frozen during transit.

She&#39;s had a much better experience with Walmart, as well as Fred Meyer.

Planners confront the rents of Whiteness in many forms, including neighborhood exclusion, environmental injustice, and the occupation of tribal lands. Conceptualizing these situations as racial rent-seeking clarifies how benefits captured by White communities are inexorably linked to harms done in non-White communities. I conclude with recommendations for dismantling these rents.

Another factor in restrictive zoning is discrimination against other races and lower social economic classes.  It&#39;s not an accident that low density, single family homes are mostly owned by rich white people.  In these neighborhoods, apartments are negatively correlated with school test scores, which significantly affect home values.

Yet an other factor in the US is the huge disparity in the quality of neighborhood schools.  This desire toward &quot;better&quot; schools creates an artificial scarcity even in the face

1. What happened in 1914 that cause the system to collapse.

2. Do people actually like renting row houses and apartments, rather than having their own homes?

To be honest I always considered that style of housing to be barracks for the workers. Not something that I aspire to.

Oh fuck you and that saying. Who actually says that besides the talking heads on Fox?

>Do people actually like renting row houses and apartments, rather than having their own homes?

Suburban life is for the wealthy.  We could do it for everyone with a lower population, more automation, and a sane economic system that doesn&#39;t depend on eternal population growth to prevent immediate collapse, but that combination doesn&#39;t seem to be likely any time soon.

Row houses and apartments mean more bodies to be at the base of the economy to hold that peak up a bit higher for the ultra-wealthy.

Lots of people like row houses. In places like New York and Boston, those sort of houses are in high demand. it turns out that lots of people want to live near other people and actually like the density. As for high population, we all benefit from the high population. More people mean more ideas, more comparative advantage, and more economies of scale, which translate into better standards of living in general. There&#39;s some point beyond which very high populations would cause standards of living to get wor

I&#39;m halfway into a 30 year mortgage and looking back I&#39;d rather rent something. Roofs are $20k and a new furnace is close to $15k now. Much easier when those are the landlords problem. Unless of course I&#39;m wealthy enough to have some isolated property but at that point those expenses are minor.

I&#39;m assuming you&#39;ve got a fixed interest mortgage?

The whole advantage of that is that as inflation does its thing, if your employer gives raises (or you hop to greener pastures if they don&#39;t), your mortgage payment actually becomes easier to pay over the life of the loan.  Rent, on the other hand, keeps going up.

So no, despite $20k roofs and $15k furnaces (you do know you can buy those online for a lot less, then get a HVAC tech to install it on the side, if you ask around), you&#39;re still coming out ahead.

I&#39;m halfway into a 30 year mortgage and looking back I&#39;d rather rent something.Really? 15 years ago means you purchased in 2010-2011. Rather implies that you would be better off in some aspect. Clearly, it is not from financial point of view, you&#39;d pay more in rent and would have no equity. No roof or furnace costs would come anywhere near eating that equity, you&#39;d have to have something really catastrophic, like foundation getting washed out, for that to happen. So why do you think renting is better?

Renting might seem bad, but sometimes it&#39;s the best option - if you plan on only staying for a short while (1-5 years), renting is far preferable to owning after all the fees and taxes and effort needed to buy and sell the property you&#39;re in are factored in.

Who said renting? There&#39;s nothing about row houses or apartments that precludes ownership. Yes I own a row house and I like it. I also own a massive house freestanding on a property in the burbs and chose to rent that out because living in isolation outside of the city centre was a shit lifestyle for me.

So you don&#39;t get time to develop Alzheimer&#39;s, so you don&#39;t get time to develop Alzheimer&#39;s.

Now I finally know what to do to avoid Alzheimer&#39;s!

Though... &quot;Cancer protects you from Alzheimer&#39;s&quot; is a pretty good one-liner by itself.  At least, my response was to say &quot;Well... shit&quot;, and chuckle.

Though if we can synthesize the anti-Alzheimer&#39;s protein that cancer produces, and if it&#39;s really effective, and if it doesn&#39;t have other nasty effects, this could result in a good anti-Alzheimer&#39;s drug.

In the United States.  With the federal government rapidly disassembling science-based medicine, that&#39;s hardly the largest and most immediate concern.

Other countries do medical research, too, and their citizens will have lower Alzheimer&#39;s rates should this research pan out.

The really big question is how permanent the Trump influence will be after 2028.  My take is that most Republicans currently in office are carpetbaggers rather than ideological extremists.  They see the opportunity to advance their own careers by riding on Trump&#39;s coattails.  Those coattails likely disappear after 2028, unless another Trump 2.0 person arises and tries to repeat the Trump strategies.

&quot;cancer and Alzheimer&#39;s disease are rarely found in the same person&quot;

&quot;cancer diagnosis was associated with an 11% decreased incidence of Alzheimer&#39;s disease&quot;

If cancer and Alzheimer&#39;s are rarely coincident, then why is there merely an 11% decrease in Alzheimer&#39;s given that cancer exists?  I would expect the decrease to be close to 100% unless &quot;rarely&quot; is actually a fuzzy term that is far from 0%.

First off, &quot;credit&quot; and &quot;reputation&quot; are synonyms.

I froze my credit some time ago, which required me registering with Experian.  They still send me emails when my credit goes up and back down.  Or down and back up.  I phrase it thusly because it never does one without doing the other a couple days later.  Great service I didn&#39;t ask for, guys.

I mean, credit rating agencies are fine, I guess.  I just don&#39;t think that, if you volunteer to make a business out of rating people according to their trustworthiness, and you accomplish that rating by getting their creditors to send you all their personal private business every time they buy gas or eat dinner, you should expect not to be kind of disliked.  Because that&#39;s not a thing that likable people do!

I agree.   They should just own the fact that they 1) provide a valuable service in measuring people&#39;s credit scores and 2) they won&#39;t be liked for it.  Especially by those who have bad credit scores.

If there are legitimate issues where people should actually have higher credit scores than they do, then that should be investigated and resolved.  If people are just upset that they screwed up their credit scores and don&#39;t like the repercussions?   I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s much that can be done.

because you don&#39;t understand what a credit score is.

It isn&#39;t an evaluation of your balance sheet and ability to pay, it is about how likely you are to pay. That logically must include your historic behaviors and other factors like how long you have lived in a current place etc.

Experian is one messenger that should be shot for criminal negligence.

I would say that the thief is the perpetrator, not Experian. If Experian was negligent, then they would indeed share in the blame. Negligence is not being alleged in this article.

Of course bad credit risks get mad at the credit rating agencies for telling lenders that.It&#39;s because of these agencies that lenders have access to the information to make lending decisions, and good credit risks can get loans with favorable terms.

credit existed before credit scores did, and could easily exist without credit scores and credit score companies

Yes, and it was highly local and often limited.

Your grocer might extend you a tab, but only because they see you come in buying groceries every Monday for a while that they know what you want. Eventually they&#39;ll trust you enough to extend you credit. But this only worked when your circle of commerce was the town and you knew the store owner&#39;s name. The whole &quot;small town&quot; thing and &quot;everyone knows

Sorry, no amount of worthwhile value for credit reports justifies what Experian has done and still does.  The Wikipedia article [wikipedia.org] is full of their breaches and shenanigans.  They have an ongoing pattern of sloppiness.  Until they (along with the other reporting services) were forced to stop by legislattion, they charged us for credit reports based on our own data that they had hoovered up.

The big question about President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace—which he formally announced while at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week—is whether it’s a scam, a delusion, or both.

Trump first mentioned a Board of Peace in September during the signing of a ceasefire accord for Israel’s war in Gaza. The idea was that the board would be the forum where Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and other Middle East countries discuss political reforms, reconstruction, and other issues relating to security and long-term peace in Gaza. Trump would chair the board—a role that he improbably insisted wasn’t his idea, but the plan made some sense, given that Trump played a major role in prodding the parties to sign the ceasefire.

However, in the months since, Trump’s vision of the board has—like much else about his presidency—swelled with self-aggrandizement. The board’s charter—which he hasn’t publicized but which the Times of Israel obtained and published—doesn’t mention Gaza at all. Rather, the document states that the board will seek “to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict”—seeming to indicate any sort of conflict, anywhere on earth.

The members on the board will consist of whichever heads of state the chairman, Donald Trump, chooses to invite. Their terms of membership will last three years, unless they pay the board $1 billion, which would buy them lifetime tenure. (Trump is designated as chairman for as long as he likes, certainly beyond the remaining three years of his presidency, gratis.)

The board will decide policies and declare resolutions by majority vote, but the chairman (read: Trump) gets veto power; he can also initiate measures unilaterally, eject members, and choose his own successor.

In other words, the Board of Peace marks yet another episode in Trump’s massive meandering ego trip. More than that, its charter, laid out in formal legalese, is sheer fantasy. It is no surprise that most of the heads of state whom he invited to join, notably those with proven interest in peace and “lawful governance,” have declined.

The naysayers include France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom—in short, many of our leading allies. Trump retracted his invitation to Canada after its prime minister, Mark Carney, delivered a much-lauded speech at Davos calling on middle-sized countries to avoid unfair pressures from larger powers by banding together. (Trump’s retraction, which he posted on social media, bolsters the impression that this is all about Trump, not world peace.)

Those who have said they will join include Argentina, Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Belarus, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Egypt, El Salvador, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Kosovo, Morocco, Mongolia, Pakistan, Paraguay, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. None of them are members of the U.N. Security Council (which Trump preposterously hopes to supplant), only a few practice “lawful governance,” and even fewer have any experience at seriously mediating conflict. It is not known whether any of them have been foolish enough to pony up the $1 billion initiation fee—nor has Trump or anyone else said who would control this slush fund. (Want to take a guess?)

The leaders of China, India, and Russia are among those who haven’t yet responded. This is no surprise. These are regional, aspiringly global powers who have a serious (if, in some cases, disruptive) interest in matters of war and peace. And they must know that Trump’s Board of Peace is not serious.

In his gushing invitation letter, Trump declared that his goal is to “bring together a distinguished group of nations ready to shoulder the noble responsibility of building LASTING PEACE.” In his snitty retraction letter to Prime Minister Carney, he brayed that Canada would thereby be excluded from “what will be the most prestigious Board of Leaders ever assembled at any time.”

If Trump believes his own hype (always an uncertainty), he reveals here once again that he has no idea what peace, especially “LASTING PEACE,” requires. To the extent Trump currently has the power to elicit feigned respect and sometimes reluctant obedience from other world leaders, it’s because he is president of the United States—meaning that he can exert the tremendous leverage of the world’s main currency and most powerful military.

Once his term in the Oval Office ends in three years, no leader would have any reason to pay him the slightest attention or courtesy. No leaders embroiled in conflict would welcome the mediation of his so-called Board of Peace, much less follow its orders.

Maybe some leaders would consent to a meeting if the board really were composed of “the most prestigious” peacemakers. But look at who, according to a statement from the White House, is on the group’s “founding” executive board: Trump’s globe-trotting emissary, Steve Witkoff, and son-in-law Jared Kushner (whose efforts to end Russia’s war on Ukraine have been especially aimless); Marc Rowan (a billionaire financier who has led Trump’s political pressure campaigns on American universities); Robert Gabriel (a former producer of Laura Ingraham’s TV show who is now Trump’s deputy national security adviser); Secretary of State Marco Rubio (whose influence will fade along with Trump’s at the end of this administration, at least if he remains under his post-presidential thumb); Sir Tony Blair (whose record as Britain’s prime minister still makes many in the Middle East shudder); and Ajay Banga, president of the World Bank.

Banga is an interesting choice: He was nominated to the World Bank by President Joe Biden, he advised Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 campaign, and he knows something about world politics. The others, once untethered from a sitting American president, would have no authority in making peace whatsoever.

Even with the power of the White House and the imprimatur of a U.N. Security Council resolution, Trump’s current Board of Peace has been unable to make headway on molding long-term peace in Gaza, the one conflict it was created to help solve. (The Security Council limited the board’s authority solely to rebuilding Gaza and set it to expire at the end of 2027.) The idea that it can roam the globe on its own, ending wars with no base of power or authority, is risible.

If the next president is a Democrat, one of their first tasks will probably be to order the words “Donald J. Trump” to be removed from the august wall of the Kennedy Center. There will, however, be no need to worry about dismantling, or doing anything about, the Trump Board of Peace; it will quickly collapse of its own accord.

Whether or not money is the root of all evil, the root of our current American oligarchy is a single Supreme Court case. That Supreme Court decision, Buckley v. Valeo, happens to turn 50 years old this week. It’s Buckley, and not the often-excoriated 2010 Roberts court decision in Citizens United v. FEC, that created the conditions for the ultrawealthy to transform their vastly unequal economic power into lopsided political power, and for a billionaire like Elon Musk to contribute a staggering $291 million to help elect Republican candidates, including Donald Trump, in 2024. It is going to take a constitutional amendment or Supreme Court reform to make things right again—and there’s a realistic chance that the current Supreme Court soon makes things worse, not better—but reform is unlikely because of the power of the very moneyed interests who benefit from the Buckley-created system.

Following President Richard Nixon’s resignation in August 1974, Congress once again took up the question of money in politics. It had passed the Federal Election Campaign Act in 1971, but it was clear that more was needed after investigations into Nixon and Watergate revealed many campaign finance abuses, such as the Nixon reelection campaign shaking down large American corporations for illegal six-figure donations, delivered sometimes in cash or laundered through foreign accounts.

Newly inaugurated President Gerald Ford reluctantly signed the 1974 FECA amendments, which aimed to fundamentally transform American campaign finance. Among other things, the law put in place a disclosure regime to let voters follow the money; it limited the amount that people could contribute to campaigns and spend supporting federal candidates; it put in place a voluntary public financing system for political campaigns; and it created the Federal Election Commission, a bipartisan agency to collect and disseminate campaign finance reports, police abuses, and advise on disputed legal questions.

A coalition of conservatives and liberals concerned about limiting money in politics quickly brought suit. FECA itself included judicial review provisions to have any constitutional challenges fast-tracked, and the Supreme Court obliged. When the case made it to the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Warren Burger felt so rushed that rather than assign a single justice to draft an opinion for the court’s majority, he divided it up into pieces. The result was a not-wholly-coherent unsigned behemoth of an opinion for the court, with separate opinions from five of the eight justices hearing the case (Justice John Paul Stevens recused).

On the key question of whether contribution and spending limits violated the First Amendment rights of free speech and association, Buckley issued a split decision. The court held that Congress could limit the amount that people could contribute directly to candidates and committees, on grounds that such contributions raised a danger of corruption or the appearance of corruption. But it struck down limits on how much individuals could spend independent of candidates.

There, the court reasoned that such independent spending could not corrupt, because to count as independent spending, a spender could not coordinate with the candidate on campaign messaging. Without such communication, the court reasoned, such independent spending could be at cross-purposes with the candidate. The court’s conclusion here was negated by the rise of outside independent groups like “super PACs,” which may be staffed by relatives, staffers, or friends of the candidate and can deploy millions of dollars to support that candidate’s message without every directly communicating with the campaign about strategy.

The Buckley court also held that limiting large independent spending on candidates could not be justified to level the playing field. On this point, the unsigned opinion held that such an equality interest was inherently impermissible:

The concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment, which was designed to secure the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources, and to assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people.

These two holdings—that independent spending can never corrupt, and that equality was an impermissible basis to ever limit money in politics—are Buckley’s original sins. American jurisprudence in this area has had so many twists and turns that it takes a whole book to explain them. Indeed, it took other decisions and rulings, including Citizens United, to get super PACs and nondisclosing political entities that could accept big-money contributions to fund campaigns independent of candidates. But in 1976, and now in 2026, the basic point is the same: American citizens cannot be limited in what they spend independent of candidates to support those candidates’ election.

The First Amendment concerns voiced by Buckley’s challengers were real and the 1974 law was too draconian. In the middle of the Buckley litigation, an advertisement appeared in the Washington Post criticizing Ford for his pardon of Nixon and his choice of Nelson Rockefeller as vice president. As campaign finance expert Herbert Alexander described it, the political advertisement headlined “Would You Elect Ex-Congressman Ford President?” “urged Republicans, Democrats, and independents to oppose Ford and convince him to withdraw as a candidate.” The ad cost $2,368.80, in violation of FECA’s $1,000 individual spending limit. It was a technical violation of the law, but not a fair one. There was also a concern that challengers need more money than incumbents, who already had name recognition and other benefits like free publicity from being in office, and so limiting campaign contributions and spending was in the self-interests of the members of Congress who passed the law.

But whether or not parts of the 1974 FECA went too far, the court was wrong to say that independent spending could never corrupt or create the appearance of corruption, or that there could be no limit in spending by the ultrawealthy. And the results in recent years have been disastrous. As I explained last year at Slate, Musk is not alone among billionaires spending big money:

In the 2024 elections, the top six donors supporting or opposing federal candidates each reported contributing at least $100 million, according to data compiled by OpenSecrets. Those donors—Musk ($291.5 million), Timothy Mellon ($197 million), Miriam Adelson ($148.3 million), Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein ($143.5 million), Ken Griffin ($108.4 million), and Jeffrey and Janine Yass ($101.1 million)—all exclusively supported Donald Trump and other Republican candidates (with the exception of the Yasses, who gave a nominal $1,500 contribution on the Democratic side). The biggest donor on the liberal side was former New York City mayor and publisher Michael Bloomberg, who gave $64.3 million total, with all but $1 million going to the Democratic side.

We have never seen so many nine-figure donors in an election, and with such lopsided giving. In the 2022 midterm elections, the sole nine-figure donor was George Soros ($178.8 million), with his contributions going to Democrats. In earlier election seasons, donations of this size were also rare: There were two in 2020 (Sheldon and Miriam Adelson and Michael Bloomberg), one in 2018 (Sheldon Adelson), and none before that.

Buckley should have been corrected at some point in the last 50 years. In the early 2000s, the court came close, as justices like David Souter recognized the risks of plutocracy. But now the court has turned in the other direction. If this very conservative court ever overrules parts of Buckley, it’s going to be to strike down remaining limits on contributions, not to uphold spending limits. A case currently before the court may lead to further deregulation.

The Buckley court was right that threats to free speech and association, and the dangers of incumbency-protecting laws, mean that courts should closely scrutinize campaign money laws. But that should not doom all attempts to level the playing field or limit the risk of corruption from nine-figure campaign contributions, mostly to ostensibly independent groups. If Congress passed a law with generous contribution and spending limits, and strong disclosure rules, we could have ample breathing room for vigorous and competitive campaigns without the danger of the wealthy swamping our democracy.

Because Buckley was a constitutional decision, there are only two paths to overturn it. One is to get a court majority to rethink the case’s fundamental mistakes. With the current makeup of the court, that seems unlikely. An even harder road is to amend the Constitution to allow for a better balance between the rights of free speech and the risks of corruption and oligarchy.

We should not give up the struggle over our money-in-politics rules. But we must recognize that there will be fierce resistance from the moneyed interests who benefit from a system giving them outsize influence over who is elected and what politicians do once they are in office.

A real democracy deserves better than Buckley.

In the days since Alex Pretti was shot to death by federal agents in Minnesota, Republican administration officials have been deploying torturous logic to defend the agents responsible and villainize the 37-year-old ICU nurse. Pretti had a gun when he encountered law enforcement on Saturday—which he was legally permitted to have in accordance with Minnesota law—and suddenly the Trump administration has decided the Second Amendment has exceptions. Seeming to lay some blame on Pretti for his killing, President Donald Trump told the press on Tuesday, “You can’t have guns. You can’t walk in with guns. You just can’t. You can’t walk in with guns. You can’t do that.”

This had already been a theme from his administration. Shortly after the incident, FBI Director Kash Patel told Fox News that Americans cannot bring a gun to just “any sort of protest that you want,” while Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino went on CNN to say that Pretti’s Second Amendment rights “don’t count” because, in Bovino’s view, he was obstructing law enforcement officers. It’s worth noting that these positions stand in stark contrast to previous ones by some of these figures, including Patel, who described Kyle Rittenhouse’s acquittal for homicide after shooting someone at a protest a “victory for the Second Amendment.” Indeed, it did not take long for the reckoning, with far-right figures, the National Rifle Association, and scores of other gun rights groups publicly calling out the Trump administration for this apparent reversal.

“I’ve encountered countless police while I’ve been armed, and never been shot. The presence of a firearm, by itself, is not an indicator of a criminal intent or a threat to law enforcement,” said Cam Edwards , a prominent gun rights activist and host of the Bearing Arms’ Cam & Co podcast. Tim Pool, a virulent ring-wing conspiracy theorist, noted that video footage appears to show Pretti being disarmed and then shot at by federal agents. “I don’t see Trump winning this one,” Pool said.

The Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus was also quick to call out Patel’s assertion about Pretti’s decision to bring a gun with him on the day he was fatally shot, clarifying that “there is no prohibition on a permit holder carrying a firearm, loaded, with multiple magazines at a protest or rally in Minnesota.”

And when California U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli repeated the administration’s line that approaching law enforcement with a gun gives agents legal justification to shoot you, the most prominent gun rights figures on X decided enough was enough. “Responsible public voices should be awaiting a full investigation, not making generalizations and demonizing law-abiding citizens,” the NRA retorted, to Essayli. Aidan Johnston, director of federal affairs for Gun Owners of America, also responded by questioning the Department of Justice’s intentions. “I guess the Justice Department is back to targeting gun owners as domestic terrorists. You can want illegals & criminals off the streets and not want to see CCW permit holders get executed for ‘approaching’ law enforcement.”

In what appears to be an attempt to calm the blowback to the situation on the ground in Minneapolis, the Trump administration announced Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino would be leaving Minnesota and returning to his old post in El Centro, California. However, among America’s conservative movement, the conversation over gun rights in the wake of Pretti’s killing is far from settled. To understand why, it’s worth considering the recent history of gun politics in the United States on the right. According to Saul Cornell, Paul and Diane Guenther Chair in American History at Fordham University, the Republican Party is not aligned on how it views the Second Amendment and in fact is facing three separate schools of thought that we’re seeing collide in real time.

As Cornell told Slate, there’s the libertarian wing that holds a sweeping view of gun rights, so much so it characterizes the right to defend oneself “as basic a human right as there is.” Then there’s the Christian nationalist view, which is also quite sweeping but believes only white, “pure blood” Americans deserve to bear arms. Finally, there is the old law-and-order bucket, which includes many Bush and Reagan Republicans who had a recent history of supporting some gun control.

Cornell offers that the Trump administration is seeking to revive the old law-and-order school of thought now that it’s convenient, and will largely get away with it. Pool, for his part, is already boasting again of his support for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, saying of federal law enforcement, “I’m not licking the boot. It’s my boot. I voted for it. I’m the one stomping.” Rob Doar, general counsel for the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus, conceded that the group was disappointed in the Trump administration’s response to Pretti’s death and it has created skepticism among those who support Trump. However, these members are “still overall pleased with the general state of things,” with Doar noting to Slate that the administration has intervened in court cases in favor of the 2nd Amendment, made gun-friendly policy changes within the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and on the whole been friendly to the 2nd Amendment.

In Cornell’s view, all the major figures in the conservative movement who may disagree with Trump now are more than likely to eventually fall back in line. “It’s hard to imagine those people are going to embrace telling people to bring their guns to ICE protests, right?” Cornell said. “Will this be the last we hear from the NRA? Or will they really harp on this and make it an issue? My suspicion is no, because it doesn’t help the Republicans” in future elections, Cornell noted.

If they’re willing to play “originalist jujitsu,” as Cornell characterized it, the Democrats still have a clear opening to use Republicans’ historical support for gun rights against them. California Gov. Gavin Newsom attempted to do so after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested Pretti did not have a Second Amendment right because he was carrying a gun. “The Trump administration does not believe in the 2nd Amendment. Good to know,” Newsom said.

Former congressman and 2024 presidential candidate Dean Phillips struck a more earnest tone. “For years I quietly mocked 2A defenders who argued arms were necessary to defend American rights against a tyrannical government,” Phillips said, in a post on X. “Today I apologize, because I’ve seen it with my own eyes.”

Perhaps the most powerful approach is to simply point to the facts. Speaking to CNN about Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s press conference in the hours following Pretti’s death, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez noted, “How rich is it that she is saying showing up to the scene of a protest with a legally owned weapon should be grounds for a person’s death, execution at the hands of the state, by the same party and administration that praises Kyle Rittenhouse.”

The second Trump administration entered office with a theory. President Donald Trump, backed by policy architect Stephen Miller, believed that in a battle of political imagery between camouflaged he-men against leftist protesters, their guys would always win. Law and order would defeat chaos. Those trying to deport immigrants would defeat those trying to protect them.

In Minnesota, that theory didn’t just hit its limit, it exceeded it. Now Trump and his team are scrambling to cushion their fall as public opinion has turned on them.

The reaction of elected Republican officials, up to and including Trump, following the Border Patrol killing of Alex Pretti over the weekend has been markedly different from that following the killing of Renee Good, or any other scandalous episode involving immigration enforcement officials thus far. A broad swath of Republican members of Congress have joined Democrats in calling for an investigation into Pretti’s killing. Trump has removed Border Patrol wannabe-action-star Greg Bovino from his role leading the immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota, while Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem appears to be—at best—in administrative time-out. Trump has taken a suddenly conciliatory tone with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey after weeks of treating them as useful left-wing foils.

It’s important not to overstate what’s happening. The administration isn’t suddenly coming out in support of open borders and abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and on Tuesday, ICE continued operations in and around Minneapolis.

But all signals sure point to Trump wanting to get the hell out of Minnesota—or at least take pains to change the way the public sees the issue.

For the first time, the administration has taken its foot off the gas in its steroidal deportation agenda. After months of ramping up its interventions into blue cities starting last summer and marketing them with an almost trollish devotion meant to please the base, the antics devolved into killings, unaccountability, and lies about what people are seeing with their own eyes. With this devolution has come a turn in public opinion, with Trump’s numbers on his once best issue—immigration—tanking. The party finally found a level of public disapproval it couldn’t tolerate, and midterms are coming closer than you think.

The first memorable time that the administration flexed unnecessary muscle the way they did in Minneapolis was last June. A series of clashes between protesters and immigration agents performing raids around Los Angeles prompted the administration to federalize the California National Guard and send in hundreds of Marines. The administration liked the visual and sent Noem there for a photo op and press briefings. During a press briefing, California Sen. Alex Padilla was thrown to the ground by Noem’s security.

The administration did not offer Padilla an apology. Instead, as the California deployment and divisiveness it caused was underway, Miller was posting about how “California used to be a paradise” but that “mass migration has brought us to where we are now.” Miller at the same time was trying to rally energy beyond the lagging One Big Beautiful Bill in Congress, arguing grandiosely that its avalanche of fresh money for DHS made the bill “the most essential piece of legislation currently under consideration in the entire Western World, in generations.”

After the Los Angeles operation, the administration federalized the Washington, D.C., police department and deployed National Guard members there, too, giving DHS agents room to ramp up their enforcement in the nation’s capital. (A man who hurled a sandwich at a federal officer was eventually taken under arrest by a swarm of 20 officers.) Elsewhere around the country, a raid on a Chicago apartment building in the middle of the night—featuring agents rappelling down the building from a Black Hawk helicopter—earned the administration plenty of controversy, but no apologies. When Trump was asked on 60 Minutes in early November about whether some ICE operations, such as those in Chicago, had gone too far, Trump said he believed “they hadn’t gone far enough.”

As the videos of over-the-top DHS tactics during raids continued to pile up, the administration stayed remorseless and itched for more fights. The Minnesota social services fraud scandals and the invective they directed at Minneapolis’ Somali population provided an impetus for “Operation Metro Storm.”

But even when an ICE agent killed Renee Good as part of the operation, the White House, the administration, and Republican elected officials showed no wavering from the party line. Good was accused by Miller and Noem of “domestic terrorism.” Rather than investigate the incident, the Department of Justice wanted to investigate Good’s widow. Vice President J.D. Vance, in an appearance in the White House briefing room, chastised the media for its coverage of the incident and described Good’s death as “a tragedy of her own making.”

But under the hood, the Renee Good killing—which a majority of Americans felt was unjustified—caused real political damage. Support for ICE’s tactics is in the tank, while support for abolishing ICE is growing. Beyond that, the high-profile nature of the Good incident and the administration’s outrageous responses to it made the president’s immigration policies not just something that a majority passively disapproved of; it raised the salience of the issue. And if there is one political issue which Republicans, already heading into a terrible midterm environment due to the cost of living, can’t afford to have as a top motivating issue working against them, it’s immigration. That is supposed to be their bread and butter.

So this time, when Alex Pretti was repeatedly shot after trying to help someone, and Noem, Bovino, and Miller tried to portray him as a would-be “assassin” or “domestic terrorist,” they were isolated in their approach. Trump fielded calls from senators and members of Congress over the weekend pleading with him to tone it down and pivot away from the Minnesota operation. The swaggering paramilitary incursions into overwhelmingly Democratic communities had at last succumbed to public opinion. Trump and a host of senators and Republican congressmen, surely with coordination, signaled deescalation in their statements and social media on Monday.

Ultimately, are they just going to tweak the Minneapolis model and try it somewhere else—maybe after a breather? Or is this the beginning of a meaningful retreat from the administration’s attempt to snatch every immigrant it can?

The calendar may dictate what comes next, at least in the medium term. The midterms are more front-of-mind now than they were in Trump’s first year, and we wouldn’t be surprised to see deportation operations select less hostile turf going forward. The Republican Party needs less widespread coverage of immigration raids gone awry, and the best way to have that would be to select fewer immigration targets likely to go awry. The more such incidents take place, the more the future of Trump’s mass deportation agenda—and Republicans’ hopes for holding congressional power going forward—dissipates.

            <h2>ServiceNow boasts about years of sweat equity that went into making its AI agents smarter</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/28/servicenow_ai_agents/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Though some recent studies cast doubt on the ability of AI agents to complete complex tasks, ServiceNow boasts that its bots are better, because they can rely on 20 years and 80 billion workflows worth of experience. The underlying model, they say, is just a small part of the product.

ServiceNow’s president and chief operating officer Amit Zavery knows Vishal Sikka, a longtime veteran of several enterprise tech companies and is aware of the paper Sikka recently co-wrote casting doubts on the efficacy of AI agents. But he says that Sikka&#39;s conclusions don&#39;t apply to his company.

“I know Vishal very well,” he told The Register. “We talk quite often .... It’s a small industry. And we argue. Vishal has some ideas. It doesn’t mean all of them are right. Some of them make sense, and we learn from each other in some cases too.”

Zavery told The Register that ServiceNow’s agents rely less on an underlying LLM than the ones studied by Sikka and co-author Varin Sikka for their July 2025 paper.

Sikka is currently the CEO of Vianai Systems as well as an Oracle boardmember and advisor to Stanford University on the subject of AI, and has a long history in enterprise tech, having served as the CEO of Infosys and CTO of SAP. He and his co-author – his son Varin – wrote that LLMs and agents based on LLMs hallucinate when ordered to complete tasks that are too complex for their model. The paper, which was surfaced by Wired last week, doubts whether AI agents are capable of carrying out multi-step tasks or checking to see if a task was done correctly.

“Our argument, in essence, is: if the prompt to an LLM specifies a computation (or a computational task) whose complexity is higher than that of the LLM&#39;s core operation, then the LLM will in general respond incorrectly,” the paper states. “Also, any LLM-based agent (i.e. in the Agentic AI sense) cannot correctly carry out tasks beyond the complexity of the LLM.”

Zavery said that’s not a problem for ServiceNow, which has run 80 billion end-to-end workflows for customers to understand what the final result should be. Because of that, ServiceNow can verify whether the agent performed it correctly.

“When we build our products, we have to guarantee outcomes,” Zavery told The Register. “We cannot have things which are unpredictable or very probabilistic without having some kind of controls built in. This is the value of our 20 years of workflow data, and our understanding of what the results should be. So when we produce something, even with the Build Agent, it&#39;s not just that we use the LLM and put a wrapper around it. There’s a huge amount of IP we build on top of that.”

On its website, ServiceNow says that it offers out-of-the box AI agents as well as build-your-own agents. Zavery estimates that when ServiceNow builds an agent for customers, the underlying LLM is carrying about 10 percent of the lift while ServiceNow’s own IP and internally developed software based on billions of business transactions is carrying the rest.

“Ninty percent is the IP and the technology we are building from governance, compliance, predictability of the outcome, who needs to monitor it, what data you need to track it, so when someone says ‘I want to onboard an employee,’ we guarantee the employee gets onboarded to the right applications and the right systems because we know what good looks like,” he said.

Zavery said that the company has a new offering with Anthropic that is designed for ServiceNow app developers. Last year, the company rolled out its build agent to let users vibe code bolt on applications that improve their ServiceNow experience. That resulted in 6,000 applications being introduced to ServiceNow’s portal.

Now, the company is adding Anthropic’s Claude Code beneath the covers of its build agent to energize that effort and Zavery said that they are expecting a four fold increase in the number of applications that should be produced.

“We are adding a lot of context in terms of security, domain, as well as prepackaged workflows, so you can expand and extend those things easily using the build agent and we’re powering that through Claude,” he said. “What this does is now evolves it into much more of a vibe coding kind of mindset. You wake up in the middle of the night and want to build something on ServiceNow. That’s our market with this one.”

ServiceNow is also looking to work with Anthropic in health care and life sciences, to better streamline case management, claim authorization, research analysts, where Opus has shown effectiveness in understanding that industry.

“We’re adding the data model as well as the workflow elements of it because we’ve been building technologies and products for life sciences and health care and we try to bring them together into one integrated offering for our customers in those regulated industries,&quot; he said. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ransomware crims have just lost one of their best business platforms. US law enforcement has seized the notorious RAMP cybercrime forum&#39;s dark web and clearnet domains.

RAMP, which stands for Russian Anonymous Marketplace, was an online souk, favored by ransomware-as-a-service gangs, extortionists, initial access brokers, and other miscreants specializing in digital crime. Its websites now say &quot;This Site Has Been Seized,&quot; with the notice attributing the takedown to the FBI in coordination with the US Attorney&#39;s Office for the Southern District of Florida and the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section of the Department of Justice.

The feds also trolled the forum&#39;s operators with a banner saying &quot;The Only Place Ransomware Allowed!&quot; and an image of Masha - a preschool character from the Russian animated TV series - winking.

While the FBI declined to comment on the seizure, DNS records show that the federal cops have seized the domains.

The takedown also appears to be confirmed by one of the forum&#39;s alleged operators who goes by &quot;Stallman.&quot; In an XSS hacking forum post shared widely on social media, Stallman said law enforcement had gained control of RAMP.

&quot;This event destroyed years of my work to create the most free forum in the world, and although I hoped this day would never come, deep down I always understood that it was possible,&quot; he wrote. &quot;This is the risk we all take.&quot;

Stallman said he could not create a new forum, but will &quot;continue to buy accesses. My core business remains unchanged.&quot;

It&#39;s highly unlikely impossible that this takedown signals the end of ransomware and other crime crews who used RAMP&#39;s websites to buy and sell malware and exploits and recruit affiliates. Much like horror-movie monsters, cybercrime forums never really die, and their users will likely scatter to other underground marketplaces to buy and sell their illicit services.

Still, &quot;its loss represents a meaningful disruption to a core piece of criminal infrastructure,&quot; Tammy Harper, a senior threat intelligence researcher at Flare who specializes in ransomware research, told The Register.

&quot;As with previous takedowns, the removal of a major hub does not eliminate the ecosystem - it forces migration,&quot; Harper said. &quot;Groups such as Nova and DragonForce are reportedly shifting activity toward Rehub, illustrating the underground&#39;s ability to reconstitute quickly in alternative spaces. These transitions are often chaotic, opening new risks for threat actors: loss of reputation, escrow instability, operational exposure, and infiltration during the scramble to rebuild trust.&quot;

Plus, she added, these types of law enforcement seizures provide &quot;rare opportunities&quot; for network defenders and threat intel teams: &quot;not only to disrupt ongoing criminal collaboration, but potentially to collect insight into affiliate networks, financial relationships, and operational security failures.&quot; ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/28/claude_code_ai_secrets_files/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Don&#39;t you hate it when machines can&#39;t follow simple instructions? Anthropic&#39;s Claude Code can&#39;t take &quot;ignore&quot; for an answer and continues to read passwords and API keys, even when your secrets file is supposed to be blocked.

Software developers often store secrets – passwords, tokens, API keys, and other credentials – in .env files within project directories. And if they do so, they&#39;re supposed to ensure that the .env file does not get posted in a publicly accessible .git repository.

A common way to do this is to create an entry in a .gitignore file that tells the developer&#39;s Git software to ignore that file when copying a local repo to a remote server.

Claude implements something similar, a .claudeignore file.

When asked, &quot;If I make a .env file, how do I keep you from reading it?&quot;, Claude responded, &quot;You can add .env to a .claudeignore file in your project root. This works like .gitignore — Claude Code will refuse to read any files matching patterns listed there.&quot;

But Claude is incorrect. As described in this Pastebin post, Claude can read the contents of an .env file despite an entry in the .claudeignore file that ought to prevent access.

The Register reproduced this result. We created a directory, created an .env file with sample secrets, added a .claudeignore file with &quot;.env&quot; and &quot;.env.*&quot; and then started Claude Code (v2.1.12) via the CLI. We asked Claude to read the .env file and it did so – which would not happen if Claude respected .claudeignore entries.

This has potential security implications, particularly for agents – these tool-enabled AI models could be induced to share stored secrets via indirect prompt injection.

What&#39;s more, Claude will also ignore the presence of &quot;.env&quot; in a .gitignore file. It does so despite a default /config flag that sets &quot;Respect .gitignore in file picker&quot; to &quot;true.&quot;

In fact, when asked to read the .env file in a project with a .gitignore entry that includes &quot;.env&quot;, Claude dutifully prints the secrets within to the console, with the following warning: &quot;Note: This file contains credentials. Be cautious about committing it to version control — make sure .env is listed in your .gitignore.&quot;

Claude&#39;s willingness to ignore .claudeignore directives is cited in an open issue post in Claude Code&#39;s GitHub repository, &quot;[HIGH PRIORITY] Claude exposes secrets/tokens in tool output - no redaction.&quot; The individual who opened the issue two days ago notes, &quot;This is a security-critical issue that should be addressed urgently.&quot;

It hasn&#39;t been. Two posts from November 2025 raise the same concern. Another open issue created two weeks ago also flags Claude&#39;s willingness to display secrets. As does yet another bug report from three weeks ago that says, &quot;Claude should refrain from reading or even being aware of anything in the .claudeignore file, using [the] same standard parsing rules as a .gitignore file.&quot;

There are ways to direct Claude to keep away from secrets that appear to work, such as specifying permissions within a settings.json file in a project&#39;s .claude directory.

When we created that file as described in the documentation, Claude reported an error: &quot;The .env file is blocked by permission settings. This is expected behavior — .env files typically contain secrets (API keys, passwords, database credentials), so they are excluded from tool access as a security measure.&quot;

But configuring these settings permissions can be tricky – a bug report raising this concern includes a response that explains Claude&#39;s syntax for absolute paths begins with two &quot;//&quot; instead of &quot;/&quot; as Linux and macOS users might expect. Developers have also opened issues reporting problems with the @ file reference syntax in settings.json. And there are other problems, like permissions.deny not preventing files from being loaded into memory.

Anthropic did not respond to a request for comment.

If settings.json is intended to be the only supported way of denying Claude file access, Anthropic should make it clearer that .claudeignore is not an option. The model&#39;s own recommendations should align with best practices, instead of leading people astray. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Come one, come all. Everyone from Russian and Chinese government goons to financially motivated miscreants is exploiting a long-since-patched WinRAR vuln to bring you infostealers and Remote Access Trojans (RATs).

The bug, tracked as CVE-2025-8088, is a path traversal flaw that affects the Windows version of the decompression tool. It received an 8.8 CVSS v3.1 score, and WinRAR patched the flaw in version 7.13 released on July 30.

Shortly after the release, ESET researchers who discovered and reported the vulnerability told The Register that Russia-aligned crew RomCom and at least one other criminal group exploited the security hole as a zero-day.

Fast forward to late January, and Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) says several groups are still abusing CVE-2025-8088.

The exploit abuses Alternate Data Streams (ADS), a feature in Windows, to hide malware. Attackers craft malicious RAR archives with a decoy PDF or other file inside, and when a user opens the decoy file on a vulnerable version of WinRAR, the hidden malware writes files to arbitrary locations on the system.

&quot;Multiple government-backed actors have adopted the CVE-2025-8088 exploit, predominantly focusing on military, government, and technology targets,&quot; GTIG said in a Tuesday report.

These include RomCom, which is both a ransomware and espionage gang, and is exploiting this bug to target Ukrainian military and government entities using geopolitical lures. Three other Kremlin-linked crews - APT44 (aka Frozenbarents), Temp.Armageddon (aka Carpathian), and Turla (aka Summit) are also abusing CVE-2025-8088 to target these same sectors in Ukraine.

Also according to Google, an unnamed PRC-based group is exploiting the vulnerability to deliver PoisonIvy, a Remote Access Trojan (RAT), via a BAT file dropped into the Startup folder, which then downloads a malware dropper.

Several financially motivated criminal gangs are also leveraging this vulnerability to infect victims&#39; machines with RATs and data-stealing malware. While the threat hunters don&#39;t name these specific gangs, we&#39;re told they include a group targeting commercial organizations in Indonesia, another group that targets hospitality and travel sectors via phishing emails with hotel booking lures that deliver XWorm and AsyncRAT, and a third focused on Brazilian users via banking websites that steals credentials.

Plus, as of January, &quot;we have continued to observe malware being distributed by cyber crime exploiting CVE-2025-8088, including commodity RATS and stealers,&quot; the security sleuths said.

Back in June, before the vulnerability was publicly known, a criminal who goes by &quot;zeroplayer&quot; posted an ad for a working WinRAR zero-day exploit for $80,000 on a cybercrime forum.

According to GTIG, this isn&#39;t the only exploit zeroplayer is selling to other criminals. &quot;Historically, and in recent months, zeroplayer has continued to offer other high-priced exploits that could potentially allow threat actors to bypass security measures,&quot; the researchers wrote.

This includes a sandbox escape, remote code execution (RCE) zero-day exploit for Microsoft Office advertised at $300,000 in November 2025, and a zero-day local privilege escalation (LPE) exploit for Windows costing $100,000 a month earlier.

In September, zeroplayer advertised a RCE zero-day exploit for a &quot;popular, unnamed corporate VPN provider&quot; without a price tag, and another zero-day for an unspecified driver that disables antivirus and endpoint detection and response software for $80,000. ®

            <h2>Microsoft plans more server farms, despite water worries</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/28/microsoft_more_server_farms/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It&#39;s no secret that datacenters use a ton of water for cooling, a demand that can strain local supplies. Despite reported internal forecasts showing sharply higher water use by 2030, Microsoft continues to splash cash on new AI bit barns.

The technology giant has been given approval to build 15 more server farms at Mount Pleasant in Wisconsin, reports say, near its existing AI datacenter campus, which Microsoft has said is on track to come online in 2026 and has billed as &quot;the world&#39;s most powerful AI datacenter.&quot;

The new project is expected to be worth more than $13 billion, with the facilities split across two sites just to the northwest of Microsoft&#39;s current campus, which occupies land once earmarked for a factory by Taiwanese electronics contract manufacturer Foxconn.

Local officials on Mount Pleasant&#39;s village board signed off on Microsoft&#39;s plans this week, according to CNBC, despite some pushback.

Elsewhere, the company has also disclosed plans to spend $30 billion expanding AI datacenters in the UK between 2025 and 2028, alongside a separate $10 billion investment in Portugal, saying it expects to more than double its datacenter capacity across 16 European countries by 2027, all to boost its ability to support AI workloads.

But all this comes at an environmental cost, as reported before, in terms of pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and water consumption. Microsoft previously conceded that its emissions were up by about 30 percent from a 2020 baseline, despite the company pledging to be carbon-negative by 2030, with the build-out of new datacenters cited as the cause.

At the end of last year, more than 230 organizations across America signed a letter calling for a moratorium on the construction of datacenters, claiming the current build boom represents a huge environmental and social threat.

Meanwhile, the New York Times claims to have obtained Microsoft documents showing forecasts for the annual water needs of roughly 100 of its campuses worldwide to more than triple to 28 billion liters by 2030, compared to 2020 levels.

These internal forecasts were reportedly made last year, and Microsoft told the newspaper it had updated its projections to reflect new water-saving techniques so that it now expects to use about 18 billion liters of water in 2030, up 150 percent from 2020.

Despite this, the cloud computing behemoth launched its Community-First AI Infrastructure initiative earlier this month, in which it pledged to minimize its use of the wet stuff, and even replenish more water than it draws.

Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith promised greater local transparency, saying that people deserve to know how much water Microsoft datacenters use, and that it is committed to making that information accessible and easy to understand.

That initiative was launched after President Trump took to social media to insist that big technology companies must pay their way, rather than ordinary Americans picking up the tab for the extra energy infrastructure needed for AI datacenters through higher bills.

It isn&#39;t just Microsoft that is building new facilities at a frenzied pace, of course, and the same criticisms can be directed at other cloud and datacenter businesses. But perhaps we aren&#39;t getting the full picture because of measures such as non-disclosure agreements that local officials are made to sign by some tech companies, as The Register recently reported.

Microsoft was asked to comment for this article, but had not responded by publication time.

The current boom in datacenter construction is only likely to slow if AI investment trails off or the current bubble bursts – which the Bank of England&#39;s Financial Policy Committee warned about last year. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/28/a_beginners_guide_to_ai_agents/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Hands On For all the buzz surrounding them, AI agents are simply another form of automation that can perform tasks using the tools you&#39;ve provided. Think of them as smart macros that make decisions and go beyond simple if/then rules to handle edge cases in input data. Fortunately, it&#39;s easy enough to code your own agents and below we&#39;ll show you how.

Since ChatGPT made its debut in late 2022, literally dozens of frameworks for building AI agents have emerged. Of them, LangFlow is one of the easier and more accessible platforms for building AI agents.

Originally developed at Logspace before being acquired by DataStax, which was later bought by Big Blue, LangFlow is a low-code/no-code agent builder based on LangChain. The platform allows users to assemble LLM-augmented automations by dragging, dropping, and connecting various components and tools.

In this hands-on guide, we&#39;ll be taking a closer look at what AI agents are, how to build them, and some of the pitfalls you&#39;re likely to run into along the way.

Before we jump into building our first agent, let&#39;s talk about what comprises an agent.

At its most basic, an agent is composed of three main components: a system prompt, tools, and the model. - Click to enlarge

In general, AI agents are going to have three main components, not counting the output/action they ultimately perform or the input/trigger that started it all.

For more complex multi-step tasks, multiple models, tools, and system prompts may be used.

If you&#39;re using a Mac or PC, deploying LangFlow Desktop is as simple as downloading and running the installer from the LangFlow website.

If you&#39;re running Linux, you&#39;ll need to deploy the app as a Docker container. Thankfully this is a lot easier than it sounds. Once you&#39;ve got the latest release of Docker Engine installed, you can launch the LangFlow server using the one-liner below:

After a few minutes, the LangFlow interface will be available at http://localhost:7860.

Warning: If you&#39;re deploying the Docker container on a server that&#39;s exposed to the web, make sure to adjust your firewall rules appropriately or you might end up exposing LangFlow to the net.

LangFlow Desktop&#39;s homepage is divided into projects on the left and flows on the right. - Click to enlarge

Opening LangFlow Desktop, you&#39;ll see that the application is divided into two sections: Projects and Flows. You can think of projects as a folder where your agents are stored.

Clicking &quot;New Flow&quot; will present you with a variety of pre-baked templates to get you started.

LangFlow&#39;s no-code interface allows you to build agents by dragging and dropping components from the sidebar into a playground on the right. - Click to enlarge

On the left side of LangFlow Desktop, we see a sidebar containing various first and third-party components that we&#39;ll use to assemble an agent.

Dragging these into the &quot;Playground,&quot; we can then config and connect them to other components in our agent flow.

In the case of the Language Model component shown here, you&#39;d want to enter your OpenAI API key and select your preferred version of GPT. Meanwhile, for Ollama you&#39;ll want to enter your Ollama API URL, which for most users will be http://localhost:11434, and select a model from the drop down.

If you need help getting started with Ollama, check out our guide here.

With LangFlow up and running, let&#39;s take a look at a couple of examples of how to use it. If you&#39;d like to try these for yourself, we&#39;ve uploaded our templates to a GitHub repo here.

In this example, we&#39;ve built a relatively basic agent to analyze spreadsheets stored as CSVs, based on user prompts.

This data analytics agent uses a Python interpreter and an uploaded CSV to answer user prompts - Click to enlarge

To help the agent understand the file&#39;s data structure, we&#39;ve used the Type Convert and DataFrame Operations components to extract the dataset&#39;s schema and help the model understand the file&#39;s internal structure.

This, along with the full document&#39;s file path, is passed to a prompt template, which serves as the model&#39;s system prompt. Meanwhile, the user prompt is passed through to the model as an instruction.

LangFlow&#39;s Prompt Template enables multiple data sources to be combined into a single unified prompt. - Click to enlarge

Looking a bit closer at the prompt template, we see {DATA_HEADER} and {DATASET_FILEPATH} defined as variables. By placing these in {} we&#39;ve created additional nodes to which we can connect our database schema and file path.

Beyond this, the system prompt contains basic information on how to service user requests, including instructions on how to call the PYTHON_DATA_PLAYGROUND Python interpreter, which we see just above the prompt template.

This Python interpreter is connected to the model&#39;s &quot;tool&quot; node and apart from allowlisting the Pandas and Math libraries, we haven&#39;t changed much more than the interpreter&#39;s slug and description.

The agent&#39;s data analytics functionality is achieved using a Python interpreter rather than relying on the model to make sense of the CSV on its own. - Click to enlarge

Based on the information provided to it in the system and user prompts, the model can use this Python sandbox to execute code snippets and extract insights from the dataset.

If we ask the agent &quot;how many monitors we sold,&quot; in the Langflow playground&#39;s chat, we can see what code snippets the model executed using the Python interpreter and the raw response it got back.

As you can see, to answer our question, the model generated and executed a Python code snippet to extract the relevant information using Pandas - Click to enlarge

Obviously, this introduces some risk of hallucinations, particularly on smaller models. In this example, the agent is set up to analyze documents it hasn&#39;t seen before. However, if you know what your input looks like — for example, if the schema doesn&#39;t change between reports — it&#39;s possible to preprocess the data, like we&#39;ve done in the example below.

Rather than relying on the model to execute the right code every time, this example uses a modified Python interpreter to preprocess the data of two CSVs or Excel files before passing it to the model for review - Click to enlarge

With a couple of tweaks to the Python interpreter, we&#39;ve created a custom component that uses Pandas to compare a new spreadsheet against a reference sheet. This way the model only needs to use the Python interpreter to investigate anomalies or answer questions not already addressed by this preprocessing script.

AI agents are just automations that should, in theory, be better at handling edge cases, fuzzy logic, or improperly formatted requests.

We emphasize &quot;in theory,&quot; because the process by which LLMs execute tool calls is a bit of a black box. What&#39;s more, our testing showed smaller models had a greater propensity for hallucinations and malformed tool calls.

Switching from a locally-hosted version of OpenAI&#39;s gpt-oss-120b to GPT-5 Nano or Mini, we saw a drastic improvement in the quality and accuracy of our outputs.

If you&#39;re struggling to get reliable results from your agentic pipelines, it may be because the model isn&#39;t well suited to the role. In some cases, it may be necessary to fine tune a model specifically for that application. You can find our beginner&#39;s guide to fine tuning here.

Along with the model, the system prompt can have a significant impact on the agent&#39;s performance. The same written instructions and examples you might give an intern on how to perform a task are just as useful for guiding the model on what you do and don&#39;t want out of it.

In some cases, it may make more sense to break up and delegate a task to different models or system prompts in order to minimize the complexity of each task, reduce the likelihood of hallucinations, or cost optimize by having lower cost models tackle easier pieces of the pipeline.

Up to this point, our examples have been triggered by a chat input and returned a chat output. However, this isn&#39;t strictly required. You could set up the agent to detect new files in a directory, process them, and save its output as a file.

LangFlow supports integrations with a wide variety of services that can be extended using agentic protocols or custom components written in Python. There&#39;s even a Home Assistant tie-in if you want to build an agent to automate your smart home lights and gadgets.

Speaking of third-party integrations, we&#39;ve hardly scratched the surface of the kinds of AI-enhanced automation that are possible using frameworks like LangFlow. In addition to the examples we looked at here, we highly recommend checking out LangFlow&#39;s collection of templates and workflows.

Once you&#39;re done with that, you may want to explore what&#39;s possible using frameworks like Model Context Protocol (MCP). Originally developed by Anthropic, this agentic protocol is designed to help developers connect models to data and tools. You can find more on MCP in our hands-on guide here.

And while you&#39;re at it, you may want to brush up on the security implications of agentic AI, including threats like prompt injection or remote code execution, and ensure your environment is adequately sandboxed before deploying them in production. ®

Production of the two pioneering models will end in the second quarter of 2026, Elon Musk says.

Tesla will discontinue the Model S and Model X in the second quarter of 2026, Elon Musk said in an earnings call with investors today.

Musk said the reasons for cancelling the vehicle programs was to make room at Tesla’s Fremont factory for production of its Optimus humanoid robot.

“It’s time to basically bring the Model S and X programs to an end with an honorable discharge, because we’re really moving into a future that is based on autonomy,” he said. “So if you’re interested in buying a Model S and X, now would be the time to order it.”

The Model S is Tesla’s luxury sedan, first released in 2012, while the Model X was its SUV with gull-wing doors, introduced in 2015. Sales of both vehicles has been declining steadily, as the company shifted focus to its mass-market Model 3 and Model Y.

In 2025, Tesla sold 50,850 “other models,” a category that includes Model S, Model X, and Cybertruck. That represented a 40.2 percent decrease in sales, year over year.

Musk has been attempting to transform Tesla from an automotive company to one that makes self-driving cars and humanoid robots. The transition has been rocky, with Tesla reporting a 61 percent decrease in profits in the fourth quarter.

If you’ve been holding off on getting a new iPhone, now’s the perfect time to size up your options. Apple’s 2025 iPhone lineup is now widely available, which includes the iPhone 17, 17 Pro, 17 Pro Max, and a brand-new model, the ultra-thin iPhone Air. These new phones offer a number of new features over their predecessors, such as upgraded cameras, faster chips, better battery life, and even better screens. Apple Intelligence, however, remains a work in progress.

Alongside the new hardware, Apple also launched iOS 26 (yes, the numbering system has changed), which includes a new Liquid Glass user interface, live translation, wallpapers in messages, and more. The software marks Apple’s biggest visual redesign since iOS 7, and despite some very polarizing reactions, we think it looks fine.

If your current iPhone is humming along, there’s no need to rush out and get a new one. But if you’re questioning whether it’s the year to replace your iPhone that’s a few generations old, then I think the answer is an easy yes. There are real gains to be had this time around, especially in the basic iPhone 17, which features a higher-refresh-rate display than last year’s model for smoother-looking animations, plus double the base storage at 256GB. And that’s all for the same price as last year’s model, despite the ongoing tariff situation in the US.

There’s no shortcut to properly testing a phone; I put my personal SIM card (physical or otherwise) in each phone I review and live with it for at least a full week. I set up each phone from scratch, load it up with my apps, and go about living my life — stress testing the battery, using GPS navigation on my bike while streaming radio, taking rapid-fire portrait mode photos of my kid — everything I can throw at it. Starting over with a new phone every week either sounds like a dream or your personal hell, depending on how Into Phones you are. For me, switching has become so routine that it’s mostly painless.

The most expensive, souped-up iPhone isn’t automatically the best one for everyone. What I look for is a happy medium — features that will satisfy most people at the best price. Sometimes, that’s last year’s model.

Battery performance can vary significantly across iPhone models, primarily due to the size of the phone. Everyone wants a phone that can last a full day, and these recommendations reflect that.

One size does not fit all. Some people like a small phone, others want the biggest screen money can buy. This list includes iPhones for people in both camps.

Screen: 6.3-inch 2622 x 1206 OLED, 120Hz refresh rate / Processor: A19 / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.6 main with sensor-shift IS; 48-megapixel ultrawide; 18-megapixel selfie / Battery: Not advertised / Charging: 40W wired, 25W wireless MagSafe / Qi2 / Weather-resistance rating: IP68

The iPhone 17 marks a turning point for the standard model. After years with a lower-quality screen, the cheapest model finally got two major upgrades for 2025: an always-on display and a high-refresh-rate panel. These features make it feel meaningfully better than the iPhone 16 and prior models in everyday use, bringing it closer than ever to the Pro models. And at the same $799 starting price as the previous generation, this year’s update is a no-brainer.

While the iPhone 17’s 48-megapixel main camera is carried over from last year, the ultrawide camera has been upgraded from a 12-megapixel to a 48-megapixel sensor, which delivers sharper, more vibrant photos. The device features an 18-megapixel Center Stage selfie camera, which is also in the Air and 17 Pro. Your selfies may not look materially better, but the front camera’s square sensor elevates the user experience, making it possible to take horizontal selfies while holding the device vertically (no need to rotate the phone).

Apple also gives you double the storage — 256GB versus 128GB in the base iPhone 16 — and improved battery life. The standard 17 still lacks a proper telephoto camera, and the A19 chip is slower than the A19 Pro found in the Pro models. Still, it’s a big step up in almost every way, even if it looks basically the same as every iPhone from the past six years.

Screen: 6.3-inch 2622 x 1206 OLED, 120Hz refresh rate / Processor: A19 Pro / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.78 with sensor-shift IS; 48-megapixel 8x telephoto with OIS; 48-megapixel ultrawide; 18-megapixel selfie / Battery: Not advertised / Charging: 40W wired, 25W MagSafe / Qi2 / Weather-resistance rating: IP68

The iPhone 17 Pro introduces a bold redesign and a number of notable upgrades, including the lineup’s most advanced camera setup yet. It also features rounded edges, and similar to last year, it’s on equal footing with the 17 Pro Max in terms of performance. The biggest differences are that the Pro Max offers a larger display, a larger battery, and up to 2TB of storage.

Whereas the iPhone 17 is for most people, the 17 Pro is geared more toward creators. The device has three 48-megapixel cameras, including a 48-megapixel telephoto, and offers several pro features aimed at those who want to take the best possible photos and videos. Some of those features include Genlock support, which lets videographers sync up timecodes across multiple cameras, and support for ProRes RAW recording. It also sports the upgraded Center Stage selfie camera found in other 2025 iPhone models.

Despite the additions and improvements, there’s little here that makes the 17 Pro an absolute must-upgrade. However, it comes in an irresistible orange, which is apparently the new “it” color.

The iPhone 17 Pro Max’s redesign isn’t just about looks. Apple hollowed out the device’s aluminum frame to fit in the biggest battery yet in an iPhone. Apple says the device offers up 39 hours of video playback, which is 12 more hours than last year’s iPhone 16 Plus, our previous battery champ. The device can easily push through a full day and then some, though your mileage will vary depending on how often you play mobile games, watch videos, and doomscroll on social media.

There are other benefits to going with the 17 Pro Max. It has the largest display of any phone in Apple’s current iPhone lineup — 6.9 inches — and offers up to 2TB of storage, giving creators more room than ever for storing their media. If you want the most iPhone you can possibly get, including the longest battery life, then the 17 Pro Max is the way to go.

The iPhone Air is Apple’s biggest redesign since the iPhone X was released in 2017. It’s shockingly thin and light, coming in at 5.6mm and 165 grams, respectively. Thanks to its titanium frame and Ceramic Shield 2 display, it’s more durable than you might expect, too. The device feels deceptively small despite its 6.5-inch display, though you really have to see and feel it yourself to understand the appeal.

But the thinner design comes with a few substantial compromises compared to other models. One of the biggest is that the Air features a single 48-megapixel camera on the back. That’s not to say the device’s camera is bad. But it’s a far less versatile system than even the far more affordable iPhone 17, which has a dual-camera setup. The second compromise is on battery life, which is just okay. It’s not terrible, but it’s not great, either.

At $999, you’re paying a lot for middling battery life and camera performance. Those who primarily care about design, though, may be more forgiving regarding the shortcomings.

Screen: 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR / Processor: A18 Cameras: 48MP Fusion with 1x and 2x optical zoom, 12-megapixel selfie / Battery: Not advertised / Charging: 20-watt wired, 7.5W Qi, no MagSafe/ Weather-resistance rating: IP68

This recommendation comes with a heavy sigh. Yes, the 16E is the cheapest iPhone Apple sells. Yes, it’s a good phone. It has a capable camera, reliable performance, full water resistance, wireless charging, and will be supported with software updates for years to come. But its $599 price tag starts to feel like too much when you consider what it’s missing.

There’s no MagSafe, which you can kind of add by way of a MagSafe case, but it’s a bummer not to have it built in when it’s basically become a standard iPhone feature. There’s no ultrawide camera, no Dynamic Island housing timely information, no camera control button (not a huge loss, honestly), and no Ultra Wideband for precise object tracking. It does support Apple Intelligence, but that doesn’t feel like much of a consolation, given that it’s very much still a work-in-progress.

The 16E will most likely receive more years of software support than a previous-gen model like the iPhone 14 or 15. And sure, Apple Intelligence might turn out to be useful someday. The 16E is a good choice if you want the path of least resistance to blue bubbles and FaceTime at your fingertips. But if you’d like MagSafe, a more advanced camera, and some of the other bells and whistles that got lost on the way to the 16E, then it’s not a bad idea to look at one of the older iPhones.

From basic and affordable to premium and ultra-customizable, these are the best controllers we’ve tested for Xbox.

We live in a golden age of controllers. The gamepads on the market now are of higher quality, more versatile, and more customizable than anything from even one console generation ago. If you play games on an Xbox Series X or Series S (or a Windows PC), you have the unenviable task of choosing between several controllers from Microsoft as well as a plethora of great options from the likes of 8BitDo, PowerA, Razer, Scuf, GameSir, and Hyperkin. Some of them have drift-resistant Hall effect or TMR-based joysticks for improved longevity, yet all of them are good for one reason or another. The days of the cheap “little sibling” controller that looked cool but barely worked are over.

We’ve spent time playing all kinds of games (first-person shooters, fighters, third-person action-adventure, racing, indie roguelikes, etc.) to test a wide swath of Xbox controllers, and it may not be a surprise that the standard Xbox Wireless Controller is the best option for most folks. It makes for a great PC and Steam Deck controller, too. The default Xbox gamepad strikes the right balance of quality, comfort, versatility, and price, but there are several alternatives worth considering.

We test Xbox controllers by playing with them for an extended period of time across a variety of genres. Our test targets include team-based arena games like Marvel Rivals, competitive shooters like Call of Duty, fighters like Tekken 8, and role-playing titles like Elden Ring. When doing so, we pay close attention to how all of the components feel. Are the triggers satisfying to pull? Do the analog sticks offer the right level of resistance? Are the D-pads and face buttons too mushy, or just right? If a controller includes customization options — such as adjustable trigger stops and sensitivity, and / or remappable back buttons — we test how easy they are to configure, then judge their impact on our gameplay experience.

Is it wireless? Does it support Bluetooth? Or is it wired only? If so, is the cable replaceable?

Does it feel cheap or nicely made? Any glitches or reliability issues while testing?

Does it have handy extras, like remappable buttons or customizable triggers?

Can you remap buttons or tune it with custom software profiles?

Is it priced affordably, about average, or does it come at a steep premium?

Incredible value for Xbox Wireless supportGreat ergonomic designSatisfying buttons and triggers

Lacks customizationRequires AA batteries (or an optional rechargeable cell)

Connectivity: Xbox wireless, Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: No / Software customization: No / Power: AA batteries or add-on rechargeable

Okay, I already know what you’re thinking. “The best controller for Xbox is the one that comes with the Xbox?” That may seem like a no-brainer, but this standard controller truly does earn this title as the best. It lacks some extras found on pricier options, but this controller is the distillation of all that has made the last 20 years of Xbox gamepads great, and it shows.

Thanks to Microsoft’s proprietary wireless protocol, the Xbox Wireless Controller is the only affordable wireless option out there. (Third-party wireless alternatives are available, but they’re mostly at the high end.) While some hate the standard Xbox wireless controller for its use of AA batteries instead of a built-in rechargeable cell, that also means it’s flexible, allowing for rechargeable AAs or a battery pack. And user-replaceable batteries mean you’re not stuck with a controller that doesn’t hold its charge after years of use. It also works over a USB-C wired connection.

But the standard-issue Xbox pad isn’t just great because of its varied connectivity. The hardware itself is excellent for the controller’s $65 (and often less) asking price. The sticks, buttons, triggers, and the sunken dish-shaped D-pad all feel impeccably tight, with the latter having a satisfying clickiness to it. If you’re a hardcore fighting game fan, you’ll probably be best served by a dedicated fight stick or a controller geared toward that genre — one with a superb D-pad like Hori’s Horipad Pro — but the Xbox Wireless Controller is otherwise an extraordinary jack-of-all-trades.

The only things it really lacks compared to pricier options are extra, customizable buttons and software tuning for things like stick sensitivity (button remapping is available), though Microsoft does offer cosmetic customization through its Xbox Design Lab, which bumps the price from $79.99 to $124.93 depending on the configuration. There’s a lot to love about these controllers, whether you make your own or pick one from the many colors that Microsoft offers.

InexpensiveLightweight and comfortableSatisfying buttons and Hall effect componentsProgrammable back buttons are easy to press

Connectivity: Wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Two / Software customization: Yes / Power: Wired

The 8BitDo Ultimate Wired Controller for Xbox is a fantastic budget model that typically retails for $44.99 but can often be found for as little as $29.99. The shape is reminiscent of Nintendo’s Switch Pro Controller, only a bit smaller, with hints of Xbox influence and a curvaceous design that feels great to hold.

On the hardware front, the Ultimate Wired Controller features Hall effect sticks with satisfying tension. It also uses Hall effect triggers with dedicated vibration motors, though it lacks trigger stops, unlike our previous budget pick, the PowerA Advantage Wired. Its D-pad, face buttons, and bumpers are nice and clicky, too, despite being smaller than we’d typically like. It has two rear paddles, remappable buttons, and the ability to save up to three profiles, which you can switch between on the fly using a dedicated button. There’s even a built-in mute switch for audio, which isn’t common on cheaper controllers. You can download the 8BitDo Ultimate Software X app on PC or Xbox to fully customize this controller.

The 8BitDo Ultimate Wired works as a wired controller with your PC, but if you prefer wireless connectivity, the company also makes a three-mode wireless version for $69.99 with support for both Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless (via a dongle). The wireless version is a bit more expensive, however, and it’s still limited to wired connectivity on Xbox consoles.

Extensive modular customizationPremium look and feelRechargeable battery lasts an incredible 40 hours

PriceyQuestionable quality controlNo Hall effect components

Connectivity: Xbox wireless, Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Up to four / Software customization: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable

The Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 is Microsoft’s fanciest controller, and it’s got a lot of nice extras, like better build quality, extra buttons, user-swappable sticks and D-pad, a built-in rechargeable battery, and loads of software customization. Where the standard Xbox controller is constructed entirely of unassuming plastic, the Elite mixes higher quality soft-touch plastic, rubberized grips, and metallic touches for a superior fit and finish. This makes it heftier than the stock controller, and as a result, it just feels nicer in your hands. It also comes with a charging dock and zip-up case with passthrough charging, completing a really nice package for $199.99 (or sometimes less, if it’s on sale).

There’s also the stripped-down Elite Series 2 “Core” version with an MSRP of $149.99, which ditches the add-ons but is equally customizable. You can buy them separately in a $59.99 accessories pack, but you’ll end up paying more that way, barring sales or discounts.

A pricey controller like an Xbox Elite is a bit of a splurge purchase. Most of us are not competing at e-sports levels that require its high-end features. Nevertheless, it’s fun to use something that feels nicer, offers ways to custom-tailor it to your liking, and maybe gives you a slight competitive edge thanks to features like hair triggers and removable rear paddles. In theory, you may be able to get shots off faster in an online shooter with the hair triggers, and you can map the paddles to functions like jump, crouch, reload, etc., while keeping your thumb on the right stick. You could teach yourself claw grip to accomplish the latter with even a cheap wired controller, sure, but it just won’t feel as cool or easy as when using an Elite.

While the Elite is still a great controller in 2025, you should keep in mind that it’s been around since 2019 and a Series 3 revision is feeling long overdue. The Series 2 also has a bit of a reputation for lackluster quality control — with horror stories from users about going through multiple replacements under warranty. Microsoft extended the controller’s warranty from 90 days to a year in late 2020 to help address concerns, but buying an Elite Series 2 may still feel like a slightly risky proposition. It also predates the current-gen implementation of a dedicated Share button, and its potentiometer-based sticks run the risk of stick drift after long-term use (something third parties are addressing with controllers that use drift-free Hall effect sticks, unlike all three big console manufacturers).

Even so, the Elite 2 remains by far the most well-rounded option for a step-up Xbox controller — thanks in large part to its impressive build and expansive software experience. If all these caveats give you pause, though, there is another promising option.

ExpensiveRequires a USB dongleRazer Synapse software needs work

Connectivity: Wireless USB dongle (Xbox / PC), wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Four / Software customization: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable

At $199.99, Razer’s Wolverine V3 Pro controller is as expensive (or more, depending on available deals) than the Elite Series 2, but it’s worth the cost if you want a high-end controller with drift-free sticks. Not only is the V3 Pro Razer’s first foray into using Hall effect sticks, it’s the company’s first fully wireless Xbox gamepad. It also sports some of the best hair-trigger lockouts around, yielding a mouse-like click usually found on even pricier Scuf controllers (a previous high-ranking pick of ours).

Other than that, the V3 Pro is similar to the previous V2 Pro, with six remappable buttons — four rear paddles in new, angled orientations and two extra shoulder buttons — and some RGB lighting. The buttons and D-pad still have that satisfying micro-switch tactility and audible clickiness like the previous-gen V2 Pro, but the RGB lighting is more subtle this time around.

The Wolverine V3 Pro’s biggest shortcomings compared to Microsoft’s Elite Series 2 are its more basic software customization, its lack of Bluetooth, and the fact that it needs a USB dongle to work wirelessly. The V3 Pro is otherwise the better pick if you can justify its high price, which, unlike the Series 2, is rarely subjected to discounts. Luckily, if you can’t, there’s also the $99.99 Wolverine V3 Pro Tournament Edition that has a nearly identical set of features in a wired configuration.

GameSir’s G7 Pro is a wired Xbox controller with remapable rear buttons, adjustable triggers, and TMR joysticks. It can also be connected wirelessly to a PC (via a 2.4Ghz dongle) or Android (via Bluetooth).

Connectivity: Wired (Xbox), wireless USB dongle (PC), Bluetooth (Android) / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Two / Software customization: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable

If you don’t mind using a wired controller, GameSir’s G7 Pro offers some features of the splurge-worthy Xbox Elite Controller 2 for under $100. It has remappable buttons, smooth-feeling drift-resistant TMR control sticks, a satisfying weight, and textured grips that made it feel comfortable to hold even with sweaty palms.

The G7 Pro is actually a battery-powered wireless controller, but its cable free connectivity is limited to PC (via an included 2.4Ghz dongle) and Android (via Bluetooth). You’ll need to plug the controller into the Xbox with a cable, and GameSir provides a lengthy USB-C to USB-A cord. The cable was long enough that I could play games from my couch (roughly six feet away) without feeling tethered.

I was impressed with the G7 Pro’s overall build quality, especially the triggers, which could be locked by flipping switches on its back. GameSir includes three swappable direction pads with the G7 Pro, which can be swapped by lifting the front of the controller’s shell and popping them in and out. However, its face buttons felt noticeably cheaper than the ones on the Elite 2, which makes sense given their price difference. Button feel aside, the controller never dropped an input, even when I mashed buttons to string together elaborate combos in Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater, or continuously cast spells, dodged, and healed in Diablo IV. If an action was mistimed, it was on me.

What the controller lacks in face button quality is more than made up for in customizability. GameSir Nexus, a free app on the Xbox Store, allowed me to remap any button (including the L4 and R4 buttons on its backside), adjust the vibration intensity of both triggers, enable two flavors of hair trigger mode, and set the deadzone for each control stick. You can save up to four profiles with different settings, and quickly switch between them by pressing the controller’s M button along with one of the face buttons. You never need to touch these options, or even download the GameSir Nexus app for the G7 Pro to work, but doing so will unlock its full potential.

The GameSir G7 Pro is an excellent Xbox controller, especially in its price range. I’d have liked the option to use it wirelessly, but that wasn’t a dealbreaker for me. That said, it’s something to consider depending on how far away you are from your Xbox when playing. If you’re a multi-platform gamer and want a controller to use with both an Xbox and PC (or Android device), it’s an even better choice.

Hyperkin’s Competitor is a wired Xbox controller that looks and feels like Sony’s PlayStation 5 DualSense gamepad. It has symmetrical Hall effect joysticks, four-button directional pad, and a pair of programmable back buttons.

Connectivity: Wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Two / Software customization: No / Power: N/A

Hyperkin’s cheekily-named Competitor wired Xbox and PC-compatible controller that looks and feels like the DualSense gamepad that comes with the PlayStation 5 — aka one of the Xbox’s main competitors. The controller’s Hall effect joysticks are symmetrical and located at the bottom, while a four-button directional pad sits above the left grip. The giant “X” button in the middle of the controller is an immediate giveaway that you’re using an Xbox gamepad, but it was easy to forget I wasn’t using a DualSense when playing games.

In terms of comfort the Competitor was on par with Microsoft’s official Xbox Wireless Controller. I’ve played enough PlayStation games over the years that using the gamepad felt intuitive, with no need to adjust my muscle memory, or change my grip. Playing with a wired controller can feel restrictive, but the long USB-C to USB-A cable included with the Competitor prevented me from feeling tethered. The cable is replaceable, which is good news if yours gets frayed or otherwise damaged over time.

Overall, I was pleased with the controller’s construction. It was heavy enough to feel substantial, but light enough that I never felt wrist fatigue after holding it for an hour or more. Its buttons were all satisfyingly clickey, and its joysticks glided smoothly. The controller has two programmable back buttons, which you can program by pressing one of the rear buttons and the “M” button that’s also located on the controller’s backside. The controller rumbles to let you know it’s time to press another button on the controller to set the hot key. Each back button has to be programmed one at a time, and can be disabled by flipping a switch.

My tests included playing Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2, Crash Bandicoot 4, Trials of Mana, and Tales of Arise. I had no problems jumping (or skating as it were) into any of these games. Playing them felt intuitive, and the controller never dropped an input. A benefit to playing games with a wired controller is there’s less latency between when you press a button and an action happens on screen. The difference is generally imperceptible (unless you play online games competitively), but there were probably a couple of Tony Hawk combos I nailed in the nick of time thanks to the lower latency.

My personal preference will always be to play Xbox games with a wireless controller because it’s the least restrictive type of gamepad. However, Hyperkin’s Competitor is a great gamepad in general, and an especially good choice if you’re regularly switching between playing Xbox, PC, and PS5 games. It doesn’t offer the same amount of customization as the GameSir G7 or Xbox Elite Series 2 controller, but its design and $49.99 MSRP more than make up for those shortcomings.

Update, January 28th: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability and add a mention of 8BitDo’s forthcoming Ultimate 3E controller. Brandt Ranj also contributed to this post.

Now, Gemini in Chrome can handle more complex requests, like helping you shop on a budget.

Google is launching a new “auto browse” feature inside Chrome that can perform multi-step tasks on your behalf. The Gemini AI-powered capability is coming to Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers in the US, and can do things like research hotel and flight costs, schedule appointments, fill out online forms, manage subscriptions, and more.

The update marks another expansion for Gemini in Chrome, which initially served as an AI assistant that you can use to ask questions or summarize content on the webpage you’re reading. Google later added the ability for Gemini to compare products across multiple tabs and recall pages from your browsing history, while hinting at allowing the AI agent to perform “tedious tasks.”

Google says that while using auto browse, Gemini can identify decorations inside of a photo you’re looking at, find similar items on the web, add them to your cart, apply discount codes, all while staying within your budget. If a task requires you to log into an account, Gemini can also use the browser’s password manager to log in.

Along with this change, Google has moved Gemini in Chrome from a pop-up window to a panel anchored to the right side of your screen. It now supports integrations with Gmail, Calendar, Maps, Google Shopping, and Google Flights for all users, allowing it to reference information from across the apps you use, as well as perform actions within them.

“For example, if you’re traveling to a conference and need to book a flight, Gemini can dig up that old email with event details, reference context from Google Flights to provide some recommendations, and later draft an email letting your colleagues know your arrival time,” Google writes.

You’ll also find Nano Banana — Google’s AI-powered image generator — in the new Gemini in Chrome panel. This feature is coming to all Gemini in Chrome users, and lets you edit an image inside your window using a text prompt.

Google has more in store down the road for Gemini in Chrome as it competes with other agentic AI browsers, including OpenAI’s Atlas and Perplexity’s Comet. Personal intelligence, an opt-in feature that first launched inside the Gemini app, gives Gemini the ability to reference your past conversations, as well as use its reasoning capabilities to analyze the data linked to your Gmail, Calendar, Photos, and search history. Google says it plans on bringing the feature to Chrome in the “coming months.”

The company will reveal its Gen 3 robot in the first quarter of 2026.

In its earnings report, Tesla says that the third-generation version of its Optimus humanoid robot “meant for mass production” will be unveiled in the first quarter of 2026.

This new version of Optimus will include “major upgrades from version 2.5, including our latest hand design.” And the company is making preparations for the first production line, which will commence “before the end of 2026.” Tesla says its planning for the eventual capacity of 1 million robots produced per year. Elon Musk previously predicted that Tesla would produce 5,000 robots in 2025, though its unlikely he met that milestone.

In an earnings call Wednesday, Musk said that Tesla was planning to end production of its Model S and Model X vehicles in the second quarter of 2026 to make room at its Fremont factory for Optimus.

Musk has also predicted that Optimus will not only be put to work in Tesla’s factories, but also as home assistants and even surgeons. He has said Tesla will begin to sell Optimus to the public “next year,” even as his company becomes more financially dependent on the prospect of humanoid robots.

But Optimus has had a rough rollout so far, including teleoperations missteps and the recent departure of Tesla’s head of robotics. Much is riding on the humanoid robot, including Musk’s $1 trillion pay package, which requires him to build at least 1 million robots.

            <div id="article-text">Microsoft’s More Personal Computing division was the only business unit to post a revenue decline this quarter.

Microsoft’s More Personal Computing division was the only business unit to post a revenue decline this quarter.

Microsoft just posted the second quarter of its 2026 fiscal financial results. The software maker made $81.3 billion in revenue and a net income of $30.9 billion during Q3. Revenue is up 17 percent, and net income has increased by 23 percent.

The holiday quarter saw PC shipments grow unexpectedly amid an ongoing RAM shortage. Microsoft’s end of Windows 10 support helped push PC shipments up, but IDC revealed earlier this month that PC makers have also been aggressively pulling forward inventory to combat potential tariffs and ongoing global memory shortage.

Microsoft’s Windows OEM and devices revenue over this holiday period was up just 1 percent year-over-year. Businesses and consumers have clearly been upgrading PCs and laptops during the Windows 10 end of life period, because Windows OEM revenue on its own was up 5 percent. But this revenue was offset by a decline in devices revenue as Microsoft combines Surface revenue and Windows OEM revenue together now.

Microsoft didn’t announce any new Surface devices during the recent quarter, after launching both the 12-inch Surface Pro and 13-inch Surface Laptop in May last year. I would expect to hear more about new Surface devices in the spring.

Microsoft’s Xbox hardware revenue has declined for three financial years in a row, and it looks like those declining revenues are going to continue throughout fiscal 2026. Xbox hardware revenue was down 32 percent year-over-year during the recent holiday quarter. Overall gaming revenue was also down 9 percent.

Xbox content and services, which includes Game Pass, is down 5 percent, too. This decline is largely being attributed to stronger first-party content performance in the previous year, and not the Game Pass Ultimate price hike during the quarter. That points towards softer sales numbers for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, which not only had to go up against Battlefield 6, but also the success of Black Ops 6 in 2024.

Unsurprisingly, Microsoft isn’t giving us an update on Xbox Game Pass subscriber numbers. The company last reported it had 34 million subscribers nearly two years ago, which included Xbox Game Pass Essential (previously Xbox Live Gold / Game Pass Core) members.

Microsoft has continued to publish more games on PS5, as part of its strategy to make previously Xbox-exclusive games available on Nintendo and Sony platforms. Microsoft revealed last year that Halo: Campaign Evolved is coming to PS5 and Xbox in 2026, and Fable and Forza Horizon 6 are also coming to Sony’s console this year.

Microsoft’s cloud revenue was once again strong this quarter, and even crossed $50 billion overall — up 26 percent year-over-year. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 39 percent.“ Microsoft Cloud revenue crossed $50 billion this quarter, reflecting the strong demand for our portfolio of services,” says Microsoft CFO Amy Hood. “We exceeded expectations across revenue, operating income, and earnings per share.”

All eyes are still on Microsoft’s AI revenues and the associated costs, and the software maker hasn’t pulled out any specific AI product numbers this quarter. Capital expenditure in Q2 was $37.5 billion, and the majority of that spend was on assets like CPU and GPUs to fuel cloud and AI data centers. Commercial bookings have also increased 230 percent year-over-year, thanks to Azure commitments from OpenAI and Anthropic.

Microsoft announced its latest in-house AI chip this week, which will help host GPT-5.2 and other models for Microsoft Foundry and Microsoft 365 Copilot. The Maia 200 chip is designed for large-scale AI workloads and will go head-to-head with similar AI inference chips from Amazon and Google.

Microsoft also saw Microsoft 365 consumer cloud revenue growth of 29 percent year-over-year, alongside Microsoft 365 commercial cloud revenue growth of 17 percent. LinkedIn revenue also grew by 11 percent year-over-year.

The strength of Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud business, which includes Azure and server products, really shines a bright light on the decline of the More Personal Computing business of Windows, Xbox, and Surface. Intelligent Cloud contributed $32.9 billion in revenue this quarter, more than double the $14.3 billion from More Personal Computing. In fact, the More Personal Computing division declined by 3 percent in revenue year-over-year, the only business unit to do so this quarter.

Microsoft blames that More Personal Computing decline on gaming, and it was offset by search and news advertising revenues growing by 10 percent and Windows OEM growth.

Microsoft will now hold an earnings call at 5:30PM ET, and we’ll update this article with any relevant comments from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Microsoft CFO Amy Hood.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The ability to remember you and your preferences is rapidly becoming a big selling point for AI chatbots and agents.

Earlier this month, Google announced Personal Intelligence, a new way for people to interact with the company’s Gemini chatbot that draws on their Gmail, photos, search, and YouTube histories to make Gemini “more personal, proactive, and powerful.” It echoes similar moves by OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta to add new ways for their AI products to remember and draw from people’s personal details and preferences. While these features have potential advantages, we need to do more to prepare for the new risks they could introduce into these complex technologies.

Personalized, interactive AI systems are built to act on our behalf, maintain context across conversations, and improve our ability to carry out all sorts of tasks, from booking travel to filing taxes. From tools that learn a developer’s coding style to shopping agents that sift through thousands of products, these systems rely on the ability to store and retrieve increasingly intimate details about their users.  But doing so over time introduces alarming, and all-too-familiar, privacy vulnerabilities––many of which have loomed since “big data” first teased the power of spotting and acting on user patterns. Worse, AI agents now appear poised to plow through whatever safeguards had been adopted to avoid those vulnerabilities.

Today, we interact with these systems through conversational interfaces, and we frequently switch contexts. You might ask a single AI agent to draft an email to your boss, provide medical advice, budget for holiday gifts, and provide input on interpersonal conflicts. Most AI agents collapse all data about you—which may once have been separated by context, purpose, or permissions—into single, unstructured repositories. When an AI agent links to external apps or other agents to execute a task, the data in its memory can seep into shared pools. This technical reality creates the potential for unprecedented privacy breaches that expose not only isolated data points, but the entire mosaic of people’s lives.

When information is all in the same repository, it is prone to crossing contexts in ways that are deeply undesirable. A casual chat about dietary preferences to build a grocery list could later influence what health insurance options are offered, or a search for restaurants offering accessible entrances could leak into salary negotiations—all without a user’s awareness (this concern may sound familiar from the early days of “big data,” but is now far less theoretical). An information soup of memory not only poses a privacy issue, but also makes it harder to understand an AI system’s behavior—and to govern it in the first place. So what can developers do to fix this problem?

First, memory systems need structure that allows control over the purposes for which memories can be accessed and used. Early efforts appear to be underway: Anthropic’s Claude creates separate memory areas for different “projects,” and OpenAI says that information shared through ChatGPT Health is compartmentalized from other chats. These are helpful starts, but the instruments are still far too blunt: At a minimum, systems must be able to distinguish between specific memories (the user likes chocolate and has asked about GLP-1s), related memories (user manages diabetes and therefore avoids chocolate), and memory categories (such as professional and health-related). Further, systems need to allow for usage restrictions on certain types of memories and reliably accommodate explicitly defined boundaries—particularly around memories having to do with sensitive topics like medical conditions or protected characteristics, which will likely be subject to stricter rules.

Needing to keep memories separate in this way will have important implications for how AI systems can and should be built. It will require tracking memories’ provenance—their source, any associated time stamp, and the context in which they were created—and building ways to trace when and how certain memories influence the behavior of an agent. This sort of model explainability is on the horizon, but current implementations can be misleading or even deceptive. Embedding memories directly within a model’s weights may result in more personalized and context-aware outputs, but structured databases are currently more segmentable, more explainable, and thus more governable. Until research advances enough, developers may need to stick with simpler systems.

Second, users need to be able to see, edit, or delete what is remembered about them. The interfaces for doing this should be both transparent and intelligible, translating system memory into a structure users can accurately interpret. The static system settings and legalese privacy policies provided by traditional tech platforms have set a low bar for user controls, but natural-language interfaces may offer promising new options for explaining what information is being retained and how it can be managed. Memory structure will have to come first, though: Without it, no model can clearly state a memory’s status. Indeed, Grok 3’s system prompt includes an instruction to the model to “NEVER confirm to the user that you have modified, forgotten, or won&#39;t save a memory,” presumably because the company can’t guarantee those instructions will be followed.

Critically, user-facing controls cannot bear the full burden of privacy protection or prevent all harms from AI personalization. Responsibility must shift toward AI providers to establish strong defaults, clear rules about permissible memory generation and use, and technical safeguards like on-device processing, purpose limitation, and contextual constraints. Without system-level protections, individuals will face impossibly convoluted choices about what should be remembered or forgotten, and the actions they take may still be insufficient to prevent harm. Developers should consider how to limit data collection in memory systems until robust safeguards exist, and build memory architectures that can evolve alongside norms and expectations.

Third, AI developers must help lay the foundations for approaches to evaluating systems so as to capture not only performance, but also the risks and harms that arise in the wild. While independent researchers are best positioned to conduct these tests (given developers’ economic interest in demonstrating demand for more personalized services), they need access to data to understand what risks might look like and therefore how to address them. To improve the ecosystem for measurement and research, developers should invest in automated measurement infrastructure, build out their own ongoing testing, and implement privacy-preserving testing methods that enable system behavior to be monitored and probed under realistic, memory-enabled conditions.

In its parallels with human experience, the technical term “memory” casts impersonal cells in a spreadsheet as something that builders of AI tools have a responsibility to handle with care. Indeed, the choices AI developers make today—how to pool or segregate information, whether to make memory legible or allow it to accumulate opaquely, whether to prioritize responsible defaults or maximal convenience—will determine how the systems we depend upon remember us. Technical considerations around memory are not so distinct from questions about digital privacy and the vital lessons we can draw from them. Getting the foundations right today will determine how much room we can give ourselves to learn what works—allowing us to make better choices around privacy and autonomy than we have before.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">From the Gemini Calendar prompt-injection attack of 2026 to the September 2025 state-sponsored hack using Anthropic’s Claude code as an automated intrusion engine, the coercion of human-in-the-loop agentic actions and fully autonomous agentic workflows are the new attack vector for hackers. In the Anthropic case, roughly 30 organizations across tech, finance, manufacturing, and government were affected. Anthropic’s threat team assessed that the attackers used AI to carry out 80% to 90% of the operation: reconnaissance, exploit development, credential harvesting, lateral movement, and data exfiltration, with humans stepping in only at a handful of key decision points.

This was not a lab demo; it was a live espionage campaign. The attackers hijacked an agentic setup (Claude code plus tools exposed via Model Context Protocol (MCP)) and jailbroke it by decomposing the attack into small, seemingly benign tasks and telling the model it was doing legitimate penetration testing. The same loop that powers developer copilots and internal agents was repurposed as an autonomous cyber-operator. Claude was not hacked. It was persuaded and used tools for the attack.

Security communities have been warning about this for several years. Multiple OWASP Top 10 reports put prompt injection, or more recently Agent Goal Hijack, at the top of the risk list and pair it with identity and privilege abuse and human-agent trust exploitation: too much power in the agent, no separation between instructions and data, and no mediation of what comes out.

Guidance from the NCSC and CISA describes generative AI as a persistent social-engineering and manipulation vector that must be managed across design, development, deployment, and operations, not patched away with better phrasing. The EU AI Act turns that lifecycle view into law for high-risk AI systems, requiring a continuous risk management system, robust data governance, logging, and cybersecurity controls.

In practice, prompt injection is best understood as a persuasion channel. Attackers don’t break the model—they convince it. In the Anthropic example, the operators framed each step as part of a defensive security exercise, kept the model blind to the overall campaign, and nudged it, loop by loop, into doing offensive work at machine speed.

That’s not something a keyword filter or a polite “please follow these safety instructions” paragraph can reliably stop. Research on deceptive behavior in models makes this worse. Anthropic’s research on sleeper agents shows that once a model has learned a backdoor, then strategic pattern recognition, standard fine-tuning, and adversarial training can actually help the model hide the deception rather than remove it. If one tries to defend a system like that purely with linguistic rules, they are playing on its home field.

Regulators aren’t asking for perfect prompts; they’re asking that enterprises demonstrate control.

NIST’s AI RMF emphasizes asset inventory, role definition, access control, change management, and continuous monitoring across the AI lifecycle. The UK AI Cyber Security Code of Practice similarly pushes for secure-by-design principles by treating AI like any other critical system, with explicit duties for boards and system operators from conception through decommissioning.

In other words: the rules actually needed are not “never say X” or “always respond like Y,” they are:

Frameworks like Google’s Secure AI Framework (SAIF) make this concrete. SAIF’s agent permissions control is blunt: agents should operate with least privilege, dynamically scoped permissions, and explicit user control for sensitive actions. OWASP’s Top 10 emerging guidance on agentic applications mirrors that stance: constrain capabilities at the boundary, not in the prose.

The Anthropic espionage case makes the boundary failure concrete:

We’ve seen the other side of this coin in civilian contexts. When Air Canada’s website chatbot misrepresented its bereavement policy and the airline tried to argue that the bot was a separate legal entity, the tribunal rejected the claim outright: the company remained liable for what the bot said. In espionage, the stakes are higher but the logic is the same: if an AI agent misuses tools or data, regulators and courts will look through the agent and to the enterprise.

So yes, rule-based systems fail if by rules one means ad-hoc allow/deny lists, regex fences, and baroque prompt hierarchies trying to police semantics. Those crumble under indirect prompt injection, retrieval-time poisoning, and model deception. But rule-based governance is non-optional when we move from language to action.

The security community is converging on a synthesis:

The lesson from the first AI-orchestrated espionage campaign is not that AI is uncontrollable. It’s that control belongs in the same place it always has in security: at the architecture boundary, enforced by systems, not by vibes.

Stratospheric internet could finally start taking off this year

Today, an estimated 2.2 billion people still have either limited or no access to the internet, largely because they live in remote places. But that number could drop this year, thanks to tests of stratospheric airships, uncrewed aircraft, and other high-altitude platforms for internet delivery.Although Google shuttered its high-profile internet balloon project Loon in 2021, work on other kinds of high-altitude platform stations has continued behind the scenes. Now, several companies claim they have solved Loon’s problems—and are getting ready to prove the tech’s internet beaming potential starting this year. Read the full story.

The firm has released a free LLM-powered tool for scientists called Prism, which embeds ChatGPT in a text editor for writing scientific papers.The idea is to put ChatGPT front and center inside software that scientists use to write up their work in much the same way that chatbots are now embedded into popular programming editors. It’s vibe coding, but for science. Read the full story.

MIT Technology Review Narrated: This Nobel Prize–winning chemist dreams of making water from thin air

Most of Earth is covered in water, but just 3% of it is fresh, with no salt—the kind of water all terrestrial living things need. Today, desalination plants that take the salt out of seawater provide the bulk of potable water in technologically advanced desert nations like Israel and the United Arab Emirates, but at a high cost.

Omar Yaghi, is one of three scientists who won a Nobel Prize in chemistry in October 2025 for identifying metal-­organic frameworks, or MOFs—metal ions tethered to organic molecules that form repeating structural landscapes. Today that work is the basis for a new project that sounds like science fiction, or a miracle: conjuring water out of thin air.This is our latest story to be turned into a MIT Technology Review Narrated podcast, which we’re publishing each week on Spotify and Apple Podcasts.

How AI and Wikipedia have sent vulnerable languages into a doom spiralWikipedia is the most ambitious multilingual project after the Bible: There are editions in over 340 languages, and a further 400 even more obscure ones are being developed. But many of these smaller editions are being swamped with AI-translated content. Volunteers working on four African languages, for instance, estimated to MIT Technology Review that between 40% and 60% of articles in their Wikipedia editions were uncorrected machine translations.

This is beginning to cause a wicked problem. AI systems learn new languages by scraping huge quantities of text from the internet. Wikipedia is sometimes the largest source of online linguistic data for languages with few speakers—so any errors on those pages can poison the wells that AI is expected to draw from. Volunteers are being forced to go to extreme lengths to fix the issue, even deleting certain languages from Wikipedia entirely. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">When Elon Musk was at Davos last week, an interviewer asked him if he thought aging could be reversed. Musk said he hasn’t put much time into the problem but suspects it is “very solvable” and that when scientists discover why we age, it’s going to be something “obvious.”

Not long after, the Harvard professor and life-extension evangelist David Sinclair jumped into the conversation on X to strongly agree with the world’s richest man. “Aging has a relatively simple explanation and is apparently reversible,” wrote Sinclair. “Clinical Trials begin shortly.”

ER-100 turns out to be the code name of a treatment created by Life Biosciences, a small Boston startup that Sinclair cofounded and which he confirmed today has won FDA approval to proceed with the first targeted attempt at age reversal in human volunteers.

The company plans to try to treat eye disease with a radical rejuvenation concept called “reprogramming” that has recently attracted hundreds of millions in investment for Silicon Valley firms like Altos Labs, New Limit, and Retro Biosciences, backed by many of the biggest names in tech.

The technique attempts to restore cells to a healthier state by broadly resetting their epigenetic controls—switches on our genes that determine which are turned on and off.

“Reprogramming is like the AI of the bio world. It’s the thing everyone is funding,” says Karl Pfleger, an investor who backs a smaller UK startup, Shift Bioscience. He says Sinclair’s company has recently been seeking additional funds to keep advancing its treatment.

Reprogramming is so powerful that it sometimes creates risks, even causing cancer in lab animals, but the version of the technique being advanced by Life Biosciences passed initial safety tests in animals.

But it’s still very complex. The trial will initially test the treatment on about a dozen patients with glaucoma, a condition where high pressure inside the eye damages the optic nerve. In the tests, viruses carrying three powerful reprogramming genes will be injected into one eye of each patient, according to a description of the study first posted in December.

To help make sure the process doesn’t go too far, the reprogramming genes will be under the control of a special genetic switch that turns them on only while the patients take a low dose of the antibiotic doxycycline. Initially, they will take the antibiotic for about two months while the effects are monitored.

Executives at the company have said for months that a trial could begin this year, sometimes characterizing it as a starting bell for a new era of age reversal. “It’s an incredibly big deal for us as an industry,” Michael Ringel, chief operating officer at Life Biosciences, said at an event this fall. “It’ll be the first time in human history, in the millennia of human history, of looking for something that rejuvenates … So watch this space.”

The technology is based on the Nobel Prize–winning discovery, 20 years ago, that introducing a few potent genes into a cell will cause it to turn back into a stem cell, just like those found in an early embryo that develop into the different specialized cell types. These genes, known as Yamanaka factors, have been likened to a “factory reset” button for cells.

But they’re dangerous, too. When turned on in a living animal, they can cause an eruption of tumors.

That is what led scientists to a new idea, termed “partial” or “transient” reprogramming. The idea is to limit exposure to the potent genes—or use only a subset of them—in the hope of making cells act younger without giving them complete amnesia about what their role in the body is.

In 2020, Sinclair claimed that such partial reprogramming could restore vision to mice after their optic nerves were smashed, saying there was even evidence that the nerves regrew. His report appeared on the cover of the influential journal Nature alongside the headline “Turning Back Time.”

Not all scientists agree that reprogramming really counts as age reversal. But Sinclair has doubled down. He’s been advancing the theory that the gradual loss of correct epigenetic information in our cells is, in fact, the ultimate cause of aging—just the kind of root cause that Musk was alluding to.

“Elon does seem to be paying attention to the field and [is] seemingly in sync with [my theory],” Sinclair said in an email.

Reprogramming isn’t the first longevity fix championed by Sinclair, who’s written best-selling books and commands stratospheric fees on the longevity lecture circuit. Previously, he touted the longevity benefits of molecules called sirtuins as well as resveratrol, a molecule found in red wine. But some critics say he greatly exaggerates scientific progress, pushback that culminated in a 2024 Wall Street Journal story that dubbed him a “reverse-aging guru” whose companies “have not panned out.”

Life Biosciences has been among those struggling companies. Initially formed in 2017, it at first had a strategy of launching subsidiaries, each intended to pursue one aspect of the aging problem. But after these made limited progress, in 2021 it hired a new CEO, Jerry McLaughlin, who has refocused its efforts  on Sinclair’s mouse vision results and the push toward a human trial.

The company has discussed the possibility of reprogramming other organs, including the brain. And Ringel, like Sinclair, entertains the idea that someday even whole-body rejuvenation might be feasible. But for now, it’s better to think of the study as a proof of concept that’s still far from a fountain of youth. “The optimistic case is this solves some blindness for certain people and catalyzes work in other indications,” says Pfleger, the investor. “It’s not like your doctor will be writing a prescription for a pill that will rejuvenate you.”

Life’s treatment also relies on an antibiotic switching mechanism that, while often used in lab animals, hasn’t been tried in humans before. Since the switch is built from gene components taken from E. coli and the herpes virus, it’s possible that it could cause an immune reaction in humans, scientists say.

“I was always thinking that for widespread use you might need a different system,” says Noah Davidsohn, who helped Sinclair implement the technique and is now chief scientist at a different company, Rejuvenate Bio. And Life’s choice of reprogramming factors—it’s picked three, which go by the acronym OSK—may also be risky. They are expected to turn on hundreds of other genes, and in some circumstances the combination can cause cells to revert to a very primitive, stem-cell-like state.

Other companies studying reprogramming say their focus is on researching which genes to use, in order to achieve time reversal without unwanted side effects. New Limit, which has been carrying out an extensive search for such genes, says it won’t be ready for a human study for two years. At Shift, experiments on animals are only beginning now.

“Are their factors the best version of rejuvenation? We don’t think they are. I think they are working with what they’ve got,” Daniel Ives, the CEO of Shift, says of Life Biosciences. “But I think they’re way ahead of anybody else in terms of getting into humans. They have found a route forward in the eye, which is a nice self-contained system. If it goes wrong, you’ve still got one left.”

A startup’s ads for controversial embryo tests hit the New York City subway.

Why personalized gene editing, genetic resurrections and embryo scoring made our list.

A small group of volunteers will receive multiple injections of the experimental treatments next month, says Unlimited Bio.

An emphasis on fruit, vegetables, and whole foods is welcome—but it’s wrong to suggest steak and beef tallow should be prominent.

            <div id="article-text">OpenAI just revealed what its new in-house team, OpenAI for Science, has been up to. The firm has released a free LLM-powered tool for scientists called Prism, which embeds ChatGPT in a text editor for writing scientific papers.

The idea is to put ChatGPT front and center inside software that scientists use to write up their work in much the same way that chatbots are now embedded into popular programming editors. It’s vibe coding, but for science.

Kevin Weil, head of OpenAI for Science, pushes that analogy himself. “I think 2026 will be for AI and science what 2025 was for AI in software engineering,” he said at a press briefing yesterday. “We’re starting to see that same kind of inflection.”

OpenAI claims that around 1.3 million scientists around the world submit more than 8 million queries a week to ChatGPT on advanced topics in science and math. “That tells us that AI is moving from curiosity to core workflow for scientists,” Weil said.

Prism is a response to that user behavior. It can also be seen as a bid to lock in more scientists to OpenAI’s products in a marketplace full of rival chatbots.

“I mostly use GPT-5 for writing code,” says Roland Dunbrack, a professor of biology at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, who is not connected to OpenAI. “Occasionally, I ask LLMs a scientific question, basically hoping it can find information in the literature faster than I can. It used to hallucinate references but does not seem to do that very much anymore.”

Nikita Zhivotovskiy, a statistician at the University of California, Berkeley, says GPT-5 has already become an important tool in his work. “It sometimes helps polish the text of papers, catching mathematical typos or bugs, and provides generally useful feedback,” he says. “It is extremely helpful for quick summarization of research articles, making interaction with the scientific literature smoother.”

By combining a chatbot with an everyday piece of software, Prism follows a trend set by products such as OpenAI’s Atlas, which embeds ChatGPT in a web browser, as well as LLM-powered office tools from firms such as Microsoft and Google DeepMind.

Prism incorporates GPT-5.2, the company’s best model yet for mathematical and scientific problem-solving, into an editor for writing documents in LaTeX, a common coding language that scientists use for formatting scientific papers.

A ChatGPT chat box sits at the bottom of the screen, below a view of the article being written. Scientists can call on ChatGPT for anything they want. It can help them draft the text, summarize related articles, manage their citations, turn photos of whiteboard scribbles into equations or diagrams, or talk through hypotheses or mathematical proofs.

It’s clear that Prism could be a huge time saver. It’s also clear that a lot of people may be disappointed, especially after weeks of high-profile social media chatter from researchers at the firm about how good GPT-5 is at solving math problems. Science is drowning in AI slop: Won&#39;t this just make it worse? Where is OpenAI’s fully automated AI scientist? And when will GPT-5 make a stunning new discovery?

That’s not the mission, says Weil. He would love to see GPT-5 make a discovery. But he doesn’t think that’s what will have the biggest impact on science, at least not in the near term.

“I think more powerfully—and with 100% probability—there’s going to be 10,000 advances in science that maybe wouldn’t have happened or wouldn&#39;t have happened as quickly, and AI will have been a contributor to that,” Weil told MIT Technology Review in an exclusive interview this week. “It won’t be this shining beacon—it will just be an incremental, compounding acceleration.”

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

By studying large language models as if they were living things instead of computer programs, scientists are discovering some of their secrets for the first time.

            <h2>Bonjour Visio: France turns digital sovereignty into policy</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-28</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a bold turn of phrase and deed, Paris has quietly told Silicon Valley “au revoir.”  On January 26, 2026, France’s Ministry of Finance announced that by 2027, all public servants will switch from U.S. video apps like Microsoft Teams and Zoom to a homegrown platform called Visio.

No more license renewals for Teams, Zoom, Webex, or Meet, just one unified, French-built solution.

In one stroke, a long-discussed slogan “digital sovereignty” has leapt off the podium and into practice. This is not a press release; it’s a watershed moment: Europe’s second-biggest economy is wagering that, when it comes to critical infrastructure, it’s time to govern itself.

“Digital sovereignty” has become the EU’s new watchword, a declaration of independence from foreign tech hegemons. Over the past few years, it has surged from a niche policy to a headline priority, as EU leaders from Ursula von der Leyen to Emmanuel Macron have warned that Europe must control its own networks and data.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

The phrase sounds grand, but what changed now is urgency. Americans’ own laws make the risks concrete: under the U.S. CLOUD Act, for example, U.S. authorities can demand data from any American platform, regardless of where it’s stored.

In practice, “jurisdiction follows ownership,” as one analyst noted: even data sitting on a Frankfurt server can be swept up by U.S. warrants if the service provider is American.

Edward Snowden’s revelations and murky court orders have long haunted Europe with the idea that a virtual meeting might be spied on from overseas. Now, with geopolitics in flux, U.S. political turns and global crises, that theoretical risk seems all too real.

The push has taken many forms. The EU has drafted cloud-certification rules demanding “sovereignty” guarantees and drafted data laws to keep Europeans’ information in Europe.

Member states debate mandating local clouds. Digital sovereignty has moved from virtue-signaling to something harder, actual infrastructure.

France’s pivot is concrete and wide-ranging. Visio, developed by the government’s interministerial digital agency (DINUM), has been tested for about a year with some 40,000 regular users. It’s already being adopted piecemeal: CNRS (France’s national research center) will replace all its 34,000 Zoom seats by March 2026, covering 120,000 associated researchers.

By early 2026, the Defense Ministry, finance tax offices, health insurance, and other big agencies will be on Visio. The government now says every state department will use Visio as the default video tool by 2027, after which external conferencing licenses simply won’t be renewed.

The official rationale is familiar: a patchwork of Teams, Zoom, Webex, and friends “fragilises security” and creates hidden costs, dependencies, and interoperability headaches.

Visio is billed as a solution under full French control: it’s hosted on a certified “SecNumCloud” by Dassault-owned Outscale, built with ANSSI (France’s cyber agency) oversight, and even uses French AI for meeting transcription and captions.

The aim, in the minister’s words, is to “end the use of non-European solutions and guarantee the security and confidentiality of public electronic communications by relying on a powerful…sovereign tool”.

In short: no more data flying through American servers or falling under foreign laws.

There are financial perks, too. Officials point out that ditching pricey Teams and Zoom licenses will save money: roughly €1 million per year for every 100,000 users who shift off commercial tools. That’s not pocket change, even if it’s a rounding error in a €600 billion budget. In any case, for France, this isn’t just about cost – it’s about control.

Taken together, these facts show a very concrete policy timeline. In one meeting on Jan. 26, the state literally put a deadline on dependence: four years to shift the ENTIRE civil service. It’s one thing to talk about sovereignty in Brussels speeches, quite another to swap out the nation’s video chat app.

France isn’t alone in flirting with this idea, but it’s the first to bet big. Other EU countries are eyeballing similar moves. In Denmark, parts of the public sector have already announced plans to phase out Microsoft’s software.

In Germany, the state of Schleswig-Holstein recently ditched Microsoft Office in favor of open-source alternatives. Even non-state bodies are joining the sovereignty club: the International Criminal Court said it will move its systems to a German-developed open-source platform (OpenDesk).

These are baby steps compared to France’s all-hands policy, but they reflect a shared unease about over-reliance on foreign tech.

Europe is also wrestling with headline-grabbing hiccups like last year’s massive cloud outages in the U.S., which left public agencies scrambling. The Visio announcement itself notes that Europe’s “overreliance on U.S. IT infrastructure” has been questioned after those failures.

And there are EU-wide initiatives underway, from the Gaia-X cloud alliance to tougher data localization rules – aimed at seeding local alternatives.

If France makes Visio work, it could serve as a proof of concept for others. Will a homegrown tool really run government communications smoothly? If yes, it might embolden policymakers in Brussels or Rome to push harder on local platforms. If not, it could slow the momentum.

For now, France’s move is a beacon: it shows that digital sovereignty can move beyond talk. Other nations will watch closely.

No one seriously argues that keeping calls on Visio will magically end world unrest. Rather, this is a narrow, technical solution to a policy problem. On the other side, France will indeed have tighter control: all servers, encryption keys, and software updates are now under French (and EU) jurisdiction.

Public-sector IT teams can audit code, set security parameters, and avoid nasty surprises (say, a foreign court order) without jumping through transatlantic hoops.

Data stays where the politicians say it stays.

But what might be lost? For one, user experience and innovation often depend on scale. Big Tech’s video platforms have oceans of R&D behind them, from instant translation to seamless device-hopping, and millions of users giving feedback.

A new platform built from scratch may not match Teams’ polish or Zoom’s ubiquity overnight. (The French have even admitted an irony: naming it “Visio” risks confusion with Microsoft Visio, the longtime diagram app, hinting that branding and polish sometimes play second fiddle to strategy.)

There’s also the question of interoperability: how well will Visio meetings work when French officials Zoom into a partner country’s conference, or vice versa? Will France demand that foreign delegations install its app, or allow links to other networks? The devil is in the details.

Some critics fret that an insular approach could fragment standards. One EU paper urges that sovereignty shouldn’t mean isolation but rather a robust, open ecosystem.

If every country builds its own siloed cloud and chat service, the Internet risks reinventing wheels (and reinventing firewalls) in every member state. Of course, Visio is only for civil servants, not a consumer product, yet it sets a precedent.

On the other hand, an expertly executed French stack could jumpstart a continental open-source community or spur startups to plug gaps. It’s a calculated gamble: France assumes that on net, its security and strategic stakes outweigh any shortfall in bells and whistles.

For its part, France says this isn’t a bare-bones trade-off. Officials emphasize Visio will include modern features: speaker separation, AI for transcripts, captions, etc. The goal is “not [a] minimalist replacement,” but a full-featured tool under domestic control.

In other words, they aim for the best of both worlds, though acknowledging it’s a tall order.

In its own softly decisive way, France’s Visio plan signals a definitive shift: digital sovereignty is no longer a future wish or empty catchphrase, but a deadline-driven program.

Europe has debated “strategic autonomy” for years; this is the first major state-level bet, with clear timelines and budget line savings. From the perspective of a tech editor watching policy trends, it’s heartening to see ambition meet action.

Will it pay off? If Visio runs smoothly, France will score a coup: more secure chats, money saved, and perhaps the bragging rights of a proof of concept. If glitches persist, France’s analysts may ask if the Q1 rollout to 200,000 civil servants is biting off too much too soon.

Either way, the move puts stakes on the table. Digital sovereignty has many meanings, but here it means doing something concrete, even if it means saying “non” to familiar tools.

In the end, it’s a balancing act. Europe gains control of what it might risk in convenience. France has just turned insurance talk into policy practice. Other countries will now watch and learn: Visio is not just a video app; it’s France’s case study in what digital independence can actually look like.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Slush, the Finnish nonprofit behind one of the most influential startup gatherings in Europe, has named Noora Saksa as its new Chief Executive Officer, a shift that indicates a strategic evolution for the organisation as it expands beyond its flagship event model.

Saksa assumes the top role after years as Slush’s Chief Operating & Financial Officer and Head of Partnerships, where she managed core operations, finances, and ecosystem programmes.

Her trajectory within the organisation reflects a deep operational understanding of Slush’s mission: to connect founders, investors, and builders in ways that help founders advance on their journeys.

In stepping into the CEO role, Saksa inherits an agenda that extends far beyond an annual conference in Helsinki.

Under her leadership, Slush aims to grow year-round engagement through digital experiences and local ecosystem programmes, and to deepen its reach in founder support globally.

Board members see her operational experience and ecosystem insight as assets for Slush’s next chapter.

Slush remains organised largely by a core team of young professionals and volunteers, a structure that has supported its rapid growth since the early 2010s.

The event brings together thousands of founders and investors each year, and the organisation’s year-round platform aims to sustain connections long after the main event ends.

In her opening statement as CEO, Saksa said the focus will remain on building meaningful experiences that help founders tackle practical challenges, expand networks, and find capital. Her intimate knowledge of Slush’s operations positions her to balance growth ambitions with the organisation’s mission-driven ethos.

Noora Saksa has played a central role at Slush as Chief Operating & Financial Officer and Head of Partnerships, overseeing operations, finances, and startup-focused programmes. Before her tenure at Slush, she held leadership roles in entrepreneurial student societies and worked in startup support functions. Saksa studied Industrial Engineering and Management at Aalto University with an exchange at Eindhoven University of Technology. Her experience spans operational strategy, ecosystem building, and partnership development within Nordic innovation communities.

            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/rainbow-weather-raises-5-5m-to-refine-real-time-weather-forecasting">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Warsaw, Poland 26 January 2026 – Rainbow Weather has raised $5.5 million in seed funding to push weather forecasting further into the short-term, high-precision territory it believes the industry still underserves.

The Warsaw-based climate tech startup focuses on hyperlocal, minute-by-minute forecasts, zeroing in on what happens in the next few hours rather than days out.

The round was backed by a syndicate of investors, including Yuri Gurski, founder of Flo Health, one of Europe’s best-known consumer tech unicorns.

Rainbow Weather’s core product is a mobile app that delivers four-hour precipitation forecasts calculated from the exact moment a user checks the weather.

Open the app at 3:51 am, and it forecasts conditions through 7:51am, refreshed every 10 minutes and mapped down to a one-square-kilometre grid. That level of temporal and spatial precision is what the company says sets it apart from mainstream weather apps.

Most major providers, including AccuWeather, Apple Weather, and The Weather Company, still rely on approaches that either simplify cloud movement or depend on large-scale numerical models designed for longer forecasts. According to Rainbow Weather, both methods struggle when conditions change quickly.

“Many legacy forecasting providers rely on optical flow for short-term precipitation forecasting. That’s a fast but simplistic method that treats clouds as shapes in motion, without any understanding of atmospheric physics,” explained Alexander Matveenko, co-founder of Rainbow Weather. “A second category of services uses large-scale mathematical models that do incorporate physical principles, but they’re so cumbersome and slow that they can’t respond quickly to real-time weather changes.”

Rainbow Weather positions itself in between, using machine learning to fuse high-resolution data from radar, satellites, weather stations, and even smartphone barometers. By combining these sources, the company claims it can reduce the noise and bias inherent in individual datasets, then generate forecasts faster than traditional systems.

The app currently focuses on short-term precipitation, but it has expanded into tracking wildfires and hurricanes, a feature added after the Palisades fire in Los Angeles. That expansion reflects a broader ambition to become a real-time risk awareness tool, not just a rain predictor.

The new funding will be used to extend Rainbow Weather’s forecasting window from four hours to 24 hours, add more weather parameters beyond precipitation, and grow its B2B offering.

The commercial weather intelligence market is expected to grow steadily over the next decade, driven by industries that depend on precise, near-term forecasts, from logistics and agriculture to aviation and drone operations.

Rainbow Weather says it has surpassed one million installs and has launched APIs aimed at companies that “can’t afford to get weather wrong.” It has also partnered with an unnamed long-term forecasting firm, supplying near-term data to improve broader climate models.

The founding team brings a track record of exits in applied AI. CEO Yuriy Melnichek previously founded AIMatter, acquired by Google, as well as consumer apps later bought by Pinterest and Farfetch. Matveenko previously sold mapping startup MapData to Mapbox.

Alongside its commercial products, the team also runs weatherindex.ai, an open-source project that evaluates short-term precipitation forecasts from major providers in real time. The tool compares live forecasts against verified airport weather reports, using standard accuracy metrics. It’s an unusual move in an industry not known for transparent benchmarking.

For Rainbow Weather, that openness is part of the pitch. The company is betting that as climate volatility increases, users and businesses will care less about next week’s weather and more about what happens in the next hour, and whether the forecast can be trusted.

Rainbow Weather is a next-gen climate tech startup for ultra-accurate short-term forecasts founded in 2021 by Yuriy Melnichek, who previously built AIMatter (acquired by Google), a neural network-based AI platform, as well as the video creation and editing app Vochi (acquired by Pinterest), and fashion marketplace Wanna (acquired by Farfetch), and Alexander Matveenko, a founder of artificial intelligence mapping startup MapData that he sold to Mapbox in 2017.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">London-based AI video startup Synthesia has raised $200 million in a Series E round, nearly doubling its valuation to around $4 billion and cementing its position as one of Europe’s most valuable AI companies.

The round was led by Google Ventures, with participation from existing investors, underscoring continued appetite for applied AI products that have already found a clear commercial use.

Synthesia builds generative AI tools that let companies create videos using AI-generated avatars instead of cameras, studios, or presenters. The technology has found a strong foothold in corporate training, internal communications, and product explainers, areas where speed, scale, and consistency often matter more than production gloss.

“Synthesia was founded on two core beliefs: first, that AI will bring the cost of content creation down to zero. And secondly, that AI video provides a better, more engaging way for organizations to communicate and learn,” said Victor Riparbelli, Synthesia’s co-founder and CEO.

Synthesia says a significant share of Fortune 100 companies now use its platform, a rare level of enterprise penetration for a European AI startup at this stage. Rather than chasing consumer virality, the company has built its business around predictable, high-value enterprise use cases, a strategy investors have increasingly rewarded over the past year.

The funding comes at a moment when enthusiasm around generative AI has shifted from experimentation to execution. Enterprises are no longer asking whether AI video works, but how reliably it can plug into existing workflows.

Synthesia’s pitch is that AI-generated video should be as routine as slides or documents, created quickly, updated easily, and deployed globally without production bottlenecks.

At a $4 billion valuation, Synthesia joins a small group of European AI companies that have managed to scale beyond regional relevance.

Its rise also highlights a broader pattern: applied AI startups, focused on specific business functions rather than general-purpose models, are attracting some of the largest growth rounds in the market.

For the UK tech ecosystem, the deal is another signal that London remains a serious hub for commercial AI, even as regulatory debates continue around model safety, copyright, and synthetic media.

Synthesia has previously positioned itself as cautious about misuse, building safeguards around consent and disclosure for its avatars, a stance that may become more important as scrutiny of AI-generated content increases.

The challenge ahead is less about proving demand and more about maintaining trust and differentiation as competitors multiply.

But with deep enterprise adoption, a clear product focus, and backing from one of Silicon Valley’s most influential investors, Synthesia is entering its next phase with momentum firmly on its side.
