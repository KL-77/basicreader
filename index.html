            <div id="article-text">Welcome to Edition 8.27 of the Rocket Report! If all goes well this weekend, NASA will complete a wet dress rehearsal test of the Space Launch System rocket in Florida. This is the final key test, in which the rocket is fueled and brought to within seconds of engine ignition, before the liftoff of the Artemis II mission. This is set to occur no earlier than February 6. Ars will have full coverage of the test this weekend.

Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.

Why did the UK abandon Orbex? European Spaceflight explores the recent announcement that British launch company Orbex is preparing to sell the business to The Exploration Company in close cooperation with the UK government. This represents a reversal from early 2025, when the United Kingdom appeared prepared to back Orbex as a means of using British rockets to launch British satellites into space. Now the government is prepared to walk away. So what happened? “There are still too many unknowns to count, and the story is far from told,” the publication states.

Why would someone want to buy Orbex? … My sense is that there is not too much of a mystery here. UK space officials probably looked under the hood of what hardware Orbex had developed and its current financial status and likely decided that the company had a low probability of reaching orbit even with a significant infusion of cash. Also curious is a decision by The Exploration Company, which builds spaceships, to consider acquiring Orbex. The European Spaceflight article speculates that this could be to capture funding through the UK’s share of the European Launch Challenge, rather than any faith in Orbex’s ability to launch its vehicles. That sounds plausible.

Canada Rocket Company emerges from stealth. A Toronto-based launch startup, Canada Rocket Company, emerged from stealth earlier this month with the announcement of a $6.2 million CDN ($4.5 million) seed funding round—and with plans to create sovereign light- and medium-lift launch capabilities, Payload reports. According to CEO Hugh Kolias, the company was founded late last year in response to Canada’s rapidly increasing investment in the space domain.

A quick deadline … Canada is concerned about relations with the United States, where it has long turned for access to space. Accordingly, last November, the country announced its Launch the North challenge, committing $105 million CDN ($75.7 million) in public funds to help stand up sovereign launch capabilities. However,  the Launch the North challenge incentivizes companies that are on track to reach orbit by 2028. The new company’s strategy to meet the aggressive 2028 deadline is to build a scalable architecture around a familiar methalox engine and field much of the tech with mature subsystems from the Canadian and European ecosystem.

Vega C nabs Brazilian launch contract. A Brazilian government agency will launch an Earth observation satellite on a Vega C rocket, Space News reports. Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research, known by the Portuguese acronym INPE, said Tuesday it will launch the Amazonia-1B satellite on a Vega C in 2027. Curiously, INPE contracted not with Avio, which is assuming responsibility for Vega C launch services, but with SpaceLaunch, a Texas-based launch broker.

Launch price disclosed … Marcy Mabry, co-founder and chief executive of SpaceLaunch, said she previously worked with INPE to arrange the launch of Amazonia-1 while at Spaceflight, a launch services provider later acquired by Firefly Aerospace. That spacecraft launched on an Indian PSLV rocket in 2021. The companies did not disclose the value of the contract. However, a January 21 Brazilian procurement document states that the contract between INPE and SpaceLaunch is worth 188.2 million Brazilian real ($35.6 million). This is a rare public data point for the cost of a Vega launch.

Russia reportedly testing plasma engine. Indian Defence Review reports that Russia is testing a new plasma propulsion system that may accelerate future missions to Mars, reducing travel time from multiple months to just one or two. The engine, developed by Rosatom’s Troitsk Institute, is now in ground-based trials but could be space-ready by 2030. The propulsion system uses electromagnetic fields to accelerate hydrogen particles.

Is it real? … According to the publication, a prototype of the engine is operating at 300 kilowatts, and it has already demonstrated a service life of 2,400 hours. If so, the engine has already surpassed the experimental VASIMR electrothermal engine under development in Houston by former NASA astronaut Franklin Chang-Diaz. Regardless, I would advise caution about engines that may work in the lab but struggle in the outerspace environment. Moreover, such achievements are likely to be hyped, so it’s difficult to know where reality lies in Russia. (submitted by tbnelson777)

SpaceX and xAI may merge. Elon Musk’s SpaceX and xAI are in discussions to merge ahead of a blockbuster public offering planned for later this year, Reuters reports. The plan would give ‌fresh momentum to SpaceX’s effort to launch data centers into orbit as Musk battles for supremacy in the rapidly escalating AI race against tech giants like Google, Meta, and OpenAI. Under the proposed merger, shares of xAI would be exchanged for shares in SpaceX. Two entities have been set up in Nevada to facilitate the transaction.

Is this inevitable? … SpaceX is already the world’s most valuable privately held company, last valued at $800 billion in a recent insider share sale. xAI was valued at $230 billion in November, according to The Wall Street Journal. Musk has previously confirmed that SpaceX plans to go public sometime this year, with a valuation expected above $1 trillion. Speaking in Davos, Switzerland, last week, Musk said, “The lowest cost place to put AI will be in space. And that will be true within two years, maybe three at the latest.”

How a 5-ton satellite fell off a Japanese rocket. The H3 is a relatively new vehicle, with last month’s launch marking the eighth flight of Japan’s flagship rocket. It lifted off from Tanegashima Island in southern Japan on December 22, local time, carrying a roughly 5-ton navigation satellite into space. The rocket was supposed to place the Michibiki 5 satellite into an orbit ranging more than 20,000 miles above the Earth. Everything was going well until the H3 jettisoned its payload fairing, the two-piece clamshell covering the satellite during launch, nearly four minutes into the flight.

And then? … Something went wrong when the rocket released its payload shroud. Video beamed back from the rocket’s onboard cameras showed a shower of debris surrounding the satellite, which started wobbling and leaning in the moments after fairing separation. Sensors also detected sudden accelerations around the attachment point connecting the spacecraft with the top of the H3 rocket. In a new report, Ars explores new information released by JAXA that shows the satellite effectively fell off the rocket. It appears to be an entirely novel failure mechanism.

FAA expects continuing growth in launches. The Federal Aviation Administration office that regulates commercial spaceflight expects continued growth in launches, Space News reports. Speaking at the Global Spaceport Alliance’s Spaceport Summit on January 27, Minh Nguyen, deputy associate administrator for commercial space transportation at the FAA, said his office licensed 205 operations in 2025, including launches and reentries, a 25 percent increase from 2024.

Double again in a few years … “The acceleration in commercial space transportation has consistently exceeded our expectations. We’re seeing remarkable growth year after year,” he said. The 2025 total, he added, was 12 percent above the high end of the FAA’s forecast for the year. The FAA expects that growth to continue, with projections showing the number of licensed operations could double by 2029. That growth has put pressure on the FAA’s Office of Commercial Space Transportation, known as AST, to keep up with the increased cadence.

ESA to study Falcon 9 breakup over Poland. The European Space Agency has published a call to tender for a study examining the reentry and breakup of a SpaceX Falcon 9 upper stage in February last year, European Spaceflight reports. In the early hours of February 19, 2025, a Falcon 9 second stage underwent an uncontrolled atmospheric re-entry over Poland. At least four fragments of the stage survived re-entry and landed in various locations across the country. While no one was injured and no property was damaged, at least one fragment landed in a populated area.

Not just an academic study … ESA hopes to use data collected during the reentry of the Falcon 9 upper stage over Poland to help predict the risks associated with the re-entry of elongated upper stages. There are currently considerable uncertainties surrounding the physics and dynamics of destructive reentry in the very low-Earth orbit regime, below 150km. It’s not an academic study, as in 2015 there were approximately 80 orbital rocket launches. A decade on, that figure has almost quadrupled, with 317 successful orbital rocket launches occurring in 2025. (submitted  by EllPeaTea)

SpaceX targets mid-March for next Starship launch. The company plans to launch Starship’s next test flight in six weeks, SpaceX founder Elon Musk said Sunday, January 25, Space.com reports. The flight will be the 12th overall for Starship but the first of the bigger, more powerful, and much-anticipated “Version 3” (V3) iteration of the vehicle.

A better engine … Starship V3 is slightly taller than V2—408.1 feet (124.4 meters) vs. 403.9 feet (123.1 m), but considerably more powerful. V3 can loft more than 100 tons of payload to low-Earth orbit, compared to about 35 tons for V2, according to Musk. The increased brawn comes courtesy of Raptor 3, a new variant of the engine that will fly for the first time on the upcoming test mission. SpaceX is hoping it proves more reliable than V2 as well.

Seeking information about Challenger artifacts. Back in 2010, Robert Pearlman of CollectSpace bought a batch of 18 space shuttle-era “Remove Before Flight” tags on eBay. It was only later that he pieced together that these tags were, in fact, removed from the external tank of STS 51-L, the ill-fated flight of space shuttle Challenger in 1986. He wrote about the experience on Ars.

How did they get to eBay? … “When the tags were first identified, contacts at NASA and Lockheed, among others, were unable to explain how they ended up on eBay and, ultimately, with me,” Pearlman said. He wants to gather more information about the provenance of the tags so that he can donate them to museums, with their full backstory.

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-30</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It took Android devicemakers a very long time to commit to long-term update support. Samsung and Google have only recently decided to offer seven years of updates for their flagship Android devices, but a decade ago, you were lucky to get more than one or two updates on even the most expensive Android phones and tablets. How is it, then, that an Android-powered set-top box from 2015 is still going strong?

Nvidia released the first Shield Android TV in 2015, and according to the company’s senior VP of hardware engineering, Andrew Bell, supporting these devices has been a labor of love. And the team at Nvidia still loves the Shield. Bell assures us that Nvidia has never given up, even when it looked like support for the Shield was waning, and it doesn’t plan to stop any time soon.

Gaming has been central to Nvidia since its start, and that focus gave rise to the Shield. “Pretty much everybody who worked at Nvidia in the early days really wanted to make a game console,” said Bell, who has worked at the company for 25 years.

However, Nvidia didn’t have what it needed back then. Before gaming, crypto, and AI turned it into the multi-trillion-dollar powerhouse it is today, Nvidia had a startup mentality and the budget to match. When Shield devices began percolating in the company’s labs, it was seen as an important way to gain experience with “full-stack” systems and all the complications that arise when managing them.

“To build a game console was pretty complicated because, of course, you have to have a GPU, which we know how to make,” Bell explained. “But in addition to that, you need a CPU, an OS, games, and you need a UI.”

Through acquisitions and partnerships, the pieces of Nvidia’s fabled game console slowly fell into place. The purchase of PortalPlayer in 2007 brought the CPU technology that would become the Tegra Arm chips, and the company’s surging success in GPUs gave it the partnerships it needed to get games. But the UI was still missing—that didn’t change until Google expanded Android to the TV in 2014. The company’s first Android mobile efforts were already out there in the form of the Shield Portable and Shield Tablet, but the TV-connected box is what Nvidia really wanted.

“Selfishly, a little bit, we built Shield for ourselves,” Bell told Ars Technica. “We actually wanted a really good TV streamer that was high-quality and high-performance, and not necessarily in the Apple ecosystem. We built some prototypes, and we got so excited about it. [CEO Jensen Huang] was like, ‘Why don’t we bring it out and sell it to people?’”

The first Shield box in 2015 had a heavy gaming focus, with a raft of both local and cloud-based (GeForce Now) games. The base model included only a game controller, with the remote control sold separately. According to Bell, Nvidia eventually recognized that the gaming angle wasn’t as popular as it had hoped. The 2017 and 2019 Shield refreshes were more focused on the streaming experience.

“Eventually, we kind of said, ‘Maybe the soul is that it’s a streamer for gamers,’” said Bell. “We understand gamers from GeForce, and we understand they care about quality and performance. A lot of these third-party devices like tablets, they’re going cheap. Set-top boxes, they’re going cheap. But we were the only company that was like, ‘Let’s go after people who really want a premium experience.’”

And premium it is, offering audio and video support far beyond what you find in other TV boxes, even years after release. The Shield TV started at $200 in 2015, and that’s still what you’ll pay for the Pro model to this day. However, Bell notes that passion was the driving force behind bringing the Shield TV to market. The team didn’t know if it would make money, and indeed, the company lost money on every unit sold during the original production run. The 2017 and 2019 refreshes were about addressing that while also emphasizing the Shield’s streaming media chops.

Update support for Internet-connected devices is vital—whether they’re phones, tablets, set-top boxes, or something else. When updates cease, gadgets fall out of sync with platform features, leading to new bugs (which will never be fixed) and security holes that can affect safety and functionality. The support guarantee attached to a device is basically its expiration date.

“We were all frustrated as buyers of phones and tablets that you buy a device, you get one or two updates, and that’s it!” said Bell. “Early on when we were building Shield TV, we decided we were going to make it for a long time. Jensen and I had a discussion, and it was, ‘How long do we want to support this thing?’ And Jensen said, ‘For as long as we shall live.’”

In 2025, Nvidia wrapped up its tenth year of supporting the Shield platform. Even those original 2015 boxes are still being maintained with bug fixes and the occasional new feature. They’ve gone all the way from Android 5.0 to Android 11 in that time. No Android device—not a single phone, tablet, watch, or streaming box—has gotten anywhere close to this level of support.

The best example of Nvidia’s passion for support is, believe it or not, a two-year gap in updates.

Across the dozens of Shield TV updates, there have been a few times when fans feared Nvidia was done with the box. Most notably, there were no public updates for the Shield TV in 2023 or 2024, but over-the-air updates resumed in 2025.

“On the outside, it looked like we went quiet, but it’s actually one of our bigger development efforts,” explained Bell.

The origins of that effort, surprisingly, stretch back years to the launch of the Nintendo Switch. The Shield runs Nvidia’s custom Tegra X1 Arm chip, the same processor Nintendo chose to power the original Switch in 2017. Soon after release, modders discovered a chip flaw that could bypass Nintendo’s security measures, enabling homebrew (and piracy). An updated Tegra X1 chip (also used in the 2019 Shield refresh) fixed that for Nintendo, but Nvidia’s 2015 and 2017 Shield boxes ran the same exploitable version.

Initially, Nvidia was able to roll out periodic patches to protect against the vulnerability, but by 2023, the Shield needed something more. Around that time, owners of 2015 and 2017 Shield boxes had noticed that DRM-protected 4K content often failed to play—that was thanks to the same bug that affected the Switch years earlier.

With a newer, non-vulnerable product on the market, many companies might have just accepted that the older product would lose functionality, but Nvidia’s passion for Shield remained. Bell consulted Huang, whom he calls Shield customer No. 1, about the meaning of his “as long as we shall live” pledge, and the team was approved to spend whatever time was need to fix the vulnerability on the first two generations of Shield TV.

According to Bell, it took about 18 months to get there, requiring the creation of an entirely new security stack. He explains that Android updates aren’t actually that much work compared to DRM security, and some of its partners weren’t that keen on re-certifying older products. The Shield team fought for it because they felt, as they had throughout the product’s run, that they’d made a promise to customers who expected the box to have certain features.

In February 2025, Nvidia released Shield Patch 9.2, the first wide release in two years. The changelog included an unassuming line reading, “Added security enhancement for 4K DRM playback.” That was the Tegra X1 bug finally being laid to rest on the 2015 and 2017 Shield boxes.

The refreshed Tegra X1+ in the 2019 Shield TV spared it from those DRM issues, and Nvidia still hasn’t stopped working on that chip. The Tegra X1 was blazing fast in 2015, and it’s still quite capable compared to your average smart TV today. The chip has actually outlasted several of the components needed to manufacture it. For example, when the Tegra chip’s memory was phased out, the team immediately began work on qualifying a new memory supplier. To this day, Nvidia is still iterating on the Tegra X1 platform, supporting the Shield’s continued updates.

“If operations calls me and says they just ran out of this component, I’ve got engineers on it tonight looking for a new component,” Bell said.

Nvidia has put its money where its mouth is by supporting all versions of the Shield for so long. But it’s been over six years since we’ve seen new hardware. Surely the Shield has to be running out of steam, right?

Not so, says Bell. Nvidia still manufactures the 2019 Shield because people are still buying it. In fact, the sales volume has remained basically unchanged for the past 10 years. The Shield Pro is a spendy step-top box at $200, so Nvidia has experimented with pricing and promotion with little effect. The 2019 non-Pro Shield was one such effort. The base model was originally priced at $99, but the MSRP eventually landed at $150.

“No matter how much we dropped the price or how much we market or don’t market it, the same number of people come out of the woodwork every week to buy Shield,” Bell explained.

That kind of consistency isn’t lost on Nvidia. Bell says the company has no plans to stop production or updates for the Shield “any time soon.” It’s also still possible that Nvidia could release new Shield TV hardware in the future. Nvidia’s Shield devices came about as a result of engineers tinkering with new concepts in a lab setting, but most of those experiments never see the light of day. For example, Bell notes that the team produced several updated versions of the Shield Tablet and Shield Portable (some of which you can find floating around on eBay) that never got a retail release, and they continue to work on Shield TV.

“We’re always playing in the labs, trying to discover new things,” said Bell. “We’ve played with new concepts for Shield and we’ll continue to play, and if we find something we’re super-excited about, we’ll probably make a go of it.”

But what would that look like? Video technology has advanced since 2019, leaving the Shield unable to take full advantage of some newer formats. First up would be support for VP9 Profile 2 hardware decoding, which enables HDR video on YouTube. Bell says a refreshed Shield would also prioritize formats like AV1 and the HDR 10+ standard, as well as support for newer Dolby Vision profiles for people with backed-up media.

And then there’s the enormous, easy-to-press-by-accident Netflix button on the remote. While adding new video technologies would be job one, fixing the Netflix button is No. 2 for a theoretical new Shield. According to Bell, Nvidia doesn’t receive any money from Netflix for the giant button on its remote. It’s actually there as a requirement of Netflix’s certification program, which was “very strong” in 2019. In a refresh, he thinks Nvidia could get away with a smaller “N” button. We can only hope.

But does Bell think he’ll get a chance to build that new Shield TV, shrunken Netflix button and all? He stopped short of predicting the future, but there’s definitely interest.

“We talk about it all the time—I’d love to,” he said.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Having a health insurance plan with a high deductible could not only cost you—it could also kill you.

A new study in JAMA Network Open found that people who faced those high out-of-pocket costs as well as a cancer diagnosis had worse overall survival and cancer-specific survival than those with more standard health plans.

The findings, while perhaps not surprising, are a stark reminder of the fraught decisions Americans face as the price of health care only continues to rise and more people try to offset costs by accepting insurance plans with higher deductibles—that is, higher out-of-pocket costs they have to pay before their health insurance provider starts paying its share.

The issue is particularly critical right now for people who have insurance plans through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Prices for those plans have skyrocketed this year after Congress failed to extend critical tax credits. Without those credits, monthly premiums for ACA plans have, on average, more than doubled. Early data on ACA enrollments for 2026 not only suggests that fewer people are signing up for the plans, but also that those who are enrolling are often choosing bronze plans, which are high-deductible plans.

In the study, researchers considered plans to be “high-deductible health plans” (HDHPs) if their deductibles were at least $1,200 to $1,350 for individuals or $2,400 to $2,700 for families between 2011 and 2018 (with the cutoffs increasing within the ranges during that time). For context, the average individual deductible for an ACA bronze plan in 2026 is about $7,500, according to KFF.

Based on previous data, such high out-of-pocket costs are known to lead people to delay or decrease health care—they may skip doctor visits, put off diagnostics, and avoid treatments. But for the new study, researchers led by Justin Barnes at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, wanted to know, more directly, if the plans were linked to lower survival—specifically for cancer patients, who obviously need more care than others.

The study used health survey data from a nationally representative group of over 147,000 people. In all, nearly 9,800 had been diagnosed with cancer, and of those, around 2,300 had HDHPs. Another group of over 37,000 who had not been diagnosed with cancer also had HDHPs. Adjusting for demographic factors and health status, cancer patients on an HDHP had a lower overall survival rate (46 percent higher risk of death) and lower cancer-specific survival rate (34 percent higher risk of death) than people on standard-deductible plans. In further analyses, the researchers found that, for cancer patients, whether their HDHP had a health savings account (HSA) did not make a difference. In survey responses, cancer patients on HDHPs reported more financial worry than people on standard plans.

By contrast, people on an HDHP who did not have a cancer diagnosis did not have lower survival rates than people on other plans, suggesting that the plans might not affect your survival as long as you don’t have any serious health conditions, such as cancer.

Barnes and his colleagues conclude, “In the current political environment, in which there may be proliferation of HDHPs, these results suggest that HDHP proliferation could exacerbate adverse cancer outcomes. These data underscore the importance of educating patients with cancer about potential (increased) need for health care utilization, educating the public about potential risks of HDHPs, identifying policy solutions to decrease costs of care, and optimizing health policies to avoid disincentives for seeking what may turn out to be necessary and lifesaving or life-prolonging care.”</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/us-spy-satellite-agency-declassifies-high-flying-cold-war-listening-post/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The National Reconnaissance Office, the agency overseeing the US government’s fleet of spy satellites, has declassified a decades-old program used to eavesdrop on the Soviet Union’s military communication signals.

The program was codenamed Jumpseat, and its existence was already public knowledge through leaks and contemporary media reports. What’s new is the NRO’s description of the program’s purpose and development and pictures of the satellites themselves.

In a statement, the NRO called Jumpseat “the United States’ first-generation, highly elliptical orbit (HEO) signals-collection satellite.”

Eight Jumpseat satellites launched from 1971 through 1987, when the US government considered the very existence of the National Reconnaissance Office a state secret. Jumpseat satellites operated until 2006. Their core mission was “monitoring adversarial offensive and defensive weapon system development,” the NRO said. “Jumpseat collected electronic emissions and signals, communication intelligence, as well as foreign instrumentation intelligence.”

Data intercepted by the Jumpseat satellites flowed to the Department of Defense, the National Security Agency, and “other national security elements,” the NRO said.

The Soviet Union was the primary target for Jumpseat intelligence collections. The satellites flew in highly elliptical orbits ranging from a few hundred miles up to 24,000 miles (39,000 kilometers) above the Earth. The satellites’ flight paths were angled such that they reached apogee, the highest point of their orbits, over the far Northern Hemisphere. Satellites travel slowest at apogee, so the Jumpseat spacecraft loitered high over the Arctic, Russia, Canada, and Greenland for most of the 12 hours it took them to complete a loop around the Earth.

This trajectory gave the Jumpseat satellites persistent coverage over the Arctic and the Soviet Union, which first realized the utility of such an orbit. The Soviet government began launching communication and early warning satellites into the same type of orbit a few years before the first Jumpseat mission launched in 1971. The Soviets called the orbit Molniya, the Russian word for lightning.

The name Jumpseat was first revealed in a 1986 book by the investigative journalist Seymour Hersh on the Soviet Union’s 1983 shoot-down of Korean Air Lines Flight 007. Hersh wrote that the Jumpseat satellites could “intercept all kinds of communications,” including voice messages between Soviet ground personnel and pilots.

“The historical significance of Jumpseat cannot be understated,” said James Outzen, NRO director of the Center for the Study of National Reconnaissance. “Its orbit provided the US a new vantage point for the collection of unique and critical signals intelligence from space.”

Jumpseat was “perhaps the most mysterious” of the NRO’s high-altitude surveillance satellites in its era, space historians Dwayne Day and Nicholas Watkins wrote in a 2020 article published in the Space Review. Day and Watkins wrote that the Jumpseat satellites “pushed the state of the art in terms of payloads, antennas, and satellite design.”

Now, we know exactly what the satellites looked like. They were built by Hughes Aircraft company, which specialized in producing satellites using spin motion to stabilize themselves. Therefore, the drum-like shape of the Jumpseat satellites in the newly declassified photos is no big surprise. The exact appearance of the antenna structure on the upper deck of the Jumpseat spacecraft was not public knowledge. The upper deck had a device to counter the satellite’s spin, allowing the antennas to point toward radio sources.

An illustration released by the NRO shows that the satellites carried a 13-foot antenna to intercept radio signals, somewhat smaller than prior open source estimates of the antenna’s size. The NRO has not disclosed precisely what kinds of signals the Jumpseat satellites intercepted, but Day and Watkins wrote in 2020 that an early justification for the program was to monitor Soviet radars, which some analysts might have interpreted as part of a secret anti-ballistic missile system to guard against a US strike.

The authors presented evidence that the Jumpseat also likely hosted infrared sensors to monitor Soviet missile tests and provide early warning of a potential Soviet missile attack. The NRO did not mention this possible secondary mission in the Jumpseat declassification memo.

Chris Scolese, director of the NRO, formally declassified “certain limited facts” associated with the Jumpseat program in December. The NRO made the information public in a press release on Wednesday. Scolese wrote that the declassification was “consistent with provisions” of an executive order signed by former President Barack Obama in 2009 that set guidelines for how and when to classify and declassify national security information.

“I have concluded that publicly acknowledging limited facts will not cause harm to our current and future satellite systems,” Scolese wrote in the Jumpseat declassification memorandum, dated December 4. “Additionally, acknowledging the program is consistent with our obligation to the American public to be both open and transparent where possible through declassification of historic programs.”

The NRO will evaluate a more complete declassification for the Jumpseat program “as time and resources permit,” Scolese wrote. He acknowledged that unclassified commercial ventures now operate signals intelligence, or SIGINT, satellites “whose capabilities are comparable if not superior to Jumpseat.”

The Jumpseat satellites were developed in partnership with the Air Force through a program called Project Earpop. The government’s first electronic surveillance satellites flew in low-Earth orbit, where they spent less than 15 minutes in range of Soviet territory on each pass.

The NRO and the Air Force launched the Jumpseat satellites aboard Titan IIIB rockets from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. The agency said Jumpseat was a “foundational program” for the NRO’s subsequent highly elliptical orbit satellite programs. According to public sources, the NRO began launching a new generation of high-altitude eavesdropping satellites called Trumpet in 1994, but details remain classified.

The NRO has also launched a separate series of eavesdropping satellites in geosynchronous orbit over the equator with enormous mesh antennas, along with bus-sized Earth-pointing telescopes capable of viewing any location in the world. These satellites are among the largest in orbit, requiring heavy-lift rockets to get them to their observation posts.

Jumpseat satellites were much smaller, weighing between half a ton and one ton at launch.

The disclosure of the Jumpseat program follows the declassification of several other Cold War-era spy satellites. They include the CIA’s Corona series of photo reconnaissance satellites from the 1960s, which the government officially acknowledged 30 years later. The NRO declassified in 2011 two more optical spy satellite programs, codenamed Gambit and Hexagon, which launched from the 1960s through the 1980s. Most recently, the NRO revealed a naval surveillance program called Parcae in 2023.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Complaining about Windows 11 is a popular sport among tech enthusiasts on the Internet, whether you’re publicly switching to Linux, publishing guides about the dozens of things you need to do to make the OS less annoying, or getting upset because you were asked to sign in to an app after clicking a sign-in button.

Despite the negativity surrounding the current version of Windows, it remains the most widely used operating system on the world’s desktop and laptop computers, and people usually prefer to stick to what they’re used to. As a result, Windows 11 has just cleared a big milestone—Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on the company’s most recent earnings call (via The Verge) that Windows 11 now has over 1 billion users worldwide.

Windows 11 also reached that milestone just a few months quicker than Windows 10 did—1,576 days after its initial public launch on October 5, 2021. Windows 10 took 1,692 days to reach the same milestone, based on its July 29, 2015, general availability date and Microsoft’s announcement on March 16, 2020.

That’s especially notable because Windows 10 was initially offered as a free upgrade to all users of Windows 7 and Windows 8, with no change in system requirements relative to those older versions. Windows 11 was (and still is) a free upgrade to Windows 10, but its relatively high system requirements mean there are plenty of Windows 10 PCs that aren’t eligible to run Windows 11.

It’s hard to gauge how many PCs are still running Windows 10 because public data on the matter is unreliable. But we can still make educated guesses—and it’s clear that the software is still running on hundreds of millions of PCs, despite hitting its official end-of-support date last October.

StatCounter, one popularly referenced source that collects OS and browser usage stats from web analytics data, reports that between 50 and 55 percent of Windows PCs worldwide are running Windows 11, and between 40 and 45 percent of them run Windows 10. StatCounter also reports that Windows 10 and Windows 7 usage have risen slightly over the last few months, which highlights the noisiness of the data. But as of late 2025, Dell COO Jeffrey Clarke said that there were still roughly 1 billion active Windows 10 PCs in use, around 500 million of which weren’t eligible for an upgrade because of hardware requirements. If Windows 11 just cleared the 1 billion user mark, that suggests StatCounter’s reporting of a nearly evenly split user base isn’t too far from the truth.

Although Windows 11’s reputation could be part of the reason for Windows 10’s tenacity, it’s easy to explain away the older OS’s continuing popularity in other ways. Just a few years ago, Windows 10 was the most ubiquitous version of Windows since XP, and when Windows 11 launched, its requirements mostly excluded PCs older than three or four years.

Because it would be catastrophic if all of those Windows 10 PCs completely stopped getting security patches or anti-malware protection, Microsoft has built a three-year off-ramp for the operating system—one year of free (but opt-in) security updates for consumer PCs, up to three years of paid security updates for businesses and other large institutions, and updates to and basic support for core apps like Windows Defender, Microsoft Office, and Microsoft Edge through at least 2028.

Microsoft executives are at least paying lip service to Windows 11’s real and perceived reputational issues. Pavan Davuluri, Microsoft’s president of Windows and devices, said in a statement to The Verge that the company would be “swarming” engineers over the next few months to “urgently fix Windows 11’s performance and reliability issues” and to modernize more of the barely buried parts of the operating system that still look a lot like they did in Windows 7 or XP or NT.

Assuming those issues are addressed—and that Microsoft can fix them without adding fun new bugs along the way—it would fix some of what ails Windows 11. But Davuluri didn’t acknowledge the aspects of Windows 11 that make it annoying even when it’s working as designed: the mandatory Microsoft account sign-in prompts, the continual reminders and upsell notifications about OneDrive, Game Pass, and other Microsoft services, and the periodic reminders to use Edge and Bing that come back no matter how many times they’re dismissed.

People are definitely switching to and using Windows 11. For people already used to Windows 10, it’s still the software update of least resistance. What Microsoft needs to do now is ensure that Windows 11 doesn’t frustrate people so much that it’s the last version of Windows they use.</div>

            <h2>How often do AI chatbots lead users down a harmful path?</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/how-often-do-ai-chatbots-lead-users-down-a-harmful-path/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At this point, we’ve all heard plenty of stories about AI chatbots leading users to harmful actions, harmful beliefs, or simply incorrect information. Despite the prevalence of these stories, though, it’s hard to know just how often users are being manipulated. Are these tales of AI harms anecdotal outliers or signs of a frighteningly common problem?

Anthropic took a stab at answering that question this week, releasing a paper studying the potential for what it calls “disempowering patterns” across 1.5 million anonymized real-world conversations with its Claude AI model. While the results show that these kinds of manipulative patterns are relatively rare as a percentage of all AI conversations, they still represent a potentially large problem on an absolute basis.

In the newly published paper “Who’s in Charge? Disempowerment Patterns in Real-World LLM Usage,” researchers from Anthropic and the University of Toronto try to quantify the potential for a specific set of “user disempowering” harms by identifying three primary ways that a chatbot can negatively impact a user’s thoughts or actions:

To figure out when a chatbot conversation has the potential to move a user along one of these lines, Anthropic ran nearly 1.5 million Claude conversations through Clio, an automated analysis tool and classification system (tested to make sure it lined up with a smaller subsample of human classifications). That analysis found a “severe risk” of disempowerment potential in anything from 1 in 1,300 conversations (for “reality distortion”) to 1 in 6,000 conversations (for “action distortion”).

While these worst outcomes are relatively rare on a proportional basis, the researchers note that “given the sheer number of people who use AI, and how frequently it’s used, even a very low rate affects a substantial number of people.” And the numbers get considerably worse when you consider conversations with at least a “mild” potential for disempowerment, which occurred in between 1 in 50 and 1 in 70 conversations (depending on the type of disempowerment).

What’s more, the potential for disempowering conversations with Claude appears to have grown significantly between late 2024 and late 2025. While the researchers couldn’t pin down a single reason for this increase, they guessed that it could be tied to users becoming “more comfortable discussing vulnerable topics or seeking advice” as AI gets more popular and integrated into society.

In the study, the researchers acknowledged that studying the text of Claude conversations only measures “disempowerment potential rather than confirmed harm” and “relies on automated assessment of inherently subjective phenomena.” Ideally, they write, future research could utilize user interviews or randomized controlled trials to measure these harms more directly.

That said, the research includes several troubling examples where the text of the conversations clearly implies real-world harms. Claude would sometimes reinforce “speculative or unfalsifiable claims” with encouragement (e.g., “CONFIRMED,” “EXACTLY,” “100%”), which, in some cases, led to users “build[ing] increasingly elaborate narratives disconnected from reality.”

Claude’s encouragement could also lead to users “sending confrontational messages, ending relationships, or drafting public announcements,” the researchers write. In many cases, users who sent AI-drafted messages later expressed regret in conversations with Claude, using phrases like “It wasn’t me” and “You made me do stupid things.”

While harmful patterns in Claude’s outputs are a big problem, the researchers also point out that the users most likely to be affected are “not being passively manipulated.” On the contrary, the researchers suggest disempowered users are usually actively asking Claude to take over for their own reasoning or judgment and often accepting Claude’s suggestions “with minimal pushback.”

The researchers identified four major “amplifying factors” that can make users more likely to accept Claude’s advice unquestioningly. These include when a user is particularly vulnerable due to a crisis or disruption in their life (which occurs in about 1 in 300 Claude conversations); when a user has formed a close personal attachment to Claude (1 in 1,200); when a user appears dependent on AI for day-to-day tasks (1 in 2,500); or when a user treats Claude as a definitive authority (1 in 3,900).

Anthropic is also quick to link this new research to its previous work on sycophancy, noting that “sycophantic validation” is “the most common mechanism for reality distortion potential.” While Anthropic says its models have been getting less sycophantic overall, many of the worst “disempowerment” examples they found are a direct result of the “most extreme cases” of sycophancy in the dataset.

That said, the researchers also try to make clear that, when it comes to swaying core beliefs via chatbot conversation, it takes two to tango. “The potential for disempowerment emerges as part of an interaction dynamic between the user and Claude,” they write. “Users are often active participants in the undermining of their own autonomy: projecting authority, delegating judgment, accepting outputs without question in ways that create a feedback loop with Claude.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft is taking a pounding in the stock market.

On Thursday, the Redmont giant’s share price collapsed by nearly 12 percent after it released its latest quarterly results, making it not only its biggest single day slide since March 2020, according to Bloomberg, but also one of the worst drops in the company’s history.

The Wile E. Coyote-worthy cliff-plunge, which wiped out over $400 billion in valuation, was despite Microsoft actually exceeding some key expectations, including its net income, which rose by 23 percent from the same period the year before to nearly $31 billion. Revenue also increased by 17 percent to $81.3 billion, which is about a billion more than what analysts projected.

But Microsoft’s AI spending spree has investors second-guessing its direction, and it’s striking that the lack of faith was strong enough to precipitate a historic plunge even with respectable financial growth. Overall, its total capital expenditures grew by 66 percent to a record $37.5 billion in Q4, as the company continues to splurge on building AI data centers for its Azure cloud computing business.

Azure reported a 38 percent bump in revenue, which is slightly slower than the year before, adding to investor uncertainty over whether the business will be able to reap back the tens of billions spent on its data centers. In December, The Information reported that Azure was struggling to sell the company’s autonomous “AI agents” to its business customers, with quotas being slashed by up to 50 percent.

Some analysts had predicted the stock drop, citing the uncertainty over Microsoft’s AI spending.

“Since it is becoming even more evident that Microsoft is not going to garner a strong ROI from their massive AI investment, their shares need to be revalued back down to a level that is more consistent with its historic fair value,” Matthew Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co, told Bloomberg before markets opened on Thursday.

In the latest earnings, Microsoft boasted it had more than $625 billion in contracts for its cloud business that it still needed to fulfill. Nearly half of that, though — a colossal $350 billion — is from OpenAI, raising concerns that it may be putting too many eggs in one basket. It also draws attention to how Microsoft has struggled to make an impact with its own AI products like its Copilot assistant, which was heavily based on OpenAI’s tech, and which many enthusiasts perceive as an inferior version of ChatGPT. Microsoft 365 Copilot, the business-focused version of its chatbot integrated into its apps like Word, had 15 million annual users, the company just revealed.

“As an investor, when you think about our capex, don’t just think about Azure, think about Copilot,” CEO Satya Nadella said on a call with analysts, as quoted by the Financial Times. “We don’t want to maximize just one business of ours. We want to be able to allocate capacity, while we are supply constrained, that allows us to build the best portfolio.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The crypto market has not had a cozy winter. After Bitcoin suffered some epic tumbles in November, the OG cryptocurrency had been hovering around $90,000 — until today, that is.

On Thursday, the Senate Agriculture Committee advanced a bill that would establish a federal regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. The bill’s future prospects seem dim, but it resulted in a sizable crash for Bitcoin, which fell to around $84,000 — its nadir for 2026 so far. Other prominent digital currencies like Ethereum and Doge fell it with, tumbling as much as 6 percent.

Now, as crypto analysts speculate whether further downfalls are in Bitcoin’s future, crypto bros are struggling to maintain a cohesive narrative in the face of such epic volatility. Some were frustrated that a rising tide in the stock market didn’t lift the Bitcoin boat.

“Stocks go up, crypto stays flat. Stocks go down, crypto goes down,” posted crypto guru João Leite on X-formerly-Twitter. “Amazing tech.”

Others compared Bitcoin to gold futures, which have been volatile day-to-day, but are up to record highs overall.

“Make it make sense,” another crypto poster wrote. “Gold is up 193 percent over the last 5 years and everyone and their mother is talking about buying. Bitcoin is up 146 percent over the last 5 years after a pullback and everyone and their is [sic] completely oblivious to the price. BTW #Bitcoin is actually finite unlike Gold.”

Others struggled to make any sense of the crash at all.

“None of this crypto sh*t makes sense,” one netizen ranted on the r/CryptoCurrency subreddit. “Idk how so many people get involved with it if it can just disappear like this.”

“I’m really tired of all the manipulation but I’m sure they’re doing it because they make money,” one Facebook user wrote under a post on the crash from Bitcoin Magazine. “They short it and then they go along with it and they do everything except just leave it the hell alone and let it go up over time. Very frustrating.”

            <h2>Sam Altman Says AI Will Cause Massive Deflation, Making Money Worth Vastly More</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI is betting in the biggest way possible on a future ruled by AI. It’s committing to spending well over $1 trillion to build out enormous data centers — despite business fundamentals lagging far behind, stoking fears over troubling days ahead.

During a town hall livestreamed on Monday, CEO Sam Altman admitted that the company was looking to pump the brakes, revealing that it’s looking to “dramatically slow down” hiring as the company continues to burn through billions of dollars each quarter.

At the same time, Altman remained characteristically bullish about what his company’s tech will soon offer to the world. When asked if AI can be used to “solve economic gaps that have existed for decades,” the executive argued that it’s “going to be massively deflationary.”

“Given, certainly, progress with work you can do in front of a computer, but also what looks like it will soon happen with robotics and a bunch of other things, we’re going to have massively deflationary pressure,” he predicted.

As a result of this deflationary pressure, Altman promised that things would get “radically cheaper” and the “empowerment of individual people” will go up as money becomes more valuable — which, it’s worth noting, would be an inversion of virtually every economic system in history, which have overwhelmingly been inflationary.

Altman reasoned that these economic changes would be the result of AI allowing individuals to be vastly more productive. He argued that by the end of this year, an individual spending $1,000 on inference — essentially the cost of running an AI — could complete a piece of software in a short period of time, a task that would have previously taken a whole team a much longer period.

It’s not the first time Altman has argued that AI could make money more valuable. In March, he claimed that AI will have a deflationary impact on the global economy during a closed-door Morgan Stanley conference.

The broader argument that AI could lead to an age of “abundance” in which the cost of living starts to decrease — and that we could even choose not to work if we didn’t want to — has long been deployed by tech leaders, including Altman and xAI CEO Elon Musk, to drive the AI hype cycle.

But given the current state of the economy, such a point remains little more than a daydream. The reality is that AI is still incredibly far from boosting efficiency enough to offset inflation. Just earlier today, the US Federal Reserve held interest rates steady, citing ongoing concerns over “elevated” inflation.

In fact, AI has more frequently been linked to mass layoffs that make it harder to survive. Long-term unemployment hit a four-year high earlier this year as jobseekers struggled to find new work. The cost of living has also continued to climb, particularly in larger US cities.

Whether AI will come to the rescue and dramatically bring down prices remains to be seen, as uncomfortable questions surrounding the tech’s viability linger.

Researchers have shown that AI is largely failing to boost productivity, at least in its current form. Surveys have found that the number of people using AI at work is falling, a troubling trend that flies in the face of promises made by tech leaders. Many of these workers argue that AI is essentially useless to them, despite their employers’ insistence that it’s revolutionary, productivity-boosting tech.

To AI’s many critics, it’s a dead end. Some have argued that OpenAI itself could be a house of cards that’s one run on the banks away from collapsing in on itself.

In short, there are plenty of reasons to remain skeptical of Altman’s claims that AI will put more buying power into each of our pockets as productivity goes stratospheric. He’s also gone as far as to argue that AI could cure cancer, solve climate change, and alleviate our financial struggles with “universal extreme health.”

Musk has similarly prophesied that “there will be no poverty in the future, and so no need to save money.” Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has also argued that we could one day work far less as a result of AI.

It’s an enormous bet — and Altman and his counterparts have plenty still to prove as reality continues to lag behind their lofty promises.

Even Altman himself isn’t entirely convinced that sudden abundance will actually be a good thing for the average person.

“Massively more abundance and access and massively decreased cost to be able to create new things, new companies, discover new science, whatever…” he said during this week’s town hall. “I think that should be an equalizing force in society and a way that people who have not gotten treated that fairly get a really good shot.”

“As long as we don’t screw up the policy around it in a big way,” he warned, “which could happen.”

            <h2>NASA’s Moon Spacesuits Are Plagued With Issues</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-29</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">NASA is gearing up for the first crewed journey to the Moon in over half a century, a mission that could launch as soon as two weeks from now.

And next year, the agency will finally attempt to return astronauts to the lunar surface itself as part of its Artemis 3 mission, which will dramatically increase the already considerable stakes.

Particularly when it comes to stepping out of the spacecraft — the agency has yet to pick between Blue Origin and SpaceX’s offerings in that regard — staying protected from the extreme temperature swings, space radiation, and lack of atmosphere is extremely challenging.

That’s not to mention the physical limitations of an extremely bulky spacesuit, which could physically tax astronauts even more than stepping outside of the International Space Station during a spacewalk.

As Ars Technica reports, former NASA astronaut and microbiologist Kate Rubins, who retired last year and has logged 300 days in space, recently voiced her concerns over the Moon suit that private space company Axiom Space has been developing for NASA as part of a $228 million contract.

“What I think we have on the Moon that we don’t really have on the space station that I want people to recognize is an extreme physical stress,” she said during a recent meeting of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.

Besides not getting any sleep, Rubin warned that people will be “in these suits for eight or nine hours” and doing extravehicular activities (EVAs) “every day.”

Compared to the suits NASA astronauts wore during the Apollo missions, the Axiom Space suit is considerably heavier. While a sixth of gravity will greatly alleviate some of that heft, they still weigh in at 300 pounds. At the same time, Moon walkers will enjoy greatly enhanced flexibility, allowing them to kneel down to pick up objects, for instance.

“I think the suits are better than Apollo, but I don’t think they are great right now,” Rubin warned, noting “flexibility issues” and the reality that “people are going to be falling over.”

In remarks directly to Ars, Rubin elaborated, emphasizing that the suits are “definitely much better than Apollo,” but remain “still quite heavy.”

Even something as simple as getting back up after a fall — as demonstrated by the many Apollo astronauts who took a tumble while on the Moon — involves a type of “jumping pushup,” as Rubins told Ars, which is a “non-trivial” and “risky maneuver.”

Not everybody is as concerned about the Axiom Space suit. Current NASA astronaut and physician Mike Barratt argued in remarks during the committee meeting that the “suit is getting there,” pointing out that “we’ve got 700 hours of pressurized experience in it right now.”

“Bending down in the suit is really not too bad at all,” he added.

NASA still plans to conduct plenty of tests involving the suit, including parabolic flight, which can simulate the partial gravity of the Moon’s surface. The agency has already put the suit through its paces underwater at NASA’s Neutral Buoyancy Lab.

The agency has until sometime next year to finalize the design for its long-awaited Artemis 3 mission to the lunar surface. At the same time, NASA still has plenty of decisions to make, including how to get down to the lunar surface in the first place.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine enters its fourth year, remotely-operated ground robots have become a startlingly common sight on the battlefield.

According to the defense policy think tank, the Jamestown Foundation, Ukraine has turned into a world leader in unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), allowing the country’s military to coordinate robotic warfare while reducing casualties.

Now, a video making the rounds on social media appears to show three Russian soldiers emerging from a building with their arms raised and surrendering to a robot armed with a machine gun. One of the soldiers appears to be covered in blood, adding to the sense of surreal darkness. A separate drone appears to be trained on the soldiers as well.

According to the Ukrainian military news outlet Militarnyi, the robot was a reconnaissance-strike ground unit dubbed Droid TW, built by Ukrainian defense company DevDroid. The washing machine-sized platform uses AI to autonomously identify targets and can shoot 7.62mm caliber rounds. The robot was developed at the request of the First Medical Battalion of the Ukrainian army, which was seeking a way to evacuate wounded soldiers under heavy fire — but considering the footage, the army may have found a different use for it as well.

The Jamestown Foundation noted that Ukrainian UVGs are “increasingly replacing infantry in high-risk missions, providing sustained firepower, engineering support, and resilience against electronic warfare, terrain challenges, and prolonged deployments.”

The country has had to seriously step up its game, with 40 Ukrainian defense companies producing 99 percent of UGVs domestically. As The Economist reported last year, there are around 200 different models of these robots, ranging from AI-enabled anti-drone laser guns to ground-based machine-gun platforms.

Other robots can lay down anti-tank mines, transport tons of materials for infantry on the front lines, or provide cover from the air under heavy artillery to exfiltrate injured soldiers. Some are outfitted with dozens of pounds of explosives to self-destruct near fortifications or bridges.

Ukraine is also getting a hand from Western defense companies, like German firm ARX Robotics, which is manufacturing a fleet of small tank-like UGVs.

Apart from videos of Russian soldiers surrendering, we’ve seen footage of UGVs engaging Russian armored personnel carriers. We’ve also seen other buggy-sized “Droid” UGVs, built by DevDroid, fighting with Russian infantry.

In short, the frontlines of the Russia-Ukraine war are a weird laboratory for modern warfare, which, against all odds, has given Ukraine a considerable tactical edge over its much larger adversary.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Earlier this week, news emerged that SpaceX CEO Elon Musk was considering taking his private space company public on his birthday in June at a staggering valuation of $1.5 trillion, making it easily the largest IPO in history.

Now, as Reuters reports, Musk is hoping to go one step further, merging his AI startup xAI with SpaceX ahead of the IPO — a baffling plan that raises far more questions than answers.

For now, we have no idea why the deal is even on the table, let alone the financial specifics. The narrative will likely have something to do with SpaceX helping xAI launch data centers into Earth’s orbit — an idea that AI tech leaders have become obsessed with as of late, despite experts warning it makes little sense, citing concerns over economic viability and bandwidth limitations.

“The lowest cost place to put AI will be in space,” Musk said during an interview in Davos last week. “And that will be true within two years, maybe three at the latest.”

Other companies, most notably Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, are also looking to launch thousands of satellites that will ultimately serve data centers from space. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has also been infatuated by the idea, arguing that bringing data centers closer to the Sun could allow them to reap practically unlimited amounts of solar energy while in orbit.

According to Reuters, two entities in Nevada, including a limited liability company that lists SpaceX chief financial officer Bret Johnsen, have been set up to facilitate the swapping of xAI and SpaceX shares. A source told the news agency that xAI executives could receive cash instead of SpaceX stock as part of the deal.

SpaceX already agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI last year as part of the startup’s fundraising round. Both xAI and SpaceX have secured major defense contracts with the Pentagon. Just earlier this year, defense secretary Pete Hegseth revealed that Musk’s AI chatbot Grok will be operating inside Pentagon networks.

SpaceX is also developing a national security version of its Starlink broadband internet network, called Starshield, which is expected to use AI to track targets back on the surface, according to Reuters.

Musk is no stranger to merging his own businesses. Last year, for instance, he folded his social media echo chamber X into xAI. His embattled EV maker, Tesla, is also seemingly getting in on the fun, announcing that it had agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI earlier this week, after reporting some disastrous earnings.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ethos Technologies, a San Francisco-based provider of software for selling life insurance, debuted on the Nasdaq on Thursday. As one of the year’s first major tech IPOs, the insurtech platform is being closely watched as a bellwether for the 2026 listing cycle.

The company and its selling shareholders raised approximately $200 million in the offering, selling 10.5 million shares at $19 each under the ticker symbol “LIFE” — one of the more on-the-nose choices in recent memory. The name fits. Ethos runs a three-sided platform where consumers buy policies online in 10 minutes without medical exams. It says over 10,000 independent agents use its software to sell those policies and that carriers like Legal & General America and John Hancock rely on it for underwriting and administrative services. Ethos itself isn’t an insurer — it’s a licensed agency earning commissions on sales.

Though the company’s stock closed its first day as a public company at $16.85, 11% below its IPO price of $19, Ethos co-founders Peter Colis and Lingke Wang still have plenty to celebrate, having grown the 10-year-old business to public-market scale.

“When we launched [the business], there were like eight or nine other life insurtech startups that looked very similar to Ethos, with similar Series A funding,” Colis told TechCrunch. “Over time, the vast majority of those startups have pivoted, been acquired at subscale, remain at subscale or gone out of business.”

For instance, Policygenius, which raised over $250 million from investors, including KKR and Norwest Venture Partners, was acquired by PE-backed Zinnia in 2023. Meanwhile, Health IQ, a startup that secured more than $200 million from prominent VCs like Andreessen Horowitz, filed for bankruptcy that same year.

Ethos, which has raised over $400 million in venture capital, could have easily succumbed to a similar fate. Instead, the company remained laser-focused on reaching profitability as the era of cheap capital and easy fundraising came to an end in 2022. “Not knowing what the ongoing funding climate would be, we got really serious about ensuring profitability,” Colis said.

That financial discipline transformed it into a profitable company by mid-2023, according to its IPO documents. Since then, Ethos has also maintained a year-over-year revenue growth rate of more than 50%. In the nine months ending September 30, 2025, the company generated almost $278 million in revenue and just under $46.6 million in net income.

Still, the company ended its first day as a public company with a market capitalization of about $1.1 billion, a valuation that’s significantly below the $2.7 billion it garnered in its last private round led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2 in July 2021.

When asked why Ethos went public, Colis said that a big part of the reason was to bring “additional trust and credibility” to potential partners and clients. He explained that because many major insurance carriers are over a century old, being publicly traded signals the company’s staying power.

The largest outside shareholders of Ethos include prominent firms, including Sequoia, Accel, Google’s venture arm GV, and SoftBank, as well as General Catalyst and Heroic Ventures. Sequoia and Accel did not sell shares in the IPO, the company disclosed.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple had a great Q1, though iPhone sales were the real standout. The company reports that its signature device had its best quarter ever, thanks partially to a surge of sales in regions like China and India.

“iPhone had its best-ever quarter driven by unprecedented demand, with all-time records across every geographic segment,” said CEO Tim Cook during the company’s earnings call Thursday. Apple’s earnings report shows the company sold $85 billion worth of iPhones during its first quarter, up from $69 billion in the same period last year.

During the call’s Q&A portion, Cook revealed that China had seen a huge surge in sales. “It was driven by iPhone, where we set an all-time revenue record,” Cook said, noting that it was the “best iPhone quarter in history in Greater China.” Cook said the sales bump had been driven by enthusiasm for the iPhone 17, which was announced in September. The new model has proven to be significantly more popular than the company’s previous iPhone.

Apple’s earnings report shows that its overall sales in the Greater China region jumped from $18.5 billion in the year-ago quarter to $25.5 billion. Cook noted that, overall, the company had fared quite well in the region. “I would tell you that during the quarter, traffic in our stores in China grew by strong double digits year over year,” he said.

Cook also highlighted India as another region where iPhones — as well as other products — seemed to be flying off the shelves. “We did set a quarterly revenue record during the December quarter,” Cook said, noting that records had been set for “iPhone and Mac and iPad [sales] and an all-time revenue record on services.” Cook called it “a terrific quarter” in a country that he noted is “the second largest smartphone market in the world and the fourth largest PC market.”

The iPhone aside, Apple’s overall sales jumped across every geographical region, its earnings report shows. In the Americas, for instance, sales went from $52.6 billion a year ago to $58.5 billion, while in Europe, they increased from $33.8 billion to $38.1 billion.

            <div id="article-text">Apple exceeded expectations when it reported its quarterly earnings on Thursday, revealing that it made $143.8 billion in revenue for a 16% year-over-year increase. As analysts peppered CEO Tim Cook with softball questions during Apple’s earnings call, one analyst dared to ask the question that seemingly no one in Silicon Valley is willing to ask.

“When I think about your AI initiatives, you know, it’s clear there are added costs associated with that… Many of your competitors have already integrated AI into their devices, and it’s just not clear yet what incremental monetization they’re seeing because of AI…,” started Morgan Stanley’s Erik Woodring.

Could there be a tinge of nervousness underneath this Finance Man’s probably-very-financey facade? In what I can only imagine must have been a Herculean display of courage, Woodring asked the question that lurks only in the darkest, dampest recesses of investors’ minds.

You’d think this would come up more. You would be wrong. Instead, Big Tech has taken a largely vibes-driven approach to AI development. Take OpenAI, for instance, which may seem like it’s on top of the world, given how ChatGPT has embedded itself into the cultural consciousness. But the company isn’t planning to make any money until 2030. Analysts from HBSC are even doubtful about that timeline, especially since it will need another $207 billion in funding, estimates say. Ask anyone in tech how OpenAI is planning to break even, and you’ll be met with the verbal equivalent of the ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ emoticon.

But good ol’ Tim “$143.8 billion in revenue” Cook was having a good afternoon, so maybe he’d finally spill the beans about how any of these companies are planning to recoup their investments.

“Well, let me just say that we’re bringing intelligence to more of what people love, and we’re integrating it across the operating system in a personal and private way, and I think that by doing so, it creates great value, and that opens up a range of opportunities across our products and services,” Cook said.

So, there you have it, folks. Apple will monetize AI by creating “great value.” And, crucially, that will “open up a range of opportunities.” Which we will experience in “products and services.” Cool!

Well, shout-out to that Morgan Stanley guy for trying.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Three of Elon Musk’s companies — SpaceX, xAI, and Tesla — are in play for a potential merger. While the talks appear to be in the early stage, according to reports from Bloomberg and Reuters, it could eventually lead to at least one company folding into SpaceX.

Two scenarios are being hashed out. In one, SpaceX and Tesla would merge, per Bloomberg, citing unnamed insiders. In another, SpaceX and aXI (which already owns Musk’s social media platform X) would combine.

According to reporting by Reuters, a merger between SpaceX and xAI could take place ahead of a planned SpaceX IPO this year. This would bring products like the Grok chatbot, X platform, Starlink satellites, and SpaceX rockets together under one corporation.

Company representatives from SpaceX and xAI have not discussed this possibility in public. However, recent filings show that two new corporate entities were established in Nevada on January 21, which are called K2 Merger Sub Inc. and K2 Merger Sub 2 LLC. This suggests that Musk is keeping all options open.

There are upsides to either scenario. Combining the SpaceX and xAI companies could allow xAI to put its data centers in space, something Musk has said he wants. A SpaceX-Tesla tie-up could align the EV maker’s energy storage business with the data center in space idea as well.

And both options — as well as a combination of all three companies — fall in line with Musk’s comments and recent actions to consolidate, or at the very least share resources between them. Last year, SpaceX agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI, according to The Wall Street Journal, and earlier this week, Tesla (also led by Musk) revealed it, too, invested $2 billion in the AI startup.

Last year, xAI bought X in a deal that Musk said valued xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion. SpaceX, which has been around since 2002, reportedly launched a secondary sale that valued it at $800 billion, making it the most valuable private company in the U.S.

A recent Financial Times report indicated that Musk wants to take SpaceX public in June. Then again, Musk’s grand plans rarely happen on time.

            <div id="article-text">OpenAI, a company already valued at $500 billion, has made it known that it’s on the hunt for another $100 billion in investment. Such a funding round could lead the company’s valuation to shoot up to a titanic $830 billion. The Wall Street Journal is now reporting that Amazon may contribute at least $50 billion of that record-breaking investment.

Not much is known about the potential deal, although the Journal notes that Amazon’s CEO, Andy Jassy, is currently leading the negotiations with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. TechCrunch reached out to Amazon and OpenAI for comment.

In its pursuit of additional funding, OpenAI has also reportedly been having discussions with sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East, and The New York Times has written that the startup has held additional talks with Nvidia, Microsoft, and SoftBank. The funding deal is expected to close by the end of Q1.

Such a partnership between Amazon and OpenAI would be particularly interesting because of Amazon’s close ties to the OpenAI competitor Anthropic. Amazon’s AWS is the primary cloud and training provider for Anthropic, and the company has invested at least $8 billion into Anthropic. Amazon also recently opened an $11 billion data center campus in Indiana, designed to exclusively run Anthropic models.

            <div id="article-text">Hustle culture may be the norm at tech companies in the AI era, but the work will stop tomorrow at publishing platform Medium. Medium CEO Tony Stubblebine is giving the company’s employees permission to take the day off to participate in tomorrow’s nationwide general strike protesting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.

Activists behind the general strike are calling for “no work, no school, and no shopping” amid a push to defund ICE, which has escalated raids in U.S. cities, killing several people, including two U.S. citizens earlier this month in Minneapolis.

In a Slack message shared today with Medium staff, Stubblebine says all employees are free to participate in the strike however they see fit.

“Whether or not you want to fully take the day away from work, or do a partial work day, or orient your work towards something that feels aligned to the goals of the strike, that is up to you,” he wrote in a general announcements channel.

The exec clarified that Medium is not “in the business of dictating people’s politics,” so the choice to participate was an individual one, not a company mandate.

Of course, the publishing platform has an important role in helping people share news, opinions, insights, and analysis around politics, culture, and other topics. So that it can allow its employees to take the day off to protest, Stubblebine said Medium will coordinate with the necessary teams to ensure there’s a plan for “business continuity” on Friday.

Tech leaders, including Google DeepMind chief scientist Jeff Dean, have been outspoken in protest of ICE. Still, many large tech companies and executives have spent the last several weeks courting favor with the Trump administration. Some execs — including Apple CEO Tim Cook — were criticized for attending the screening of the Amazon MGM Studios-produced “Melania” documentary on the day federal border control agents shot and killed ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.

Many rank-and-file tech employees, meanwhile, have demanded that ICE and CBP (Customs and Border Protection) get out of U.S. cities, as evidenced by the open letter signed by more than 500 tech industry employees.

Stubblebine seems to share that opinion, writing that Medium has a responsibility to “make its stance clear,” especially “as many other tech orgs are donating to the Trump campaign.” He also said that Medium’s product exists to help “elevate truth and diverse voices,” not hateful content or racism.

His message also reiterated Medium’s support for DEI, the set of pro-diversity policies the Trump administration has attempted to dismantle through executive orders, the elimination of DEI positions in the federal workforce, curriculum removals, legal targeting, and more.

“Our business thrives when the country thrives, and so being out there representing is good for [our] mission,” Stubblebine said.

Kathleen Walters was only 23 days away from qualifying for early retirement at the IRS when she decided to quit, rather than acquiesce to a Trump-administration request that she break the law and compromise millions of people’s privacy. She’s one of hundreds of thousands of civil servants who have left or been fired from their federal-government jobs in the past year. In this episode, host Anne Applebaum speaks with Don Moynihan, an expert in the history of public policy from the University of Michigan. He explains how the destruction of America’s civil service is part of the administration’s greater effort to create a government that derives its power through unprecedented means and fundamentally disrupts democracy as we know it.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Kathleen Walters: I thought I would be at the IRS for six months when I joined, and those six months turned into almost two decades. My name is Kathleen Walters, and  I was an executive at the IRS for nearly 20 years, most recently serving as the agency’s chief privacy officer. I’ve kind of worked with every administration all the way back to the early ’90s. No other administration has personally ever asked me to do anything that was illegal, no. No.

Anne Applebaum: From The Atlantic, this is Autocracy in America. I’m Anne Applebaum. In this new season, I’m asking how the Trump White House is rewriting the rules of U.S. politics, and talking to Americans whose lives have been changed as a result. Today’s episode examines the destruction of the civil service: the removal of professionals, and their replacement with loyalists. I’ve seen this kind of transformation before, in other failing democracies. Everyone suffers from the degradation of public services. Government institutions run by lackeys are also more easily manipulated by autocratic leaders, and no longer serve the public interest. Kathleen Walters found herself in the center of this story in 2025.

Walters: So on day one of the second Trump administration, it was clear things were going to be different because of the flurry of executive orders that were issued. I got word that some of our leaders might be negotiating with DHS over a memorandum of understanding—an agreement to share tax data. I was contacted by our acting commissioner, and they wanted to have an agreement signed with DHS to share data on immigrants. Certainly name, address, contact information was high on their list and, really, whatever we could give them. And they wanted to compile it and mix it with the data they received from all the other agencies, and—they didn’t use this term, but it was very clear—create the most updated profile on each of the immigrants. I asked DHS for a sense of volume, and the individual representing DHS stated that he believed it would be about up to 7 million immigrants’ data that they were requesting.

That is very, very sensitive data, and we have one of the most complex privacy laws in the federal government. The lawyers determined that we could not give it to them legally. I had decided that I was not going to be able to facilitate something that, based on our attorney’s input, was not lawful. So that weekend, I sent a resignation email to the acting commissioner.

The decision to leave the IRS was the hardest thing I’ve ever done and yet the easiest decision. We all have boundaries in life. I had a clear one, and I was committed to it. So that made it easy. On the other hand, I also am the mom to a 9-year-old, who I’m responsible for caring for and paying for. I was 23 days shy of qualifying for early retirement, which would’ve given us some payments monthly and health insurance for life. So I had to tell my daughter what was going on, and I said, you know, We are gonna have to not spend as much money. We’re probably not gonna go out to eat much. But this is what I did and this is why. And it still chokes me up. She said to me, Mom, even if we have to live in a tent in someone’s yard, you made the right decision.

Integrity, to me, it’s the most important thing to maintain, because if you lose a job, you can get another job. But if you lose your integrity, it is very hard to get it back.

Applebaum: Professor Don Moynihan is an expert in the history of public policy, and teaches at the University of Michigan.

Moynihan: And a lot of these disagreements really boil down to whether the president can order people to break the law. It’s a red flag when you see so many people saying, My god. This is so illegal that we cannot, in good conscience, stick around any longer.

Applebaum: Don, there are now many, many civil servants who have left or been fired, so tell us more about how this term may be different from President Trump’s first term.

Moynihan: I spent a few years at the end of Trump’s first term trying to think about how bad could it get in his second term. I did not anticipate just how bad it would become, partly because I didn’t anticipate that so many laws, civil-service laws and other laws, would be broken with seeming impunity. One of his big lessons from his first term was that there are a lot of lawyers in government who are telling me, No, I can’t do things. I need lawyers who will tell me, Yes you can. And so he’s systematically pushing the envelope on policy and, in many cases, breaking the law. And then also replacing those lawyers with more amenable actors. And so we see again and again, principled public officials saying, We think this crosses the boundaries, effectively being put on administrative leave, being told to resign, or, in some cases, being fired.

Applebaum: I want to ask you about the implications of all that, but first I think it would be helpful to give a little background here, because the United States hasn’t always had a professional, nonpartisan civil service. Until the Pendleton Act of the 1880s, we had something called the “spoils system,” which meant that only loyal party members could get jobs in government. And that system created corruption. It encouraged bribery. It was inefficient. How did that change?

Moynihan: The first major civil-service reform bill is introduced during the Civil War by Charles Sumner. And it’s a response to the perception that a lot of money is being wasted, the war effort is less efficient than it should be, partly because of the corruption that’s embedded in the use of public funds. We see stories of, basically, large contracts going to people aligned with the party. And so it became clearer to the public that you couldn’t really trust that the politicians were acting in the public interest when there was so much money sloshing around the public sector.

Applebaum: And so instead of that, we created a system that requires people to be hired and fired based on merit. And the Civil Service Reform Act, which comes later in the 20th century, also says you can’t hire or fire people because of their political affiliations. Correct?

Moynihan: That’s exactly right. The Civil Service Reform Act is the first act to actually write down what those merit principles are, and it specifies, very clearly, that employees cannot be treated differently because of their political affiliations.

Applebaum: And is the current administration adhering to this act?

Moynihan: Neither in spirit or in the letter of the law is the current administration adhering to this act, in my view. I think we’re at the most dramatic attack on the civil-service system since its creation in the 1880s. It feels that there is an element of the spoils system that is returning, but also, there is this much more direct attack on democracy that is part of the mechanization and the weaponization of the civil-service system right now.

Applebaum: And is this an effective strategy for improving government efficiency?

Moynihan: We know that research tells us that more politicization leads to generally worse outcomes. And this is for a variety of reasons. One is that you get less competent people who work for government under more politicized regimes. The more talented people tend to leave. You also have officials who don’t want to share bad news with their political principals. And so the presidents or the agency leaders are simply making worse decisions because they don’t have good access to information.

I’ll give you two examples of pieces of research here. One is that after the Pendleton Act, and the post office was no longer driven by patronage, you saw the accuracy and speed of mail delivery improve. So in a very specific way, you could see how performance got better. Another example is: The Bush administration used to rate agency programs on a one-to-five scale from “not performing” to “excellent.” And one analysis found that programs that were run by career civil servants tended to perform better than programs that were run by political appointees, all else being equal. Once you add politicization, things tend to get worse; once you give autonomy to capable professionals, things tend to get better when it comes to performance.

Applebaum: I mean, is there a precedent of other countries that had meritocratic civil service sliding backwards? The only example that comes into my head, since my background is in writing Soviet history, is the Bolsheviks, in the Soviet Union. The Soviet state created a civil service in which you could only advance if you were a party member, and not only that, you had to publicly state your allegiance to the party and its constantly changing principles, whenever you were asked to do it. Is there another country, another example, that you think of?

Moynihan: In Hungary, they put party cronies in charge of major parts of the system through a privatization scheme. In Turkey, we saw mass purges of people who were perceived as not being aligned with the administration. And so there is a common pattern there that I think serves as a warning sign.

Applebaum: And where do you see those warning signs now, in America?

Moynihan: So I think we’re seeing a multipronged attack on civil-service capabilities. Partly it’s through hiring. They want to put more loyalists into civil-servant positions. Partly it’s through firing. People who won’t go along with breaking the law are being shown the door. And partly it’s also through just instilling a culture of fear within our government.

Applebaum: Let’s break those down. What is unprecedented about the way the Trump administration is hiring civil servants?

Moynihan: The Trump administration announced a new hiring process, which it claimed would bring in better candidates for public-sector jobs. There were a couple of really unusual aspects to that. One is that people would submit essays where they would be asked to name their favorite Trump executive order and how they would help serve President Trump. And so that is new—the idea that job candidates will be asked, How are you gonna serve this particular president? Even though the job is, you’re supposed to serve every president, not just this individual president. The second part of the hiring process that’s changing now is that political appointees are directly involved in choosing these civil servants, and so it eliminates any barrier between the political appointees—those who are directly loyal to the president—and the people who are hired, which makes it much more likely that the people who are hired are also going to share those same political loyalties to President Trump.

Applebaum: Of course, political appointees have always had some involvement with the civil service, but there still seems to be something different now. There’s a culture of fear around these appointments that didn’t exist before, and we know that that culture of fear is being created deliberately. And we know that because the architect of a lot of these changes, Russell Vought, at the Office of Management and Budget, has said, “We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected. We want to put them in trauma.” How are we seeing that play out?

Moynihan: I certainly think that was his goal. He has been upfront about viewing the government as an enemy, wanting a much smaller bureaucracy. And I think he has succeeded. One thing that’s important to understand is that this culture of fear that we’re seeing is not just driven by Trump officials. It’s also driven by Trump-aligned actors in broader society. And so, for example, Elon Musk might tweet about an individual government employee. They then get doxxed; they have to leave their home. You see private actors who are sort of conservative commentators identify individual civil servants. These could be FBI agents. And you read the next week: Those people have been fired.

And you also see a very organized effort, and some funded by organizations like the Heritage Foundation, to FOIA individual civil servants, to basically go through their emails, see if they can find any damaging language that would allow them to be fired, and to create, effectively, enemies lists, where individual civil servants are put on a website somewhere. There are lists of alleged crimes, which are often things like, Served on a DEI panel once, are listed. And then, again, you predictably see sometimes formal retaliation for that—a person might be put on leave or fired—but also informal attacks, where people get nasty phone calls, emails; sometimes people will turn up at their home and threaten them. And so the fear is not irrational. It is not just in the workplace; it’s in the broader society that these civil servants are now working in.

Applebaum: The third warning sign you listed is the mass firings. Since the Trump administration has taken office, hundreds of thousands of civil servants have been fired or have quit. Are these mass firings legal? I had always assumed, prior to this administration, that it wasn’t that easy to fire civil servants. In fact, this was one of the complaints that was sometimes made about them, is that they can’t be fired. How is it possible that this administration can just tell thousands of people to leave their jobs?

Moynihan: There are so many things I thought were illegal that now appear to be legal. It’s hard to keep a full list. If you asked me a year ago, Can the president eliminate an agency? or Can the president impound funds? I would’ve said, No, those are illegal things because that takes up congressional prerogatives too great an extent. They’re clearly unconstitutional. And now we have seen the president do both of those things. When it comes to firing individual employees, it is onerous to fire an individual employee. You can fire them for calls. That is to say: If they’re poor performers, you can fire them. They can appeal that decision. It can take a while to do that, but if you document the basis for the firing, it is possible to get rid of them. Ironically, it’s somewhat easier to fire lots of employees, because there is a legal “reduction in force” process—RIFs—where agencies can say: Because we need to save money, or because of some reorganization, we are going to eliminate a lot of positions.

Whether the Trump administration is using those reduction-in-force authorities legally, I think, is a very open question. RIFs are very technical documents and there’s a lot of procedures. It looks to me that the Trump administration has not followed in implementing those RIFs. Also, a huge number of people left through the deferred-resignation program, the so-called “fork in the road” voluntary-resignation program that Elon Musk introduced. It feels fairly clear to me that that was not following statutes, but a lot of people simply did leave, and it doesn’t seem like the Supreme Court is gonna do anything about it. The ways in which there was mass firings of probationary employees—a judge has ruled those to be illegal, but he’s also said: Well, it’s too late to fix it now. And so there is this sort of disturbing trend where things that really do appear to be illegal in terms of how federal employees are treated are allowed to move forward. And then maybe, down the line, the court will say, Well, that wasn’t right. But at that point, the remedy has pretty much walked out the door. Too much time has passed. So, for example, USAID doesn’t exist as an agency anymore. And so even if the courts were to say, That was illegal, there’s no workable solution for the employees who were laid off or for the programs that they were trying to implement.

Applebaum: Coming up after the break: The attack on the civil service may be part of a bigger project: Trump’s entourage wants to change our system so that they can stay in power.

Moynihan: He’s  issued executive orders claiming authority over elections that constitutionally he doesn’t seem to have,  but that doesn’t mean that a weaponized Department of Justice couldn’t sue or investigate or harass states or individual election officials for what they regard as improper behavior, which could be behavior that’s actually trying to maintain a free and fair election.

Applebaum: Don, talk about the practical impact of these firings. Of course they are felt by the people themselves, who’ve lost their jobs, but how will this affect the public at large?

Moynihan: I think there are two ways to answer that question. And so the first way is to think about the federal workforce as a group of employees who work for you. Do you want a group of employees that are knowledgeable, committed to their job, really dedicated to the goals that they’re trying to implement? And I think, historically, in America, we’ve mostly said yes. We get to hire some very smart people in government, partly because they care a lot about the mission, partly because they like the stability of government work. And so we probably get people who are coming not just for the paycheck—because they could earn more in the private sector—but because they’re really committed to the statutory goals of protecting the environment or emergency management. If you think of yourself as a mini-CEO overseeing this workforce, what we’re seeing is a bunch of structural changes that is gonna make it less easy for you to attract and retain good employees. They don’t appreciate the lack of stability. They don’t appreciate the toxic work environment, or being demonized. And so a lot of those people will exit, or they will never join the public sector in the first place. The stock of human capital in the workforce just gets worse.

Then we get to specific public services. And here, it’s harder to say, Planes are going to drop out of the sky tomorrow because there’s a 5 percent cut of FAA employees. And this is something about public services that is sometimes maybe a little different from private services, which is that the erosion of quality can be slower and harder to observe. I do think there are places we are starting to see this. Social Security has been struggling to serve its customers. I think the IRS—the fact that they’re hiring back people now is an admission that they simply don’t have enough people to manage the inflow of tax forms that will come at tax season. I think emergency management, to me, is a huge red flag, where FEMA did not have an especially bad summer in terms of natural disasters, but with flooding in Texas, it clearly was not as able to respond, partly because of the cuts and services, partly because of the extra layers of red tape that the DHS leadership imposed upon it. And so I think there will be more stories like that, where failures occur in a visible way. And then if you look at those failures honestly, you can say, Well, partly, this is because the Trump administration chose to reduce the capacity of these agencies.

Applebaum: So if things do begin to erode and government services begin to decline and more accidents happen with pollution or food safety, do you think people will make the connection between those accidents, and that erosion, and the attacks on the civil service?

Moynihan: What I do think is true is that there is a moment here of opportunity for civic education between the citizens of America and the government that serves them, where we can explain to them: Here it is; here’s what your government does. Here’s how your taxpayer dollars are spent. And when you sort of pull out these capacities, here’s how things start to collapse. We mostly don’t have those moments of opportunities, because they’re mostly moments of really bad outcomes. I think about Hurricane Katrina. That was an opportunity where we understood that putting unqualified people in charge of FEMA contributed to some very bad outcomes for the residents of New Orleans. So I think the work to be done there is to connect these failures that we see with choices made by the administration to undermine state capacity.

Applebaum: Earlier, you directly linked the civil-service firings with a decline in democracy, and you’ve also written elsewhere that President Trump is trying to build a more authoritarian political system. Let’s talk more specifically about what that means. For example, direct control of some state institutions could give a ruling party or leader advantages. So if the president can use the IRS to steal data or information, and use it in campaigns, or to initiate investigations against his enemies for political reasons, then the next time we go to vote, the playing field isn’t level. And that’s why neutral institutions that are meant to serve all of us shouldn’t be politicized.

Moynihan: Yeah. You need nonpartisan institutions to, I think, also create trust in government. And if we look at independent agencies, or, let’s say, take the Merit Systems Protection Board. This was created with the 1978 Civil Service Reform Act. These were the actors put in place, where if some employee is saying, I’ve been fired because of my political affiliation, or I’ve been fired because I wouldn’t do something illegal, they have the final sort of judgment on whether discrimination on political basis took place. But President Trump has basically taken control of that entity, removed any Democrats and put only Republicans on it. And so it’s no longer a credible check on government abuses at this point.

Applebaum: All of us have begun to focus on the midterms, and, clearly, the administration is nervous about them. How does the absence of thousands of federal civil servants, or the politicization of the civil service—how could it affect the elections? Do mass firings create an atmosphere of fear that impacts voting? What’s the connection between these two things?

Moynihan: One part of the authoritarian checklist that Trump has struggled most with is elections, and that’s partly because the constitutional system delegates the actual running of elections to state governments. And historically, the federal government has had minimal involvement over these processes. And, you know, right now that seems like a very good thing. But that doesn’t mean that a weaponized Department of Justice couldn’t sue or investigate or harass states or individual election officials for what they regard as improper behavior, which could be behavior that’s actually trying to maintain a free and fair election. It doesn’t mean that the president might not deploy the National Guard to election sites, or put ICE around election sites, on the claim that mass fraud is taking place. It is, I think, the area where Trump has made the least progress. But he’s clearly interested in this as a topic, and he’s issued executive orders claiming authority over elections that, constitutionally, he doesn’t seem to have—as he has done in other areas.

Applebaum: This seems, to me, to be the central point: the possibility of elections being shaped or manipulated by the executive. It’s not necessarily going to happen, but it’s also important that we take the possibility seriously. How do you think we should be thinking this? Should we be behaving differently; should we be acting differently?

Moynihan: We’re currently operating under an administration where you probably can’t retain a significant job if you don’t go along with the idea that somehow the 2020 elections were crooked. It does mean that the leadership of these agencies, like the Department of Justice, are going to be very much driven by people with this conspiratorial worldview, who are perhaps less dedicated to constitutional principles.

So I think in the blue states, you will have attorney generals who will be anticipating these efforts and will be, in some cases, responding to Department of Justice investigations. In red states, you’re gonna have this partisan alignment between the president and the actors in charge of individual states. And so I think, in both cases, public support for elections, public support for maintaining the integrity of elections, will become very important. Visible demonstrations by members of the public, if they can start to realize that there are real threats here, will become, I think, useful in reminding society as a whole that these elections do not run themselves.

Moynihan: It was my pleasure. Thank you, Anne.

            <h2>Tesla Just Killed the Most Important Car of the 21st Century</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Before Elon Musk, most electric vehicles seemed less like an alternative to gasoline than an argument in its favor. The sad state of affairs for EVs for many years was that they were slow, impractical, and largely enticing only if you lived with copious guilt over your carbon emissions.

Then Tesla came out with the Tesla Model S. The speedy, high-tech sedan didn’t just leave other EVs in the dust; it could compete with the likes of BMW and Mercedes-Benz. “EVs went from ‘eating your vegetables’ to getting you super-car performance in a vehicle that’s luxurious and quiet,” Jake Fisher, the senior director of auto testing at Consumer Reports, told me. The Model S proved something that’s now easy to take for granted: EVs can work, and ordinary people might actually want one. A year after the Model S’s 2012 debut, Musk personally drove one coast-to-coast to prove that it was just as capable as a gas car.

Now the Model S is going away. During Tesla’s earnings call yesterday, Musk announced that his company will soon stop manufacturing the car that launched his empire. “That is slightly sad,” he acknowledged on the call. In a sense, it was inevitable. Tech products get killed off all the time to make way for something better; Apple no longer sells the iPhone 4. Indeed, the Tesla Model S has become irrelevant and overpriced compared with the company’s newer cars. (As a Road & Track headline put it in 2023, “The Tesla Model S Has Lived Long Enough to See Itself Become a Villain.”) Nearly all of Tesla’s global sales come from the more affordable Model Y and Model 3, leaving the original Model S unceremoniously lumped in with “Other Models” in the company’s financial reports.

But Tesla is not phasing out the Model S to focus on making even better cars. The move is part of a retreat from the car business. Tesla will stop producing the Model S and another one of its less popular cars, the gull-winged Model X SUV, in order to free up space at its California factory to build the human robot Optimus. “It is time to bring the S and X programs to an end and shift to an autonomous future,” Musk said yesterday. He’s made very clear that he wants to reposition Tesla as an AI company. The promise of robotaxis that can take you to work and robots that water your plants is why Tesla’s investors recently offered Musk a $1 trillion pay package even as the company’s car sales are slumping and slumping. If cars like the Model S changed the world, the investors would argue, then there’s no reason to believe that Musk’s vision for robots can’t do something even grander. (Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.)

Read: Tesla wants out of the car business

This plan had better work. Now that Tesla seems largely done with making new car models, the company is throwing away a lot in order to go all in on autonomy. The irony is that in canceling the Model S, Tesla is effectively walking away from a business that it helped create. Even at its apex, the Model S never sold as well as something like the Toyota Camry. (The Tesla’s initial starting price of about $100,000 immediately put it out of reach for most car buyers.) But it is undoubtedly the most important car of the 21st century. The global EV industry would not be what it is today without it.

Perhaps the biggest legacy of the Model S is that it turned cars into gadgets. From the get-go, Tesla owners enjoyed a parade of new features rolled out via software downloads. Until the Model S, whatever features your car had at purchase were essentially all you ever got, unless you modified it yourself or paid a shop to do it. Tesla pioneered the idea of a car that could, like a smartphone, get better over time with digital upgrades. At times, software updates can be a nuisance for drivers: Some features are now locked behind a subscription paywall. This kind of approach has made Tesla a tech company, with a stock price more reminiscent of Silicon Valley than of Detroit. Tesla is now worth more than most other car companies combined.

Naturally, other automakers were eager to replicate the Tesla playbook. By the late 2010s, the rest of the industry was scrambling to chase Tesla’s progress and innovation (and that stock price). Other companies have since sunk billions of dollars into EVs, batteries, and software, all to varying degrees of success. Software updates are something the sector is still struggling with. Even last year, when Tesla’s profits and sales sank, most Americans who bought an EV were opting for Teslas. And when Tesla set up its factory in China, it kicked that country’s auto industry into high gear. Now electric cars from companies such as Geely and Xiaomi handily outclass many of Tesla’s cars; the auto giant BYD just eclipsed Tesla to become the world’s biggest seller of EVs. Perhaps that’s why Tesla is moving away from making cars; it’s now up against dozens of other Teslas that have government support and considerable financial resources.

Read: The firewall against Chinese cars is cracking

The Model S may have another enduring legacy: In addition to turning Tesla into an EV juggernaut, it also laid the groundwork for Musk’s eventual obsession with robots and robotaxis. Tesla’s “Autopilot” feature, which allows drivers to take their hands off the wheel on the highway and while parallel parking, debuted as a software upgrade on the Model S. Over time, this evolved into “Full Self-Driving,” for hands-free driving in cities. It’s the basis for Tesla’s AI-powered autonomous-car dreams and its hopes for robotics: A humanoid robot like Optimus should theoretically “see” and operate in the world much the same way.

Even so, Tesla is racing toward a totally unproven concept. The technology behind humanoid robots remains in its infancy, and there’s no guarantee that fully autonomous cars can be deployed safely at scale. Musk’s company proved that people could want electric cars. It might be a much taller order to prove that they’d want humanlike robots and cars without steering wheels.</div>

The attack on Representative Ilhan Omar on Tuesday was horrifying but depressingly predictable. Not only has the country seen a recent spree of political violence, but Omar, a Democrat from Minnesota, has also been a frequent target of death threats.

The suspect, whom police have identified as Anthony Kazmierczak, was arrested after he squirted a combination of apple-cider vinegar and water at Omar during a town hall in Minneapolis, according to court documents. She was apparently not injured in the attack and continued to speak for 25 minutes before being medically screened. Kazmierczak has a long rap sheet, and he also has a long record of social-media posts that support right-wing causes and President Trump. His brother told The Independent that Kazmierczak frequently complained about Somali immigrants and about Omar in particular, who was born in Somalia before immigrating and becoming an American citizen. Court documents allege that he once said someone “should kill that bitch.”

Kazmierczak’s alleged animosity toward Omar didn’t come out of nowhere. A chorus on the right, led by Trump, has worked for years to villainize her. When ABC News reached Trump on Tuesday night, he said that he hadn’t seen the footage of the attack but then baselessly claimed that Omar had staged the incident. “I don’t think about her. I think she’s a fraud,” he said. “She probably had herself sprayed, knowing her.”

For a guy who claims not to think about Omar, Trump sure seems obsessed with her. Just a few hours earlier, at a speech in Iowa, Trump had been talking about her. “She comes from a country that’s a disaster,” he said. “It’s considered, I think, the worst. It’s not even a country.” He has sought to make her the face of Somali immigration, usually invoking her name when he mentions the fraud rings involving Somali immigrants in Minnesota. (Omar has no known connection to the criminal investigations.) Trump has mentioned her at least 10 times this month alone on Truth Social, where he’s labeled her “disgusting,” called her a “fake ‘Congresswoman,’” and alleged that she married her brother, a long-running claim that fact-checkers have noted is baseless. He said last week that she should be investigated for “Political Crimes,” a chillingly authoritarian phrase, and even found time to rant about her during his speech at the World Economic Forum.

In fact, Trump helped turn Omar into a national figure in 2019, shortly after she entered Congress. “‘Progressive’ Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe,” should “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came,” he wrote on social media in July of that year. The comment was widely interpreted as a swipe at Omar (among others)—a theory that Trump effectively confirmed a few days later when he complained about her personally, inciting a rally crowd to chant “Send her back!”

In other words, Trump is a major driver of the visceral anger toward Omar. He knows the effect his words might have, though he avoids specifically encouraging violence against her, a phenomenon that Juliette Kayyem, a terrorism scholar and an Atlantic contributor, has called “stochastic terrorism.”

Trump is familiar with this line of thinking, even if he hasn’t used the academic term. After two attempts on his life in 2024, including one that left him bloodied in Butler, Pennsylvania, Trump and many of his allies charged that Democrats and other Trump critics were to blame for demonizing Trump and saying that he was a threat to democracy. Many of the same arguments followed the assassination of Charlie Kirk last year, and some on the right tried to crack down on political speech even as they hailed Kirk for defending it.

A handful of Omar’s critics, including Representative Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican, have condemned the attack on her. “Regardless of how vehemently I disagree with her rhetoric—and I do—no elected official should face physical attacks. This is not who we are,” Mace wrote on X. But others have hewed closer to Trump’s line. Representative Randy Fine, a Florida Republican, said that Omar shouldn’t have been attacked, and then immediately pivoted: “I also blame Ilhan Omar for what happened.”

After the assassination attempts on Trump and Kirk’s murder, some people believed that a national effort to lower tensions and avoid violent rhetoric might be possible. But the victim-blaming emanating from Trump and Fine shows that many prominent extremists have no appetite for calming their language, and they haven’t developed a principled commitment to suppressing political violence—they just don’t want their own side to face it. Maintaining a peaceful, stable democracy is nearly impossible when some prominent figures are willing to inflame and then shrug off violence against their political adversaries.

Here are four new stories from The Atlantic:

“At least,” a friend sighed, “they didn’t call it the 2026 National War Strategy.” True enough, although if Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth claims that he now leads the Department of War, logical consistency would suggest substituting the fiercer war for the feebler defense in the National Defense Strategy.

But logistical consistency, like coherence and gravitas, does not characterize the new NDS. It is a document that supposedly nests within the National Security Strategy, explaining at greater length the implications of overall policy for the armed forces. The 2026 version does not do that. Rather, it restates some of the basic priorities of the Trump administration but for the most part confines itself to flattery of the president, insults, and bombast.

Read. Writing a great memoir about choosing a “good enough” life, it turns out, is hard, Lily Meyer writes.

Listen. Bruce Springsteen’s “Streets of Minneapolis” taps into a time-old tradition to rail against a modern crisis, Spencer Kornhaber writes.

In Princeton, New Jersey, a short stroll from the university you have heard of, there lies a little campus home to the Institute for Advanced Study. It was founded in 1930 not to confer degrees nor—God forbid!—to make money, nor even to conduct research toward any end in particular. The institute proclaims that its purpose is “the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake.”

Founder Abraham Flexner reckoned that brilliant minds, once freed to pursue “useless satisfactions,” would stumble upon discoveries of “undreamed-of utility,” as he wrote in a magazine a few years into the institute’s work. It seems to have worked for Albert Einstein, who had an office there. J. Robert Oppenheimer, too.

Enjoy this week’s “useless” satisfactions. I look forward to your theory of everything the week after.

And by the way, did you know that one of the first American protest songs was “Yankee Doodle”? In 1755, a British doctor put new words to a popular tune, mocking the American colonists as “doodles,” or simpletons, and “dandies,” or fops.

Once war broke out, British fighters taunted their American opposition with the song, but as the tide shifted, the Americans embraced it and began belting it back with proud defiance. And in 1781, when the British surrendered at Yorktown, some witnesses reported that the moment was set to the music of “Yankee Doodle.”

How did you do? Come back tomorrow for more questions, and if you think up a great question after reading an Atlantic story—or simply want to share a fact—send it my way at [email protected].

And by the way, did you know that the United States spent only $10,000 on the last land that it outright purchased? In 1944, the country bought Water Island, 500 volcanic acres in the Caribbean just south of St. Thomas; it had purchased the Virgin Islands (including St. Thomas) from Denmark a few decades earlier.

Water Island was not then owned by Denmark, but rather the Danish East Asiatic Company. By World War II, the United States wanted Water Island too, to support military operations on St. Thomas, so it scooped up the land for a bargain.

This, however, was not the last time the United States tried to purchase land, and not even that decade. Two years after the Water Island purchase, the Truman administration offered Denmark $100 million in gold to buy … Greenland.

How did you do? Come back next week for more questions, and if you think up a great question after reading an Atlantic story—or simply want to share a fact—send it my way at [email protected].

And by the way, did you know that the vaunted Athenians, inventors of democracy, most commonly selected their political officeholders by chance? Bronze tokens representing the adult men of Athens would be slotted into a carved-stone device called the kleroterion, then dice would be repeatedly dropped into the contraption to rule out tokens until only the number required to hold office remained.

The proper poli-sci term for this is sortition, which also applies to how the United States selects people for jury duty today. But imagine the rest of U.S. democracy working like that: You’re tossing out your junk mail when you notice a letter from the feds—congrats, the big government Plinko board has decided you’re serving one year in Congress. Good luck!

And by the way, did you know that—speaking of snow monsters—the U.S. State Department in 1959 issued guidance on yeti expeditions? It informed Americans who wished to hunt for the abominable snowman that they would have to comply with certain rules set by Nepal: They needed to pay for a permit, they had to share any photographic evidence they found, and they were allowed to capture the yeti alive but could kill it only “in an emergency arising out of self defence.”

Alas, this did not mean that State officials believed in the monster. Rather, they were trying to show their support for Nepalese sovereignty—and thus keep the country out of the clutches of a boogeyman that scared Americans even more than the yeti: communism.

And by the way, did you know that throughout the history of the Nobel Prizes, there have been years so turbulent that the Peace Prize committee determined not to confer an award, even as other categories went on?

This happened in a few of the interwar years as Nazi Germany rearmed, Italy invaded Ethiopia, and peace generally disintegrated. It was also the case for the years of World War I, with the exception of 1917, when the committee recognized the Red Cross for its humanitarian aid. (All of the Nobel Prizes were suspended during the early years of World War II.)

The circumstances were a bit different in 1948, when the committee ruled that “there was no suitable living candidate.” The clear message was that the award—which by rule cannot be given posthumously—should have gone to Mahatma Gandhi, assassinated earlier that year.</div>

In 1915, former President Theodore Roosevelt criss-crossed the country as a champion of what he called “Americanism.” The concept was becoming commonplace in American discourse, marking a stand against what he referred to as “hyphenated Americanism.” The persistence of such identities—German American, Italian American, Jewish American—was for Roosevelt “the one absolutely certain way of bringing this nation to ruin,” creating a “tangle of squabbling nationalities.” “The foreign-born population of this country,” Roosevelt said, “must be an Americanized population—no other kind can fight the battles of America either in war or peace.”

In 1916, the writer Randolph S. Bourne offered a rejoinder in The Atlantic. In his essay, “Trans-national America,” Bourne wondered: If Americanization on the terms that Roosevelt and others had defined failed, what of it? Should immigrants not shape their own lives as they see fit? Should they deny their own cultures and identities? To be open to this sort of cultural diversity was not, Bourne wrote, “to admit the failure of Americanization. It is not to fear the failure of democracy. It is rather to urge us to an investigation of what Americanism may rightly mean.”

Bourne’s investigation came in the form of this essay, which is often glossed as a rejection of the “melting pot” ideal and an early statement on multiculturalism—long before that term was in circulation. But in its immediate context, “Trans-national America” was something more urgent. During a moment of rising xenophobia and growing war fever, it was a direct challenge to the orthodoxy that there was only one way to be an American.

The alarm about immigrants and their incomplete assimilation into American life was not new to the mid-1910s. The wave of arrivals that began in the last decades of the 19th century sparked a range of nativist and exclusionary movements—particularly against East Asians—and considerable anxiety about those deemed too alien to integrate into the culture. The prospect of American intervention in the First World War after 1914 turned alarm into panic about immigrants’ supposedly divided loyalties. Calling on Congress for defense appropriations at the end of 1915, President Woodrow Wilson lashed out at those immigrants “who have poured the poison of disloyalty into the very arteries of our national life.” “Such creatures of passion, disloyalty, and anarchy,” he said, “must be crushed out.”

For Bourne, the mood was eerily redolent of what he’d seen in Germany when the First World War broke out in the summer of 1914. As he scrambled to leave the country at the end of a post-college European tour, he saw how quickly militarism could coalesce into conformity—and how easily people could forget their principles in the process. At home in 1916, Bourne watched as calls for military “preparedness” merged with hardening definitions of loyalty and belonging.

Bourne tendered “Trans-national America” to The Atlantic (which had published his early work) to persuade Americans that they were asking the wrong questions about identity and belonging. If the melting pot had failed and the hyphenated Americans remained hyphenated, this was so much the better in Bourne’s view. Stripping new arrivals of their cultures and identities and forcing them into an Anglo-Saxon mold that didn’t fit them couldn’t be called freedom. It wasn’t even terribly American, considering so much of what passed for Anglo-Saxon culture in the United States was rooted in what Bourne saw as cowering fealty to English practice and precedent.

“Trans-national America” offered what Bourne called “a higher ideal.” America represented, in his telling, “a unique sociological fabric” as a gathering of the world’s peoples. The country’s dynamism lay not in its uniformity but in its diversity. A capacious America could avoid the fate of an Old World embroiled in a brutal military conflict. “Living here in mutual toleration, freed from the age-long tangles of races, creeds, and dynasties,” Americans could work out what Bourne called “a federated ideal” in which people were “mingled, yet not homogeneous”—in which “they merge, but they do not fuse.” This was Bourne’s concept of “trans-nationality”: a cosmopolitan American identity that embraced the world, and America itself, rather than emulating what had come before. Why, Bourne wondered, would anyone reject such a vital national formation? The alternative—“the weary old nationalism,—belligerent, exclusive, inbreeding”—was on display in a Europe at war.

Although Bourne was not an immigrant himself, he knew what it was to be an outsider in a world that was wary of them. During his birth, an obstetrician’s forceps had deformed his face; when he was a young child, spinal tuberculosis had stunted his growth and curved his spine. Bourne moved through the world keenly aware of both his disability and his difference—to which he testified with incisive clarity in a September 1911 Atlantic essay. As an undergraduate at Columbia, Bourne came to feel at home and first glimpsed the possibility of his “higher ideal” in lively intellectual exchange. To argue, debate, and ultimately understand was the foundation of what Bourne called a “Beloved Community” rooted in respect for people’s ideas and individuality. The model of the college could be expanded to the country at large, a nation built on “intellectual sympathy” for “different cultural expressions.” Such a community, Bourne said, “will make understanding and not indignation its end. Such a sympathy will unite and not divide.”

But Bourne’s essay and ideas could not stem a tide that was becoming a torrent. The continued drift toward war would only further amplify the panic over immigration. Bourne called for national educational service as a means of advancing his vision of a beloved community on a national scale; others welcomed American intervention abroad, and the conscripted military service it would require, as the best means to “yank the hyphen” out of immigrants with supposedly split loyalties. The immediate future did not belong to Bourne but to those he wrote against. Bourne’s more strident anti-war writings after “Trans-national America” would get him blackballed from most mainstream publications. The broader xenophobia of the time was built into a series of laws restricting immigration, increased suppression of dissent, and the rise of a national Ku Klux Klan that appropriated “100 percent Americanism” as its slogan.

Mercifully, perhaps, Bourne was not around to see it. He died in 1918, a victim of the flu pandemic. Although never quite forgotten, Bourne’s ideas gained new currency in the 1960s; a reflection and anthology of his work was published in 1965—the same year the Immigration and Nationality Act reversed the restrictions that had been in place since the 1920s. At least for a little while, people were able to see, as Bourne did, that “it bespeaks poverty of imagination not to be thrilled at the incalculable potentialities of so novel a union of men.”</div>

            <h2>MAGA’s War on Empathy</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/war-empathy-hillary-clinton/685809/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When I first saw the video of the killing of Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse at the Minneapolis VA hospital, I immediately thought of the parable of the Good Samaritan. Federal agents shot Pretti after he tried to help a woman they had thrown to the ground and pepper-sprayed. Jesus tells us to love our neighbors as ourselves and help those in need. “Do this and you will live,” he says. Not in Donald Trump’s America.

Americans have now seen with their own eyes the cost of President Trump’s abuse of power and disregard for the Constitution. Videos of the killing of Pretti and Renee Good by federal agents have exposed the lies of Trump-administration officials who were quick to smear the victims as “domestic terrorists.” Even Americans who have grown habituated to Trump’s excesses have been shaken by these killings and the reflexively cruel and dishonest response from the administration.

This crisis also reveals a deeper moral rot at the heart of Trump’s MAGA movement. Whatever you think about immigration policy, how can a person of conscience justify the lack of compassion and empathy for the victims in Minnesota, and for the families torn apart or hiding in fear, for the children separated from their parents or afraid to go to school?

That compassion is weak and cruelty is strong has become an article of MAGA faith. Trump and his allies believe that the more inhumane the treatment, the more likely it is to spread fear. That’s the goal of surging heavily armed federal forces into blue states such as Minnesota and Maine—street theater of the most dangerous kind. Other recent presidents, including Joe Biden, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton, managed to deport millions of undocumented immigrants without turning American cities into battlegrounds or making a show of keeping children in cages.

“The cruelty is the point,” as The Atlantic’s Adam Serwer memorably put it during Trump’s first term. The savagery is a feature, not a bug. By contrast, as Serwer noted recently in these pages, the people of Minnesota have responded with an approach you could call “‘neighborism’—a commitment to protecting the people around you, no matter who they are or where they came from.” To my ears, that’s as Christian a value as it gets.

The glorification of cruelty and rejection of compassion don’t just shape the Trump administration’s policies. Those values are also at the core of Trump’s own character and worldview. And they have become a rallying cry for a cadre of hard-right “Christian influencers” who are waging a war on empathy.

Their twisted campaign validates Trump’s personal immorality and his administration’s cruelty. It marginalizes mainstream religious leaders who espouse traditional values that conflict with Trump’s behavior and agenda. And it threatens to pave the way for an extreme vision of Christian nationalism that seeks to replace democracy with theocracy in America.

The rejection of bedrock Christian values such as dignity, mercy, and compassion did not start with the crisis in Minnesota. The tone was set right at the beginning of this second Trump presidency. The day after taking the oath of office last January, Trump attended a prayer service at the National Cathedral. The Episcopal bishop of Washington, Mariann Edgar Budde, directed part of her sermon at the new president: “In the name of our God, I ask you to have mercy upon the people in our country who are scared now.” She spoke of children of immigrant families afraid that their parents would be taken away, refugees fleeing persecution, and young LGBTQ Americans who feared for their lives. It was an honest plea, suffused with the kind of love and generosity toward neighbors and strangers that Jesus taught.

Bishop Budde was immediately vilified. One Republican congressman said she “should be added to the deportation list.” The pastor and influencer Ben Garrett warned his followers, “This snake is God’s enemy and yours too. She hates God and His people. You need to properly hate in response.” The right-wing Christian podcaster Allie Beth Stuckey called the sermon “toxic empathy that is in complete opposition to God’s Word and in support of the most satanic, destructive ideas ever conjured up.” Toxic empathy! What an oxymoron. I don’t know if the phrase reflects moral blindness or moral bankruptcy, but either way it’s appalling.

This is certainly not what I was taught in Sunday school, not what my reading of the Bible teaches me, and not what I believe Jesus preached in his short time on Earth. Yes, I went to Sunday school. In fact, my mother taught Sunday school at our Methodist church in Park Ridge, Illinois. As an adult, I occasionally taught at our church in Little Rock, Arkansas. Some people—such as the Republican congressman who once called me the Antichrist—might find this surprising. (When I confronted him, he mumbled something about not having meant it. Trump later appointed him to his Cabinet.)

I’ve never been one to wear my faith on my sleeve, but that doesn’t mean it’s not important to me. Quite the opposite: My faith has sustained me, informed me, saved me, chided me, and challenged me. I don’t know who I would be or where I would have ended up without it. So I am not a disinterested observer here. I believe that Christians like me—and people of faith more generally—have a responsibility to stand up to the extremists who use religion to divide our society and undermine our democracy.

No less a religious authority than the late Pope Francis called out the Trump administration’s war on empathy. After Vice President Vance argued that Christians should be stingy with their love, prioritizing those close to us over strangers, he offered a rebuke. “Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons and groups,” the pope noted, before urging everyone to read up on the Good Samaritan.

Luis Parrales: What the border-hawk Catholics get wrong

The contrast between traditional Christian morality and Trumpian amorality was particularly stark at the memorial service for the slain MAGA activist Charlie Kirk in September. Kirk’s widow, Erika, publicly forgave her husband’s killer. “I forgive him because it was what Christ did,” she said. “The answer to hate is not hate. The answer we know from the Gospel is love and always love.”

It reminded me of the families of the victims of the Mother Emanuel Church massacre in Charleston, South Carolina. In 2015, nine Black worshippers were murdered at an evening Bible study by a young white man trying to start a race war. In court a few days later, one by one, grieving parents and siblings stood up and told the shooter, “I forgive you.”

Instead of being inspired by Erika Kirk’s grace, though, Trump rejected it. “I hate my opponent and I don’t want the best for them,” he declared. He would not forgive his enemies. “I am sorry, Erika,” he said. So much for “Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute you.”

With leadership like this, it’s no wonder that one survey found a quarter of Republicans and nearly 40 percent of Christian nationalists now agree that “empathy is a dangerous emotion that undermines our ability to set up a society that is guided by God’s truth.” MAGA rejects the teachings of Jesus to “love thy neighbor” and care for “the last, the least, and the lost.” It recognizes only a zero-sum war of all against all. The world may look gilded from the patio at Mar-a-Lago, but the MAGA view is fundamentally fearful and impoverished. MAGA sees a world of vengeance, scorn, and humiliation, and cannot imagine generosity or solidarity.

The whole exercise is suffused with barely disguised misogyny. The extremist pastor Joe Rigney wrote a book called Leadership and the Sin of Empathy. Rigney is an ally of the influential Christian nationalist Douglas Wilson, who thinks giving women the right to vote was a mistake and advocates turning the United States into a theocracy. (Would it shock you to know that Pete Hegseth is a big fan of Wilson’s?)

Rigney declared that Bishop Budde’s plea for mercy was “a reminder that feminism is a cancer that enables the politics of empathetic manipulation and victimhood that has plagued us in the era of wokeness.” Manipulation by wily women is a sexist trope as old as Adam and Eve, but this is an ugly new twist. Instead of women tempting men with vice, now the great fear is that women will tempt men with virtue.

Christian nationalism—the belief that God has called certain Christians to exercise dominion over every aspect of American life, with no separation between Church and state—is ascendant in Trump’s Washington. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, displays a historic flag outside his office on Capitol Hill that in recent years has been embraced by Christian nationalists. The same flag was carried by insurrectionists on January 6, 2021, and flown by Justice Samuel Alito’s wife at the couple’s vacation home.

The National Council of Churches, the largest ecumenical organization for mainline churches in the country, has warned about the dangers of Christian nationalism. “In this quest for political power, Christian humility is lost, as is the message of God’s love for all humanity,” the council said in a 2021 statement. “Where the Bible has at its core the story of a people committed to welcoming aliens and strangers because they themselves were aliens and strangers, and to defending the oppressed because they themselves were once oppressed, the Christian nationalist narrative rejects the stranger and judges the oppressed as deserving of their oppression.”

This is exactly the kind of mainstream Christian view that enrages Allie Beth Stuckey. The author of Toxic Empathy, who styles herself a voice for Christian women, has more than a million followers on social media. In between lifestyle pitter-patter and her demonization of IVF treatments, she warns women not to listen to their soft hearts. This commissar of MAGA morality targets other evangelicals whose empathy, she warns, has left them open to manipulation. Maybe they recognize the humanity of an undocumented immigrant family and decide that mass deportation has gone too far. Or they make space in their heart for a young rape survivor forced to carry a pregnancy to term and start questioning the wisdom and morality of total abortion bans. It’s all toxic to Stuckey.

The don’t-love-thy-neighbor Christians have powerful allies in the war on empathy. Silicon Valley techno-authoritarians and social Darwinists argue that empathy is weakness and “suicidal” for civilization because it gets in the way of ruthless ambition and efficiency. That’s pretty rich for the crew that’s busy building artificial-intelligence systems they freely admit might obliterate humanity one day. But these are the same billionaires who dismiss critics and liberals as “NPCs,” or non-player characters, a video-game term for nonhumans. Once you see people that way, why would you care about understanding or helping them?

Elizabeth Bruenig: The conservative attack on empathy

They may be convinced that they’re the smartest guys in the room, but they’re dead wrong about this. Empathy won’t destroy civilization; indeed, it just might save it. We can debate policies. We can debate theology. But if we give up on empathy, we give up on any real chance of coming together to solve our problems. Empathy does not overwhelm our critical thinking or blind us to moral clarity. It opens our eyes to moral complexity. It’s not a sign of weakness; it’s a source of strength.

This might be lost on tycoons who have a huge financial interest in leaving the rest of us behind on their way to Mars, but one might hope Christians would know better. You don’t need to look too far back to find examples of those who do. I disagreed with President George W. Bush about many things, but I respected his sincere belief in a more “compassionate conservatism.” There was no greater proof of this commitment than the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, a mission of mercy that helped save an estimated 26 million lives. It was a public-health miracle. Many of the program’s most ardent champions were evangelical Christians inspired by Jesus’s teachings to heal the sick and feed the hungry. That hasn’t stopped the Trump administration from slashing PEPFAR and other lifesaving assistance to people in need around the world. Experts predict that 14 million people could die by 2030 as a result—including millions of children.

Some earlier leaders of the religious right were also cruel and demagogic. When I was coming up in politics, we had huckster televangelists instead of social-media snake-oil salesmen, but the game was the same: exploit religion to profiteer and push an extreme political agenda. In the 1980s, right-wing firebrands such as Jerry Falwell and Anita Bryant claimed that the AIDS epidemic was a plague sent by God to punish gay people. There was no shortage of rhetoric that I would call dehumanizing or un-Christian. These reactionary religious forces led a decades-long campaign against women’s rights and gay rights that helped turn the Republican Party against democracy itself. The rise of unabashed Christian nationalists is their legacy.

But what we’re seeing today feels different—and more dangerous. The question of who deserves empathy, and the rights and respect that flow from our shared humanity, has always been highly contested in our politics. But until now, no major American political movement has ever seriously suggested that empathy and compassion themselves are suspect.

The decline of mainstream Christian voices in recent decades left a vacuum that the most extreme ideologues and provocateurs eagerly filled. The Catholic Church and the old mainline Protestant denominations have been weakened by destabilizing scandals and schisms, and have seen declining attendance. With the percentage of Americans identifying as Christian hitting record lows, the National Council of Churches expects that as many as 100,000 churches across the country will close in the coming years, mostly mainstream Methodist, Presbyterian, and Lutheran congregations.

It has pained me to see my own United Methodist Church split by deep disagreements over gay rights. Many conservative American congregations seceded and joined with traditionalist congregations in Africa and elsewhere to form a separate, less inclusive Church. Other denominations have faced similar struggles. All of this has left room for upstarts such as Douglas Wilson’s Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches, a growing network of more than 150 Christian-nationalist congregations.

Another factor is Trump himself. No one mistakes him for a devout Christian or a person of faith or morality. But his corruption isn’t just a personal matter—it taints everything he touches, including his Christian supporters. The conventional wisdom is that Trump says out loud what many others think privately, that his blunt bigotry gives permission for people to throw off the shackles of political correctness and woke piety. That may be partly true. He does bring out the worst in people. But it’s more than that. He makes people worse. Cruelty and ugliness are infectious. When they become the norm, we all suffer.

Consider the contrast between Trump and Reagan, two presidents beloved by the religious right. Reagan offered a vision of an optimistic, sunny, welcoming America. He called it a shining city on a hill. His policies often failed to match his rhetoric, but the stories we tell ourselves matter. They shape our national narrative and shared moral framework. By contrast, Trump’s story is dark and angry, filled with “American carnage” in the streets. It makes sense that his political movement—and its version of Christianity—would be dark and angry, too.

Reagan cultivated a distinctly American mythos: the aw-shucks cowboy working his ranch and standing up to tyranny. Trump, especially in this second term, has styled himself as a gold-plated Caesar, the farthest thing from an American ideal. Instead of the decency of Washington we get the decadence of Caligula; rather than the humility of Lincoln, the cruelty of Nero. You’d think good Christians would see the irony of throwing their lot in with a wannabe Roman emperor, but the whole point of a cult of personality is to leave you blind and afraid.

Finally, I am convinced that the uniquely pernicious dynamics of social media have put all of these trends on steroids. Our addiction to algorithms has made society more lonely, anxious, and mean. Platforms like TikTok and Elon Musk’s X reward extremism and marginalize moderation. They promote negativity and smother positivity. Empathy doesn’t drive engagement, so it’s not valuable.

In the 1980s, I was impressed by Neil Postman’s book Amusing Ourselves to Death, which argued that television was corroding American society and democracy. He bemoaned how religion and politics had been reduced to shallow entertainment as a distracted public lost the ability to think clearly and debate rationally.

Today I find Postman’s warnings eerily prescient. He argued that “each medium, like language itself, makes possible a unique mode of discourse by providing a new orientation for thought, for expression, for sensibility.” Now that social media—and short-form, algorithmic video in particular—has taken over the world, it’s crucial that we understand how this medium is shaping our culture. It’s no coincidence that TikTok has given such a boost to far-right politics. It’s not just the hidden hand of the Chinese Communist Party, or the group of Trump supporters who recently bought the app’s American shell, although that’s also alarming. It’s that the medium is designed to boost vitriol and knee-jerk reactions rather than thoughtful dialogue. It provides fertile ground for misinformation and is inhospitable to serious journalism or debate.

Cultural critics have begun warning that we are at risk of becoming a “post-literate” society. They point to declining reading and math scores across the Western world in the years since the smartphone was introduced. The fear is that with fewer people reading books and newspapers, we’ll lose the ability to process complex ideas and arguments, become more susceptible to propaganda, and, to paraphrase Postman, scroll our way to oblivion.

There’s good reason to believe that a post-literate society will also be a post-moral society. We already have Christian influencers saying empathy is a sin. We have a president who is allergic to civic virtue. Americans spend countless hours on social media and are lonelier, angrier, and more distrustful than at any time I can remember.

A good place to start is to follow the example of courageous faith leaders standing up to the Trump administration’s abuses. On January 23, about 100 clergy were arrested after protesting deportation flights at the Minneapolis airport. They prayed and sang hymns in the brutal cold until police took them away. Many more have fanned out across the city to support protesters and help immigrant families in need.

David Brooks: America needs a mass movement—now

In November, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops released an unusual special message condemning “the indiscriminate mass deportation of people” and “the vilification of immigrants.” It is rare for America’s bishops to speak with one voice like this—the last time was in 2013—but they said, “We feel compelled now in this environment to raise our voices in defense of God-given human dignity.”

I hope grassroots faith leaders across the country who are appalled by what they see from an immoral administration and an extremist political right also find their voice. It is understandable that some stay silent out of fear. Influencers like Stuckey are zealously policing any deviation from the party line. But speaking truth to power has been part of the Christian tradition since the very beginning. The Christian community—and the country—would be stronger and healthier if we heard these voices.

We also need to contest this ground politically. If MAGA Republicans are going to give up on traditional virtues such as compassion and community, Democrats have an opportunity to fill that gap. The violent overreach in Minnesota may provide an opening to engage new audiences looking for alternatives. Many evangelical Christians who have long voted Republican are turned off by Trump’s venality and cruelty. Even some Republican leaders are starting to question the administration’s berserk immigration crackdown.

Democrats need a big tent that welcomes people of faith into our coalition, even if we don’t agree on every issue. Don’t forget, liberal Christianity has a long and storied history. Progressive people of faith have led virtually every major social movement. Think of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. marching with Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel in Selma. That’s a spirit we should work to reclaim.

Indeed, welcoming is not enough. Democrats should actively reach out to people of faith and try to win their trust and their votes. That dozens of liberal clergy have already signed up to run for office in the 2026 midterms is an encouraging sign. This doesn’t mean Democrats should abandon our commitments to freedom, justice, and equality for all, or fight any less hard for what we believe in. We should listen with an open heart and an open mind, and be unafraid to talk about our values.

I know empathy isn’t easy. But neither is Christianity. When Jesus called on us to turn the other cheek and pray for those who persecute us, it was supposed to be hard. We fail more than we succeed—we’re human—but the discipline is to keep trying.

It’s especially challenging to feel empathetic for people with whom we disagree passionately. I certainly struggle with this. You may remember that I once described half of Trump supporters as “the basket of deplorables.” I was talking about people drawn to racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, Islamophobia—you name it. “Some of those folks, they are irredeemable,” I said. I still believe intolerance and hatred are deplorable. Slandering a peaceful protester and cheering his murder is deplorable. Terrorizing children because their parents are undocumented is deplorable. But as a Christian, I also aspire to see the goodness in everyone and believe that everyone has a chance at redemption, no matter how remote.

When I see brutality like we’ve all witnessed in Minnesota, I ask myself: Can I really find empathy for people who insist on dehumanizing others? I’m not sure, to be honest. I’m still working on it. I believe our hearts are big enough to hold two truths at once. We can see the humanity in even the worst of our fellow human beings and still fiercely resist tyranny and repression. We can stand firm without mirroring the cruelty of our opponents. These are dark days in America. To rekindle our light, we must reject cruelty and corruption. To be strong, we need more empathy, not less.</div>

This is news? What do I do with this information? Did something change? Are you selling something? So fucking confused.

It&#39;s saying that software and the web in general have slowly become a shit experience and it&#39;s now normalized. Examining this and calling it out could help improve things. My personal peeve is a website putting up a javascript overlay asking to join their mailing list.

Was there supposed to be a link in this &quot;news story&quot;, or is /. doing short form op-eds now?

You won&#39;t, it doesn&#39;t suit your politics.

But no one cares whether you care about someone&#39;s editorial, the content was posted for its merit.  Not that you understand merit.

Serious software written by serious people for serious use is often in-house work and rarely has marketshare beyond the developers and their immediate target audience within a single organization. Sometimes it&#39;s OSS&#39;d but often it isn&#39;t even marketed outside the organization it&#39;s created in.

As such it is crowded out by software written for the hoi polloi by businesses whose model depends less on functionality and more on not getting a reputation as too hard or too geeky for broad appeal.

We just have absolutely no power to change it.

It&#39;s bestowed upon us by greedy bastards who want to sell us worthless things against our will and who know that the only way to make us pay up for all the ridiculous subscriptions and features is bully us into compliance.

If they put this into place, will they have to pay per CPU?  Per MB of memory?  Per GPU card?    Will ComcastUniversal name all of their computers Wesley.Snipes and only pay for a single instance?

And the most important questions are:If they push this through will they have to let AI generatied actresses join the union?When the majority of actors are AI instances, will they vote an AI as president of the union?

The real threat here is that AI will get good enough that producers, directors and writers can work together to achieve their artistic vision without actors. That&#39;s very different from business people vibe coding a bunch of insecure spaghetti code garbage. In this case, I&#39;m sympathetic, but not nearly as much as other industries because actors have always been just a cost of allowing creatives upstream of them in the industry to realize their vision.

That&#39;s very different from business people vibe coding a bunch of insecure spaghetti code garbage.Interesting statement. It leaves me asking in what ways though?I could say CRUD app crapped out of no-code thing like copilot, or the result of a vibe coding session by lay person has a lot in common with a genAI video as well.On this topic I keep coming back to.

On this topic I keep coming back to. If AI generates a movie, novel, song, etc and people enjoy it. What is &quot;wrong&quot; with that? We all wear clothes and use textiles practically everywhere. When was the last time you heard anyone demanding something woven by hand or complaining you can&#39;

Carrie Fisher is dead, she can&#39;t complain.

AI is going to cause a casting couch strike. The Harvey Weinsteins of the the world will be inconsolable.

He should&#39;ve taken the perfectly legal route to acquire this by feeding all their confidential information into a private LLM rather than uploading it to his personal cloud account.

Anyone with brains would have done all the downloads on the last day and headed straight to the airport never to set foot in the US again. Either he&#39;s got a very dim view of Googles security apparatus or he&#39;s just an arrogant SoB and thought he was too smart to get caught.

He uploaded the information to his personal Google Cloud account.When an employee working for Google committing an active act of espionage is THAT fucking stupid, it really puts the artificial in intelligence. This is like a bank teller robbing their own bank and then asking for a safe deposit box.  A 12-year old can feel the embarrassment here.

You&#39;ll always find people willing to be disloyal or treasonous for a payday... but in making the almighty dollar the supreme power, you&#39;re just making them cheaper and more readily available to anyone who wants them. This also means they aren&#39;t the smartest cookie in the jar either. 

This is how the tree of ultracapitalism bears fruit. At least traditional fascism had a solid concentration on the nationalism part (

My guess of why Ding uploaded to the Google Cloud: this was the only way to get the information out. That is, it couldn&#39;t be physically transported out of Google&#39;s office(s) otherwise.

Another guess: the file was encrypted before it was uploaded to the cloud. This -- and the size of the file -- may have been the tipoff that something nefarious was happening.

One more guess: A LOT of Chinese citizens are getting caught trying to steal US intellectual property. I wonder why they don&#39;t stop. So, the guess: those

They don&#39;t hire for brains, as brains can challenge the &quot;leadership&quot;. They instead hire for agendas. Besides, there is nothing of value worth stealing from goolag except for the money they have in their accounts.

He could have stolen real secrets, not &quot;AI&quot; secrets.

Finally a use for AI that actually improves people&#39;s lifes. We need more of this and less slop and deep fakes..

Absolutely.  Pattern-matching AIs that can do this sort of thing are fantastic, and are far more useful and ethical than GPTs that generate probabilistic garbage based on theft of creatives&#39; works.

Using them for linear separation of states in order to classify results is precisely how they should be used.

I remember one of the uses for image filters back in the 1990s when I was in college was to take X-rays and use different image filter types to help more easily find calcifications, tumors, and other &quot;sus&quot; items.  I&#39;m glad this is moving along, because this is where AI can be extremely helpful.  Worst case, a biopsy happens and some benign lesions are removed.

This is not AI, nor is it an LLM. This is just a solid machine learning model put to a good use. Calling it AI gives credit to the LLM grifters and hype machine.

This technology has been used in the US, even at very small hospitals, for years. Our local hospital uses iCAD [icadmed.com], and recently &quot;upgraded&quot; from the older on-site processing to the cloud-based version.

It places virtual markers (not actually on the images, but in a separate data file that mammogram viewing software understands) that indicate places of concern (areas of extra density and the like).

Isn&#39;t that supposed to be covered by unemployment benefits?

No, unemployment benefits deal with frictional unemployment. The short-term, between jobs kind.

Structural unemployment, which is what allegedly the llms are about to unleash has always been dealt with by a more complex policy.

In any case, nobody is starving to death so that is a de factor guaranteed minimum income.

Oh please learn what those words mean. Disability is something entirely different from structural unemployment.

In any case my point was simply that there already are government programs that support people long-term.  How to do it is not unknown.

Rural Americans have been supportint the policies that hurt them for a very long time now, so perhaps they have grounds to claim disability of a certain kind.

Yes but if you&#39;re dealing with mass unemployment due to AI, why set up a UBI when you could expand unemployment instead?

The theory behind UBI that I&#39;ve heard is that it saves on administrative procedures. A lot.

All the right wing nut talking points about &quot;fraud&quot; would disappear and all those billions spent on ICE and the like would go to the people.

Yeah, sure.  As if it takes much in the way of administrative procedures to operate existing unemployment benefits programs at higher benefit levels and/or longer benefit durations (it doesn&#39;t).

One of the biggest problems with existing programs is fraud (ie people making claims who shouldnt). Because such fraud happens there is then a lot of money spent on enforcement, as well as entitlement checks for anyone applying.With a UBI scheme everyone gets it by default, so there is much less fraud and no entitlement checks. Everyone simply gets it wether they&#39;re employed or not.It also means that actually working is beneficial, because someone working will always be better off than someone relying solel

How does UBI stop me from claiming twice and for my dead grandma and for twelve people who don&#39;t exist?

By: you only get it once.And no one cares about your grandma or other twelve persons ... because they have to make their own claims ... ooops. And as your grandma is dead, her UBI got suspended the day she died ... no idea what YOU want to claim about her.

One of the biggest problems with existing programs is fraud (ie people making claims who shouldnt). Because such fraud happens there is then a lot of money spent on enforcement, as well as entitlement checks for anyone applying.
With a UBI scheme everyone gets it by default, so there is much less fraud and no entitlement checks. Everyone simply gets it wether they&#39;re employed or not.
It also means that actually working is beneficial, because someone working will always be better off than someone relying solely on their UBI. Contrast that with the current system where someone on low paid work might actually be worse off, or could be claiming welfare anyway to top up their low salary (more complexity).I wonder how much less fraud there will be. As an example, a friend of my wife is working, yet has three autistic children she is receiving SSI payments for as well as support from her ex. The wife says that all three appear normal, well adjusted, and intelligent. The oldest one plans to start college in a couple years. 

All strata of people commit fraud. Or is this just the standard Slashdot narrative that the honesty, morality, and basic decency of all humans is inversely proportional to how much money t

This is called &quot;the dole&quot;, and didn&#39;t work in the US. We tried welfare, and it nearly bankrupted us.Welfare isn&#39;t bankrupting us, it never was. Welfare is a very small portion of the national budget. If you look at the budget, the largest expenses are social security and medicare. Incidentally, those could be considered a form of basic income.

Corruption is forced to give a shit otherwise.What&#39;s in a UBI name? Nothing without proper funding to keep the pitchfork-armed masses at bay.

Permanently unemployable status has been the norm for large swats of society for ages.And the idea that the llms will put all people out of work is just a fantasy of a few misguided imbeciles who live in a feedback-less world because of the low taxes they pay and their echo chamber.

Personally, I&#39;d rather not see people losing their heads.That said, I support a UBI, but as replacing most other forms of welfare.My rough US example:1. $600/month for US citizens, non-us citizen legal immigrants get a tax deduction instead that adds up to the $600 for their earn

Not now because I have to go to buy milk and then work, but later in the evening I might. Really, you could probably ask the LLM to produce a list for you, it does have a lot of history books distilled and quantized so that you don&#39;t need me.

One class were the many poor in Europe in the early middle ages, they were sent on crusades, lead by the heirless offpring of their tribal chieftains.

In the UK at least, for a large swathe of ex mining towns, disability is basically a de facto UBI for a large amount of the population in the area. Areas like Merthyr Tydfil, which had a large mining industry which is now vanished.You have something like 50% of the population who have been on disability for various things (mental health, something physical that is basically mild or made up) and have been this way since the 1980&#39;s - A lot of people who don&#39;t live in their middle class cuccoon &quot;round here&quot; wi

It&#39;s not LLMs that will replace such people, its robots and even manually operated machinery as such people are typically employed in manual labor fields anyway. And this has been happening for a long time, and spreads into more areas as robots become cheaper and more capable.

We don&#39;t have &quot;AI&quot;, we have a massive resource waste in the hope that it will produce &quot;AI&quot;. The LLM cannot even replace a creative tiktoker, nevermind someone who produces a value.

And that at the cost of destroying the future https://m.slashdot.org/story/4... [slashdot.org]

Which LLM is 0.0001 cent? Most plans I&#39;ve seen that can do what a less creatitve toktiker does will run me a bill that is higher.

The LLM can copy &quot;the creative tiktoker&quot; and put the hundreds of thousands of &quot;slightly less creative tiktokers&quot; out of work though.

That&#39;s still a lot of people.
There are still a lot of people selling worthless degrees for tens of thousands of dollars that are still confused as to exactly why those degrees are quite worthless.  Thank you for clarifying that it has a lot to do with what we call a “job” today.  If we keep bending that definition, drug dealers put “out of work” will qualify for unemployment benefits.  Along with the OF “influencer” who got fat and ugly.Copy that across every other industry and the numbers add up fast.Hopefully most other industries still employ trained professiona

The LLM cannot even replace a creative tiktoker, nevermind someone who produces a value.And yet tens of thousands are out of a job (allegedly) because of AI and not a never-Recession.  Not that the end result is really different.If said TikToker is being fed by TikTok income (and I mean that literally), then they are producing a value.  Sadly.  That value comes in the form of one less person on taxpayer subsidized social plans, simply to provide the other benefit which is avoiding mass chaos and violence in the streets when 50,000 local TikTokers are suddenly unemployable and will not survive

I don&#39;t know about the UK, but aren&#39;t unemployment benefits funded on the assumption that more people will eventually find work?

We need a new kind of disability payment, a market disability. Where being made of flesh and blood and needing sleep and food and housing is too much of a liability to make you employable anymore.

I don&#39;t know about the UK, but aren&#39;t unemployment benefits funded on the assumption that more people will eventually find work?

I principle yeah. In practice, oh boy the UK benefits system is in a bit of a mess and needs some serious reform. As a result, a lot of people are going on long term disability for mental health reasons, since its the only practical way to get support. This has no return to work provision and the benefits bill is spiralling out of control.

Sadly our PM is a moron. The reform he trie

The driving force behind benefits policy in the UK is outrage that someone else is getting something for nothing, and you are paying for it through tax.

Except when it comes to the biggest cost to the system - pensioners. Then there doesn&#39;t seem to be any limit to the burden on working people.

At the very least drivers of light vehicles like Uber drivers and pizza delivery drivers and whatnot are going to be put out of work you say it like it is a real loss for them, but it isn&#39;t. most of the money in this line is not made by the people who work, but by the people who &quot;invested&quot; in it the salaries and the taxes they don&#39;t pay.

There are no AI job losses in the UK or anywhere else.  Maybe a few call center jobs.  The rest is just excuses for a restructuring.  But this is par for the course: everyone is using AI to push their own agenda.There are a few, but it&#39;s not the bloodbath that certain people are predicting (and certain businesses are, for some reason, desperately hoping for). 

If your job is basically applying rules to data, you can be replaced by AI... Like say if your job is just putting together dashboards in PowerBI it&#39;s probably time to learn how to drive a lorry. If your job requires accuracy, intellect or being able to work with incomplete information, you&#39;re pretty safe.

And I have yet to see anyone verifiably fired because of &quot;AI&quot; - that is - fired and their job replaced by the LLM.

I have not used a call center in any capacity, ever. It is a world beyond my comprehension, really, I&#39;m not even sure it exists.

Not at all. I happen to know several technical translators (Chinese and Japanese to English and back), they have more work now and better pay than 5 years ago.

Especially technical translation was hit hard. A user manual that needed translation to 18 languages a decade ago required a translator and a reviewer for every target language. The translator was paid a fee per translated word, the reviewer a lower fee per reviewed word. (With even lower fees for repetitions or complete/fuzzy matches retrieved from translation memories or terminology databases.)

With the introduction of machine translation, that translator role all but disappeared. The reviewer role remains

Not from what I see, like I said. All translators I know are fully employed with more work than they can handle.

A private prescription provider I use has moved from having front line staff answer queries to using an LLM. To be fair, the LLM is actually more helpful than the humans were. Presumably those people are no longer employed there, or I suppose they might have been switched to other roles.

Where is all the money for this UBI going to come from?

Yeah, that&#39;s not working now so I don&#39;t see it working just because UBI is a thing.

The sad reality is that AI is likely to cause major financial stress, regardless of whether there&#39;s a bubble or not.   Once AI improves worker productivity by a huge amount there will be job losses.  That loss of jobs means less money in the economy to purchase goods and services.  Reduced demand means reduced profits for the companies that employed AI in the

I&#39;ve actually supported a UBI in the USA for years.  That said, my UBI is a lot less generous than most, making it easier to finance.Anyways:$500/month (well, $600 now).  Get a job if you want to live in an expensive area or not have roommates.Eliminate most other forms of welfare.  This actually funds the lion&#39;s share of it.  Biggest exemption would be medical, because that&#39;s too uneven of an expense.Flatten the tax brackets to tax most of the UBI back from people actually working or otherwise earning mone

Where is all the money for this UBI going to come from?

It can come from the same place that banks use to pay a trickle amount of interest on the bank accounts. And yet, banks have not faltered.

Considering that wealth is supposed to &quot;trickle down&quot;, taxing the rich makes sure that there&#39;s no blockage.

So then they need a &quot;bad Apple in every barrel approach&quot;.  Regulate for the worst offenders and if the more reasonable people don&#39;t like it, suck it up buttercup because that&#39;s life.

If it is being targetted at specific industries then it is by definition NOT a Universal Basic incomeYep, &quot;universal&quot; means everyone gets it... If it&#39;s only for specific industries it&#39;s just subsidising pay so that employees can be paid less. 

Given it&#39;s Jason Stockwood. he&#39;s probably trying get (more) subsidies for his businesses.

Even the Egyptian pharaoh knew that slave labor isn&#39;t useful for great achievements like conquering the neighboring tribes or building the pyramids. Eventually the trumpistani society will also develop to that level, or disappear.

...and robots and the Internet and personal computers and the Green revolution and shipping containers and mechanization of agriculture and internal combustion engines and railroads and canals and horse collars and on and on and on.

You could use any revolutionary productivity improvement as justification for UBI. But we&#39;ve been over this ground uncountable times in /. so time to trot out the same timeworn arguments which won&#39;t change anyone&#39;s minds.

I&#39;m sorry, it&#39;s simply offensive at this point to be expected to believe that the anglosphere will do anything about this other than mass starvation

I think UBI is premature. First it should be remove and even provide benefits to job creation.

It cost less than pay anyone to do nothing. It&#39;s better to pay to do something instead, even if the created has less value than the income. You only need to pay the difference.

Besides, UBI cost too much so it will be too low or generate lots of debt, and unemployment benefits creates a barrier between people with and without job. It becomes too unbalanced. Job required dedication and effort, while unemployment benefits it&#39;s not, for a similar income. Definitely it won&#39;t end well.

And also it&#39;s the problem that AI has an unfair different less taxes than workers, which will push for automation EVEN IF IT DOESN&#39;T GENERATE A SOCIAL IMPROVEMENT.That&#39;s because AI will get an artificial advantage through different taxation. That&#39;s the reason we need to go for the opposite. Turn job taxation to job promotion first, so the automation only reach places where it&#39;s clearly better than workers.

If automation brings a lot of new production in the future, then the government will get a lot more taxes and maybe both an unemployment benefit + UBI can be changed over time, until a day UBI would be as great as a salary, so jobs will become entirely optional and maybe done for free (as a hobby).

The AI bubble fueled by greed and hope for more greed needs additional hype fuel, so the news media is writing big headlines how AI stinks so that more hype cash is thrown into the hype engine.So far, so capitalist hype train as usual.

But now the suits n ties are using these fake headlines to justify pretty much anything because OMG AI is coming.We really are living on the wrong branch of reality.

The only way to fund this would be to finally have billionaires and huge corporations contribute their fair share, and they have been working hard to influence politics and media to prevent this. Just glance at the US: the idiocracy will make the opposite happen.Just listen to and observe the likes of Thiel and Musk. Their egomaniac, narcissistic way to influence politics through their financial power, which exceeds the financial power of most countries on Earth will cause social turmoil, civil and non civi

In a world where machines are going to do all the real work, trade will slowly start to fade.

So, to start with, universal basic income makes sense, but I predict that there will be a fundamental shift into something else. Probably closer aligned to the old socialist ideals, but with machines taking up the roles of the workers.

You can&#39;t give people the bare minimum to survive when the whole of society is built on paying people the bare minimum to survive. Why would anyone spend two hours travelling to and nine hours at work assembling widgets to barely pay for bus fares, rent and food if they got the rent and food for free?How are you going to get anyone to do the work? You can&#39;t pay people more than subsistence wages because that would cause the world to end.

Because most people don&#39;t want to live in the cheapest place they could possibly live and have no luxuries.  Living on UBI won&#39;t be pleasant!

Maybe Comcast should raise their bullshit fees again to make up the loss. Seems to be their &quot;go to&quot; move to boost their earnings. I mean, what can go wrong?

As T-Mobile taught us, price guarantees are worthless. Verizon charges an economic conditions fee regardless of guaranteed prices.

Hell, even here in the UK it&#39;s only been a year since mid contract price rises have to be expressly stated in pounds and pence (actual money) instead of vague allusions to a percentage.

I&#39;m trading one asshole for another.  AT&T is currently ripping up my neighborhood, laying fiber.  Nearly 20 years after they said they would.

They likely won&#39;t lose the elderly, inertia and all that.  But I&#39;ll jump ship the instant it&#39;s declared &#39;stable&#39;

AT&T has an shit router unless you bypass it and don&#39;t get that air shit (lower caps / not an real IPv4)

You won&#39;t get real legacy IP with most new providers these days, at least not without playing extra - sometimes a lot.

The only reason companies like comcast can offer it is because they got huge allocations back when that was possible, and since their customer base is declining they have plenty spare.

I pay $90 for 5gb/5gb fiber that usually performs at least 4.7gb each way on average. I pay $275 a year for visible for my phone.

Before that I paid $139 a month for xfinity &#39;gigabit&#39; internet which was at best 600mbps/30mbps and $100 a month to verizon for cell service.

I&#39;ll keep the fiber and verizon&#39;s own MVNO which has performed as good as verizon every day for the last 2 years.

When Metronet came through my area I&#39;m fairly sure every single person switched. I haven&#39;t seen a Xfinity truck in ages out here.

The fun part was comcast knew about it, so they went down the street and installed the underground pull boxes to try to stop it.

Metronet saw the other side of the street was better anyways and installed their pull boxes. Those comcast ones have been empty now for years.

Maybe... just maybe... they shouldn&#39;t have god awful fucking shit quality service, both the ISP connection itself, and their customer service !?

They&#39;ve spent decades abusing their customers (and everyone else) with their endless corporate bullshit, network abuse, price hikes, service outages, etc...

And when people start finding reasonable alternatives, SURPRISE.... They take advantage of them.

Thats what happens when you lose your monopoly spamcast.  The second I was able to get fiber at my premise, I dropped them the same day.

Got 3 times the speed, for half the price.  Latency also dropped quite a bit too.

Last year I switched from XFinity broadband to a local company called Ezee Fiber. XFinity kept raising their prices, they make it all but impossible to bring your own devices (cable modems), and there were numerous service outages. The last straw was when service went out on a Friday, and they said they could come out and take a look at the problem by the next Wednesday. Instead, I switched providers, and had my service up and running the next day. Plus, it was 5x faster (5 GBps) and came with a WiFi 6 router with no monthly rental fees. I did not save money on the new service, but the customer service is 10x better. So far, I&#39;m very happy with the switch.

must be nice to have an local company with fiber not all of us have that. For some it&#39;s comcast or slow DSL maybe an 2th cable co.

Nice, but I had to wait years before it arrived.

Yeah, they literally just laid fiber in our neighborhood a couple of years ago. For many years, Comcast was the only option.

Funny thing is, after EzeeFiber came through the neighborhood, AT&T decided they&#39;d better get in on the act, and they too laid fiber. But while EzeeFiber took a month or two to lay fiber to 2500 homes, AT&T took a couple of years, and hit several gas lines in the process. Still having three options is nice, and keeps prices down.

I&#39;m no fan of Xfinity, but i had them for about 15 years until about 4 years ago and bringing a modem wasn&#39;t an issue.  First i had some &quot;Surfboard&quot; and later bought a Netgear DOCSIS 3  from Costco.   They were both fine.   (only issue was that you had to call them to provision because they lock to the first MAC address they see).

My main problems with them:a) very asymmetric.  slow upstream.   even at 1+Gbps down it&#39;s like 30mbps or 40mbps up.   It&#39;s _mostly_ fine but if you have a number of people in the h

Your experience with bringing your own equipment doesn&#39;t match mine. Sure, they &quot;officially&quot; said you could do it. But then when something didn&#39;t work, the answer from support was always &quot;sorry, we don&#39;t support that modem&quot; even though it was on their approved list.

10,000,000 satellites in space beaming internet. And no they won&#39;t Kessler-ize. They won&#39;t collide often either as they will be placed in low earth orbits fifty to a hundred miles from each other (space is huge). That&#39;s the future.

Space will always be slower. There&#39;s only so much radio spectrum. There&#39;s no point having satellites 50 miles apart, they&#39;ll be getting signal from the same customers, so the same bandwidth is shared. You&#39;d need some fancy beam forming tech or tracking antennas to mitigate that. And you&#39;re also sharing bandwidth with an entire neighbourhood.

How does a terrestrial antenna deal with that?

Is this sarcasm? 10,000,000 satellites would cost trillions of dollars, and hundreds of billions of dollars per year to replace failing satellites... There probably isn&#39;t enough launch capability in the world to maintain such a network. I don&#39;t know why you would choose starlink over any terrestrial service with comparable speed. It&#39;s a niche product for rural customers and underdeveloped nations. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it&#39;s only &quot;profitable&quot; due to some sort of clever accounting where costs are hidden

So? A trillion spend would be less than global 5G deployment cost to date (which is terribly spotty coverage). By the way any rational examination of this would show deploying those 10 million satellites will cost about half a trillion at most ($50k per satellite, of which $20k is the launch cost on Starship). Note: A mass produced satellite should actually cost way less than $30k per (they don&#39;t use any fancy materials). Also, I am assuming the satellite will weigh more than a Starlink v2 mini AND assuming

Total bullshit. SpaceX current cost is 500-1000 times that. A terrestrial cell tower costs upwards of a million dollars, and that isn&#39;t for spaceworthy hardware that must run for years with zero maintenance, nor including all the satellite specific hardware that has nothing to do with providing service.

Those costs are as likely to happen as Elon is to make good on any of his full self driving, robotaxi, or Optimus promises.

You probably think he will be launching AI datacenters to space, too.

I used them for several years, and they dropped out nearly every time it rained. Which wasn&#39;t just an inconvenience - I work from home.

I got a second ISP account with a local provider, who didn&#39;t have the best reputation for reliability, but I used them as a backup.

After I set up monitoring on the lines I realized my connection to the local ISP was actually really stable, and dropped Comcast.

It was a great decision. No calling to negotiate the price down every year, it works in the rain, and the people there are really nice. They cost about 1/3 what Comcast charged, too.

You burnt too many bridges over the last 20+ years. Now you wonder why customers are leaving when they can. As soon as fiber became available in my area I instantly switched. It&#39;s less than half the price, many times faster, and far more reliable. Oh, and my fiber provider has a TRUE price guarantee. What is advertised is what I pay, not a penny more, and in over two years now no price increases. You&#39;re a relic Comcast ... bye bye. Your asshole ways did you in.

Let&#39;s add that they don&#39;t truly have unlimited, and if you want truly unlimited, you need to pay for truly unlimited... Huh fuckers. Another $50!

Plus, their cable upload sucks. We&#39;re among the people who moved away from Comcast 1gb down/100mbps up... and were paying close to $200/month for truly-truly-really-unlimited to now $95 for about 750 Mbps download/upload via fixed wireless. So far, it&#39;s been working great.

No such thing as truly unlimited...every line has a rating and there are only so many minutes in the day.

I had Comcast. I signed up for some reasonable price agreed on the phone, then they started sending me bills for about 250 USD (for internet + cable).

Eventually I switched to a local competitor. They offered Ethernet to my apartment, with unlimited IPv4 internet IPs with no NAT (seriously) for only 60 USD/month. On top of that a few extra bucks for streaming services and it&#39;s better service for half the price.

Then Comcast in their genius tried sending me to a debt collector.

Their standard service was still 8 times slower on upload versus download the last time I checked.

Despite the pandemic showing us that we need two-way video to do virtual anything, so service is limited by the slowest data direction.

I&#39;m considering moving to a senior living place in the next year or so.  One sticking point is that their building ISP is Comcast.I&#39;m a software engineer - my work network meetings are mostly audio and screen sharing, so I can tolerate asymmetric data, barely.My wife is a sign l

Yes, on cable they are. I have their fastest service which is 2 Gbps down. Upstream is about 300 Mbps. I wish it was symmetrical.

Their history of poor customer service and the talk of data caps means people are doing exactly what they should:  shopping elsewhere.

Have not ended. You still have to call every year to stop your bill from doubling. A few years ago, they wouldn&#39;t budget on the price. I ended up switching to a fixed wireless ISP. It sacked, sadly. I&#39;m back on Comcast. Currently at $80/month on 2 Gbps/300 Mbps.

Their advertised price is now $100/month with 5 year guarantee. I would not take that deal now if my contract ended.

Indeed. This is why they rebranded to Xfinity. But the word has gotten out on that, too.

Their network assets should be turned over to smaller local providers, perhaps municipal, that actually care about their customers.

Pretty much universally, everyone hates Comcast.  Their business model has for years been, &quot;do everything possible to suppress competition, then raise prices and reduce the level of service&quot;.  Everywhere they&#39;re being competed with, they have excellent service and low prices (and are fighting hard to get other players out of their market and lobbying against municipal broadband).  Everywhere else, you pay them because they&#39;re the only option, and you get what you get.

Comcast tried to block the installation of Utah&#39;s UTOPIA fiber network, somehow forgetting the same easements that allowed their cable lines to be run on utility poles allowed UTOPIA to do the same. As a result, symmetrical gigabit service at home costs $65 per month while Xfinity costs almost $100 with upload speeds of only 24mbit even with gigabit level service tier and they push sooo hard to sell you a package deal with cable and phone service that almost doubles your bill after the introductory period.

Switched from Comcast to AT&T fiber a little over a year ago. Bypassing their gateway with a custom SFP module. Literally get 125% of advertised speeds, symmetrical, 24/7, zero outages, working IPv6 PD. All for the same price as service from Comcast advertised as the same speed but delivering about 25% down and 10% up.

I kept getting emails from their marketing department saying &quot;your cable modem is too slow&quot;, despite having purchased a DOCSIS 3.0 gigabit modem. Felt big brother-y and greedy. Didn&#39;t like

The optimistic story about the FBI’s surprising Wednesday raid on Fulton County, Georgia, voting offices to seize ballots and electronic materials related to the 2020 election is that it’s another instance of the United States Department of Justice and other parts of the federal government indulging in Donald Trump’s fantastical belief that he lost the presidential election to Joe Biden in 2020 because of fraud. If that reason for the raid is right, the investigation will amount to very little, even if Trump and allies mangle whatever evidence the FBI produces to continue spreading ridiculous voter fraud claims. If the government attempts to bring criminal charges (that may well be barred by the statute of limitations), they are far more likely to be about Trump’s retribution campaign than about actual intentional violations of federal law protecting the integrity of elections.

The pessimistic story is far darker. It’s about the raid being a test run for messing with election administrators and the counting of ballots in the midterm elections in 2026, when control of both houses of Congress could be at stake. Now is the time for state and local governments, the courts, and the people to work against such potential election subversion.

The Fulton County saga goes back to the hotly contested 2020 presidential election, which was conducted in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Donald Trump was an unpopular incumbent running against former Vice President Joe Biden. Many states made it easier for people to vote by mail in 2020, which was much safer than voting in person and potentially getting sick. Trump had long spread unsubstantiated claims about voter fraud, from massive noncitizen voting to fraud committed in large American cities like Philadelphia and Detroit that have substantial minority populations. But during 2020, Trump turned his propaganda machine on the influx of mail-in ballots, which he claimed would be infected by fraud; never mind that he regularly voted by mail in his home state of Florida.

Election results came in slowly, thanks in part to the slower count necessary to properly process the flood of mail-in ballots. When the numbers were released, Biden had won, including in Georgia, where he claimed victory by a slim margin. Trump tried various tactics to overturn that result and others. Before the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol—an unsuccessful attempt to stop Congress from counting states’ Electoral College votes and declare Trump the winner—Trump leaned on election administrators and elected officials in states with majority-Republican legislatures to overturn the results. Even though Georgia had conducted a hand recount of all the state’s ballots that confirmed Biden’s victory, Trump notoriously pressured Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to “find” 11,780 votes to flip the results to him. Raffensperger refused.

While Trump worked the refs, his allies worked the public, and much of the effort to gin up fraud claims focused on the processing of ballots in State Farm Arena by Fulton County election workers. Focusing on an area with a large population of Black voters was par for the course among Trump’s fraudulent fraud-squad members. Rudy Giuliani falsely accused two election workers there of fraud (as well as passing around drugs), and they faced threats and harassment; the workers, Wandrea Moss and her mother, Ruby Freedman, won a $148 million defamation suit against Giuliani, which later settled.

Fulton County, like many large counties in the United States, has seen its share of election administration mismanagement. But a yearslong investigation by state officials found no intentional wrongdoing and nothing that would have changed the 2020 outcome.

Given the deep investigations of the 2020 elections generally and Fulton County, Georgia, in particular, it is highly unlikely that the new FBI investigation (whose warrant was curiously sought by a U.S. attorney in Missouri, not Georgia or even Washington, D.C.) will amount to anything. So what was it really about?

One tipoff is the curious appearance during the FBI raid of Fulton County’s election offices of Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, who is known to peddle conspiracy theories herself. Portraying this raid as part of a national security effort is in line with the musings of Cleta Mitchell, a Trump conspiracy-theory ally who had been on Trump’s call with Raffensperger. Back in September, Mitchell, on a call with fellow election deniers, suggested that Trump could declare a “national sovereignty crisis” in a bid to take over the midterm elections.

Trump has no power over the conduct of federal elections, which are left in the hands of the states, a point numerous courts have made recently in striking down parts of an August Trump executive order purporting to make voting harder. But that doesn’t mean he won’t try. Trump has expressed regret that he did not seize voting machines in 2020. So this threat for 2026 (and 2028) is real.

So what can be done about all of this? To begin with, state and local election officials need to be ready to go to federal court to seek injunctions barring the government from seizing voting machines or otherwise interfering with the process of tabulating ballots. Trump might even try to send troops to seize ballots without a search warrant, and if that threat is real, proactive judicial action is necessary. These threats are most likely to materialize in those areas around the country with contested congressional races. Particular targets may be in those states, such as California and Arizona, where the tabulation of ballots takes a long time, so there is more time for Trump and his allies to act.

State officials and the public need to support, with dollars and volunteers, election administrators and those who would hold the line against interference. The greater the transparency of the work of these administrators in tabulating ballots, and the quicker a fair count can take place, the harder it will be for Trump to have a legal excuse to try to interfere with the balloting.

Donald Trump is not going to be able to cancel U.S. elections. But the events this week in Fulton County remind us that he has many tools at his disposal to try to mess with them. It’s not too early to plan against another attempt to overturn democratically conducted elections in the United States.

How do you stop someone from killing someone else? In most societies, we do so with warnings, promises, and contracts. We make laws to make ourselves feel safe. It’s important to feel safe, because reality is terrifying. In Minneapolis this weekend, we saw reality: a group of men with guns, in a semicircle, firing a barrage of shots into a man’s body lying on the ground. The laws that were supposed to protect Alex Pretti—the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, multiple state and local and national statutes on use of force—failed. Pretti’s death, captured on video from multiple angles, was so shocking that even the Trump administration has been forced to rethink its brutal tactics in the Twin Cities, which for more than a month has been ravaged by an onslaught of federal agents ostensibly conducting “immigration enforcement.”

Now, the Trump administration is shifting its approach, or at least its messaging. Gregory Bovino, the cartoonishly fascist figurehead of Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s operations in the Twin Cities, has been removed from his post and forced off social media. Kristi Noem, Bovino’s boss at the Department of Homeland Security, received a brief, but significant, rebuke from the president. The Democrats, America’s sluggish and often ineffectual opposition party, are howling for investigations, firings, and impeachments.

It’s tempting to see these developments as a victory, as the rule of law slowly reasserting itself over a deadly aberration in America’s social contract. Soon, you might think, things may go back to normal. But in Donald Trump’s America, the contract has been rewritten. The conditions that caused Pretti’s death still exist—in Minneapolis, in Maine, in California, in every city and every town where agents of the state carry guns. The goon squads are here to stay, and it’s only a matter of time until they kill again.

What this reflects is more than the Trump administration’s vicious immigration policies, but a broader shift in American politics. Inside the West Wing, a terrifying new political ideology is on display, one that says the right to shape, change, and end Americans lives is not granted by a democratic framework of laws, but by a simple equation of who has more guns.

This shift was not immediate. During the first Trump administration, the snarl of legal jurisprudence that slowed down many of Trump’s most egregious excesses also lured us into a false sense of comfort that the law still worked, and that the contract still held—and sometimes it did. When Trump attempted to overturn the 2020 election, the system worked. Judges threw out his cases. When rioters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, they were prosecuted en masse for their crimes. Trump himself was impeached, though never convicted, thanks to the cowardice of a bloc of Republican senators.

Upon entering his second term, Trump went for it, not so much testing as smashing through the constraints of legal precedent—he pardoned the criminals who stormed the Capitol on his behalf and indicted many of the officials that, in turn, had indicted him. On the border, he saw a chance to test his might: calling in Marines to quell protesters in Los Angeles and increasing the DHS’s purview to arrest, detain, and raid far outside of their preexisting jurisdictions.

The guardrails are not holding this time around.

Minneapolis represents the most stark example of the rule of the gun thus far. During “Operation Metro Storm,” the ominously named federal operation in the Twin Cities, federal agents have shot three people, killed two, and injured dozens with pepper spray, rubber bullets, tear gas, and fists. Until Pretti’s death finally tipped the scales, Noem and other figures in the administration doubled and tripled down on their mandate to use force. Jonathan Ross, the agent who shot Renee Good, the first person killed by ICE in the Twin Cities, currently faces no charges, after the FBI intervened to toss out the state-level investigation into the killing.

Federal agents have repeatedly violated protesters’ First Amendment rights, detained citizens and noncitizens alike unlawfully, and even sought to prevent detainees from accessing legal counsel. The Department of Justice, instead of investigating these abuses, has instead leveled charges on the protesters. There are videos all over social media of officers, after Good’s killing, taunting protesters with threats that they will be next. The men with guns knew the power they held. They knew no one could stop them from killing.

And so when Alex Pretti stood up in the middle of the street, filming them with his phone, and intervened to try to help another civilian they had pushed to the ground, they shot him. He had, after all, committed a crime in their eyes: He had resisted the administration’s will. The agents who killed Pretti have not been identified or charged; like in Good’s killing, there will be no federal civil rights investigation, only an internal process overseen by the department that fired the shots. (Two of the agents involved in shooting Pretti have now been put on leave, but that’s a far cry from meaningful consequences for what they did.) Even if, by some miracle, Good’s and Pretti’s killers are eventually brought to justice, their individual consequences do nothing to subvert ICE’s mandate of force wherever it appears. ICE can afford to discipline or lose an agent or two to mollify public opinion. They have plenty more operating, still, under the same rules of engagement.

Under Trump’s new government-by-gun, individuals are presented with a choice between obedience and execution—or at least the ever-present danger of it. And without legal recompense, the only check to this power appears to be other armed men.

In Maine, where ICE and other agencies have been conducting snatch-and-grab arrests and targeted harassment of protesters similar to those in Minneapolis, local law enforcement has already staked out a hard line against their excesses, something that Minneapolis’ authorities were slow to do. Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce called ICE’s actions “bush-league policing” in an interview on Sunday, after federal agents mistakenly arrested a local corrections officer. This pressure has also changed the situation in Minneapolis, where Gov. Tim Walz has managed to muster a largely tepid show of force from his own military, the Minnesota National Guard, deploying them to the streets in cute reflective vests with donuts and coffee.

It’s easy to see those images and miss what they mean. The National Guard is often seen as a friendly force that shows up with bottled water during hurricanes and digs out roads after mudslides. But that’s not what they are: They are armed forces that are ostensibly under the command of a state governor. Their presence on the streets of Minneapolis, orange vests and all, is a show of force by a state military aligned opposite of a federal military. Right now, it’s no more than optics. But lines are being drawn.

And things could always get worse. The National Guard and domestic police are not sympathetic forces to many of this country’s marginalized groups. In L.A. and D.C., National Guard troops squared up with protesters themselves, and their orders come from political actors—governors, mayors, and other politicians with their own biases and agendas.

Soldiers and police, however, are not the only people in America who have guns. As the top levels of our political system wield violence in the open, it’s only a matter of time before people tired of having guns pointed at them may decide that it’s time to have more guns to point back. Communities I have reported on for years are beginning to mobilize again. Online, left-wing accounts and marginalized groups are openly championing the Second Amendment, abandoning arguments for reasonable gun control in favor of arming themselves to face a future in which their only defense is through open force. There was nothing to stop ICE agents from killing Alex Pretti, their thinking goes, so the next time it happens someone might as well shoot back. A brutal occupation unrestrained by any notion of fairness or recompense often inspires a violent response, which would plunge our society into circumstances it has rarely, if ever, seen before: widespread violence on the streets and guerilla attacks on federal forces that inspire even more brutal reprisals and repression.

It’s still possible to regain control of our society before we get to that point; to organize and protest and document well enough that a better future is made possible before the rule of the gun is all we have left. We’ve seen that approach have some success , in this specific case: The administration’s excesses were so blatant and cruel—and so highly publicized—that politicians on both sides of the aisle were forced to hold them to account. But so far, Trump’s response looks more like damage control than a larger shift in approach. The goon squads are still on the streets, still hauling people into their vans. They will learn from this defeat. They will get better at killing. And unless we find a way to upset the architects of our new political order, they’re almost certainly going to do it again.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Countries intent on digital sovereignty will need to invest at least 1 percent of their entire gross domestic product (GDP) into AI infrastructure by 2029, according to analyst biz Gartner.

The consultant claims digital sovereignty will lead to countries being locked into region-specific AI platforms based on proprietary contextual data. This means their domestic AI stacks may be bespoke, with reduced collaboration and duplication of effort driving up the cost.

&quot;Countries with digital sovereignty goals are increasing investment in domestic AI stacks as they look for alternatives to the closed US model, including computing power, datacenters, infrastructure and models aligned with local laws, culture, and region,&quot; said Gartner VP Analyst Gaurav Gupta.

Gartner reckons 35 percent of countries will be locked into region-specific systems by next year.

Localized models deliver more contextual value, outperforming non-customized global models in applications such as education, legal compliance, and public services, Gartner says, especially in non-English languages.

Concerns over digital or data sovereignty have been around for years with the growing dominance of US tech giants. But these were turbocharged last year following the inauguration of President Trump, whose behavior has at times been erratic and his policies often punitive.

Many of the largest AI companies are either American or US-owned, but Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella argued recently that AI sovereignty is less about where the application runs and more about who controls it.

The problem for Europe and other regions in their quest for digital sovereignty is the dependency on US cloud infrastructure, hence the need for nations to spend more on AI infrastructure of their own.

&quot;Datacenters and AI factory infrastructure form the critical backbone of the AI stack that enables AI sovereignty,&quot; claimed Gupta.

&quot;AI factory&quot; is an industry buzzword that essentially means a server farm dedicated to AI processing.

&quot;As a result, datacenters and AI factory infrastructure will see explosive build-up and investment going forward, propelling a few companies that control the AI stack to achieve double-digit, trillion-dollar valuations,&quot; Gupta said.

However, 1 percent of GDP – the total value of a country&#39;s entire economic activity – is a substantial amount. In the UK, for example, this would equate to about £30 billion ($39 billion).

This is overshadowed by many of the US tech giants, which are already investing more into infrastructure for AI than the entire GDP of some countries. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI is sunsetting some of its ChatGPT models next month, a move it knows &quot;will feel frustrating for some users.&quot;

GPT‑4o, GPT‑4.1, GPT‑4.1 mini, and OpenAI o4-mini are on the way out on February 13, alongside GPT-5 (Instant and Thinking). The retirements apply to ChatGPT. &quot;In the API, there are no changes at this time,&quot; the company stated.

It isn&#39;t the first time OpenAI has attempted to pull the plug on GPT-4o – the model was deprecated last year following the rollout of GPT-5. However, the subsequent outcry resulted in a U-turn, and OpenAI restored both the model and the ability to select it.

According to OpenAI, users &quot;preferred GPT‑4o&#39;s conversational style and warmth,&quot; prompting it to tweak subsequent releases. Most usage is now on GPT-5.2, with only 0.1 percent of users choosing GPT-4o each day.

After the furor, OpenAI boss Sam Altman said of GPT-4o: &quot;If we ever do deprecate it, we will give plenty of notice.&quot; Confirmation of the latest changes is dated January 29, meaning there are two weeks before the model will be pulled from ChatGPT.

The response has been considerably more muted compared to last year&#39;s deprecation attempt. One user on Reddit grumbled: &quot;This sucks. I still use 4o daily. It just has a different personality and gives better nuance to certain questions. I&#39;ll use 5.2 as well, but it doesn&#39;t replace 4o. I don&#39;t see why they can&#39;t just leave it well alone.&quot;

But considering the low usage levels and the fact most users will have stuck with the defaults and gone nowhere with GPT-4o, the decision is understandable, despite the relatively short notice.

&quot;Changes like this take time to adjust to... and we didn&#39;t make this decision lightly,&quot; OpenAI said.

Probably best not to get too attached to that AI virtual buddy. You never know when somebody might decide that the time has come to decommission it. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">HashiCorp co-founder Mitchell Hashimoto took to X this week to unveil the secret of workplace success: stay off your phone, sweep the floor, and clean the machines after that.

Hashimoto co-founded HashiCorp in 2012, acting as CEO for four years before becoming CTO, then stepping back from the corporation in 2021. During that time, HashiCorp launched infrastructure-as-code tool Terraform, as well as other products central to the cloud-native wave.

The business was then sold to IBM in 2024, by which time Hashimoto was devoting himself to other coding projects, primarily terminal emulator Ghostty. And flying planes.

So life is good. But not perfect, as he told the X sphere this week.

&quot;Appalled when I see workers on their phones. My dad used to always say &#39;there&#39;s always something to do.&#39; No customers? Sweep the floor. Floor swept? Clean the machines. Machines clean? Organize stock. Organized? Clean again. Insane that anyone lets you on your phone lol. (I worked in various forms of customer-facing retail for about 7 years, but this extends beyond that).&quot;

It wasn&#39;t clear whether Mitchell was talking about software engineers, retail or hospitality workers, or public employees.

Nevertheless, he sparked a long thread about how his sweeping approach scales from a retail outlet, or similar, to a hundreds or thousands-strong company. Like a major software vendor perhaps. Or even a small one.

One responder, @afterlanie, said: &quot;My thought tends more towards that they&#39;re not being paid enough to care, and this is a company culture issue. employees who feel invested in the work/culture, and see potential for growth don&#39;t sit on their phones.&quot;

While fellow founder and engineer @Doom_S_dey opined: &quot;Slack isn&#39;t laziness, it&#39;s capacity. It&#39;s how teams absorb rushes, train new hires, and stay accurate when things get hectic.&quot;

The Reg is pretty sure they didn&#39;t mean the chat platform Slack. Though maybe...

On the other hand, as @Simantak242172 said: &quot;Gotta do something while Claude Code is &#39;schellepping.&#39;&quot;

And @zwuvincent added: &quot;Maybe they&#39;re orchestrating agents.&quot;

Or maybe we&#39;re not just talking retail staff or engineers. @jreidgreer said: &quot;Drives me absolutely insane when I&#39;m in NYC and half of the NYPD is on their phones.&quot;

To be fair, it&#39;s not just about sweeping and cleaning machines. Mitchell was clear about the need to organize stock. After all, his stake in HashiCorp was estimated to be worth around half a billion dollars at the time of the sale. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Opinion I&#39;m an eighth-generation American, and let me tell you, I wouldn&#39;t trust my data, secrets, or services to a US company these days for love or money. Under our current government, we&#39;re simply not trustworthy.

In the Trump‑redux era of 2026, European enterprises are finally taking data seriously, and that means packing up from Redmond-by-Seattle and moving their most sensitive workloads home. This isn&#39;t just compliance theater; it&#39;s a straight‑up national economic security play.

Europe&#39;s digital sovereignty paranoia, long waved off as regulatory chatter, is now feeding directly into procurement decisions. Gartner told The Reg last year that IT spending in Europe is set to grow by 11 percent in 2026, hitting $1.4 trillion, with a big chunk rolling into &quot;sovereign cloud&quot; options and on‑prem/edge architectures.

The kicker? Fully 61 percent of European CIOs and tech leaders say they want to increase their use of local cloud providers. More than half say geopolitics will prevent them from leaning further on US‑based hyperscalers.

The American hypercloud vendors have figured this out. AWS recently made its European Sovereign Cloud available. This AWS cloud, Amazon claims, is &quot;entirely located within the EU, and physically and logically separate from other AWS Regions.&quot; On top of that, EU residents will &quot;independently operate it&quot; and &quot;be backed by strong technical controls, sovereign assurances, and legal protections designed to meet the needs of European governments and enterprises for sensitive data.&quot;

Many EU-based companies aren&#39;t pleased with this Euro-washing of American hypercloud services. The Cloud Infrastructure Service Providers in Europe (CISPE) trade association accuses the EU Cloud Sovereignty Framework of being set up to favor the incumbent (American) hypercloud providers.

You don&#39;t need a DEA warrant or a Justice Department subpoena to see the trend: Europe&#39;s 90‑plus‑percent dependency on US cloud infrastructure, as former European Commission advisor Cristina Caffarra put it, is a single‑shock‑event security nightmare waiting to rupture the EU&#39;s digital stability.

Seriously. What will you do if Washington decides to unplug you? Say Trump gets up on the wrong side of the bed and decides to invade Greenland. There goes NATO, and in all the saber-rattling leading up to the 10th Mountain Division being shipped to Nuuk, he orders American companies to cut their services to all EU countries and the UK.

With the way things are going, they&#39;re not going to say no. I mean, CEOs Tim Cook of Apple, Eric Yuan of Zoom, Lisa Su of AMD, and – pay attention – Amazon&#39;s Andy Jassy all went obediently to watch a feature-length White House screening of Melania, the universally-loathed, 104‑minute Amazon‑produced documentary about First Lady Melania Trump.

Sure, that&#39;s a silly example, but for American companies to do business today, they&#39;re kowtowing to Trump. Or, take a far more serious example, when Minnesota company CEOs called for &quot;de-escalation&quot; in the state, there was not one word about ICE or the government&#39;s role in the bloodshed. It was the corporate equivalent of the mealy-mouthed &quot;thoughts and prayers&quot; American right-wingers always say after a US school shooting.

Some companies have already figured out which way the wind is blowing. Airbus, the European aerospace titan, has put out a €50 million, decade‑long tender to migrate its mission‑critical applications to a &quot;sovereign European cloud.&quot; Airbus wants its whole stack – data at rest, data in transit, logging, IAM, and security‑monitoring infrastructure – all rooted in EU law and overseen by EU operators. As Catherine Jestin, Airbus&#39;s executive vice president of digital, told The Register: &quot;We want to ensure this information remains under European control.&quot;

Who can blame them? Thanks to the American CLOUD Act and related US surveillance statutes, US‑headquartered providers must hand over European data regardless of where the bytes sit. Exhibit A is that Microsoft has already conceded that it cannot guarantee data independence from US law enforcement. Airbus is betting that &quot;data residency on paper&quot; from AWS‑styled &quot;EU sections&quot; is not enough. Real sovereignty demands EU‑owned and run operations with full contractual and legal firewalls. Sure, your data may live in Frankfurt, but your fate still rests in Seattle, Redmond, or Mountain View if an American company owns your cloud provider.

Besides, do you really want some Trump apparatchik getting their hands on your data? I mean, this is a government where Madhu Gottumukkala, the acting director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, uploaded sensitive data into ChatGPT!

In response, Brussels is pushing an open source‑led exit from hyperscaler lock‑in. Ministries are standardizing on Nextcloud‑style collaboration stacks instead of Microsoft 365 to fund Euro‑native clouds via the European Cloud Alliance. Some countries, like France, are already shoving Zoom, Teams, and other US videoconferencing platforms out the door in favor of a local service.

If you&#39;re running an EU‑based firm in 2026, the takeaway isn&#39;t that AWS‑in‑Frankfurt is evil; it&#39;s that for certain workloads, especially national security, industrial IP, or high‑profile consumer data franchises, EU‑native cloud and services are no longer a nice‑to‑have but a business continuity plan requirement.

It&#39;s time to get serious about digital sovereignty. The clock is ticking, and there&#39;s no telling when Trump will go off. ®

            <div id="article-text">Bark!Bark!Bark! Sellafield Ltd is to use Boston Dynamics&#39; Spot robot dogs in &quot;routine, business-as-usual operations&quot; amid the ongoing cleanup and decommissioning of the notorious UK nuclear site.

Plans for day-to-day use of the mechanical quadrupeds were disclosed in a case study detailing the trial of the technology over the last few years.

As Sellafield Ltd noted: &quot;Sellafield is one of the most complex nuclear sites in the world. Parts of the site are hazardous and can be difficult or unsafe to access.&quot;

This all dates back to the Cold War era, when the government rushed to develop nuclear materials and weapons at the site – then called Windscale – without considering the need for managing and clearing the resulting nuclear waste. The situation wasn&#39;t helped by a fire in 1957 that led to the escape of radioactive fallout.

As the case study explains: &quot;Our decommissioning work increasingly depends on high quality inspections. These ensure accurate data collection, enabling timely decision-making.&quot;

Sending humans into &quot;radiological or industrially risky areas, confined spaces, or locations with restricted access&quot; raises quite a lot of HR issues. Sending in the likes of Boston Dynamics&#39; robo-hounds is far less of an ethical dilemma.

So the site has started using the robots for &quot;routine tasks such as mapping, data capture, and characterization.&quot; This includes 3D scanning and livestreaming information.

The devices are fitted with &quot;radiation resistant sensing systems and enhanced data collection payloads&quot; and sensors including LiDAR and &quot;gamma and alpha characterization.&quot;

The &quot;perception systems&quot; were developed with Createc, while AtkinsRéalis has worked on systems integration and mission planning. Other collaborators include UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA), Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), Sellafield Ltd, the University of Manchester, and AWE Nuclear Security Technologies.

The first deployment into a &quot;highly radiological area&quot; came a few years ago, and showed &quot;these robots can operate in areas traditionally accessible only to workers using full personal protective equipment (PPE) with strict controls.&quot;

Savings in PPE are part of the calculus. Human PPE is pricey. Going by the pictures included with the case study, a couple of garden waste bags and some gaffer tape is all you need for a robot dog.

Last year, in conjunction with AtkinsRéalis, Sellafield began trialing remote operations from outside and &quot;successfully completed tasks including repeated inspection runs, environmental mapping, radiological characterization.&quot;

So the plan is to move &quot;Spot into routine operations.&quot; This will include improved digital integration, including 3D visualization tools, digital twins, and existing information systems.

Sellafield will also &quot;work with partners to design and test new payloads and sensing packs&quot; to support a &quot;wider range of decommissioning tasks [such as] radiological mapping, asset condition assessments, and environmental characterization.&quot;

Other robot formats may be deployed. &quot;We&#39;ll ensure all robotic technologies meet the strict security requirements of the nuclear sector,&quot; Sellafield said.

The Register asked whether the fact the frontrunners in robot tech are not indigenous technologies is a problem from a cybersecurity perspective. We also wondered whether the sort of humanoid robots beloved of Elon Musk or numerous Chinese developers might fit into the plans.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A British state-owned bank is reconfiguring its modernization project, including considering reducing connections with legacy systems, as it tries to claw back schedule and budget overruns that are far beyond early plans.

The National Savings & Investment (NS&I) transformation program is already £1.3 billion over budget and four years late. In December, chief executive Dax Harkins told MPs the organization was outside HM Treasury spending limits and timetable under a revised plan from systems integrator Capgemini.

In a letter to the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) this week, he confirmed &quot;that plan is currently forecast to complete outside the March 2028 target date and outside the agreed budget&quot; set in the Spending Review last year.

He told Parliament&#39;s spending watchdog: &quot;We recognize the challenge this presents and are working on options to improve the cost and time of program delivery, including what would be required to live within our Spending Review budget. The new options include reducing the need to connect our older legacy systems with our new services and new banking systems, and areas where we could reprioritize work.

&quot;Work is underway now to assess the potential risks, impacts, and benefits of each option to inform our decision. This includes reviewing finances and dependencies for all options, and producing a draft business case for the preferred option, with the final decision on the delivery plan to be taken by ministers.&quot;

NS&I is an executive agency of the UK&#39;s Chancellor of the Exchequer.

Last year, the National Audit Office (NAO) slammed the program [PDF], which includes both a new customer-facing technology and banking engine, pointing out that it &quot;carries an extremely high level of risk.&quot;

In 2020, NS&I began a business transformation program called Project Rainbow, which aimed to reduce the bank&#39;s running costs and replace its 20-year outsourcing deal with Atos by splitting the work into five separate contracts.

In 2014, the bank awarded Atos a new contract to run until 2021, and then extended it until 2024 and again until 2028 without competition.

As well as being the incumbent supplier for the legacy system, Atos was awarded a £474.4 million ($612 million) contract to build systems including modernizing the core banking engine, as well as running payment, reporting, and business-to-business services from December 23, 2024, until March 31, 2028.

NS&I had originally gone to market to launch the competition for a new core banking, payments, and reporting system. However, the government-owned bank later said the award was made to Atos &quot;as the incumbent service provider, Atos and its key sub-contractor(s), are the providers of the existing NS&I core banking platforms, which rely on interdependent leveraged technology and resources.&quot;

The total cost of the program is expected to hit £3 billion until 2030-31, including its contract with Atos and other running costs. The total cost increase is set for £1.3 billion compared to the 2020 business case, the NAO said in November.

In his letter to the PAC, Harkins said NS&I was working with Capgemini to finish its options analysis by the end of March 2026. By June 2026, it hopes to get plans approved by HM Treasury. ®

It’s time for another exclusive AMA for Verge subscribers, and this time, I’ll be your host. I cover everything from wearables to dystopian cursed tech like at-home urine labs and belligerent AI companions. At times, my job calls for flirting with Grok’s AI girlfriend for 24 hours or coercing weird AI video apps to generate odd French-kissing videos. Other times, I’m making personas of myself in the Vision Pro. I also do normal things, like testing the latest smart glasses, smart rings, and smartwatches. Once in a while, I get away with shitposting about the black Apple Watch Ultra 2. Oh, and I also write the Optimizer newsletter, in which I investigate the wellness Wild West and cut through tech hype about whether this or that innovation will actually make your life better.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last Saturday, I received an email from the Children’s Theatre Company of Minnesota. They explained that they were canceling the weekend’s performances of Go, Dog. Go! “for the safety of our patrons, staff, and artists.” Earlier that morning, federal agents had killed Alex Pretti in the streets, about nine blocks away from the theater’s doors.

The tickets were a Christmas gift to my four-year-old daughter from her grandparents. She has never been to the theater before. In the ever-expanding list of consequences from ICE’s violent occupation of the Twin Cities metro area, this disappointment hardly merits a mention. But it still made me sad, because — as any parent could probably tell you — all I want for my kid is joy, and so much of the world that surrounds her right now is confusion and fear and pain.

I have two daughters. My youngest is not yet two years old and will, I hope, be too young to remember anything about the armed, masked agents terrorizing Minneapolis. My oldest, as she’d proudly tell you, will be five next summer. I don’t know how much she understands, but I wanted to be prepared for anything she might ask, so I turned, as generations of parents have, to Sesame Street. Here’s their advice for ages four to five: “Children may be concerned about your safety or about being separated. Explain all the ways grown-ups can keep them safe—if they’re afraid of an event that happened far away, use the distance to reassure them.”

This advice, well-intentioned as it was, did not make me think about my daughter. It made me think about Liam Conejo Ramos, the five-year-old boy whose photograph — Spider-Man backpack, fuzzy blue bunny hat — emerged, last week, as one of the most enraging and heartbreaking images of this enraging and heartbreaking time for Minnesotans. After he arrived home from preschool on January 20th, ICE detained Liam alongside his father and sent them to a detention center in Dilley, Texas, where they remain at the time of this writing.

It’s disturbing to see Republicans — self-styled protectors of children, but always in theory and never in practice — shrug off those same children as collateral damage.

Here’s the question that’s been keeping me awake at night: If I were his father, how would I comfort Liam? Let’s consult the Sesame Street checklist. He is right to fear for his family’s safety. He is, terrifyingly, entirely correct about being separated from his family, including his pregnant mother. And there are, apparently, no grown-ups — at least the ones who care about him — who can do anything to keep him safe.

Any parent knows there are only so many ways they can protect their children. Despite your best efforts, they will be hurt: a broken bone, a dying pet, a first breakup. However we might wish it, it’s impossible, and not our real job, to shield them from the hurts that will inevitably arrive. It’s our job to give them a safe, loving place where they can become resilient enough to survive those hurts — maybe even grow from them.

In Minneapolis, there are countless signs every day that the sanctity of our safe, loving places has been ruptured. The Trump administration has not just failed to protect children; it has seen, in their innocence and vulnerability, a fault line that ICE can exploit. It’s disturbing to see Republicans — self-styled protectors of children, but always in theory and never in practice — shrug off those same children as collateral damage. School bus drivers should not need special training on what they should do if ICE shows up at a stop. Parents should not need to explain the routine presence of masked agents wearing military fatigues and carrying guns. Children should be able to attend youth sports without worrying that their proudly diverse leagues will make them a target for ICE raids.

And schoolteachers should not need to explain to their classes why so many desks are now empty — in some public schools, as many as 40 percent — because parents are keeping their children at home for safety or, in the worst cases, because ICE has already abducted and detained them. A photograph’s raw power has made Liam Conejo Ramos a symbol of this administration’s cruelty to nonwhite children, but there are more than a thousand people in his detention center, including “many” under the age of five. A lawyer who recently visited to meet with clients described a nightmarish setting: baby formula mixed with putrid water, insects in the food, verbally abusive guards. While there, he met a family with twins who, having spent nearly a year in detention, had just turned five — 20 percent of their young lives already spent behind bars.

It is only the racism of this administration that makes Liam Conejo Ramos a target.

It shouldn’t matter, but in case it does: Liam’s father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, and his wife traveled more than 3,000 miles from Ecuador to Minneapolis, entering the United States legally in December 2024 but ending up stuck, like so many, in the interminable process of seeking legal asylum. Though Donald Trump continues to insist ICE only targets “the worst of the worst,” Arias has no criminal record. His case remained pending when ICE descended upon their home, sweeping up Conejo Arias and Liam while Liam’s pregnant mother remained inside, urged by bystanders to keep their door locked in fear of what ICE might do if she opened it.

“Liam is a very, very cheerful child. He is the most playful in the family,” Conejo Arias’ brother told CNN in an interview after the boy’s photo went viral. In the detention center, his father says, Liam has been lethargic, sleeping a lot. He asks about his family and classmates. He asks for his bunny hat.

What I know, looking at that photograph, is that — apart from his family’s country of origin and the color of his skin — Liam Conejo Ramos is just like my daughters. All parents in Minnesota have had the experience of choosing a winter hat for their children; my youngest delights in a fuzzy pink bunny hat she wears inside and outside. Earlier this week, my older daughter’s school buoyed students’ spirits with Superhero Day; she dressed as Ghost-Spider, her favorite Spider-Man superhero. It is only the racism of this administration that makes Liam Conejo Ramos a target; it is only the racism of this administration that keeps my children from being targeted as well.

My daughters don’t have questions yet. But someday they will. When they do, it will be my responsibility to tell them the truth about the United States they grew up in. That the people in power chose to be this cruel. That many, many millions happily supported it. That some of us tried to stop them and didn’t or couldn’t. That the world they’ll inherit isn’t good enough for them. And that I hope their generation will learn from how we failed and do better.

            <div id="article-text">﻿Sorry, it’s not a documentary but a ‘creative experience.’

﻿Sorry, it’s not a documentary but a ‘creative experience.’

The makers of Amazon’s Melania documentary have defended its exorbitant cost following accusations of bribery to appease the Trump empire. Amazon paid $40 million to Melania Trump’s production company for the film rights and another $35 million for marketing — making it one of the most expensive documentaries ever produced.

“I think it’s silly because there’s a feature film and three episodes,” director Brett Ratner told Deadline at last night’s premiere. “We spent more money on music in this than I did on Rush Hour. I mean, top of the line, three best cinematographers in the world, at the highest level. Eighty people on the first day of shooting in my crew. That’s not unheard of in a documentary. You put the money on the screen.”

That budget is, actually, pretty unheard of for a documentary, sparking criticism that it’s a $75 million bribe. The New York Times notes that the $35 million marketing budget for Melania is 10 times higher than the average spend for big documentaries, despite only taking 20 days to shoot. The first lady herself is expected to personally pocket $27 million from Amazon’s $40 million licensing deal, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Melania Trump — who is also a producer on the project — says Melania isn’t a documentary at all, but in fact a “creative experience that offers perspectives, insights and moments.”

            <div id="article-text">Director Hlynur Pálmason wanted to make a new family film. So in The Love That Remains, he featured some of his own.

Director Hlynur Pálmason wanted to make a new family film. So in The Love That Remains, he featured some of his own.

Anna and Magnus built a life together. They had a home with three kids and a dog. Then they separated. This is where The Love That Remains begins, but as time passes and the reality of their divorce sets in, they’re left to move through a future strained by their unraveling.

Icelandic director Hlynur Pálmason’s latest film echoes the radiant visual language of his previous, the 19th-century period piece Godland and contemporary drama A White, White Day. And though its subject matter is heavy, the tone here is admittedly lighter. The aforementioned dog, Panda, even took home the Palm Dog Award at Cannes this year, which — and I’m being very serious here — is an actual award given out. On the surface, The Love That Remains is a story about normal people with normal feelings and normal problems, like how to raise a family while going through a divorce and what to do when one of your kids — who are played by Pálmason’s children — shoots the other in the chest with a bow and arrow. (He’s fine, but he’s gonna need a new sweater.)

Buried deep are existential questions. “Often I think about what is the meaning of all this? When you go through life, you have moments of doubt about just life and things and what’s the meaning of all of it,” Pálmason tells me. “It’s so silly, all of it.” He’s right. It is silly. It’s also life? As we pass through the seasons with Anna and Magnus, we begin to learn what’s left between them.

The director sat down with The Verge to talk about what it’s like to direct your own kids and how he balanced shooting Godland and The Love That Remains at the same time.

The Verge: I want to start here. Godland had such a weighty story. The Love That Remains feels lighter, but I think they share similar themes. Do they feel similar to you? Different? I’d be curious to hear you talk about that relationship.

Hlynur Pálmason: Because Godland was this period film and there’s almost like a heaviness with each period film because you have to create everything. You just can’t just take a camera and start shooting whatever. So there was this feeling of wanting to do something with a little bit different energy, like more playful and something that we could almost just go out and shoot. And also, just with a smaller budget and smaller crew. I mean, it was actually very small in Godland, but even smaller in The Love That Remains.

But there is this thing that I have after I moved back home to Iceland, I was always trying to figure out a way of stretching time so I could have more time with each project, which is difficult because of finances. But we kind of found a way to do it by working in parallel on a couple of projects. But we’re developing and writing and shooting various things. And then when we feel like it kind of has formed and we feel that it’s ready and the energy is ready, we kind of select the project that we move forward with. The Love That Remains, in many ways, has been going on for such a long time. Even the first image we shot was in 2017.

It’s quite a long process. Sometimes when you talk about other projects, they are almost happening parallel. I remember shooting scenes from Godland and the same week, shooting a scene for The Love That Remains, which is crazy to think about.

You keep all these different threads in your head?

Yeah, I think it all kind of... I don’t know. I feel like, I think some people would find it negative if things are talking too much together or eating into each other, like projects. But I kind of like when it happens because it kind of shakes you and makes you even doubt things or pushes the project. If something is turning out really interesting in one project, it kind of feeds into the other one or it kind of pushes the other one to do better.

I would never be able to make one film at a time, because financially it wouldn’t work at all. And I would only make three films during my lifetime and I would have to have other works, teacher and other things.

The title, The Love That Remains, is really more of a question: what love remains? Was making this film a way for you to answer that?

Often I think about what is the meaning of all this? When you go through life, you have moments of doubt about just life and things and what’s the meaning of all of it. If I’m in a relationship for many years and then we get separated and my fiancée would just find another, what is it? It’s so silly, all of it.

But there’s also a brighter side: how precious time is and how you spend it and actually, who you spend it with and who you decide to spend it with. Because time is probably precious because it moves so fast. You kind of have to, try to capture what you can get or moments with ones you love. And yeah, I’ve been thinking a lot about time and you can see that both in Godland and in The Love That Remains, where really, there’s an emphasis on time, on how it moves.

The opening sequence is really lovely. You establish this family by holding a portrait of them at the table. It almost feels like a sitcom, but then the music isn’t sitcom music at all?

Yeah, I did think a lot about after I filmed this image, this image of the roof getting ripped off of the old studio, that was the first image I filmed for the film.

Yeah. And when I had that image, I knew exactly what would happen afterward. And that’s often the case when I’m working. I often don’t know what happens unless I record a sound or I film an image, and then I kind of just react to the image and then I know what happens. It’s kind of like you get stimulated by something you experience or film, and then you write the next scene or you know what’s going to happen. And I think just when I saw this image of the roof, not while I was filming it, because I was not in a good state then, but afterwards, I knew exactly how the film should start.

We should be introduced to each family member and it should be this warm feeling before things begin to fall apart. But also, afterward you begin to find out that it’s actually a fractured family, they’re not together anymore. And often the case is when I’m making something, I know what I don’t want the film to be, but I don’t always know what I want it to be.

It’s fun and playful, but sweet and sincere, too.

But when does it become sentimental? And that’s something that I don’t like. I only like it in a David Lynch film or something. I love it in his films, but I could never do that. So I tried to balance it in a different way, but it is a fine line.

It’s your own children in this film too, right? What’s it like to direct your kids?

It’s fun. But I think it’s okay because I have so many, because basically they’ve been in all my projects except for my debut and also my short films. And so it’s very natural for me to just keep collaborating with them and spending time with them. It’s not something I force them to do. I mean, I do pay them for their work, but I think they also just really like being part of our family or the filmmaker family because it’s a very, very close group of friends and we’ve been working on all of the projects together.

The idea of being a director and having to make many decisions and at the same time, having your kids in the space, I’m sure it adds some fun nuance.

Yeah. I mean, sometimes it’s total chaos, but I think number one is that we have enough time, that we’re not pressed on time. There’s no AD [assistant director] that is saying, “Okay, we have to move.” It’s never happened in my life. We just film until we have something that we like and then we move on. What I like about our sets is that they’re very calm and effortless. There’s no catering, there’s no hierarchy, there’s no chairs, there’s no screens. It’s very, very basic.

The Love That Remains is in select theaters now.

The PowerToys team is testing a new dock that complements its Command Palette launcher.

Microsoft’s PowerToys team is contemplating building a top menu bar for Windows 11, much like Linux, macOS, or older versions of Windows. The menu bar, or Command Palette Dock as Microsoft calls it, would be a new optional UI that provides quick access to tools, monitoring of system resources, and much more.

Microsoft has provided concept images of what it’s looking to build, and is soliciting feedback on whether Windows users would use a PowerToy like this. “The dock is designed to be highly configurable,” explains Niels Laute, a senior product manager at Microsoft. “It can be positioned on the top, left, right, or bottom edge of the screen, and extensions can be pinned to three distinct regions of the dock: start, center, and end.”

If Microsoft does go ahead and build this dock, it will also include customization options to change the background, styling, and overall theme. You’ll also be able to easily reorder extensions between the different dock regions and pin them freely.

This dock is designed to complement Microsoft’s existing work with its Command Palette launcher that the company launched last year. Command Palette is similar to Apple’s Spotlight in macOS, allowing you to quickly access commands, apps, and development tools.

Microsoft is currently soliciting feedback on this proposal, and developers can experiment with an early version of it by importing a project from Microsoft’s PowerToys GitHub repository into Visual Studio.

﻿Bato’s operator was reportedly making over $57,000 a month in illicit advertising revenue.

Japan’s anti-piracy coalition says that one of the world’s largest manga piracy networks has been shut down following a coordinated investigation between Japanese publishers and Chinese authorities. The Content Overseas Distribution Association (CODA) announced the arrest of an individual on suspicion of copyright infringement on November 19th, who “has admitted to operating” Bato.to and approximately 60 related sites, such as xbato.com and mangapark.io.

Bato.to launched in 2014, growing to be one of the most recognizable online platforms for “scanalation” — in which manga, manhwa, and other comics are scanned, edited with translated text, and then distributed by online user communities. CODA reports that the 60 shuttered sites recorded a combined 350 million visits in May 2025 alone, with Bato.to making more than 400,000 yuan (around $57,000) in advertising revenue during peak months.

Bato.to’s operator has since been released on bail and is expected to be formally indicted.

The news: The US Department of Homeland Security is using AI video generators from Google and Adobe to make and edit content shared with the public, a new document reveals. The document, released on Wednesday, provides an inventory of which commercial AI tools DHS uses for tasks ranging from generating drafts of documents to managing cybersecurity.

Why it matters: It comes as immigration agencies have flooded social media with content to support President Trump&#39;s mass deportation agenda—some of which appears to be made with AI—and as workers in tech have put pressure on their employers to denounce the agencies’ activities.

How the sometimes-weird world of lifespan extension is gaining influence

—Jessica HamzelouFor the last couple of years, I’ve been following the progress of a group of individuals who believe death is humanity’s “core problem.” Put simply, they say death is wrong—for everyone. They’ve even said it’s morally wrong.

They established what they consider a new philosophy, and they called it Vitalism.Vitalism is more than a philosophy, though—it’s a movement for hardcore longevity enthusiasts who want to make real progress in finding treatments that slow or reverse aging. Not just through scientific advances, but by persuading influential people to support their movement, and by changing laws and policies to open up access to experimental drugs. And they’re starting to make progress.

            <h2>How the sometimes-weird world of lifespan extension is gaining influence</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/30/1131933/weird-world-lifespan-extension-gaining-influence-oneill-arpa-h/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the last couple of years, I’ve been following the progress of a group of individuals who believe death is humanity’s “core problem.” Put simply, they say death is wrong—for everyone. They’ve even said it’s morally wrong.

They established what they consider a new philosophy, and they called it Vitalism.

Vitalism is more than a philosophy, though—it’s a movement for hardcore longevity enthusiasts who want to make real progress in finding treatments that slow or reverse aging. Not just through scientific advances, but by persuading influential people to support their movement, and by changing laws and policies to open up access to experimental drugs.

Vitalism was founded by Adam Gries and Nathan Cheng—two men who united over their shared desire to find ways to extend human lifespan. I first saw Cheng speak back in 2023, at Zuzalu, a pop-up city in Montenegro for people who were interested in life extension and some other technologies. (It was an interesting experience—you can read more about it here.)

Zuzalu was where Gries and Cheng officially launched Vitalism. But I’ve been closely following the longevity scene since 2022. That journey took me to Switzerland, Honduras, and a compound in Berkeley, California, where like-minded longevity enthusiasts shared their dreams of life extension.

It also took me to Washington, DC, where, last year, supporters of lifespan extension presented politicians including Mehmet Oz, who currently leads the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, with their case for changes to laws and policies.

The journey has been fascinating, and at times weird and even surreal. I’ve heard biohacking stories that ended with smoking legs. I’ve been told about a multi-partner relationship that might be made possible through the cryopreservation—and subsequent reanimation—of a man and the multiple wives he’s had throughout his life. I’ve had people tell me to my face that they consider themselves eugenicists, and that they believe that parents should select IVF embryos for their propensity for a long life.

I’ve seen people draw blood during dinner in an upscale hotel restaurant to test their biological age. I’ve heard wild plans to preserve human consciousness and resurrect it in machines. Others have told me their plans to inject men’s penises with multiple doses of an experimental gene therapy in order to treat erectile dysfunction and ultimately achieve “radical longevity.”

I’ve been shouted at and threatened with legal action. I’ve received barefoot hugs. One interviewee told me I needed Botox. It’s been a ride.

My reporting has also made me realize that the current interest in longevity reaches beyond social media influencers and wellness centers. Longevity clinics are growing in number, and there’s been a glut of documentaries about living longer or even forever.

At the same time, powerful people who influence state laws, giant federal funding budgets, and even national health policy are prioritizing the search for treatments that slow or reverse aging. The longevity community was thrilled when longtime supporter Jim O’Neill was made deputy secretary of health and human services last year. Other members of Trump’s administration, including Oz, have spoken about longevity too. “It seems that now there is the most pro-longevity administration in American history,” Gries told me.

I recently spoke to Alicia Jackson, the new director of ARPA-H. The agency, established in 2022 under Joe Biden’s presidency, funds “breakthrough” biomedical research. And it appears to have a new focus on longevity. Jackson previously founded and led Evernow, a company focused on “health and longevity for every woman.”

“There’s a lot of interesting technologies, but they all kind of come back to the same thing: Could we extend life years?” she told me over a Zoom call a few weeks ago. She added that her agency had “incredible support” from “the very top of HHS.” I asked if she was referring to Jim O’Neill. “Yeah,” she said. She wouldn’t go into the specifics.

Gries is right: There is a lot of support for advances in longevity treatments, and some of it is coming from influential people in positions of power. Perhaps the field really is poised for a breakthrough.

And that’s what makes this field so fascinating to cover. Despite the occasional weirdness.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/29/1131938/dhs-is-using-google-and-adobe-ai-to-make-videos/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The US Department of Homeland Security is using AI video generators from Google and Adobe to make and edit content shared with the public, a new document reveals. It comes as immigration agencies have flooded social media with content to support President Trump&#39;s mass deportation agenda—some of which appears to be made with AI—and as workers in tech have put pressure on their employers to denounce the agencies’ activities.

The document, released on Wednesday, provides an inventory of which commercial AI tools DHS uses for tasks ranging from generating drafts of documents to managing cybersecurity.

In a section about “editing images, videos or other public affairs materials using AI,” it reveals for the first time that DHS is using Google&#39;s Veo 3 video generator and Adobe Firefly, estimating that the agency has between 100 and 1,000 licenses for the tools. It also discloses that DHS uses Microsoft Copilot Chat for generating first drafts of documents and summarizing long reports and Poolside software for coding tasks, in addition to tools from other companies.

Google, Adobe, and DHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The news provides details about how agencies like Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, which is part of DHS, might be creating the large amounts of content they’ve shared on X and other channels as immigration operations have expanded across US cities. They’ve posted content celebrating “Christmas after mass deportations,” referenced Bible verses and Christ’s birth, showed faces of those the agency has arrested, and shared ads aimed at recruiting agents. The agencies have also repeatedly used music without permissions from artists in their videos.

Some of the content, particularly videos, has the appearance of being AI-generated, but it hasn’t been clear until now what AI models the agencies might be using. This marks the first concrete evidence such generators are being used by DHS to create content shared with the public.

It still remains impossible to verify which company helped create a specific piece of content, or indeed if it was AI-generated at all. Adobe offers options to “watermark” a video made with its tools to disclose that it is AI-generated, for example, but this disclosure does not always stay intact when the content is uploaded and shared across different sites.

The document reveals that DHS has specifically been using Flow, a tool from Google that combines its Veo 3 video generator with a suite of filmmaking tools. Users can generate clips and assemble entire videos with AI, including videos that contain sound, dialogue, and background noise, making them hyperrealistic. Adobe launched its Firefly generator in 2023, promising that it does not use copyrighted content in its training or output. Like Google’s tools, Adobe’s can generate videos, images, soundtracks, and speech. The document does not reveal further details about how the agency is using these video generation tools.

Workers at large tech companies, including more than 140 current and former employees from Google and more than 30 from Adobe, have been putting pressure on their employers in recent weeks to take a stance against ICE and the shooting of Alex Pretti on January 24. Google’s leadership has not made statements in response. In October, Google and Apple removed apps on their app stores that were intended to track sightings of ICE, citing safety risks.

An additional document released on Wednesday revealed new details about how the agency is using more niche AI products, including a facial recognition app used by ICE, as first reported by 404Media in June.

Meet the Vitalists: the hardcore longevity enthusiasts who believe death is “wrong”

Last April, an excited crowd gathered at a compound in Berkeley, California, for a three-day event called the Vitalist Bay Summit. It was part of a longer, two-month residency that hosted various events to explore tools—from drug regulation to cryonics—that might be deployed in the fight against death.One of the main goals, though, was to spread the word of Vitalism, a somewhat radical movement established by Nathan Cheng and his colleague Adam Gries a few years ago. Consider it longevity for the most hardcore adherents—a sweeping mission to which nothing short of total devotion will do.Although interest in longevity has certainly taken off in recent years, not everyone in the broader longevity space shares Vitalists’ commitment to actually making death obsolete. And the Vitalists feel that momentum is building, not just for the science of aging and the development of lifespan-extending therapies, but for the acceptance of their philosophy that defeating death should be humanity’s top concern.

The ability to remember you and your preferences is rapidly becoming a big selling point for AI chatbots and agents.Personalized, interactive AI systems are built to act on our behalf, maintain context across conversations, and improve our ability to carry out all sorts of tasks, from booking travel to filing taxes.But their ability to store and retrieve increasingly intimate details about their users over time introduces alarming, and all-too-familiar, privacy vulnerabilities––many of which have loomed since “big data” first teased the power of spotting and acting on user patterns. Worse, AI agents now appear poised to plow through whatever safeguards had been adopted to avoid those vulnerabilities. So what can developers do to fix this problem? Read the full story.

The flawed logic of rushing out extreme climate solutionsEarly in 2022, entrepreneur Luke Iseman says, he released a pair of sulfur dioxide–filled weather balloons from Mexico’s Baja California peninsula, in the hope that they’d burst miles above Earth.It was a trivial act in itself, effectively a tiny, DIY act of solar geoengineering, the controversial proposal that the world could counteract climate change by releasing particles that reflect more sunlight back into space.Entrepreneurs like Iseman invoke the stark dangers of climate change to explain why they do what they do—even if they don’t know how effective their interventions are. But experts say that urgency doesn’t create a social license to ignore the underlying dangers or leapfrog the scientific process. Read the full story.—James Temple

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The eastern half of the US saw a monster snowstorm over the weekend. The good news is the grid has largely been able to keep up with the freezing temperatures and increased demand. But there were some signs of strain, particularly for fossil-fuel plants.

One analysis found that PJM, the nation’s largest grid operator, saw significant unplanned outages in plants that run on natural gas and coal. Historically, these facilities can struggle in extreme winter weather.

Much of the country continues to face record-low temperatures, and the possibility is looming for even more snow this weekend. What lessons can we take from this storm, and how might we shore up the grid to cope with extreme weather?

Living in New Jersey, I have the honor of being one of the roughly 67 million Americans covered by the PJM Interconnection.

So I was in the thick of things this weekend, when PJM saw unplanned outages of over 20 gigawatts on Sunday during the height of the storm. (That’s about 16% of the grid’s demand that afternoon.) Other plants were able to make up the difference, and thankfully, the power didn’t go out in my area. But that’s a lot of capacity offline.

Typically, the grid operator doesn’t announce details about why an outage occurs until later. But analysts at Energy Innovation, a policy and research firm specializing in energy and climate, went digging. By examining publicly available grid mix data (a breakdown of what types of power plants are supplying the grid), the team came to a big conclusion: Fossil fuels failed during the storm.

The analysts found that gas-fired power plants were producing about 10 gigawatts less power on Sunday than the peak demand on Saturday, even while electricity prices were high. Coal- and oil-burning plants were down too. Because these plants weren’t operating, even when high prices would make it quite lucrative, they were likely a significant part of the problem, says Michelle Solomon, a manager in the electricity program at Energy Innovation.

PJM plans to share more details about the outages at an upcoming committee meeting once the cold snap passes, Dan Lockwood, a PJM spokesperson, told me via email.

Fossil-fuel plants can see reliability challenges during winter: When temperatures drop, pressures in natural-gas lines fall too, which can lead to issues for fuel supply. Freezing temperatures can throw compression stations and other mechanical equipment offline and even freeze piles of coal.

One of the starkest examples came in 2021, when Texas faced freezing temperatures that took many power plants offline and threw the grid into chaos. Many homes lost power for days, and at least 246 people died during that storm.

Texas fared much better this time around. After 2021, the state shored up its grid, adding winter weatherization for power plants and transmission systems. Texas has also seen a huge flood of batteries come online, which has greatly helped the grid during winter demand peaks, especially in the early mornings. Texas was also simply lucky that this storm was less severe there, as one expert told Inside Climate News this week.

Here on the East Coast, we’re not out of the woods yet. The snow has stopped falling, but grids are still facing high electricity demand because of freezing temperatures. (I’ve certainly been living under my heated blanket these last few days.)

PJM could see a peak power demand of 130 gigawatts for seven straight days, a winter streak that the local grid has never experienced, according to an update to the utility’s site on Tuesday morning.

The US Department of Energy issued emergency orders to several grid operators, including PJM, that allow power plants to run while basically ignoring emissions regulations. The department also issued orders allowing several grids to tell data centers and other facilities to begin using backup generators. (This is good news for reliability but bad news for clean air and the climate, since these power sources are often incredibly emissions-intensive.)

We here on the East Coast could learn a thing or two from Texas so we don’t need to resort to these polluting emergency measures to keep the lights on. More energy storage could be a major help in future winter storms, lending flexibility to the grid to help ride out the worst times, Solomon says. Getting offshore wind online could also help, since those facilities typically produce reliable power in the winter.

No one energy source will solve the massive challenge of building and maintaining a resilient grid. But as we face the continued threat of extreme storms, renewables might actually help us weather them.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple confirmed this week that it has acquired Israeli AI startup Q.ai in a deal valued at close to $2 billion, making it one of the company’s largest acquisitions ever, second only to the $3 billion purchase of Beats in 2014.

But check your assumptions: this isn’t Beats 2.0. There’s no new headphone brand to flex. Instead, Apple is paying top dollar for tech that might let your devices understand you without you ever saying a word.

​​These days we put our phones on silent so they won’t disturb us; soon the phone will put us on silent so it can understand us.

Q.ai has been operating in secrecy since its founding in 2022. Its machine-learning research focuses on interpreting “silent speech”, detecting imperceptible facial micro-movements, and subtle audio cues to infer what someone means to say.

Patents suggest this tech could work in headphones, smart glasses, or other wearables so users can issue commands privately, even in a quiet library.

That future has a decidedly dramatic edge: imagine telling Siri to skip a track or read your messages without ever parting your lips. Apple executives call the acquisition a way to fuse machine learning with next-generation hardware.

Longtime Apple watcher Johny Srouji praised Q.ai as “a remarkable company that is pioneering new and creative ways to use imaging and machine learning.”

At first blush, spending almost $2 billion on not speaking might sound like corporate futurism taken to a comic extreme. We already have voice assistants that sometimes struggle to understand us when we do speak.

Yet here’s Apple’s bet: once devices can interpret faint facial cues, the entire paradigm of human-computer interaction shifts, from keyboards and taps to gestures and barely-audible intentions.

This move also signals how Apple’s AI strategy is evolving. Some critical voices have noted that the company has lagged behind competitors in generative AI and conversational assistants, even partnering with Google to bring Gemini-powered features into its ecosystem. Acquiring Q.ai suggests Cupertino isn’t just chasing language models; it wants to redefine the interface itself.

There’s a strange poetry to this. In an era when every tech giant is clamouring to make their AI chatty, Apple is buying a company that may prime its devices to be less vocal, more intuitive, and perhaps eerily discreet.

It’s the sort of paradox that defines modern tech: a quieter future might demand the loudest investment.

If this sounds like science fiction, well, it does. But Q.ai’s technology, as described in recent reports, could translate into features in AirPods, Vision Pro headsets, or future wearables as soon as 2027. Could it help Siri finally feel less like a confused concierge and more like an unseen assistant tuned to your intent? That remains to be seen.

Either way, Apple’s big wager on silent speech reminds us that innovation doesn’t always roar. Sometimes, it listens for the quietest signals and pays dearly for them.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">G2, the Chicago-based software insights platform, agreed today to acquire three prominent software review and discovery properties from Gartner: Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp.

The deal brings four of the largest B2B review sites under a single roof and signals a shift toward unified, AI-driven software recommendation and buying experiences.

According to the announcement, the combined business will include roughly six million verified customer reviews and tap into an audience of more than 200 million annual software buyers. G2 said it expects the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2026, subject to standard regulatory and closing conditions.

G2’s leadership frames the agreement as a response to fragmentation in the software buying journey. By consolidating multiple review databases and audiences, the company aims to streamline discovery for buyers and expand demand-generation tools for vendors.

In a public post, G2’s CEO described the integration as building “the trusted data foundation for B2B software in the age of AI,” with deeper buyer intent signals and a more consistent taxonomy across categories.

For buyers, the enlarged platform promises easier access to user-verified feedback and faster decision cycles. For software vendors, the unified dataset could translate into broader visibility and enhanced market insights.

G2’s roadmap includes tighter AI integration across search and recommendation workflows.

Gartner, which currently owns Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp, has held these properties for years as part of its digital markets portfolio.

This divestiture appears to reflect a strategic choice to focus its core research and advisory business while enabling specialized review platforms to evolve under a dedicated marketplace operator.

As the software market continues to expand, the consolidation of review infrastructure under G2 could reshape how products are evaluated and purchased.

The market will watch closely for how the combined entity leverages its scale to influence search visibility and buyer influence metrics in 2026 and beyond.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI adoption is creating a clear divide among employees. Some see AI as a tool to increase their impact, while others see it as a threat to their role. So, where does the truth lie between these two mindsets? Let’s explore.

Over the past two years, we’ve seen a wave of layoffs often attributed to “AI replacing humans.” Among widely discussed cases, IBM openly stated that over 7,000 back-office roles may no longer need to be hired because AI can absorb the work. Many other tech players, including Microsoft, Amazon, and HP, have cut between 6,000 and 200,000 employees as a shift toward AI-driven initiatives.

Meanwhile, beware: many might make misleading conclusions. They are often treated as straightforward examples of AI replacing human labor, when in reality they reflect a deeper restructuring of how value is created inside organizations.

Taking a closer look, it becomes evident that in many examples like these, people weren’t displaced because AI was smarter or outperformed people.

They were displaced because one (or more) of the following reasons:

From this perspective, it becomes evident: AI isn’t coming for roles, it’s here to remove low-leverage work. Roles that exist mainly to handle volume or work around broken systems no longer make sense once those problems disappear.

This is already playing out across teams. For example:

As AI reduces friction and automates workflows, organizations and employees are increasingly forced to ask these two questions: 1) where real value is created, 2) where human input is essential in areas AI cannot handle. Teams that explore and embrace this shift early will be better positioned to adapt as AI continues to compress the cost and effort of execution.

An overlooked but highly efficient aspect many businesses miss: AI introduces a level of transparency most organizations have never had before. This visibility changes how organizations make decisions and how they manage business resources.
In particular, AI-powered spend analysis is set to become one of the most transformative forces inside companies.

Ultimately, the level of business success is largely determined by the ability to turn spend data into an operational signal. When, instead of tracking costs in isolation, organizations clearly see how spend translates into productivity and revenue, that’s where real differentiation begins.

Smart spend management platforms like this already exist, take Spendbase, for example. In this case, AI can be the next layer that unlocks even deeper insights.

ROI and cost efficiency are at the very center of any business. Therefore, as AI increases transparency into multiple business areas (performance, time, spend, etc.), work that cannot be clearly tied to outcomes loses its footing. Hence, roles that fail to translate their work into clear outcomes risk being deprioritized.

As AI automates execution, the people and teams that remain essential are those who can clearly explain how their work impacts the business in ways AI cannot. Such as:

Apart from this, another important area of impact lies in organizational and customer-facing work, where human-driven value is created from responsibilities focused on aligning teams, resolving complexity, building trust, and, particularly, innovating.

Imagine a product team competing in a crowded market or where competitors are continuously copying each other. In this case, AI can meticulously handle research and benchmarking: analyze competitor offerings, user behavior, reviews, and market gaps.

It can even generate predictions or simulate feature adoption. However, it takes human vision and accountability to challenge assumptions and find unpaved paths for growth.

When it comes to creating something inherently new, with no existing market equivalent, AI may fall short at innovation. Yet these are often the areas where the greatest business impact lies.

In most organizations, changes revolving AI adoption won’t happen overnight. Roles will gradually shrink, shift, and eventually be redefined. As a result, human contributions that can’t be tied to measurable outcomes quietly lose relevance.

            <div id="article-text">The way people discover information online is quietly but fundamentally changing.

Instead of scrolling through links and choosing which article to open, users are increasingly asking large language models to answer directly. Tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity don’t send people browsing; they synthesise information from multiple sources and deliver a ready-made response inside the interface.

For brands and publishers, this creates a new problem: what does visibility mean when nobody clicks anymore?

For years, search optimization revolved around a familiar feedback loop: publish content, earn rankings, drive clicks, measure performance. Traffic, impressions, and engagement acted as proxies for relevance and influence. AI-generated answers disrupt that loop entirely.

This isn’t a temporary fluctuation in search behaviour. It’s a structural shift in how information is consumed.

Large language models do not simply index the web like classic search engines. Their response generation involves a combination of training data, real-time search, and internal reasoning. As shown in analyses comparing Perplexity and ChatGPT, these systems search the web differently even when responding to the same questions.

ChatGPT tends to issue longer, context-rich queries to build an explanation, whereas Perplexity formulates shorter, list-like queries focused on freshness and comparison.

This means visibility isn’t universal across models; a topic that surfaces in one LLM is not guaranteed to surface in another.

If clicks are no longer the primary signal, content strategies must adapt. Instead of optimizing only for human users and search engine algorithms:

Content intended for modern AI discovery needs both depth and freshness: explanations that support contextual reasoning (favoured by ChatGPT-style behaviour) and concise, signal-rich sections (favoured by Perplexity-style behaviour). This duality underscores the complexity of AI brand visibility.

Publishers and marketers have few tools to assess whether their pages are actually being consulted by AI agents. Traditional analytics platforms report pageviews, but:

This lack of transparency means that even high-quality content may go unnoticed in AI answers, not because it is irrelevant, but because it does not match the specific patterns an LLM uses when selecting sources.

Recognising the need for a new feedback loop, solutions are emerging that approach this problem from an engineering perspective rather than purely a marketing one. For instance, Genezio has analysed how ChatGPT and Perplexity prioritise sources and generate their search behaviours, revealing that the same topic leads to substantially different retrieval patterns across systems and therefore different visibility outcomes.

Rather than treating AI visibility as a black box, these approaches:

By observing how AI systems behave at scale, marketers can begin to measure brand visibility in conversations rather than clicks, transforming raw engineering data into actionable insight.

AI-generated answers are rapidly reshaping how information is found, processed, and presented. In this new environment, visibility is not just about ranking formulas or organic traffic; it’s about earning a place in the narrative that LLMs generate.

The brands that succeed will be those that understand not only how to produce quality content, but also how to make it legible and extractable to systems that never lead users back to a webpage.

Measuring visibility without clicks may seem intangible today, but as AI becomes central to how people seek answers, it will soon become standard practice.

            <h2>Bonjour Visio: France turns digital sovereignty into policy</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-28</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a bold turn of phrase and deed, Paris has quietly told Silicon Valley “au revoir.”  On January 26, 2026, France’s Ministry of Finance announced that by 2027, all public servants will switch from U.S. video apps like Microsoft Teams and Zoom to a homegrown platform called Visio.

No more license renewals for Teams, Zoom, Webex, or Meet, just one unified, French-built solution.

In one stroke, a long-discussed slogan “digital sovereignty” has leapt off the podium and into practice. This is not a press release; it’s a watershed moment: Europe’s second-biggest economy is wagering that, when it comes to critical infrastructure, it’s time to govern itself.

“Digital sovereignty” has become the EU’s new watchword, a declaration of independence from foreign tech hegemons. Over the past few years, it has surged from a niche policy to a headline priority, as EU leaders from Ursula von der Leyen to Emmanuel Macron have warned that Europe must control its own networks and data.

The phrase sounds grand, but what changed now is urgency. Americans’ own laws make the risks concrete: under the U.S. CLOUD Act, for example, U.S. authorities can demand data from any American platform, regardless of where it’s stored.

In practice, “jurisdiction follows ownership,” as one analyst noted: even data sitting on a Frankfurt server can be swept up by U.S. warrants if the service provider is American.

Edward Snowden’s revelations and murky court orders have long haunted Europe with the idea that a virtual meeting might be spied on from overseas. Now, with geopolitics in flux, U.S. political turns and global crises, that theoretical risk seems all too real.

The push has taken many forms. The EU has drafted cloud-certification rules demanding “sovereignty” guarantees and drafted data laws to keep Europeans’ information in Europe.

Member states debate mandating local clouds. Digital sovereignty has moved from virtue-signaling to something harder, actual infrastructure.

France’s pivot is concrete and wide-ranging. Visio, developed by the government’s interministerial digital agency (DINUM), has been tested for about a year with some 40,000 regular users. It’s already being adopted piecemeal: CNRS (France’s national research center) will replace all its 34,000 Zoom seats by March 2026, covering 120,000 associated researchers.

By early 2026, the Defense Ministry, finance tax offices, health insurance, and other big agencies will be on Visio. The government now says every state department will use Visio as the default video tool by 2027, after which external conferencing licenses simply won’t be renewed.

The official rationale is familiar: a patchwork of Teams, Zoom, Webex, and friends “fragilises security” and creates hidden costs, dependencies, and interoperability headaches.

Visio is billed as a solution under full French control: it’s hosted on a certified “SecNumCloud” by Dassault-owned Outscale, built with ANSSI (France’s cyber agency) oversight, and even uses French AI for meeting transcription and captions.

The aim, in the minister’s words, is to “end the use of non-European solutions and guarantee the security and confidentiality of public electronic communications by relying on a powerful…sovereign tool”.

In short: no more data flying through American servers or falling under foreign laws.

There are financial perks, too. Officials point out that ditching pricey Teams and Zoom licenses will save money: roughly €1 million per year for every 100,000 users who shift off commercial tools. That’s not pocket change, even if it’s a rounding error in a €600 billion budget. In any case, for France, this isn’t just about cost – it’s about control.

Taken together, these facts show a very concrete policy timeline. In one meeting on Jan. 26, the state literally put a deadline on dependence: four years to shift the ENTIRE civil service. It’s one thing to talk about sovereignty in Brussels speeches, quite another to swap out the nation’s video chat app.

France isn’t alone in flirting with this idea, but it’s the first to bet big. Other EU countries are eyeballing similar moves. In Denmark, parts of the public sector have already announced plans to phase out Microsoft’s software.

In Germany, the state of Schleswig-Holstein recently ditched Microsoft Office in favor of open-source alternatives. Even non-state bodies are joining the sovereignty club: the International Criminal Court said it will move its systems to a German-developed open-source platform (OpenDesk).

These are baby steps compared to France’s all-hands policy, but they reflect a shared unease about over-reliance on foreign tech.

Europe is also wrestling with headline-grabbing hiccups like last year’s massive cloud outages in the U.S., which left public agencies scrambling. The Visio announcement itself notes that Europe’s “overreliance on U.S. IT infrastructure” has been questioned after those failures.

And there are EU-wide initiatives underway, from the Gaia-X cloud alliance to tougher data localization rules – aimed at seeding local alternatives.

If France makes Visio work, it could serve as a proof of concept for others. Will a homegrown tool really run government communications smoothly? If yes, it might embolden policymakers in Brussels or Rome to push harder on local platforms. If not, it could slow the momentum.

For now, France’s move is a beacon: it shows that digital sovereignty can move beyond talk. Other nations will watch closely.

No one seriously argues that keeping calls on Visio will magically end world unrest. Rather, this is a narrow, technical solution to a policy problem. On the other side, France will indeed have tighter control: all servers, encryption keys, and software updates are now under French (and EU) jurisdiction.

Public-sector IT teams can audit code, set security parameters, and avoid nasty surprises (say, a foreign court order) without jumping through transatlantic hoops.

Data stays where the politicians say it stays.

But what might be lost? For one, user experience and innovation often depend on scale. Big Tech’s video platforms have oceans of R&D behind them, from instant translation to seamless device-hopping, and millions of users giving feedback.

A new platform built from scratch may not match Teams’ polish or Zoom’s ubiquity overnight. (The French have even admitted an irony: naming it “Visio” risks confusion with Microsoft Visio, the longtime diagram app, hinting that branding and polish sometimes play second fiddle to strategy.)

There’s also the question of interoperability: how well will Visio meetings work when French officials Zoom into a partner country’s conference, or vice versa? Will France demand that foreign delegations install its app, or allow links to other networks? The devil is in the details.

Some critics fret that an insular approach could fragment standards. One EU paper urges that sovereignty shouldn’t mean isolation but rather a robust, open ecosystem.

If every country builds its own siloed cloud and chat service, the Internet risks reinventing wheels (and reinventing firewalls) in every member state. Of course, Visio is only for civil servants, not a consumer product, yet it sets a precedent.

On the other hand, an expertly executed French stack could jumpstart a continental open-source community or spur startups to plug gaps. It’s a calculated gamble: France assumes that on net, its security and strategic stakes outweigh any shortfall in bells and whistles.

For its part, France says this isn’t a bare-bones trade-off. Officials emphasize Visio will include modern features: speaker separation, AI for transcripts, captions, etc. The goal is “not [a] minimalist replacement,” but a full-featured tool under domestic control.

In other words, they aim for the best of both worlds, though acknowledging it’s a tall order.

In its own softly decisive way, France’s Visio plan signals a definitive shift: digital sovereignty is no longer a future wish or empty catchphrase, but a deadline-driven program.

Europe has debated “strategic autonomy” for years; this is the first major state-level bet, with clear timelines and budget line savings. From the perspective of a tech editor watching policy trends, it’s heartening to see ambition meet action.

Will it pay off? If Visio runs smoothly, France will score a coup: more secure chats, money saved, and perhaps the bragging rights of a proof of concept. If glitches persist, France’s analysts may ask if the Q1 rollout to 200,000 civil servants is biting off too much too soon.

Either way, the move puts stakes on the table. Digital sovereignty has many meanings, but here it means doing something concrete, even if it means saying “non” to familiar tools.

In the end, it’s a balancing act. Europe gains control of what it might risk in convenience. France has just turned insurance talk into policy practice. Other countries will now watch and learn: Visio is not just a video app; it’s France’s case study in what digital independence can actually look like.
