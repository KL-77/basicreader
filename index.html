            <h2>TSMC says AI demand is “endless” after record Q4 earnings</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/tsmc-says-ai-demand-is-endless-after-record-q4-earnings/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Thursday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) reported record fourth-quarter earnings and said it expects AI chip demand to continue for years. During an earnings call, CEO C.C. Wei told investors that while he cannot predict the semiconductor industry’s long-term trajectory, he remains bullish on AI.

TSMC manufactures chips for companies including Apple, Nvidia, AMD, and Qualcomm, making it a linchpin of the global electronics supply chain. The company produces the vast majority of the world’s most advanced semiconductors, and its factories in Taiwan have become a focal point of US-China tensions over technology and trade. When TSMC reports strong demand and ramps up spending, it signals that the companies designing AI chips expect years of continued growth.

“All in all, I believe in my point of view, the AI is real—not only real, it’s starting to grow into our daily life. And we believe that is kind of—we call it AI megatrend, we certainly would believe that,” Wei said during the call. “So another question is ‘can the semiconductor industry be good for three, four, five years in a row?’ I’ll tell you the truth, I don’t know. But I look at the AI, it looks like it’s going to be like an endless—I mean, that for many years to come.”

TSMC posted net income of NT$505.7 billion (about $16 billion) for the quarter, up 35 percent year over year and above analyst expectations. Revenue hit $33.7 billion, a 25.5 percent increase from the same period last year. The company expects nearly 30 percent revenue growth in 2026 and plans to spend between $52 billion and $56 billion on capital expenditures this year, up from $40.9 billion in 2025.

Wei’s optimism stands in contrast to months of speculation about whether the AI industry is in a bubble. In November, Google CEO Sundar Pichai warned of “irrationality” in the AI market and said no company would be immune if a potential bubble bursts. OpenAI’s Sam Altman acknowledged in August that investors are “overexcited” and that “someone” will lose a “phenomenal amount of money.”

But TSMC, which manufactures the chips that power the AI boom, is betting the opposite way, with Wei telling analysts he spoke directly to cloud providers to verify that demand is real before committing to the spending increase.

“I want to make sure that my customers’ demand are real. So I talked to those cloud service providers, all of them,” Wei said. “The answer is that I’m quite satisfied with the answer. Actually, they show me the evidence that the AI really helps their business.”

The earnings report landed the same day the US and Taiwan finalized a trade agreement that cuts tariffs on Taiwanese goods to 15 percent, down from 20 percent. The deal commits Taiwanese companies to $250 billion in direct US investment, and TSMC is accelerating the expansion of its Arizona chip fabrication facilities to match.</div>

            <h2>Feds give Tesla another five weeks to respond to FSD probe</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/feds-give-tesla-another-five-weeks-to-respond-to-fsd-probe/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Late last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened yet another investigation into Tesla and its partially automated driver assist systems. This time it was about FSD (again), which has been the subject of more than 60 complaints to the regulator after Teslas operating under FSD either ignored red traffic lights or crossed into oncoming traffic. As part of the preliminary investigation, NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation has asked Tesla for more information on the problem. This week, it told the automaker it could have a five-week extension on its homework.

To be fair to Tesla, NHTSA has asked for a comprehensive amount of information: a list of every Tesla produced and sold or leased in the United States, including whether or not that car had FSD and which version; cumulative data on how many US Teslas have FSD and how often it’s used; and a list of all the customer complaints, field reports, incident reports, lawsuits, and other data related to FSD ignoring traffic laws.

For each incident involving a crash, Tesla must give NHTSA a summary of the incident, including “causal and contributing factors.” Further questions require information on FSD use by crashed cars; any alert shown to the drivers; what work, simulation, or otherwise Tesla has conducted to ameliorate the problem; any modifications or changes to FSD hardware or software; an explanation of Tesla’s theory of operation for traffic lights and stop signs; and Tesla’s assessment of the problem.

The original request was sent to Tesla on December 3 with a deadline of January 19—next Monday—with penalties of up to $27,874 per day (to a maximum of $139.4 million) for not complying.

However, the winter holiday period ate up two weeks of the six-and-a-bit weeks, and the company has had to simultaneously prepare two other information requests for other ongoing NHTSA probes, one due today, another on January 23rd, and yet another on February 4, the company told NHTSA. Identifying all the complaints and reports will take more time, Tesla said, as it found 8,313 items when it searched for traffic violations, and it can only process 300 a day to see which ones are relevant.

Answering the remaining questions on NHTSA’s list would require the above to be completed first, so Tesla asked for and was granted an extension until February 23.

Meanwhile, Tesla has changed how its driver assist cash cow contributes to the bottom line. Until now, Tesla owners had the option of buying the system outright for (currently) $8,000. Now, CEO Elon Musk says that option will go away on February 14. From then on, if a Tesla owner wants FSD, they’ll have to pay a $99 monthly fee to use it.</div>

            <h2>Ferrari doing what it does best: The 12Cilindri review</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/driven-the-ferrari-12cilindri-spider-is-open-top-grand-touring-bliss/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It has been nearly 80 years since Ferrari unleashed its first V12-powered sports car upon the world with the 125 S. In 1947, its debut year, the 125 S secured Ferrari’s first race victory, along with five other wins in the 14 events it competed in that season.

Although it was soon replaced by the 159 S, the success of the 125 S kick-started Ferrari’s storied history of producing some of the most desirable 12-cylinder performance cars known to man. And while the Italian automaker has come to embrace forced induction and electrification in recent years, its legacy of building stunning front-engine, rear-wheel drive machines with spectacular V12s stuffed into their engine bays continues with the 12Cilindri Spider.

Ferrari hasn’t shied away from leveraging cutting-edge technology in the development of its latest models, but the company also understands the value of a good throwback. As the successor to the 812 Superfast, the 12Cilindri boasts clever performance technologies, like a sophisticated active aero system and a four-wheel steering system that can manage each corner independently to enhance response, but it’s ultimately an homage to the heady days of late ’60s luxury grand touring. The exterior styling takes obvious inspiration from the 365 GTB Daytona, while its lack of all-wheel drive, turbocharging, and electric assistance bucks trends that have become nearly inescapable in modern performance cars.

Instead, Ferrari has deliberately prioritized the core principles that have defined its most enduring GT icons: elegant design, a meticulously engineered chassis, and a sensational naturally aspirated V12, the latter represented here by a 6.5 L dry-sump mill that delivers 819 hp (611 kW) and a soaring 9,500-rpm redline.

That horsepower figure might not raise as many eyebrows as it would have just a few years ago, but it’s worth noting that at a time in history when an alarming number of new performance vehicles are now as heavy as full-size pickups, the 12Cilindri Spider tips the scales at a relatively svelte dry weight of 3,571 (1,620 kg) pounds thanks in part to its focus on the fundamentals. Equipped with massage seats and a retractable hardtop that opens and closes in just 14 seconds, the 12Cilindri Spider is primarily aimed at fulfilling drivers’ fantasies of cruising along the French Riviera with the smell of the ocean in the air and the banshee wail of 12 cylinders in their ears. But it also takes on a noticeably more sportscar-like persona than its primary rival, the Aston Martin Vanquish Volante, mainly due to the 12Cilindri’s eight-speed dual-clutch transmission and more earnest performance-tuned chassis.

Sport is the 12Cilindri Spider’s default drive mode, a naming decision that helps set expectations for suspension stiffness, but you can also depress the steering-wheel-mounted Manettino drive mode dial to enable Bumpy Road mode, which softens the adaptive dampers beyond their standard tuning for more compliance on rough pavement. While the gearbox occasionally needs a second to get its act together from a standstill, and the car’s low stance makes the nose lift system an often-used feature, the 12Cilindri Spider is a remarkably civil cruiser when pressed into service for everyday driving tasks.

The in-car tech does tarnish this driving experience to a tangible degree, though. The liberal use of capacitive surfaces on the steering wheel and the instrument panel to control features like rear-view mirror position and adaptive cruise control, as well as the functions that are accessed via the 15.6-inch digital gauge cluster, frequently led to frustration during my time with the car, and although the high-resolution 10.25-inch central touchscreen looks great and is quick to respond to user inputs, wireless Apple CarPlay crashed on several occasions for no discernible reason and remained inaccessible until after the next key cycle. These may seem like trivial issues, but in a car with a $507,394 MSRP ($661,364 as-tested with destination fee), it’s tough to excuse problems that are so distracting and seemingly easy to rectify.

We had the same problem with the 296 GTB, and it’s time Ferrari retired its capacitive wheel and replaced them all with the version that has physical buttons. Which it will do for existing owners—for a hefty fee.

But, perhaps unsurprisingly, those quibbles always seemed to fade away whenever I found an open stretch of canyon road and set the Manettino to Race mode. Doing so eases up the electronic assists, sets up the transmission and differential for sharper response, and opens up the valves in the active exhaust system. But, in contrast to convention, it leaves the steering weight, suspension stiffness, throttle response, and brake-by-wire system alone in order to maintain predictable dynamic behavior regardless of which drive mode you’re in.

Although the exhaust is a bit quieter than I’d prefer, even with the roof stowed away, the sound that this V12 makes as you wind it out is the stuff that dreams are made of. It took me a moment to recalibrate to the lofty redline, though—with the gearbox set to manual mode, my mind naturally wanted to pull the column-mounted paddle about 2,000 rpm early. I blame this on my seat time in the Vanquish coupe last year. Aston’s decision to equip the Vanquish’s 5.2 L V12 with a pair of turbochargers enables it to best the 12Cilinidri’s horsepower figure by a few ponies while also providing a significant advantage in peak torque output (738 lb-ft/1,000 Nm versus the Ferrari’s 500 lb-ft/678 Nm), but it also relegates the Vanquish’s redline to a more prosaic 7,000 rpm while naturally muting its tone a bit.

And to be frank, I don’t think the 12Cilindri Spider needs another 238 lb-ft (322 Nm), a theory that was backed by the flashing traction control light that fired up any time I got a little too brave with the throttle coming out of a slow corner. Intervention from the Ferrari’s electronic safeguards is so seamless that I rarely noticed it happening at all, though, and I can’t say the same for the Vanquish, which is undoubtedly thrilling to drive but often felt like it was fighting against its own prodigious output in order to keep the nose on the intended path. The 12Cilindri, by contrast, feels easy to trust when the going gets fast, and that sensation is bolstered by tons of mechanical grip, a quick steering rack, and a firm, progressive brake pedal.

But regardless of my thoughts on the matter, the 12Cilindri’s successor will likely be a significantly different beast with a lot more power on tap. Nearly a decade ago, we predicted that the 812 would likely be the last Ferrari to feature a naturally aspirated V12, and while this is a prediction that we’re happy to have been wrong about, this era is undoubtedly drawing to a close. A hybridized V12 will likely offer even more grunt, and enthusiasts rarely scoff at the prospect of more power, but it also opens the door to all-wheel drive, significantly more heft, and ultimately a very different driving experience. Until then, the 12Cilindri Spider serves as an important reminder that sometimes the most compelling aspects of a performance car can’t be quantified on a spec sheet.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/mother-of-one-of-elon-musks-offspring-sues-xai-over-sexualized-deepfakes/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ashley St Clair, the influencer and mother of one of Elon Musk’s children, has sued the billionaire’s AI company, accusing its Grok chatbot of creating fake sexual imagery of her without her consent.

In the lawsuit, filed in New York state court, St Clair alleged that xAI’s Grok first created an AI-generated or altered image of her in a bikini earlier this month.

St Clair claims she made a request to xAI that no further such images be made, but nevertheless “countless sexually abusive, intimate, and degrading deepfake content of St. Clair [were] produced and distributed publicly by Grok.”

In one case, a photo of St Clair from when she was 14 years old was altered by Grok to undress her and put her in a bikini, according to the court filing.

St Clair is a conservative influencer with about 1 million followers on X and the mother of one of Musk’s children. The billionaire entrepreneur has espoused pronatalist views, arguing in support of increasing birth rates, and has fathered at least 14 children with several different women.

After reporting the images to xAI, St Clair’s account on the X social media platform was stripped of its verification checkmark, premium subscription, and ability to monetize her posts, the filing said.

The case has now been moved to federal court. xAI, which runs X, did not respond to a request for comment.

The news comes as xAI and Musk have come under fire over fake sexualized images of women and children, which proliferated on the platform this year, particularly after Musk jokingly shared an AI-altered post of himself in a bikini.

Over the past week, the issue has prompted threats of fines and bans in the EU, UK, and France, as well as investigations by the California attorney-general and Britain’s Ofcom regulator. Grok has also been banned in Indonesia and Malaysia.

On Wednesday, xAI took action to restrict the image-generation function on its Grok AI model to block the chatbot from undressing users, insisting that it removed Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) and non-consensual nudity material.

St Clair, who has in recent months been increasingly critical of Musk, is also seeking a temporary restraining order to prevent xAI from generating images that undress her.

“Ms St Clair is humiliated, depressed, fearful for her life, angry and desperately in need of action from this court to protect her against xAI’s facilitation of this unfathomable nightmare,” lawyers wrote in a filing seeking the restraining order.

xAI filed a lawsuit against St Clair in Texas on Thursday, claiming she had breached the company’s terms of service by bringing her lawsuit against the company in a New York court instead of in Texas.

Earlier this week, Musk also said on X that he would be filing for “full custody” of their 1-year-old son Romulus, after St Clair apologized for sharing posts critical of transgender people in the past. Musk, who has a transgender child, has repeatedly been critical of transgender people and the rights of trans individuals.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Welcome to Edition 8.25 of the Rocket Report! All eyes are on Florida this weekend as NASA rolls out the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft to its launch site in Florida for the Artemis II mission. NASA has not announced a launch date yet, and this will depend in part on how well a “wet dress rehearsal” goes with fueling the rocket. However, it is likely the rocket has a no-earlier-than launch date of February 8. Our own Stephen Clark will be in Florida for the rollout on Saturday, so be sure and check back here for coverage.

As always, we welcome reader submissions, and if you don’t want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.

MaiaSpace scores a major launch deal. The ArianeGroup subsidiary, created in 2022, has inked a major new launch contract with satellite operator Eutelsat, Le Monde reports. A significant portion of the 440 new satellites ordered by Eutelsat from Airbus to renew or expand its OneWeb constellation will be launched into orbit by the new Maia rocket. MaiaSpace previously signed two contracts: one with Exotrail for the launch of an orbital transfer, and the other for two satellites for the Toutatis mission, a defense system developed by U-Space.

A big win for the French firm … The first test launch of Maia is scheduled for the end of 2026, a year later than initially planned, at the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana. The first flights carrying OneWeb satellites are therefore likely to launch no earlier than 2027. Powered by liquid oxygen-methane propellant, Maia aims to be able to deliver up to 500 kg to low-Earth orbit when the first stage is recovered, and 1,500 kg when fully expendable.

Firefly announces Alpha upgrade plan. Firefly Aerospace said this week it was planning a “Block II” upgrade to its Alpha rocket that will “focus on enhancing reliability, streamlining producibility, and improving launch operations to further support commercial, civil, and national security mission demand.” Firefly’s upcoming Alpha Flight 7, targeted to launch in the coming weeks, will be the last flown in the current configuration and will serve as a test flight with multiple Block II subsystems in shadow mode.

Too many failures … “Firefly worked closely with customers and incorporated data and lessons learned from our first six Alpha launches and hundreds of hardware tests to make upgrades that increase reliability and manufacturability with consolidated parts, key configuration updates, and stronger structures built with automated machinery,” said Jason Kim, CEO of Firefly Aerospace. Speaking bluntly, reliability upgrades are needed. Of Alpha’s six launches to date, only two have been a complete success. (submitted by TFargo04)

Another PSLV launch failure. India’s first launch of 2026 ended in failure due to an issue with the third stage of its Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), Spaceflight Now reports. The mission, designated PSLV-C62, was also the second consecutive failure of this four-stage rocket, with both anomalies affecting the third stage. This time, 16 satellites were lost, including those of other nations. ISRO said it initiated a “detailed analysis” to determine the root cause of the anomaly.

Has been India’s workhorse rocket … The four-stage launch vehicle is a mixture of solid- and liquid- fueled stages. Both the first and third stages are solid-fueled, while the second and fourth stages are powered by liquid propulsion. The PSLV Rocket has flown in multiple configurations since it debuted in September 1993 and achieved 58 fully successful launches, with the payloads on those missions reaching their intended orbit.

US military invests in L3Harris rocket motors. The US government will invest $1 billion in L3Harris Technologies’ growing rocket motor business, guaranteeing a steady supply of the much-needed motors used in a wide range of ‍missiles such as Tomahawks and Patriot interceptors, CNBC reports. L3Harris said on Tuesday it ‌is planning ‌an IPO of its growing rocket motor business into a new publicly ​traded company backed by a $1 billion government convertible security investment. The securities will automatically convert to common equity when the company goes public later in 2026.

Shifting investment strategy … “We are fundamentally shifting our approach to securing our munitions supply chain,” said Michael Duffey, undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment. “By investing directly in suppliers we are building the resilient industrial ⁠base needed for the Arsenal of Freedom.” However, the government’s equity position in L3Harris could face blowback from L3Harris’ rivals, given that it creates a potentially significant conflict of interest for the US government. The Pentagon will have an ownership stake in a company that regularly bids on major defense and other government contracts.

First Ariane 64 to launch next month. Arianespace announced Thursday that it plans to launch the first variant of the Ariane 6 rocket with four solid rocket boosters on February 12 from French Guiana. The mission will also be the company’s first launch of Amazon Leo (formerly Project Kuiper) satellites. This is the first of 18 Ariane 6 launches that Arianespace sold to Amazon for the broadband communications megaconstellation.

A growing cadence … The Ariane 6 rocket has launched five times, including its debut flight in July 2024. All of the launches were a success, although the first flight failed to relight the upper stage in order to make a controlled reentry. Arianespace increased the cadence to four launches last year and will seek to try to double that this year.

Falcon 9 launches the Pandora mission. NASA’s Pandora satellite rocketed into orbit early Sunday from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, Ars reports. It hitched a ride with around 40 other small payloads aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, launching into a polar Sun-synchronous orbit before deploying at an altitude of roughly 380 miles (613 kilometers).

A satellite that can carry a tune … Pandora will augment the capabilities of NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope. Over the next few weeks, ground controllers will put Pandora through a series of commissioning and calibration steps before turning its eyes toward deep space. From low-Earth orbit, Pandora will observe exoplanets and their stars simultaneously, allowing astronomers to correct their measurements of the planet’s atmospheric composition and structure based on the ever-changing conditions of the host star itself.

ArianeGroup seeking ideas for Ariane 6 reuse. In this week’s newsletter, we’ve already had a story about MaiaSpace and another item about the Ariane 6 rocket. So why not combine the two and also have a report about an Ariane 6 mashup with the Maia rocket? As it turns out, there’s a relatively new proposal to retrofit the existing Ariane 6 rocket design for partial reuse with Maia rockets as side boosters, Ars reports.

Sir, maia I have some cost savings? … It’s infeasible to recover the Ariane 6’s core stage for many reasons. Chief among them is that the main stage burns for more than seven minutes on an Ariane 6 flight, reaching speeds about twice as fast as SpaceX’s Falcon 9 booster achieves during its two-and-a-half minutes of operation during launch. Swapping out Ariane 6’s solid rocket motors for reusable liquid boosters makes some economic sense for ArianeGroup. The proposal would bring the development and production of the boosters under full control of ArianeGroup and its French subsidiary, cutting Italy’s solid rocket motor developer, Avio, out of the program. All the same, we’ll believe this when we see it.

Meet the EtherealX Razor Crest Mk-1. I learned that there is a rocket company founded in Bengaluru, India, named Ethereal Exploration Guild, or EtherealX. (Did you see what they did there?) I found this out because the company announced (via email) that it had raised an oversubscribed $20.5 million Series A round led by TDK Ventures and BIG Capital. So naturally, I went to the EtherealX website looking for more information.

Let me say, I was not disappointed … As you might expect from a company named EtherealX, its proposed rocket has nine engines, is powered by liquid oxygen and kerosene, and has a maximum capacity of 24.8 metric tons to low-Earth orbit. (Did you see what they did there?) The website does not include much information, but there is this banger of a statement: “The EtherealX Razor Crest Mk-1 will house 9 of the most powerful operational liquid rocket engines in Asia, Europe, Australia, Africa, South America, and Antarctica – Stallion.” And let’s be honest, when you’ve bested Antarctica in engine development, you know you’re cooking. Alas, what I did not see on the website was much evidence of real hardware.

NASA topples historic Saturn and shuttle infrastructure. Two historic NASA test facilities used in the development of the Saturn V and space shuttle launch vehicles have been demolished after towering over the Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama since the start of the Space Age, Ars reports. The Propulsion and Structural Test Facility, which was erected in 1957—the same year the first artificial satellite entered Earth orbit—and the Dynamic Test Facility, which has stood since 1964, were brought down by a coordinated series of implosions on Saturday, January 10.

Out with the old, in with the new … Located in Marshall’s East Test Area on the US Army’s Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, the two structures were no longer in use and, according to NASA, had a backlog of $25 million in needed repairs. “This work reflects smart stewardship of taxpayer resources,” Jared Isaacman, NASA administrator, said in a statement. “Clearing outdated infrastructure allows NASA to safely modernize, streamline operations and fully leverage the infrastructure investments signed into law by President Trump to keep Marshall positioned at the forefront of aerospace innovation.”

Space Force swaps Vulcan for Falcon 9. The next Global Positioning System satellite is switching from a United Launch Alliance Vulcan rocket to a SpaceX Falcon 9, a spokesperson for the US Space Force Space Systems Command System Delta 80 said Tuesday, Spaceflight Now reports. SpaceX could launch the GPS III Space Vehicle 09 (SV09) within the next few weeks, as the satellite was entering the final stages of pre-flight preparations.

The trade is logical … SV09 was originally awarded to ULA as part of order-year five of the National Security Space Launch (NSSL) Phase 2 contract, which was announced on October 31, 2023. This isn’t the first time that the Space Force has shuffled timelines and switched launch providers for GPS missions. In May 2025, SpaceX launched the GPS III SV08 spacecraft, which was originally assigned to ULA in June 2023. In exchange, ULA was given the SV11 launch, which would have flown on a Falcon Heavy rocket. The changes have been driven largely by repeated delays in Vulcan readiness.

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-15</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/big-pharma-is-openly-railing-against-rfk-jr-s-anti-vaccine-agenda/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Pharmaceutical executives are finally saying how they really feel about the extreme anti-vaccine agenda Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been ruthlessly implementing—and it’s not pretty.

According to reporting from Bloomberg at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference that ended today in San Francisco, pharmaceutical executives who had previously been careful to avoid criticizing the Trump administration appear to have reached a breaking point, with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla offering some of the most candid comments.

“I am very annoyed. I’m very disappointed. I’m seriously frustrated,” Bourla said. “What is happening has zero scientific merit and is just serving an agenda which is political, and then antivax.”

Last week, Kennedy and other health officials abruptly announced a mass overhaul of the childhood vaccine schedule, dropping the number of routine recommended vaccinations from 17 to 11. The drastic and unprecedented change bypassed all the scientific review and transparent decision-making processes that would normally underpin such changes, which would likely have taken months if not years.

Kennedy claimed that the move puts the US more in line with peer nations, but as an analysis by Stat News pointed out, the US is now an outlier, recommending significantly fewer vaccines than many other countries. Of 20 so-called peer countries that Stat compared, only one other country has a similarly low number of recommendations: Denmark.

Leading medical groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, are preparing a legal challenge to block the changes.

But pharmaceutical executives don’t appear comforted by the pushback. “Today it may be childhood vaccines or mRNA, but tomorrow it’s everything,” Noubar Afeyan, co-founder and chairman of Moderna, maker of mRNA vaccines, said. “We have to say not just ‘why is this happening?,’ but ‘Where will it stop?’”

As a bad flu season is underway, Dean Li, president of Merck Research Laboratories, noted that the anti-vaccine rhetoric is hitting seasonal flu shots. “With the pressure on vaccination, I cannot foresee flu vaccination increasing in this country over the next three years,” he said in a presentation.

Sanofi Chief Executive Paul Hudson had a similarly pessimistic outlook. “It’s clear this administration has a particular sensitivity around vaccination, and indeed pediatric vaccination,” Hudson said. “I’m asked all the time ‘what are you going to do to fix this?,’ and the truth is we just need to stay extremely objective and continue presenting the evidence. There’s really very little else we can do,” except wait for the midterm elections, he said.

“We will have to maintain a steely focus on the long-term future of vaccines and deal with any uncertainty around vaccine coverage rates in the short-term based on misinformation, Facebook posts, and statements from the top,” he said.

Bourla also worried about the conditions Kennedy is creating to attack drug makers. Kennedy, who is an environmental lawyer with no scientific or medical background, has profited from lawsuits against vaccine makers, as have many of his allies and advisors. “There is also a lot of plaintiffs’ playbook there,” Bourla said. “Everybody will start litigating.”</div>

            <h2>Doctor Says Trump Appears to Have Suffered a Stroke</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-16</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Donald Trump won his second term in the White House, he was the oldest man in the history of the United States to do so. Assuming he serves for his entire term, he’ll be 82 years and seven months old by the time he leaves office — breaking Joe Biden’s record of 82 years and two months.

And like Biden, some major questions are swirling around Trump as obvious signs of aging come to the fore. Speaking to the biographer Sidney Blumenthal and historian Sean Wilentz on their podcast The Court of History, Washington State University Professor of Medicine Bruce Davidson opined that Trump appears to have suffered a stroke that’s impacting his ability to move.

“My impression is that president Trump has had a stroke, and I think there’s several lines of evidence supporting that,” Davidson said. “I think his stroke was on the left side of the brain, which controls the right side of the body.” Based on what he’s seen, the doctor estimated the event happened “six months ago or more, earlier in 2025.”

“There’s video of him shuffling his feet, which is not what we’d seen him [doing], striding on the golf course,” the doctor continued. “He was garbling words, which he didn’t do previously, and which he’s improved upon more recently. And he’s also had marked episodes that have been noticed of daytime, excessive sleepiness, — medical term, hypersomnolence — which is characteristic of many patients after they’ve had a stroke.”

The most recent smoking gun, Davidson claimed, was a recent video of Trump gingerly walking down the stairs from Air Force One. As he descends the steps, the president grips the banister with his left hand, even though he’s right-handed.

“All of this is consistent with having had a stroke on the left side of his brain,” Davidson said.

While the assertion has some important implications for Trump himself, it would also mean that his entire administration has been lying to the American public about his health for months — echoing the health debacle surrounding Biden in his final years in office. That said, Davidson’s definitely not the first person to suggest Trump’s hiding a stroke in plain sight.

As questions of the president’s visible bruising and swollen ankles dominated headlines last July, the White House put out a statement admitting he had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency. In mid-October, Trump was taken for a mysterious check-up at Walter Reed Medical Center, which the White House claimed was a routine physical — even though it turned out Trump had gotten an MRI scan.

Earlier this month, Trump contradicted the administration’s earlier claims, stating that the trip involved a CT scan, not an MRI, which he underwent to “definitively rule out any cardiovascular issues.”

Without being able to examine the president directly, even the best professional diagnoses amount to speculation at best — and given Trump’s history of offering up bizarre claims about his health, it’s unlikely the public will get any clarity any time soon.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The use of generative AI for creative purposes has spawned a major countermovement. From game developers reeling from a wave of criticism for using the tech to artists staging mass protests against AI, the backlash against what’s being hailed as a technological revolution grew massively last year.

In a startlingly literal example of this growing fury, a University of Alaska Fairbanks undergraduate student was detained after ripping “artwork off the walls and eating it in a reported protest,” according to a university police department statement quoted by the school’s student newspaper, The Sun Star.

The student, Graham Granger, was accused of chewing and spitting out small images that were pinned to the wall of a UAF art exhibit, which featured 160 AI-generated images by fine arts student Nick Dwyer. Photos taken by The Sun Star show crumpled-up pieces of paper strewn across a polished concrete floor.

According to the police department, Granger chewed up at least 57 of the 160 images. As a result, the undergraduate student was arrested for “criminal mischief in the 5th degree and booked at the Fairbanks Correctional Center,” according to the student newspaper.

It’s yet another example of how anti-AI sentiment is gripping the art world, highlighting a heated debate over human authorship and expression in a world filled with text-to-image generators that can conjure up works from a simple prompt in an instant.

Dwyer has since defended his work, telling The Sun Star that he had been using AI for his art since 2017. He said his exhibit “explores identity, character narrative creation and crafting false memories of relationships in an interactive role digitally crafted before, during and after a state of AI psychosis.”

The term “AI psychosis” has been used by health professionals to describe a troubling phenomenon in which users of AI tools are experiencing symptoms of psychosis or delusional episodes. Experts have raised concerns over the trend, warning that more and more people could be caught up in these delusions as they become hooked on AI chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

In extreme cases, these tools have been alleged to have led to numerous deaths, including the suicide of a 16-year-old.

Dwyer told The Sun Star that he had fallen into AI psychosis himself, turning to art to portray the experience.

The art world has been reeling from a flood of AI-generated pieces for years now. We’ve seen instances of artists being wrongfully accused of using the tech, while others, like users on the subreddit Defending AI Art, are arguing that it’s an entirely legitimate way of expressing oneself.

A similar situation is playing out in the music industry as well, with music streaming services hosting cheap AI knockoffs of real artists’ works.

Just this week, music distribution platform Bandcamp announced that it was banning AI-generated songs — a move that was met with an outpouring of support.

            <div id="article-text">What do you get when you put a vaccine conspiracy theorist in charge of the agency responsible for funding medical research throughout the globe? A recipe for Tuskegee 2.0, apparently.

Some bombshell reporting over the last month has revealed a monstrous plan by Robert F Kennedy Jr.’s Department of Health and Human Services to fund a $1.6 million study on hepatitis B vaccines among 14,000 newborns in the West African country of Guinea-Bissau. As protocol documents obtained by Inside Medicine show, the study would have been a “randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of neonatal Hepatitis B vaccination on early-life mortality, morbidity, and long-term developmental outcomes.”

In other words, Kennedy’s HHS was about to fund a study that withheld Hep B vaccinations from 7,000 infants in one of the poorest countries on earth — so that western researchers could compare their long-term health to babies that got the vaccine.

Earlier today, the Guardian revealed that the trial — slated to begin in 2027 — had been halted by officials in Guinea-Bissau, after weeks of outrage from health officials and researchers. Instead, Africa CDC told the Guardian the study would be reworked to address the ethics concerns that have become a rallying cry in the medical research community.

“This is another Tuskegee,” one anonymous CDC official told Inside Medicine prior to the trial’s cancellation.

They were refering to the Tuskegee syphilis study, an infamous experiment that ran from 1932 until 1972 in which 600 poor Black men with syphilis were studied to understand the long-term effects of the disease in exchange for “free medical care” from the US government.

The catch? Though penicillin was discovered to be an effective treatment for syphilis in 1943, study subjects were never offered the antibiotic, or even told they had syphilis in the first place — leaving them to suffer the full effects of the debilitating infection, even though it was fully treatable. It remains one of the most barbaric biomedical research studies in US history, and its cruelty is still felt to this day.

Continuing, the CDC official told Inside Medicine that “we are allowing children, infants, to be exposed to Hepatitis B when we could prevent it, and then follow them for five years to see what happens. That’s not long enough to see the long-term benefits, but might be long enough to find some non-specific effects.”

“Non-specific effects” is a key buzzword swirling around Kennedy’s orbit of vaccine skeptics and holistic wellness influences, which essentially means “unintended harms.” The HHS’s chosen researchers for the Guinea-Bissau study were Peter Aaby and Christine Stabell Benn, a controversial Danish couple who have spent years chasing after non-specific effects in vaccines.

Thankfully, “the good guys won,” as Paul Offit, an infectious disease physician told the Guardian. “This administration did not see people in Africa as valuable… We were able to stand up for them. We were able to convince people about the fact that this was unethical.”

            <div id="article-text">For over two decades, millions of people volunteered the computational capacity of their computers to help UC Berkeley scientists in their search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI).

The goal of the project, called SETI@home, was to trawl through data collected by the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico for signs of unusual radio signals from the cosmos. It was a powerful example of “distributed computing,” which relies on a huge network of individual computers — but whether the search has borne any fruit remains unclear as scientists continue to analyze the wealth of data.

SETI@home concluded after 21 years in 2020, producing a whopping 12 billion detections, according to a UC Berkeley press release, making it “one of the most popular crowd-sourced research projects ever.”

Over the years, researchers whittled down the data to just 100 signals that were “worth a second look” by eliminating radio frequency interference and noise with the help of a supercomputer. Since July, they’ve been using China’s Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), in the hopes of catching another glimpse of the identified targets.

Unfortunately, the Arecibo Observatory — once the world’s largest radio telescope — collapsed during a storm in 2020, and is being decommissioned.

Even if the project never leads to first contact with an intelligent extraterrestrial species, it doesn’t mean SETI@home was a waste of time. Researchers are still trawling through the FAST data, but early conclusions of the project and its effectiveness have already resulted in two papers that were published last year in The Astronomical Journal.

“If we don’t find ET, what we can say is that we established a new sensitivity level,” said project cofounder David Anderson in a statement. “If there were a signal above a certain power, we would have found it.”

The team is hoping to inspire a successor to the crowdsourced research project, while applying what they’ve learned.

“Some of our conclusions are that the project didn’t completely work the way we thought it was going to,” Anderson said. “And we have a long list of things that we would have done differently and that future sky survey projects should do differently.”

Astronomer and project director Eric Korpela also pointed out that the considerable amount of radio interference, which can emanate from other sources, including radio and TV broadcasts and even microwave ovens, could seriously mess with the data.

“We have to do a better job of measuring what we’re excluding,” he said. “Are we throwing out the baby with the bath water? I don’t think we know for most SETI searches, and that is really a lesson for SETI searches everywhere.”

Given the lack of a smoking gun after trawling “billions and billions” of stars in the Milky Way, the project left the alien-hunting organizers somewhat deflated.

“We are, without doubt, the most sensitive narrow-band search of large portions of the sky, so we had the best chance of finding something,” Korpela explained. “So yeah, there’s a little disappointment that we didn’t see anything.”

However, the researcher hasn’t given up on the idea, particularly given the immense advancements in computer power and improved internet connections.

“I think that you could still get significantly more processing power than we used for SETI@home and process more data because of a wider internet bandwidth,” Korpela said. However, “the biggest issue with such a project is that it requires personnel, and personnel means salaries. It’s not the cheapest way to do SETI.”

And plenty of what-ifs remain, especially considering the limitations of the SETI@home project.

“There’s still the potential that ET is in that data and we missed it just by a hair,” he pondered.

            <h2>Researchers Just Found Something That Could Shake the AI Industry to Its Core</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-industry-recall-copyright-books">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For years now, AI companies, including Google, Meta, Anthropic, and OpenAI, have insisted that their large language models aren’t technically storing copyrighted works in their memory and instead “learn” from their training data like a human mind.

It’s a carefully worded distinction that’s been integral to their attempts to defend themselves against a rapidly growing barrage of legal challenges.

It also cuts to the core of copyright law itself. Copyright is a form of intellectual property law designed to protect original works and their creators. Under the US Copyright Act of 1976, a copyright owner has the exclusive right to “reproduce, adapt, distribute, publicly perform, and publicly display the work.”

But, crucially, the “fair use” doctrine holds that others can use copyrighted materials for purposes like criticism, journalism, and research. That’s been the AI industry’s defense in court against accusations of infringement; OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has gone as far as to say that it’s “over” if the industry isn’t allowed to freely leverage copyrighted data to train its models.

Rights holders have long cried foul, accusing AI companies of training their models on pirated and copyrighted works, effectively monetizing them without ever fairly remunerating authors, journalists, and artists. It’s a years-long legal battle that’s already led to a high-profile settlement.

Now, a damning new study could put AI companies on the defensive. In it, Stanford and Yale researchers found compelling evidence that AI models are actually copying all that data, not “learning” from it. Specifically, four prominent LLMs — OpenAI’s GPT-4.1, Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, xAI’s Grok 3, and Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet — happily reproduced lengthy excerpts from popular — and protected — works, with a stunning degree of accuracy.

They found that Claude outputted “entire books near-verbatim” with an accuracy rate of 95.8 percent. Gemini reproduced the novel “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” with an accuracy of 76.8 percent, while Claude reproduced George Orwell’s “1984” with a higher than 94 percent accuracy compared to the original — and still copyrighted — reference material.

“While many believe that LLMs do not memorize much of their training data, recent work shows that substantial amounts of copyrighted text can be extracted from open-weight models,” the researchers wrote.

Some of these reproductions required the researchers to jailbreak the models with a technique called Best-of-N, which essentially bombards the AI with different iterations of the same prompt. (Those kinds of workarounds have already been used by OpenAI to defend itself in a lawsuit filed by the New York Times, with its lawyers arguing that “normal people do not use OpenAI’s products in this way.”)

The implications of the latest findings could be substantial as copyright lawsuits play out in courts across the country. As The Atlantic‘s Alex Reisner points out, the results further undermine the AI industry’s argument that LLMs “learn” from these texts instead of storing information and recalling it later. It’s evidence that “may be a massive legal liability for AI companies” and “potentially cost the industry billions of dollars in copyright-infringement judgments.”

Whether AI companies are liable for copyright infringement remains a subject of heated debate. Stanford law professor Mark Lemley, who has represented AI companies in copyright lawsuits, told The Atlantic that he isn’t sure whether an AI model “contains” a copy of a book or can reproduce it “on the fly in response to a request.”

Unsurprisingly, the industry is continuing to argue that they’re technically not replicating protected works. In 2023, Google told the US Copyright Office that “there is no copy of the training data — whether text, images, or other formats — present in the model itself.”

OpenAI also told the office in the same year that its “models do not store copies of the information that they learn from.”

To The Atlantic‘s Reisner, the analogy that AI models learn like humans is a “deceptive, feel-good idea that prevents the public discussion we need to have about how AI companies are using the creative and intellectual works upon which they are utterly dependent.”

But whether the judges overseeing the litany of copyright lawsuits will agree with that sentiment remains to be seen. The stakes are considerable, particularly as it becomes harder and harder for authors, journalists, and other content creators to make a living — while the AI industry swells to unfathomable value.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Much ink has been spilled over US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s dalliances with anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, brain worms, nicotine pouches, and bizarre self-treatment with a synthetic dye known as methylene blue.

In spite of all those wellness eccentricities of his own, Kennedy is apparently in awe of his boss Donald Trump, who he says spends his days “pumping himself full of poison.”

In a recent appearance on the Katie Miller Podcast — hosted by the wife of Stephen Miller, who currently serves as homeland security advisor to the White House — Kennedy expressed astonishment that the president is even alive.

“He eats really bad food,” the health secretary dished. “Which is McDonald’s, and, you know, candy and Diet Coke. But he drinks Diet Coke at all times. He has the constitution of a deity — I don’t know how he’s alive, but he is.”

Though Kennedy acknowledged that Trump eats “really good food” when he’s staying in a place like Mar-a-Lago, he says those habits fall away the second he gets on the road.

“If you travel with him you get this idea that he’s just pumping himself full of poison all day,” Kennedy told Miller. “He wants to eat food from big corporations because he trusts it and he doesn’t want to get sick when he’s on the road.”

Trump’s health woes have been a topic of heated debate since he assumed his second term in office. He’s currently the oldest person to be elected president in US history, a superlative which has come with complications like daytime fatigue, visible bruising, and what his critics say is observable cognitive decline. (A mysterious CT scan that the president has struggled to explain hasn’t helped dispel those concerns.)

Whether Trump’s diet is contributing to his health woes is hard to say for certain — the administration insists he remains perfectly fit — but if Kennedy’s astonishment is any indication, the BigMacs certainly aren’t helping.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/how-a-hacking-campaign-targeted-high-profile-gmail-and-whatsapp-users-across-the-middle-east/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Tuesday, U.K.-based Iranian activist Nariman Gharib tweeted redacted screenshots of a phishing link sent to him via a WhatsApp message.

“Do not click on suspicious links,” Gharib warned. The activist, who is following the digital side of the Iranian protests from afar, said the campaign targeted people involved in Iran-related activities, such as himself.

This hacking campaign comes as Iran grapples with the longest nationwide internet shutdown in its history, as anti-government protests — and violent crackdowns — rage across the country. Given that Iran and its closest adversaries are highly active in the offensive cyberspace (read: hacking people), we wanted to learn more.

Gharib shared the full phishing link with TechCrunch soon after his post, allowing us to capture a copy of the source code of the phishing web page used in the attack. He also shared a write-up of his findings.

TechCrunch analyzed the source code of the phishing page, and with added input from security researchers, we believe the campaign aimed to steal Gmail and other online credentials, compromise WhatsApp accounts, and conduct surveillance by stealing location data, photos, and audio recordings.

It is unclear, however, if the hackers were government-linked agents, spies, or cybercriminals — or all three.

TechCrunch also identified a way to view a real-time copy of all the victims’ responses saved on the attacker’s server, which was left exposed and accessible without a password. This data revealed dozens of victims who had unwittingly entered their credentials into the phishing site and were subsequently likely hacked.

The list includes a Middle Eastern academic working in national security studies; the boss of an Israeli drone maker; a senior Lebanese cabinet minister; at least one journalist; and people in the United States or with U.S. phone numbers.

TechCrunch is publishing our findings after validating much of Gharib’s report. The phishing site is now down.

According to Gharib, the WhatsApp message he received contained a suspicious link, which loaded a phishing site in the victim’s browser.

The link shows that the attackers relied on a dynamic DNS provider called DuckDNS for their phishing campaign. Dynamic DNS providers allow people to connect easy-to-remember web addresses — in this case, a duckdns.org subdomain — to a server where its IP address might frequently change.

It’s not clear whether the attackers shut down the phishing site of their own accord or were caught and cut off by DuckDNS. We reached out to DuckDNS with inquiries, but its owner Richard Harper requested that we send an abuse report instead.

From what we understand, the attackers used DuckDNS to mask the real location of the phishing page, presumably to make it look like a genuine WhatsApp link.

The phishing page was actually hosted at alex-fabow.online, a domain that was first registered in early November 2025. This domain has several other, related domains hosted on the same dedicated server, and these domain names follow a pattern that suggests the campaign also targeted other providers of virtual meeting rooms, like meet-safe.online and whats-login.online.

We’re not sure what happens while the DuckDNS link loads in the victim’s browser, or how the link determines which specific phishing page to load. It may be that the DuckDNS link redirects the target to a specific phishing page based on information it gleans from the user’s device.

The phishing page would not load in our web browser, preventing us from directly interacting with it. Reading the source code of the page, however, allowed us to better understand how the attack worked.

Depending on the target, tapping on a phishing link would open a fake Gmail login page, or ask for their phone number, and begin an attack flow aimed at stealing their password and two-factor authentication code.

But the source code of the phishing page code had at least one flaw: TechCrunch found that by modifying the phishing page’s URL in our web browser, we could view a file on the attacker’s servers that was storing records of every victim who had entered their credentials.

The file contained over 850 records of information submitted by victims during the attack flow. These records detailed each part of the phishing flow that the victim was in. This included copies of the usernames and passwords that victims had entered on the phishing page, as well as incorrect entries and their two-factor codes, effectively serving as a keylogger.

The records also contained each victim’s user agent, a string of text that identifies the operating system and browser versions used to view websites. This data shows that the campaign was designed to target Windows, macOS, iPhone, and Android users.

The exposed file allowed us to follow the attack flow step-by-step for each victim. In one case, the exposed file shows a victim clicking on a malicious link, which opened a page that looked like a Gmail sign-in window. The log shows the victim entering their email credentials several times until they enter the correct password.

The records show the same victim entering their two-factor authentication code sent to them by text message. We can tell this because Google sends two-factor codes in a specific format (usually G-xxxxxx, featuring a six-digit numerical code).

Beyond credential theft, this campaign also seemed to enable surveillance by tricking victims into sharing their location, audio, and pictures from their device.

In Gharib’s case, tapping on the link in the phishing message opened a fake WhatsApp-themed page in his browser, which displayed a QR code. The lure aims to trick the target into scanning the code on their device, purportedly to access a virtual meeting room.

Gharib said the QR code was generated by the attacker, and scanning or tapping it would instantly link the victim’s WhatsApp account to a device controlled by the attacker, granting them access to the victim’s data. This is a long-known attack technique that abuses the WhatsApp device linking feature and has been similarly abused to target users of messaging app Signal.

We asked Granitt founder Runa Sandvik, a security researcher who works to help secure at-risk individuals, to examine a copy of the phishing page code and see how it functions.

Sandvik found that when the page loaded, the code would trigger a browser notification asking the user for permission to access their location (via navigator.geolocation), as well as photos and audio (navigator.getUserMedia).

If accepted, the browser would immediately send the person’s coordinates to the attacker, capable of identifying the location of the victim. The page would then continue to share the victim’s location data every few seconds, for as long as the page remained open.

The code also allowed the attackers to record bursts of audio and snap photos every three to five seconds using the device camera. However, we did not see any location data, audio, or images that had been collected on the server.

We do not know who is behind this campaign. What is clear is that the campaign was successful in stealing credentials from victims, and it is possible that the phishing campaign could resurface.

Despite knowing the identities of some of the people in this cluster of victims who were targeted, we don’t have enough information to understand the nature of the campaign. The number of victims hacked by this campaign (that we know of) is fairly low — fewer than 50 individuals — and affects seemingly ordinary people across the Kurdish community, as well as academics, government officials, business leaders, and other senior figures across the broader Iranian diaspora and Middle East.

It may be that there are far more victims than we are aware of, which could help us understand who was targeted and potentially why.

It is unclear what motivated the hackers to steal people’s credentials and hijack their WhatsApp accounts, which could also help identify who is behind this hacking campaign.

A government-backed group, for example, might want to steal the email password and two-factor codes of a high-value target, like a politician or journalist, so they can download private and confidential information.

That could make sense since Iran is currently almost entirely cut off from the outside world, and getting information in or out of the country presents a challenge. Both the Iranian government, or a foreign government with interests in Iran’s affairs, could plausibly want to know who influential Iranian-linked individuals are communicating with, and what about.

As such, the timing of this phishing campaign and who it appears to be targeting could point to an espionage campaign aimed at trying to collect information about a narrow list of people.

We asked Gary Miller, a security researcher at Citizen Lab and mobile espionage expert, to also review the phishing code and some of the exposed data from the attacker’s server.

Miller said the attack “certainly [had] the hallmarks of an IRGC-linked spearphishing campaign,” referring to highly targeted email hacks carried out by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a faction of Iran’s military known for carrying out cyberattacks. Miller pointed to a mix of indications, including the international scope of victim targeting, credential theft, the abuse of popular messaging platforms like WhatsApp, and social engineering techniques used in the phishing link.

On the other hand, a financially motivated hacker could use the same stolen Gmail password and two-factor code of another high-value target, such as a company executive, to steal proprietary and sensitive business information from their inbox. The hacker could also forcibly reset passwords of their victim’s cryptocurrency and bank accounts to empty their wallets.

The campaign’s focus on accessing a victim’s location and device media, however, is unusual for a financially motivated actor, who might have little use for pictures and audio recordings.

We asked Ian Campbell, a threat researcher at DomainTools, which helps analyze public internet records, to look at the domain names used in the campaign to help understand when they were first set up, and if these domains were connected to any other previously known or identified infrastructure.

Campbell found that while the campaign targeted victims in the midst of Iran’s ongoing nationwide protests, its infrastructure had been set up weeks ago. He added that most of the domains connected to this campaign were registered in early November 2025, and one related domain was created months back in August 2025. Campbell described the domains as medium to high risk and said they appear to be linked to a cybercrime operation driven by financial motivations.

An additional wrinkle is that Iran’s government has been known to outsource cyberattacks to criminal hacking groups, presumably to shield its involvement in hacking operations against its citizens. The U.S. Treasury has sanctioned Iranian companies in the past for acting as fronts for Iran’s IRGC and conducting cyberattacks, such as launching targeted phishing and social engineering attacks.

As Miller notes, “This drives home the point that clicking on unsolicited WhatsApp links, no matter how convincing, is a high-risk, unsafe practice.”

            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk’s X is experiencing its second large-scale outage this week.

The site and app, formerly known as Twitter, are either not loading at all or are glitching into life briefly before throwing up error messages like gang signs.

The site Down Detector shows nearly 80,000 reports of X being down, starting at around 10 a.m. Eastern time, and is still down at the time of this writing.

This is the second major outage at X this week, following an earlier technical issue. It comes as the platform faces criticism after Grok, xAI’s chatbot that is integrated into X, has been fulfilling user requests to manipulate real photos of women, and even children, into nonconsensual sexual and violent imagery.

When Musk took over Twitter in 2022, he laid off much of the staff, sparking worries that the site wouldn’t be able to function normally or adequately monitor for harmful content. The site has largely remained running, though there were notable outages last year.

            <h2>Chinese EVs inch closer to the US as Canada slashes tariffs</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/chinese-evs-inch-closer-to-the-us-as-canada-slashes-tariffs/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced Friday that his country will slash its 100% import tax on Chinese EVs to just 6.1%, paving the way for companies like Geely, BYD, Xiaomi, and others to establish a second foothold in the North American automotive market.

Canada is not going all-in on Chinese EVs, though. The country will initially cap annual imports at 49,000 vehicles. That cap will slowly increase to about 70,000 in around five years, according to the Associated Press.

It’s a major shift that comes at a time when China is looking to boost EV exports, especially as the European Union weighs lowering its own tariffs on the vehicles. The U.S. remains a holdout on that front, though this week President Trump said he’d be open to Chinese automakers building factories in the U.S. that produce EVs.

China has already been exporting gas, hybrid, and electric vehicles to Mexico, with the latter especially booming in 2025. Many of the leading EV-makers in China have been agitating to enter the U.S. market, including Geely, which held a drive event at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week. While the company was showcasing a number of models ostensibly meant for the Mexican market, one of its communications executives implied the conglomerate is aiming to announce an entry into the U.S. in the next two-to-three years.

Automotive journalists, influencers, and even some executives — most notably Ford CEO Jim Farley — have praised the quality of Chinese EVs over the last few years.

But the 100% tariff on Chinese cars has so far made the idea of exporting them to the U.S. a non-starter. That’s despite the fact that Chinese EVs are sold at far lower prices than the average car in the U.S. — a feat typically achieved through a combination of extremely low cost of capital, labor, and a willingness to burn money to gain market share.

China’s ability to undercut other automakers on price is just one concern. The U.S. has spent the last few years trying to separate itself from China’s EV supply chain for national security reasons, under both Presidents Biden and Trump. There are other legal hurdles too. Last year, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security issued a rule restricting the import and sale of certain connected vehicles and related hardware and software linked to China or Russia.

On Thursday, Avery Ash, the CEO of nonprofit Securing America’s Future Energy, cautioned against Trump’s idea of allowing Chinese automakers to build cars in the United States.

“We’ve seen this strategy backfire in Europe and elsewhere—it would have potentially catastrophic impacts on our automotive industry, have ripple effects on our entire defense industrial base, and make every American less secure,” he said in a statement. “We urge the President to stay tough against China and protect American auto manufacturers and workers.”

            <h2>YouTube relaxes monetization guidelines for some controversial topics</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/youtube-relaxes-monetization-guidelines-for-some-controversial-topics/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">YouTube is updating its advertiser-friendly content guidelines to allow more videos on controversial issues to earn full ad revenue, as long as they’re dramatized or discussed in a non-graphic manner. These controversial topics include self-harm, abortion, suicide, and domestic and sexual abuse. YouTube notes that content on child abuse or eating disorders will remain ineligible for full monetization.

YouTube announced the change this week in a video on its Creator Insider channel.

“In the past, the degree of graphic or descriptive detail was not considered a significant factor in determining advertiser friendliness, even for some dramatized material,” YouTube explained. “Consequently, such uploads typically received a yellow dollar icon, which restricted their ability to be fully monetized. With this week’s update, our guidelines are becoming more permissive, and creators will be able to earn more ad revenue.”

The Google-owned company says it’s making the change in response to creator feedback that YouTube’s guidelines were leading to limited ad revenue on dramatized and topical content. YouTube notes that it wants to ensure that creators who are telling sensitive stories or producing dramatized content have the opportunity to earn ad revenue.

“We took a closer look and found our guidelines in this area had become too restrictive and ended up demonetizing uploads like dramatized content,” YouTube said. “This content might reference topics that advertisers find controversial, but are ultimately comfortable running their ads against. For example, content may be in a fictional context or voiced from personal experiences in passing or in a non-graphic manner. So, as long as the content steers clear of very descriptive or graphic scenes or segments, creators can now earn more ad revenue.”

The move comes as YouTube has been easing up on how it polices content on its platform.

The company told moderators last year to leave up videos that may violate platform rules if they are considered to be in the public interest. The New York Times reported at the time that these videos included discussions of political, social, and cultural issues. The policy shift came at a time when social media platforms were rolling back online speech moderation after President Donald Trump returned to office.

YouTube notes that there are still some areas where ads will remain restricted, as topics like child abuse, including child sex trafficking and eating disorders, are not included in this update. Descriptive segments of those topics or dramatized content around them remain ineligible for ad revenue.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Social network Bluesky is updating its app to allow anyone to share when they’re livestreaming on Twitch, and adding specialized hashtags, known as cashtags, for discussing publicly traded stocks.

The new features could potentially help Bluesky capitalize on a recent boost in new installs, which have arrived in the days after the X deepfake news went mainstream.

On X, users were asking its integrated AI bot Grok to turn photos of real women and sometimes minors into sexualized images without consent. This week, California’s attorney general opened an investigation into xAI’s chatbot over the proliferation of the “nonconsensual sexually explicit material.”

In the wake of the controversy, Bluesky saw its downloads surge in the U.S. According to new data from market intelligence provider Appfigures, daily downloads of Bluesky’s iOS app have jumped nearly 50% from the period before news of the deepfakes reached critical mass.

The firm says Bluesky typically sees around 4,000 installs in the U.S. per day, but from December 30, 2025, through January 6, 2026, Bluesky’s iOS downloads in the U.S. totaled around 19,500. From January 7, 2026, through January 14, downloads grew to 29,000 — a 49% increase.

Meanwhile, cashtags will allow the app to catch up to one of X’s more popular use cases: discussing stocks. To create a cashtag, you place a dollar symbol before the stock ticker symbol (e.g., $AAPL for Apple).

The idea for cashtags was first introduced by stocks-focused social network Stocktwits, which now has over 10 million users, before the tags were later adopted by Twitter in 2012.

In addition, Bluesky says it’s expanding access to the “Live Now” experimental feature that lets users add a temporary “LIVE” badge to their avatar to indicate when they’re streaming online. Currently, this feature only supports Twitch and doesn’t allow anyone to go live directly on Bluesky itself.

The boost in activity on Bluesky comes after the network saw declines in downloads and usage last year. In April 2025, Appfigures noted that the social networking startup’s downloads dropped to new lows, and daily average users on mobile devices had declined nearly 40% by the end of October, per Similarweb data. Pew Research reported last year that a number of influencers now have Bluesky accounts, but they still tend to post more regularly on X.

This suggests that the switching costs are higher than some would expect when it comes to swapping out one real-time social network for another. Adding new features will only be part of the battle for Bluesky; it will also have to find a way to get users to change years of ingrained behavior.

In this episode of Galaxy Brain, Charlie Warzel confronts the growing crisis around AI-generated sexual abuse and the culture of impunity enabling it. He examines how Elon Musk’s chatbot Grok is being used to create and circulate nonconsensual sexualized images often targeting women. Warzel lays out why this moment represents a red line for the internet: It is a test of whether society will tolerate tools that silence women through humiliation and intimidation under the guise of free speech.

Warzel is then joined by The Atlantic’s Sophie Gilbert, the author of Girl on Girl, for a conversation about how misogyny has been a constant throughline in the history of internet innovation, from Facebook to YouTube. Warzel and Gilbert discuss today’s AI-powered exploitation and explore how new technologies repeatedly repackage old abuses at greater scale and speed. They discuss why this wave of hostility feels so intense right now, how backlash politics and platform design reinforce one another, and what is at stake if lawmakers, companies, and the public fail to draw a red line with Elon Musk’s Grok.

A note from Charlie Warzel: On Wednesday—after this episode was recorded and after The Atlantic published its article on the Grok undressing scandal—X’s Safety account posted an update noting that the company had “implemented technological measures to prevent the [@]Grok account on X globally from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis. This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.” It also noted: “Image creation and the ability to edit images via the [@]Grok account on X are now only available to paid subscribers globally.”

I reached out to X to ask if this update was different from the changes it had made to the feature that were rolled out last week. I asked if Grok was now unable to generate bikini images for any user. X’s media strategy lead, Rosemarie Esposito, did not respond to our request for comment.

As of this writing, it is unclear if the safeguards are always working. In some cases, Grok seems to be unable to generate bikini images. However, some users are still posting images on X that suggest they can still prompt the chatbot to do so.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Sophie Gilbert: It is about power. It’s about asserting that in certain spaces, at least online, women are not equal human beings. They will always be seen as nonhuman objects. Any time they have ways of speaking or voicing things, they will be

essentially silenced, they’ll be driven out of certain platforms, they’ll be made to feel unwelcome, they’ll be shamed in lots of ways and humiliated.

Charlie Warzel: Welcome back to Galaxy Brain. I am your host, Charlie Warzel. Last week, I offered up a little bit of a rant at the top about Elon Musk and Grok and the chatbots’ undressing spree. And it turns out, I’m not done talking about that one. Today’s episode is going to be about the ways in which technology has shaped a culture that’s been increasingly hostile to women online and elsewhere.

I’m going to be joined by my colleague Sophie Gilbert, who writes extensively about culture and the ways that it talks about and influences and shapes women and our perceptions of women. She’s the author of a fantastic book called Girl on Girl, which traces how pop culture has turned a generation of women against themselves. We’re going to be talking about the Grok stuff, but also the ways that these tech platforms have this rich history of exposing women and why it’s become so popular to think about women as these nonhuman objects online, how AI is encouraging this, and what women are supposed to do in response. But before we get to Sophie, I wanted to address the Grok issue head on again. I remain truly, incandescently mad about this, about all of it.

Here is a sentence that is true. For more than a week, beginning late last month, anyone could go online and use a tool—owned and promoted by the world’s richest man—to modify a picture of basically any person, even a child, especially women, and undress them.

At the moment, Elon Musk seems to be not only getting away with this, but reveling in it.

Here’s where I need to note that xAI says it’s prohibited the sexualization of children in its acceptable-use policy. A post earlier this month from the X safety team states that the platform removes illegal content, including child-sex-abuse material, and it works with law enforcement as needed. The company said late last week that it limited image generation with Grok and editing to paying subscribers. Now, this is disturbing in its own right, because Musk and xAI are essentially marketing nonconsensual sexual images as a paid feature of the platform. But X users have been able to get around even this very low bar of moderation using the “edit image” button that appears on every image uploaded to the platform, or by going to Grok’s stand-alone app and creating images that way.

To be clear, the deluge of people online, anonymous trolls saying @Grok put her into a bikini, et cetera—that’s subsided slightly. But on subreddits and on these backwater message boards, I can tell you, personally, that I’ve seen creeps strategizing and sharing tactics for the best ways to get around these safeguards and to create realistic pornographic images of women.

The problem continues. Musk himself has said that he is quote, “not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok. Literally zero.” He’s talking about images of children. Now, he might not be aware of it, but as my colleague Matteo Wong has shared with me, there are investigators who look at this stuff, who have found Grok-generated images on the dark web that clear the bar for child-sexual-abuse material. It is out there. To say nothing of the harassment that’s gone on in broad daylight on X with people undressing women and public figures.

And so I can’t stop thinking about this. Now there’s starting to be a little bit of pressure from governments around the world. Government bodies in the U.K., India, and the European Union have said that they’re trying to investigate X. Malaysia and Indonesia have blocked access to Grok. In the U.S., though, the response has been a lot different. This week, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth touted a partnership publicly between the military and xAI to use Grok in war-fighting capabilities.

Meanwhile, the United States State Department has appeared to threaten the United Kingdom over their probe into Elon Musk’s app. Senator Ted Cruz, a co-sponsor of the Take It Down Act—which establishes criminal penalties for the sharing of nonconsensual, intimate images, real or AI-generated, on social media—wrote on X last week that Grok-generated images that were “unacceptable and a clear violation of the law.” On Monday, Cruz posted a photo on X of him with his arm around Elon Musk. The caption said, “Always great seeing this guy!” Rocket emoji.

Make no mistake: This is a part of a crisis of impunity that goes well beyond X or Elon Musk. This is the result of politicians, despots, and CEOs just bowing and capitulating to Donald Trump. A financial grift and speculation running rampant in sectors like cryptocurrency and meme stocks. A braggadocious, get-the-bag ethos that has no room for shame or greed. Of Musk realizing that his wealth insulates him from financial consequences of all kinds. It’s cynical. It’s cowardly. It is cancerous to the social fabric.

I can’t know what is in the heart of these CEOs or these politicians or the employees of the companies that are refusing to comment on the fact that they’ve invested in a company that has weaponized and viralized abusive, suggestive, sexual material. But I feel confident in saying that their silence on this issue is due to a hope that if they’re quiet, everyone will just move on. It’s a strategy on today’s internet among people with power to just bank on a culture in which people have given up demanding consequences.

And we just cannot allow that to happen. Because this is a line-in-the-sand moment for the internet—but also for us culturally. This is not, as I said last week, a partisan issue. This is not, as Elon Musk would have you think, a free-speech-maximalist issue. It is, however, a free-speech issue in that this tool is being used to silence women through intimidation.

The Grok scandal it is just so awful, so egregious, that it offers a direct opportunity to address this crisis of impunity, head on. This is a moment in which people with power, or people who can exert pressure—the Apples and Googles of the world, our politicians, other people in Silicon Valley—this is a moment when they should demand accountability for this. Elon Musk should wear this.

The stakes could not be any higher. Because if there is no red line around AI-generated sexual-abuse material, there’s no red line.

And so joining me now is Sophie Gilbert, who can speak to, in many ways, the other side of this. The consequences and what all of this horrible culture of misogyny is doing to women online. Here’s Sophie.

Gilbert: Charlie, hi. Thank you so much for having me.

Warzel: I’m sorry to talk to you under these circumstances, but it’s a delight regardless of what we’re about to get into. And on that note, I did want to start with the news. Which, it’s been a pretty horrific few months, even by internet and 2020s standards, in terms of the blatant, flagrant misogyny that is out there.

We have the Grok-undressing stuff; I just talked about in the beginning, here, of the episode. We have the Epstein files coming to light. The vilification on the right of Renee Good in Minneapolis. There’s a lot more, which you’ve been writing about—including the president calling a reporter “Piggy.” What has been your reaction to the volume of this really ugly misogyny manifesting right now?

Gilbert: God. I just think, like—I used to be a TV critic, not to be glib. I used to write about culture. I mean, through a very, you know, lens of gender. I mean, I still write about culture, but because I think and write so much about gender dynamics and misogyny, of course, and women. God, there’s been a lot. There’s really been a lot. There’s been a lot of kind of stories to cover, of things to respond to. It feels like everything is peaking. I don’t know if this is actually the peak, or if we have a way to go. But I mean, one thing, I think, is that so much of our culture has sort of learned from, and is responding to, the example of the president. Who is not, I would say, the most decent person when it comes to talking, thinking about, talking to, treating women.

Warzel: I think that’s well documented. Yes.

Gilbert: Well documented; yeah. I’m wondering, will I always check in? But obviously, his example, I think, has had a real profound effect on the culture. I feel like it’s enabled a lot of people to be much more honest about how they feel about women. I wrote this in one of my pieces last year, but it did feel like, for a while, that sexism and misogyny were not generally acceptable in public discourse. They were frowned upon. I mean, you would get fired as someone in the workplace if you said something misogynistic or sexist. You would, you know, have an outcry, public outcry, if you tweeted something or said something publicly to that, in that line. And now, it’s just open season. I don’t know if it’s, like, the Overton window being broadened. Or it just feels like there is so much license now for people to say the most outrageous, the most indecent, the most horrific things.

Warzel: Do you feel like a lot of that is a direct backlash? Some people frame the Trump years, the Trump election in 2016, as a backlash to the historic election of a Black president. This idea that we are constantly ping-ponging back and forth in this very extreme way to the thing that happened before. Do you see this as—I know you just referenced Trump now—do you see it as also a reflexive reaction in the culture to the #MeToo stuff?

Gilbert: Yeah, definitely. I wrote about this a little bit in my book. I wrote a book about the pop culture basically of the 1990s and the 2000s, and the ways in which it presented women and the big influence of porn on popular culture. And so much of the pattern of that period of time is: progress backlash, progress backlash, progress backlash. I mean, Susan Faludi, I think, wrote this in Backlash that any time women are perceived to be making strides—in terms of status, in terms of equality—there is a profound backlash to that in the culture. And I think certainly, Trump himself was manifesting as a reaction to a lot. And then obviously after #MeToo, you had this real pushback. And then after what happened in 2020—with the George Floyd protests and sort of sustained efforts on the part of lots of people to build a more equitable culture—there was obviously a backlash to that too.

So it just feels like everything constantly is kind of reverberating back and forth, back and forth.

Warzel: Is that why … there was a line that struck me in the piece you wrote after Trump called a reporter “Piggy.” It said, “Over the last few weeks, it feels like we’re revisiting the same characters over and over, with no consequences and no forward momentum.” Is that part of it, or is that a different dynamic?

Gilbert: No. I mean, there are definitely the main characters, right? Like, there’s Trump; there’s Elon Musk; there’s [Robert F. Kennedy] Jr. I mean, so many of these people just keep coming up in the news with reference to these kinds of stories. And I think in part that’s because of who they are, and how they behave, and what they’re doing. And the example that they set, as well.

Warzel: Your book, which you just mentioned, is fabulous. And it picks at the ways in which so much of this is baked into our culture. Like, for example, sexual objectification is normalized and kind of branded in the fashion industry, and they profit off of all that. And then it emanates also, you know, into every other corner of popular culture there. I’d love to—in part because of what’s happening with Musk and Grok—love to trace the role that technology is playing in all of this. Do you feel it’s a similar kind of dynamic to what you were writing about in the book? Because you and I were talking a little bit before this, and you told me that you’re thinking about how this is coded in from the beginning on the tech platforms. And I wanted you to expand on that. How can we start to just trace this through some of these big tech platforms?

Gilbert: Yeah. I mean, this was one of the things that really surprised me the most in my research. So many of our major tech platforms that are really incorporated into our daily lives were built on the exposure of women; on the desire to look at sexualized pictures of women. I mean, I can talk about this a bit more in a minute, but if you go way back to the ’90s, when the internet was really first becoming a force of presence in people’s lives, the first real viral video was Pamela Anderson’s sex tape, which was obviously stolen. It was a private video made with her and her husband on her honeymoon. It was stolen from their home. It was released without her consent. Was broadcast on the internet, sold as VHS. It became just such a moment of mass-media consumption in a time when I think no one really understood what was happening.

So it’s just—it’s in the history of our technology. I mean, before we had Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg created Facemash, which was a site where people could compare the relative hotness of women at Harvard. I mean, Google Images was created because Jennifer Lopez wore a very low-cut Versace dress to the Grammys, and there was so much unprecedented traffic. And there was no way to easily provide people with images. So that was created as a response.

Gilbert: Yeah. So it’s basically like—name a tech platform in there. It has been created because someone, somewhere, wanted to ogle women. And it’s not that that’s a bad thing, per se. It’s just that it’s part of the coding. It’s part of the texture of why the internet was made, and what people have always wanted to use it for. I think what you see, and what we’re seeing now with Grok, is that whenever there’s a leap forward in terms of technology, the first thing people use it for seems to be sex. And often sexual exploitation as well.

Warzel: Well, I’ve done previously, in past decades, stories about technology and the porn industry, right? And the porn industry has the similar part—or maybe slightly the flip side of that dynamic is that the porn industry is also very good at seeking out. Whether it’s VHS, or whether it is some of the internet stuff, some of the even just like the switch posts. You know, the Pamela Anderson sex tape, to this idea of amateur porn. Then artificial intelligence and VR goggles, and things like that. Like the industry itself—not the nonconsensual part of it, but the bought-and-paid-for part of the industry has always been excellent at leveraging that and figuring out new, novel ways of distribution.

Gilbert: Yeah, one of the facts that really blew my mind was learning that in the mid-’70s, when VHS technology was first introduced, up to 75 percent of the tapes being made, really the first day of VHS being available, were pornographic. The early adopters were just that fast to see what VHS would be used for.

Warzel: One thing that I was looking at, reading in your book, that was just so striking—post all of this Grok stuff, and this idea of the internet just being flooded at the moment with all this AI-generated nonconsensual sexualized imagery. Is the description from, and you’re just describing, a scene from the ’90s teenage-sex comedy American Pie in which one of the characters has an exchange student over and sets up a webcam. And then, you know, like runs over to his friend’s house to basically watch her, surveil her in his room, and then broadcast that to the whole school or whatever. This idea that—you know, she’s basically shamed. She’s an exchange student, shamed to go back to her own country. Where the main character who did this is just, you know, kind of “boys will be boys’ed” out of it.

And I was just so struck by the way in which, I mean, American Pie was just like a canonical film of the late ’90s, early 2000s. Just so popular in our culture. And yet right there is this idea of, I don’t know if it’s exactly revenge porn, but really horrible, nonconsensual broadcasted imagery. Over the internet. The fact that these tools, like, should be used for this type of spying—or even if not, it’s kind of funny. And that there really are no consequences for doing so. Can you just tell me a little bit about how you feel popular culture has dealt with this rise of the broadcasting of women, the ogling of women, in this? And sort of made it acceptable for people to treat women in this way?

Gilbert: Yeah; I mean, I think one of the things that happens is that technology is so fast that we don’t, as a society—even in terms of thinking about our laws or our structures or our ethical frameworks—we don’t have ways to respond as quickly as technology arrives. So when things like webcams, and the ability to stream video, or the ability to furtively take pictures of people without their knowledge … when things like that arrive, it takes us a while to sort of build ethical frameworks in terms of usage. So I think that example in American Pie is so interesting because you see this new technology. You see it as a story in a film, but we didn’t have the language, right, to say nonconsensual porn. Or, I mean—we don’t have the words necessarily to accurately describe what’s going on. And I think that it always takes a while for us to catch up.

So with something like—another thing I write about in my book is the way that photographers, paparazzi photographers in the 2000s, would lie down on the ground to take pictures of women’s skirts. Basically to try and capture, catch them, photograph them without underwear. And now I would call that nonconsensual porn, of course. But back then, it was called upskirt. Like, upskirt photography; upskirting. Because we didn’t yet … we hadn’t figured out the right way of thinking about what it actually was, what it actually meant. And that’s why I think language is so important. And it’s why something like what’s happening on Grok right now is so dispiriting to me. Because it’s like: We’ve already done it. We’ve already learned the lesson. We’ve already decided as a culture that this is not something that we want to participate in. That it’s wrong; that it profoundly hurts and traumatizes women. And yet new technology comes along, a new way of doing it. And everyone kind of forgets everything that we’ve set forward.

Warzel: Do you think it’s that, or do you think it is a backlash, again, in this way? Or people trying to reclaim it, right? Something that I have noticed in the dynamic—and other people have noticed, of course—of what’s happening with the Grok stuff is it’s so clearly all about power, right? Like, it’s this idea of immediate ritualized, viralized shame and humiliation. And it feels to me almost less like we haven’t learned those lessons, and more like a bunch of people saying like, “You know, we want to go back.”

Gilbert: Yeah, I think you’re 100 percent right. It is about power. It’s about asserting that in certain spaces, at least online, women are not equal human beings. They will always be seen as nonhuman objects. Anytime they have ways of speaking or voicing things, they will be essentially silenced. They’ll be driven out of certain platforms; they’ll be made to feel unwelcome; they’ll be shamed in lots of ways, and humiliated. And it’s very much about underscoring the idea that, again—I mean, it’s sort of taking away our full humanity, in a way that I find, again, horrifying in so many ways. It’s not even about making sexual material. It’s about making sexual material of women in a way that is trying to dehumanize them and objectify them, but also to sort of push them out of public life.

Warzel: This may seem like an obvious question, given that we’re talking about Grok right now, but how are you thinking about how AI is supercharging this, or how it’s changing the dynamics? Obviously, it’s allowing it to happen so much more quickly. It’s allowing there to be, I guess, a level of crude and awful imagination in the scenarios that one can be put in. But yeah, how do you see AI changing and pushing this dynamic forward?

Gilbert: There are so many different elements of AI that I find disconcerting. I think one is the way that it just affirms whatever the user wants to do. It’s sort of, it’s very sycophantic. It’s very obsequious. It will try and keep users engaged by really making them feel good about themselves and what they’re doing. There’s not a lot of pushback. And in terms of a lot of the relationships that are being set up, in terms of people’s emotional and intimate relationships with chatbots … it’s not normal to have that kind of relationship. You don’t have that kind of relationship with a human being. With any kind of human being, there’s friction, there’s pushback. There’s a two-way power dynamic. It’s not the person in the relationships, let’s say the man in the relationship, being constantly affirmed, constantly catered to, constantly gratified in any way that he might want. And so I think setting up that dynamic in terms of: What are people’s expectations? How are they being set up to have real human relationships, in real life? That’s one thing that I find troubling.

But there’s also, I mean, you could look at the way that I think when ChatGPT, a version of ChatGPT, was launched in 2024, and it had this female voice that was modeled after Scarlett Johansson because she declined to let them use her. Yeah, allegedly. I’m sorry. Yeah.

Warzel: Allegedly, sounded exactly like Scarlett Johansson. Scarlett Johansson thought that it sounded like Scarlett Johansson. She was very pissed off. Allegedly, allegedly.

Gilbert: But it’s very feminine coded, right? And so you have these assistants. I think this comes back to the Siri discourse, when Siri was first launched. And she, of course, had a female voice. When, you know, Alexa obviously has a woman’s name. Are we affirming these dynamics where women take care of men, by coding that into the platforms that we use? It certainly seems so.

Warzel: Something I wanted to ask you about was the rise of OnlyFans. Obviously, porn—we’ve talked about it. And through your work, there is this kind of … it always is coming back to porn. In terms of roles and expectations for women, and the way that it’s infusing in culture.

OnlyFans has been a really interesting revolution in adult content in that, you know, when I was reporting on the adult industry a little bit in the ’00s, or the 2010s rather, it felt like nothing was ever going to take down those tube sites. Those free tube sites that were, you know, squeezing production companies; also, you know, uploading a lot of stuff that hadn’t been verified, from performers that was quote unquote “amateur” content.

A lot of big issues. And also sort of a strange leviathan monopoly on the industry that was driving, you know, the money that they—that performers—could make way down. OnlyFans comes along; there’s a sort of democratization element and influencing element therein. And a lot of people have made great amounts of money on that. There’s been a feeling from certain people of, you know, an empowerment in terms of this type of sex work.

And yet, it also feels to me like it has added this influencer culture onto it, right? There are so many elements of influencer interaction with fans that the platform has set up. That I think, as you said, also set up these relationships. How have you been watching the rise of OnlyFans and thinking about it in terms of all this culture?

Gilbert: I find it so fascinating. In so many ways, I think the first way is thinking culturally. I’m always thinking about, like, how does culture inform desire? How does culture teach us things that we’re attracted to, or things that are acceptable, or things that we fantasize about? And when you look at a lot of porn from the ’90s and the 2000s, the women in those movies were a very narrow range of beauty. They were sort of mostly young, mostly thin, mostly blonde. Like, I’m not gonna go any more descriptive than that. But it was quite a narrow, I would say, physicality. And then OnlyFans comes along, and it really broadens, I think, the scope of just the kinds of desire that people felt licensed in having. I’m thinking about age. Like, a lot of the celebrities who have made names for themselves on OnlyFans, and who have really made significant amounts of money, are in their 50s. Which seems interesting to me, because in mainstream culture, those kinds of women are not typically portrayed as desirable, right? Like you’re in your 20s and your 30s, or in your 40s if you’ve had a good facelift.

But women in their 50s are not typically sex symbols in Hollywood. So suddenly you have this platform that is really … I don’t know, it’s sort of allowing a much broader definition of what is desirable in mainstream culture. And so that, to me, is fascinating and positive in lots of ways. I think OnlyFans has certainly made things a lot safer for sex workers in many ways. But again, I mean, in terms of what I was talking about with AI and chatbots, it’s the same kind of one-sided dynamic. Where you have men having these very intimate, and often parasocial, but very, very intimate and emotional relationships with women who are performing for them for money. It’s not coming from an honest place of connection. It’s coming from a place of sort of a one-sided power dynamic, where women perform and cater to men. And so while it’s fascinating in so many ways, I do think it’s affirming the same kinds of patterns that we see more and more in technology.

Warzel: I’ve had to go and look in some of these backwater areas for the reporting on the Grok stuff, but also just in general with AI-driven sexualized images, or what have you. And something that I’ve seen in some of these communities—I mean, apart from the awfulness—is these confessional posts from men who are saying, Guys, I’m kind of ruined by this. Right? This is like, I can generate my fantasy and my dream on demand now, and then tweak it in all these different ways and do it again and again and again. And I don’t feel anything when I look at women. Or something like that. Like, I’ve seen numerous confessional posts in that regard. And I think about that with the culture. And I don’t know how much you know about this—but there was a very long Harper’s story about this, but this culture of “gooning” and this idea of sensory overload. Marathon sessions of self-pleasuring and being bombarded by porn of all kinds. Where do you think this is all headed? You mentioned peaking in terms of, like, misogynist behavior. This is obviously a different category, but where do you feel like all this is headed?

Gilbert: Yeah. It seems so much like it’s an addiction. I was also looking at the Reddit page for Grok today, just to briefly see what people were talking about.

Gilbert: I saw—no, no, no, it’s okay. But you know, there are posts by women saying, “I’ve discovered that my boyfriend has created undressed images of people who we know. Women who we know in real life.” Like, “He says he can’t help it; it’s a compulsion.” But you know, that’s one real-world consequence.

I have talked a lot over the past year about how the manosphere is setting men up for profound failure. Like, if you cannot see women as equal human beings, you cannot relate to them on a level of basic equality. No one is going to want to be in your life. No one is going to want to have an intimate, personal relationship with you. And we know that men need marriage and meaningful relationships as a health matter. Like, men live longer when they’re married. They’re happier when they’re married; they get less diseases when they’re married. That kind of emotional stability has a profound public-health impact. And so things like this, they are setting men up for these lives of profound loneliness. And, you know, not to sort of be like, What about the men? But it is an interesting aspect of it that I think can get lost sometimes when we’re talking about, rightfully, how awful and humiliating this is for the women involved. But like, it works both ways.

Warzel: To that point, I don’t want to focus on the men in all of this, but do you think that that’s a way, like a crack, in which somebody—like some of this can just be begun to be pulled a bit apart? I think so much about what the manosphere and a lot of these, you know, hypermasculine influencers are trying to sell, right? Which is this idea that someone’s putting something over on you, right? Like, you’re either being exploited by feminism, or whatever, you’re being subjected to something by some outside force, right? And this is a way to, like, push against it. Get a little bit of autonomy; be a man; do whatever. I feel like there’s a reverse version of that with this, right? Which is like, All of these people are setting you up. Like a reverse Alex Jones, right? Like, All these people are setting you up for this failure. They’re exploiting you to sell creatine powder, or whatever it is. And that is a way in which you can actually break free on this. Like, people are trying to subjugate you for profit, because they’re influencers, because there’s a reason to, or an intentional thing to gain. Do you feel like that is a possible way to switch the dynamic?

Gilbert: Yeah. I think it’s a way to frame it that gets people to pay attention. Certainly, maybe a different kind of person than someone who might read our stories at The Atlantic and be profoundly influenced.

Warzel: I’m always trying to figure out how to talk to the manosphere. Always, you know, direct to camera.

Gilbert: I think it is an argument that is both valid and may have more of an impact. I think the thing that I really am caught on, right now, is the thing that you and our colleague Matteo Wong wrote about. Which is that this is our red-line moment. Like, if we cannot agree that this is something that we will not do as a culture, there is no coming back from it. And particularly, I was thinking lot about Elon Musk’s comments when my great home country of Great Britain threatened—not even threatened—but there was the specter of possibly X being taken offline. And he responded that it would be the suppression of free speech.

And I was thinking about how we’ve always, as a culture, agreed—we’ve been unanimous on this—that there are certain kinds of speech that we will suppress. And that speech is, you know, child-sexual-abuse material. That is the kind of speech that we will not tolerate in society. We do not allow it. We legislate very strongly against it. There are so many taboos against it. It is something that is really profoundly frowned upon, and we’ve always agreed on that. So why now has it become something that suddenly people—politicians in my country—are saying might be protected free speech? Like, what has changed? I really just am so much in alignment with your argument that there’s sort of no coming back if we can’t draw this line now, and set up our boundaries.

Warzel: What has changed, at the risk of sounding extremely dumb and obvious. But, you know… a healthy society stops this. We are not stopping this. So what has changed? Is it just simply, we’re just not a healthy society? Or … what’s changed that this is a red line that people seem okay crossing, as long as they’re not, you know, they don’t have to wear it? You know, just as long as it just passes.

Gilbert: Yeah. There’s such cognitive dissonance in being alive right now in this moment of like, Epstein freakout, but also post–kind of QAnon, “save the children.” And suddenly people ... it’s really hard to make sense of. I think the thing that has changed is Elon Musk. And the money that he has, and the power that he has, and the position that he has. And the way that he has taken over X—in a way where it still operates just about enough like the traditional social-media site that it once was, that people feel like it might be, but it’s not anymore. It’s really 4chan with a couple of normies. Like, it’s been so profoundly radicalized. It’s just become a cesspool in a way that I think people who have stayed on it have become inured to. And it’s sort of harder to shock them, I think. And that has profoundly affected the people who are still on the platform, and the ramifications are going to affect all of us.

Warzel: I just did, at the front of this, a bit of a monologue about this moment. The red-line moment; the line in the sand. I think the hope always, with our work, when we’re talking about the culture or the technologies, and how they push people to a certain, they force cultural change in some way.

If a lawmaker—if someone in power—is listening to this, what’s your message for them on all this right now?

Gilbert: I would say: This is such an easy one for you. It’s so straightforward. Morally, it’s so simple. Ethically, it’s so simple. It’s so straightforward. If you can be the person who will take a stand, you will have so many people behind you. I know it’s hard, because Musk has money, and Musk has power, and money buys you more power. But this is very straightforward, and it’s not something that the public at large are divided on. And if you think that the public are divided, it’s possibly because you’ve spent too much time on X.

Warzel: I couldn’t have said it better myself. Sophie Gilbert, thank you for coming on to talk about the world’s most depressing stuff. I think the only way though to go forward is to just address it head on. So the only way out is through. And thank you for helping me get through.

Gilbert: Thank you for your piece. I know; I’m sorry that you’ve already spoken about it, but I wanted to bring it up, because it’s such a good piece and everyone should read it. And I think this kind of moral clarity right now is hard to come by and very important.

Warzel: Wonderful. Sophie, thanks so much.

Novelists committed to depicting contemporary life face an unprecedented challenge in this moment: How can they do so in a way that keeps readers interested when so much of the average person’s time is spent scrolling across a variety of screens?

First, here are four new stories from The Atlantic’s Books section:

Looking at the internet doesn’t lend itself easily to depiction in prose, and yet anyone writing about the 21st century has no choice but to address it. This doesn’t change the fact that describing someone browsing the web or scrolling without end can be mind-numbing. Different novelists have approached this fresh challenge in multiple ways: by adopting the unique vernacular or fragmented form of a social-media feed, for instance, or by showing a protagonist falling deep into a rabbit hole.

In her debut novel, Lost Lambs, Madeline Cash, a co-founder of the literary magazine Forever, has attempted to write an internet-mediated story that feels more grounded in the real world than what has come before—in large part by adopting the classic form of the family drama. She uses this approach to show not only what it looks like for a person to spend a lot of their time online, Gideon Leek wrote this week in The Atlantic, but also what that does to a person—and to their relationships. In Lost Lambs, every member of the Flynn family is influenced by their devices in a different way: The parents, Bud and Catherine, have embarked on an experiment with nonmonogamy, an idea that Catherine gets from watching a Real Housewives spin-off set in Baghdad. Meanwhile, their daughter Louise has fallen in love with an Islamic-fundamentalist boyfriend she met online in a chatroom for middle children. “Yourstruly” (the screen name by which she knows him) has taught her how to make a bomb, which she’s been assembling in her backyard treehouse. “They don’t cover this sort of thing in parenting books,” Bud remarks, confounded.

The internet can do scary things to a person, such as encouraging violence or conspiracism. Leek points out that in Cash’s novel, however, the stakes seem oddly low because nothing bad really happens. In the logic of the family novel, betrayals and mistakes should lead to a “cascade of consequences,” he writes; instead, “Cash flinches.” But perhaps what Cash is doing is simply capturing something very real about the internet. It’s a unique place that intermingles the worst of humanity with absolute mundanity—somewhere you can have a relationship with a self-professed militant that ends before anything too grave occurs offline. In Cash’s novel, the characters, just like many real people, simply get lucky: The worst doesn’t occur—and what happens online, for the most part, stays there. Maybe the internet is not just changing society, but also tweaking the rules that govern what a family novel is supposed to be.

The Unhappy Literary Families of the Internet Age

Fiction about online life tends to mimic its dull repetition. A debut novel doesn’t quite succeed in raising the stakes—but it points the way forward.

The title of Yi’s strange and appealing 2023 novel refers to, as the unnamed narrator puts it, “a type of fanfiction where the protagonist was called Y/N or ‘your name.’” The narrator attends a K-pop show in Berlin and becomes obsessed with the band’s youngest member, the 20-year-old Moon: “a gift forever in the moment of being handed over,” Yi writes. As the narrator’s fixation grows, she begins writing Y/N fan fiction about Moon, much of which is reproduced in the novel. When Moon abruptly retires, the narrator goes to Korea to find him. Some readers might expect an indictment of fan fiction and celebrity culture; Yi swerves, though, and creates a more searching and subversive tale of love, connection, and art. Even after the narrator finds Moon, her motives remain obscure. The point of her fantasy seems to be the fantasy itself.  — Erin Somers

From our list: Six books you can get lost in

📚  How to Commit a Postcolonial Murder, by Nina McConigley

📚 The Elements of Power, by Nicolas Niarchos

The Pitt Is a Brilliant Portrait of American Failure

Some might call The Pitt preachy. (A recent Vulture review argued that the show’s righteousness has become “distractingly pedantic, even patronizing,” as though considering real-world flash points through a humanizing lens was wholly new for television rather than embedded in its history: Remember Maude’s abortion? Rose’s Golden Girls HIV test?) I’d argue, rather, that The Pitt has an emphatic moral clarity that feels awkward only because we haven’t seen it for so long. It refuses to both-sides issues that it considers straightforward. Should you vaccinate your children against measles? Yes, The Pitt says, offering up a child with not just spots all over his body but also acute inflammation in his brain and spinal cord. The show is set in the emergency room, where society’s problems become inescapable, where people who have fallen through the cracks land. In an era of relentlessly absurd and wealth-washed TV, The Pitt’s realism, its defiant lack of glamour, is bracing.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Every time I’ve found myself lost for words over something in the news this past year—which has happened disconcertingly often—I’ve returned to the same book for guidance, the philosopher Kate Manne’s Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny, published in 2017, largely in response to the election of Donald Trump. Misogyny, Manne argues, is often less about hating women outright than about policing and punishing their behavior.

It can—of course—be an expression of both. “Fucking bitch,” a male voice, believed by many to be that of the ICE agent Jonathan Ross, was captured on video saying last week—after Ross had crossed in front of Renee Nicole Good’s car; after she’d calmly told him, “I’m not mad at you”; and after he’d then shot her at least three times. Good didn’t seem afraid of Ross—even though, apparently, she should have been. She wasn’t sufficiently reverent and deferential to the uniform he wore, to the gun in his hand, to the terror the Trump administration is using ICE to elicit in so many American communities. And because of that, she’s dead.

Sophie Gilbert: No, women aren’t the problem

Not just dead but grotesquely maligned in her death, in ways that try to enforce and underscore the patriarchal order that women such as Good threaten. “There’s a weird kind of smugness,” the conservative analyst Will Cain said on Fox News, “in the way that some of these liberal white women interact with authority.” Good was, President Trump himself said, “very, very disrespectful” in her interactions with the officer who shot her. Other people compelled to weigh in on the mother of three’s manifestly avoidable violent death seemed to take umbrage at the fact that she had previously specified her pronouns, that she was visibly queer, and simply that she was, in the right-wing pundit Erick Erickson’s words, an AWFUL: an Affluent White Female Urban Liberal.

If sexism is based on the belief that men are inherently superior to women, misogyny, Manne writes, especially targets “unbecoming women—traitors to the cause of gender—bad women, and ‘wayward’ ones.” Good has apparently been deemed by some to be all three. “You guys gotta stop obstructing us,” the Minnesota Reformer quoted one ICE agent as telling another activist this week. “That’s why that lesbian bitch is dead.” Women are by no means ICE’s primary target or victims—officers have been empowered to act as aggressively as they please toward anyone they encounter. (Thirty-two people died in ICE custody last year according to The Guardian, the highest number in more than two decades.) On Wednesday night, an agent reportedly threw flash-bang grenades and tear gas near a car filled with children, causing airbags to deploy, three minors to be hospitalized, and an infant who was in the car to momentarily stop breathing, the child’s mother said. Over the past year, videos have documented agents throwing people to the ground, shooting them with “nonlethal” rounds at close range, raiding day-care centers, leaving children alone and unattended after detaining their parents.

Good’s wife, Becca, stated after Good’s death that she was “a Christian who knew that all religions teach each other the same essential truth: We are here to love each other, care for each other, and keep each other safe and whole.” For her insurgent empathy, the U.S. government has labeled her a domestic terrorist, and has instructed Minneapolis prosecutors to investigate her wife. (Six federal prosecutors in Minnesota subsequently quit in protest.)

Hating and wanting to punish women is an ancient pastime—“fucking bitch” made me catch my breath, as honest as it was in its loathing—but one that is being ever more gamified, turned into recreation. On January 2, The Guardian reported that Grok, xAI’s chatbot, had been generating images of women and children “in minimal clothing,” responding to prompts that could turn virtually any picture of any person into nonconsensual pornography. In many countries, including the U.S., publishing imagery like this of minors is illegal, and yet X’s owner, Elon Musk, responded to Grok’s generation of sexually humiliating imagery and child-sexual-abuse material (CSAM) with crying-laughing emojis. (xAI posted, “We’ve identified lapses in safeguards and are urgently fixing them—CSAM is illegal and prohibited.”) Later, Musk asserted that any country seeking to prevent this kind of ritualized harassment by taking X offline would be suppressing free speech, even though sexual imagery of minors has historically been the one kind of speech that virtually everyone can agree should be suppressed.

Read: Elon Musk cannot get away with this

It’s beyond clear that the technologies being imposed upon us exaggerate and enable tendencies that used to be unspeakable. They normalize abuse, and they have already normalized gendered hatred. These compulsions come from the same place as the impulse to punish Renee Nicole Good for protesting, for not bending to patriarchal authority. Grok, in fact, generated images of Good wearing a bikini and pictures of her defaced with bullet holes in the days after her death. Objectification, Manne writes, “can seemingly serve not only as punishment but also as a way of defusing the psychic threat that certain women pose.” What do you do with a disrespectful woman, a wayward one? Punish her, dehumanize her as an example everyone can learn from. What do you do with a woman who seeks authority for herself? Remind her of her place. It’s not surprising that many of the first people targeted by AI deepfake “undressing” technology were women in positions of power. In her 2025 book, The New Age of Sexism, the writer and activist Laura Bates describes learning that her image had been modified into deepfake pornography, seemingly in response to her work addressing sexism. “Even now, it feels like a violation,” she writes. “There’s a little shock, disgust, fear, and, yes, shame every time I see it.”

We have a choice to make about whether we simply accept Musk’s right to turn his social-media site into the world’s biggest pixelated abuse generator—whether we yield to the idea that any woman who appears online or annoys a man runs the risk of being turned into grotesque sexual caricature. As my colleagues Charlie Warzel and Matteo Wong have written, if we refuse to put a “red line around AI-generated sex abuse, then no red line exists.” (Musk has since responded to pushback in certain countries by supposedly geoblocking Grok from fulfilling explicit requests on X in some places, although reporters in Britain have noted that its “undressing” mode continues to function.)

In some ways, what Grok is doing is what new technological platforms have always done. “Sex,” a Wired essay stated in 1993, “is a virus that almost always infects new technology first.” The first mass-consumed video of the online age was a private tape of one of the most famous women in the world that a disgruntled contractor stole and turned into nonconsensual pornography. One of Mark Zuckerberg’s early websites was Facemash, a site that encouraged Harvard students to rate the hotness of female students, and the “Metaverse,” the virtual-reality landscape he spent almost $100 billion building, suffered from widespread reported incidents of sexual harassment and assault from the very beginning.

So many of the platforms that have come to dominate our daily lives were born out of the simple desire to see women exposed. Objectification isn’t a bug; it’s a feature. But Grok’s transformation into a nonconsensual-porn factory is unprecedented in its shamelessness, its seeming impunity, its scale. (One report in 2023 identified 95,820 deepfake videos circulating online; Grok has been generating thousands of “nudified” images per hour.) And it speaks to all the ways in which contemporary reality is currently chipping away at women’s rights and status, with predictable consequences. “The propagandist’s purpose is to make one set of people forget that certain other sets of people are human,” Aldous Huxley wrote in The Olive Tree in 1936. We are now facing an urgent choice as to whether we submit to the entrenched hatred and abuse of women as a technological and cultural norm, or whether we fight for an alternative way forward.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/01/the-iranians-who-feel-betrayed-by-the-left/685644/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Whenever I hear the plaintive lyrics of “Baraye,” the song that became an anthem for the 2022 Iranian protests, I still tear up—and I find it hard to imagine anyone having a different reaction. Shervin Hajipour, then 25, wrote it by stringing together a list of young Iranians’ reasons for going to the streets. They want to kiss in public without fear and not be forced to spout empty slogans. They want an economic future and clean air. These are what the Czech dissident Václav Havel called the “aims of life,” which in authoritarian counties, places like Iran, slam right up against the “aims of the system.”

Iranians are out in those streets again, pursuing those aims. And this time they are being slaughtered for it in numbers that have not been seen before—estimates of the death toll are rough (because the internet and most international communication have been cut), but they run anywhere from 2,000 to 12,000.

This is a simple story: People are risking their life to resist tyranny, engaging in a human struggle for basic rights. Its resonance, particularly for those on the left, should be self-evident. It has all the greatest hits—pitting the powerless against power, freedom against repression, unarmed men and women against snipers. But in the most animated corners of the activist ecosystem, so recently energized by their opposition to the death and destruction in Gaza, it has not resonated. The protest has been viewed instead through the thick lens of ideology, producing a reaction that has been dismissive at best and, at worst, degrading to the Iranians themselves. Many thousands of demonstrators, rising up all over the country, are accused of being witless tools of an imperialist agenda, part of a “CIA-Mossad regime change campaign,” or maybe just actual “Mossad agents.”

These might be the most extreme examples—it’s easy enough to find any opinion on social media—but there are clear signs that they represent a pervasive line of thinking on the left. By Wednesday, they had reached a sustained-enough pitch that Cornel West, a high priest of anti-imperialism, was moved to reprimand his own comrades for “playing some ideological games”: “Shame on those on the left who view precious Iranians solely as pawns,” he said in a video posted on X. (For this, he was derided in replies as a “clown,” a “fool,” and “a useful tool of Zionism.”)

But I didn’t need to go online to see evidence of this myopia, or the effect that it is having on those who are distressed by what’s happening in Iran. I spoke this week with a number of Iranian exiles who consider themselves progressive and pro-Palestine—many of them used the word genocide, for instance, to talk about the conflict in Gaza. Overwhelmingly, they told me that they felt abandoned—rejected by peers whom they had believed shared their values. (I felt something like this myself in the days immediately following October 7.)

“I feel isolated and betrayed,” said Fatemeh Shams, a feminist scholar and poet at the University of Pennsylvania, referring to fellow academics. “I have already unfriended a bunch of these idiots who are, unfortunately, my colleagues. I don’t even know how I can bring myself, in the future, to even go to their conferences and give papers.”

In my conversations with these Iranian exiles, I heard deep frustration. Whether they are responding to social media or drawing conclusions from a lack of organizing was sometimes hard to tell, but they confirmed for me that this was not just a problem of the very online: The Iranian protesters stepping fearlessly into the sights of government snipers are being seen by the American left with more suspicion than sympathy. Perhaps I shouldn’t have been so surprised, given the state of American polarization. In many ways this is just the latest example of the epistemic rupture between left and right, a framework that applies settled, simplified templates to anything reality presents us with, including the recent shooting in Minneapolis—discarding what is inconvenient and swallowing what is most palatable.

This framework has ideological, if not factual, consistency. In the (admittedly) simplified version of the hard left’s worldview, the Iranian regime represents an anti-imperialist force that should be defended against America and Israel, two countries they view as agents of oppression. I can’t help but think of the way some intellectuals in the 1950s ignored Stalin’s Gulags because the Soviet Union was the side they wanted to support in the Cold War. From this Manichaean perspective, what is happening in Iran right now as the bodies pile up is possibly exaggerated, possibly the work of the Mossad or the CIA, or at the very least a disruption openly desired by Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu (and therefore evil).

What could be fueling this perception on the left is the fact that the right is indeed viewing the protest through its own interests. Trump said he hopes to “make Iran great again”—though as of this writing, the president seems to have backed off his threat of intervention, convinced that “the killing in Iran is stopping—it’s stopped—it’s stopping,” as he stutteringly put it. To many on the left, agreeing with the premise that regime change would be optimal feels like encouraging the start of another war in the Middle East. And if you ask a college activist why they are willing to protest in support of Palestinians but not Iranians, they might answer, logically, that the United States is complicit in the killing in Gaza because of the money that flows to Israel, whereas it already sanctions the Islamic Republic—so there is no policy change to agitate for. This argument, however, sounds pedantic to me, like a point scored in a debate rather than a real explanation for why some human dramas compel empathy and action and others do not.

The Mossad and CIA conspiracy theories also draw on real facts: A slice of the opposition in Iran is loyal to Reza Pahlavi, a son of the former shah who expanded his power in 1953 with the CIA’s backing. Pahlavi does not seem to represent a democratic, pluralistic vision of the country’s future, and he is openly courting American and Israeli intervention.

This has all led to an orgy of whataboutism, as the left and the right mock each other for caring only about their favored victims. Lost in this pointless food fight is what is actually happening to the Iranian people, who are fighting against a sclerotic regime that has insinuated itself into the most private corners of their life and proved itself incapable of maintaining a standard of living for its citizens.

“We’re between a rock and a hard place,” Ali Abbasi, an Iranian-born film director based in Denmark, told me. “The left doesn’t believe us, because they think we have the wrong supporters. The right wants us to go and, you know, overthrow the Islamic Republic and install a pro-Israeli, pro-right” leader. “And in the middle are millions and millions of Iranian people who just know this system has hit an absolute dead end.”

I am not shocked by the positions held by the right; perhaps because of this, I feel more troubled by the quiet on the left. If you’re someone attuned to suffering, you should be strongly inclined to feel a sense of solidarity with the protesters in Iran. And I’d hoped that somewhere in the leftist body, beneath layers of ideological bloat, the muscle for expressing basic opposition to totalitarianism was intact. I don’t think I’m being self-indulgently nostalgic when I recall that there used to be an international left capable of activating on behalf of people fighting fascism anywhere in the world, simply as a matter of principle.

For the exiles I spoke with, the most disturbing—and telling—thing about the tepid response was the contrast with the impassioned reaction to Gaza. “Why is it that when Palestinians—armed or unarmed—fight for liberation, it is seen as a moral duty to support them, but when Iranians protest, they are labeled ‘armed terrorists’ or ‘agents of Mossad?’” Shams, the feminist scholar, said.

Janet Afary, a religious-studies professor at UC Santa Barbara, helped put this dissonance in context. She described for me a long history that would explain the left’s knee-jerk sympathy for the Islamic Republic, starting with the leftist elements that helped lead the 1979 revolution (alongside the clerics who ended up seizing full control). For those who want to see the end of Israel, the regime’s identity as a defender of Palestinian rights—and a funder of extremist anti-Israel groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah—has given it cachet.

Afary recalled confronting a colleague who was dismissive of the 2022 protests, which were largely driven by feminists; this person wondered why Iranian women can’t just wear hijab like other women in the Middle East. “Are you saying this because you don’t want the government of the Islamic Republic to be overthrown because it supports the Palestinian cause?” Afary asked her. She said yes. “To my face!” Afary said.

The ideological left doesn’t know what to do with violence that doesn’t involve a Western aggressor, according to Kamran Matin, another exile and an international-relations professor at the University of Sussex in England. Matin noted other groups that received only muted support from anti-imperialists, including the Yazidis, persecuted by ISIS, and Rohingya, victims of the Myanmar government—in which case the aggressors were not Western hegemons. If you jump to the barricades against these atrocities, “then the whole edifice of postcolonial anti-imperialism basically collapses. Because for them, it feels like they dilute their case against the West by accepting non-Western cases.”

I also wonder if what distinguishes Gaza from Iran is that Palestinian civilians represented perfect victims, people bombed simply for living in Gaza, especially in places where Hamas was operating. The picture in Iran is more complicated; the protesters are fighting for regime change, and they comprise a melange of opposition groups with various motives and ideas about a post-ayatollah Iran. The opponents of the mullahs are, for now, powerless against them. But they are also, ultimately, jockeying for power, with various international forces behind them. (This is true of Palestinians, of course, but the endgame seems very far off.) Outsiders might think that supporting the protests would amount to support for one or another faction.

This sort of litmus test is exactly what the exiles I spoke with find so disheartening because it doesn’t regard Iranians as people with agency who deserve their own freedom. Some even described as racist the assumption, as Abbasi put it, “that people of a country like Iran are never able to make their own decisions, and they’re always puppets of some government, some power.”

All you have to do, he added, is look at who is getting killed to understand that this is a movement of ordinary people—and he wants the focus to return to them. “Of the few people that are named among the killed, one of them was a costume-design student,” Abbasi said. “The other one was a bodybuilder. The third one was a sculptor. These are not the people who work for anyone. If the CIA was really using a sculptor to do armed operations in Iran, then it’s mismanaged.”

Nearly a week into the communications blackout, and with stories of extreme state violence leaking out, Abbasi and his fellow exiles seemed desperate to have their case taken up by as broad a public as possible, one that bridges partisan politics. But when I spoke with Siamak Aram, the president of the National Solidarity Group for Iran, he didn’t sound particularly hopeful on this point. He told me that a demonstration planned for this weekend, which was meant to bring together multiple factions of Iranian opposition, had almost no participation from non-Iranian activist groups.

This was unfortunate, Aram said, because the argument for supporting his people should be legible to the left. “If a police officer kneels on the neck of a man, we condemn that,” he said. “If a sniper shoots a girl in Tehran, we must condemn that.” Aram also thinks we need to find a way to see the human beings in this story. “The failure of both sides, of left and right, would be that they are letting their political calculator override their moral compass. They are asking, Who benefits if I condemn this?, instead of asking, What is wrong; what is right?”</div>

            <h2>Something Is Wrong With Russia’s Children</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/01/russia-children-violence-war/685635/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">One Tuesday morning last month, a 15-year-old Russian boy got ready for school by packing a paramilitary vest, a helmet, and a knife. Before leaving his house, he sent a manifesto to his classmates denouncing gay people and Jews, and quoting a mass murderer along with a white-supremacist conspiracy theory.

When the boy, identified by prosecutors as Timofey K., arrived at his school, located outside Moscow, he went to the bathroom to put on his gear, which he’d branded with neo-Nazi symbols and racist slogans. Then he filmed himself patrolling the hallways and asking people, at knifepoint, what nationality they were. Several gave the wrong answer, and Timofey stabbed them. Most survived, but a 10-year-old boy from a Tajik family did not.

Timofey’s attack wasn’t the first instance of brutality among schoolchildren in Russia last month. Two weeks earlier, a ninth grader had beaten an eighth grader so severely that the latter couldn’t remember what had happened by the time he got to a hospital. The next day, a group of teenagers tortured a schoolgirl in the Ural region, cutting into her back with a knife. Less than a week later, schoolboys repeatedly kicked a 10-year-old student in the head. Several days after that, a ninth grader stabbed his math teacher in the back.

For years, children in Russia have watched their country massacre Ukrainians and condemn hundreds of thousands of its own citizens to injury and death at the front. As violence has come to surround Russian youth, many seem to have become more violent themselves. Last year, the number of juvenile crimes in the country surged by 18 percent. Authorities also reported an uptick in “serious and especially serious” crime. “There is no positive ideology for children in a country fighting a murderous war,” Ilya Barabanov, a Russian journalist, told me. Instead, the war has amplified worldviews that encourage brutality.

The ethnic hatred that inspired Timofey’s attack has spread widely in Russia, thanks in part to President Vladimir Putin’s embrace of a militant strain of nationalism. The president has justified the war in Ukraine by appealing to a doctrine known as Russkiy mir, or “Russian world,” which makes no room for non-Russians. (Some of Putin’s soldiers in Ukraine have worn the kolovrat symbol that Timofey affixed to his vest, a neopagan emblem resembling a swastika.) Last year, the Kremlin even encouraged law enforcement to cooperate with ultranationalist groups. They helped police round up and deport tens of thousands of immigrants, who evidently did not belong in the Russian world.

Putin has claimed that the Russkiy mir ideology is based on “openness and constant respect” for other cultures. Yet just this week, his key propagandist, the TV presenter Vladimir Solovyov, called for additional “special military operations” in Armenia and Central Asia in order to maintain Russia’s “sphere of influence”—the same pretext for its war in Ukraine. For the Kremlin, other cultures, it seems, are not an object of respect; they are a threat that only violence and aggression can neutralize.

Timofey’s attack was not an aberration. It is a product of Putin’s dogma, and it has energized Russia’s many networks of ultranationalists and other extremists. The day after the assault, journalists spotted a neo-Nazi banner on the wall of the Federal Security Service office in Sochi. On social media, a neo-Nazi paramilitary group known as Rusich Army posted photos to its more than 1 million followers of the insignia on Timofey’s equipment, which included the English acronym SYGAOWN—“Stop Your Genocide Against Our White Nations.” One image showed Timofey pointing a knife at the school’s security guard; Rusich Army superimposed its logo on Timofey’s hand, seeming to claim him as one of its own.

Extremist groups are growing, and they are threatening further violence. In 2023, a far-right nationalist movement called Russkaya Obshchina said that its inaugural congress attracted some 200 people; it claimed to host more than 1,200 last year, including two members of Parliament. Last month, shortly before Timofey’s attack, the group posted a video with English subtitles, which included: “I will sharpen the knife. I will load the gun.” In June, nationalist Telegram channels reposted a similar video promising “big blood.”

Read: How Putin tapped a well of ethnic hatred in Russia

Alexander Verkhovsky, the director of the SOVA Centre for Information and Analysis, has studied Russia’s far-right movements and watched them expand. Every year from 2012 to 2022, he attended a council that Putin held with civil-society and human-rights groups. Verkhovsky warned Putin to his face about Russia’s growing xenophobia and the effect it could have on the country. Putin didn’t seem to listen.

Still, Verkhovsky told me that he has been surprised by just how quickly ultranationalism has taken root among Russian teenagers in particular—and just how violent they have become as a result.

Even some of Putin’s loyalists have expressed alarm. Nina Ostanina, a legislator who has largely endorsed Putin’s policies, responded to Timofey’s attack last month by telling the National News Service, “We see tragedy after tragedy. Our children are armed with a destructive ideology, and they don’t have a positive” alternative.

That might not be such a bad thing for Putin. Soon enough, Russia’s children will supply him with a new generation of eager soldiers.</div>

That means Seattle is issuing bonds like crazy, soaking up investment capital that then does not go to creating private sector jobs or paying higher wages.  It just turns into debt.  And that debt carries interest, so even less money for the people.

Seattle area voters did approve measures to build a monorail system. But the local politicians shot those down on each occasion. Citing &quot;financial risks&quot; and cost overruns in each case. Which Sound Transit (the light rail authority) has brought us in spades. The difference between the two systems (aside from the technology) was that the monorail system was envisioned as a stand-alone, self funded transit provider. Whereas Sound Transit was created as a region-wide taxing and revenue collection authority. With little oversight into its spending.

Anecdote: Following Sound Transits creation, I did a little research into proposed routes. Particularly in the Eastside region. One thing I found was records on line of Sound Transit purchasing some unused freight rail rights of way. For some hundreds of millions of dollars. &quot;Smart&quot;, I thought. Where better to put light rail than on existing railroad beds. But then a few years later, I looked again. Some of this acquired property had been given over to bicycle trails. Sound transit wasn&#39;t chartered to build bicycle trails, I thought. But the worst part; A significant portion of that right of way was handed back to adjacent property owners (generally wealthy people). I&#39;m pretty sure Sound Transit wasn&#39;t created to benefit the rich. But it turns out that I am mistaken. It was created to benefit whoever sits on it&#39;s governing board of directors. Hence, the political maneuvering by the ex-King County executive to obtain the CEO position on that board. Since it is sovreign to other local government agencies.

I can almost guarantee that the cost of this will spiral out of control and take way longer to complete than they are telling you right now.

CA High Speed Rail, was supposed to be done by now, it doesn&#39;t have a single working section, and has already ballooned its expenses. But here we are, throwing good money after bad, instead of cutting it off.

They know some percentage of users won&#39;t notice or won&#39;t be bothered, and that&#39;s free money for them.And you probably have to waive your right for any future damages or lawsuits regarding the incident. So if you take the $20 you can&#39;t come back with a lawsuit that says it cost you $1,000 in productivity for your Uber earnings for the day.

They know to whom they need to send a text but instead of just crediting their balance, they make customers jump through hoops in the hopes that some forego the effort or can&#39;t work the app.

Reminds me of the Uber-Eats vouchers ClownStroke handed out after their homemade disaster from abject incompetence...

Why is this mocking. $20 is 50% or of most of Verizon&#39;s monthly service plans.

A more than 50% rebate for a half day&#39;s outage is pretty good. But the rebate should be automatically applied. Not the way they are doing it.

I don&#39;t know what service plan you have, but my Verizon cell phone bill is over $80 a month. I needed one of the better &quot;Unlimited&quot; plans so I could tether my other devices without going over a data cap. Which is a really stupid thing to say about an &quot;Unlimited&quot; data plan, but it&#39;s 2026 and that&#39;s where we are now when it comes to corporate greed and service contracts.

Unlimited Ultimate Plan [verizon.com] $50

Even with an $80 bill, a $20 rebate is 25% off. To me 25% off for a 1.7% outage(half day / 30) is a very fair trade. Better than most SLAs I&#39;ve had the misfortune of reading.

We had lines affected. I got the text telling me to claim the credit, but I have no option to claim it. Has anyone successfully claimed it?

I donâ(TM)t think they need any engineers. Each year they use their marketing department and Dreamforce conference to find a new way to rebrand and repackage their existing products as something new, including the use of fabricated demos of features and products that donâ(TM)t exist and likely never will.

&quot;AI made us more productive&quot; has become the perfect excuse for the layoffs and hiring freezes that were going to happen anyway, given the state of the economy.  I wonder how long people will believe it?

Mass unemployment is celebrated as a success story...

What&#39;s they&#39;re saying is that they&#39;re generating more and more code with less and less human eyes to look at it... recipe for success!

Having consulted at a lot of these big businesses, I can tell you that a lot of the staff classified as &quot;engineers&quot; by CEOs in their posts & stock holder messaging, are in fact &quot;tool configurators&quot; that these orgs are using to setup, update, and modify the configuration of their internal tools, and a lot of last mile &quot;solutions&quot; for making clunky enterprise tools work well enough or often report well enough for internal middle management needs.

That opinions should be divergent is what should be expected.  Current AIs have &quot;jagged capability&quot;.  If what you want fits where they&#39;re good, you can be overly impressed.  If it fits where they&#39;re poor, you can be overly skeptical.

Actually, people have &quot;jagged capability&quot; also.  Don&#39;t ask me to win at football.  But we have reasonable models for people.  We don&#39;t have reasonable models for AIs.  Making the problem worse, different AIs have different capability profiles.  I don&#39;t know how good Claude is at

I have very little exposure to Salesforce, but from what I&#39;ve seen I suspect most of their software &#39;work&#39; is catering to companies that have ever so slightly bespoke details around largely the same general flows.  So LLM can probably do a decent job of rearranging their stuff to deliver a seemingly &#39;bespoke&#39; solution for a customer that is pretty much never anything truly &#39;new&#39;, but just a tailored mix of things everyone has already done.  Companies think their processes are unique and innovative and a tai

&quot;We spent so much money on this AI crap that while other companies are realizing they need more people to deal with the slop, we don&#39;t have any money left and we&#39;re completely boned, so we&#39;re raising our prices on salesforce.&quot;

Let&#39;s hear an announce from that dunce that AI has made the Executive Suite so much more productive that Salesforce has no further use for him. Termination at the End-O-Week, and any crap left behind will be mailed to him.

deigned to sell the snake oil he&#39;s selling.

I see more and more corporate executive spending millions on this shit, because they are easily fooled.  This bubble is going to pop, and its going to ruin the economy. Mark my words.

If they can&#39;t figure out how turn more employees into more revenue, then someone else is going to end up hiring those people. Actually it&#39;s worse than simply being unable to figure it out, they don&#39;t understand that they are even supposed to be turning labor into money.

If I were a customer of any company I relied upon for my business and I hear &quot;hiring 20% more account executives this year&quot; AND &quot;Salesforce had reduced its customer support workforce by roughly 50%&quot; this would be cause for concern and a signal I should probably be looking elsewhere.

I never understand why people like comments like this, almost like a hit and run.

No substance, no engagement, nothing constructive, just hit and run.

Grift huh?  I&#39;ve been doing this for 30 years.  I don&#39;t code anymore, I am using claude, and if you use it correctly,  you&#39;ll see it&#39;s not a grift.

Perhaps the AI tools the Ruby on Rails creator was using are not as well designed for a language which has been described as &quot;not a serious programming language&quot; [slashdot.org]?

Worse still, it&#39;s one of the lower ranked languages, even lower than Assembly, Cobol, and even classic Visual Basic [tiobe.com]!

So I&#39;m left wondering, is their opinion worth listening to, especially considering Linus Torvalds is dabbling in using AI [slashdot.org]? hmm

If you use it correctly, you&#39;re a human using it who understand its uses and limitations.  The grift is that vibe coding or autonomous coding is remotely viable.

> if it makes the junior programmers redundant> don&#39;t need their help anymore.

A true senior developer never &quot;needed&quot; the help of a junior dev to begin with. A junior developer&#39;s role is not to be some senior&#39;s personal secretary to take mundane boilerplate tasks the senior doesn&#39;t want to do. The goal is to eventually grow them into a dev capable of taking their own complex, senior-level tasks so that more work can actually be done or the senior can move on to other projects/jobs/retire.

If you see junior devs as some kind of burden to be replaced by AI, or whatever other automation or tooling, you&#39;re doing it wrong.

In my experience the code that AI produces is way overkill too.

For example, I recently had Copilot write, what should be, a small script to enable an option on all mailboxes, companywide. Something that should just be a quick for loop, checking for a parameter and setting it to something if it matched a specific value. Almost a one-liner, if I was writing it.

The thing spit out no less than 300 lines of code with all kinds of edge case checks and safety guardrails and logging. Ok, fine, this is probably how

So you&#39;re claiming that you agree with a programmer you claim is an idiot?  What does that make you?

&quot;But there are much better ways to use AI tools than lazily asking it to write everything--or even anything at all. LLMs are great for debugging, code reviews, and other things that don&#39;t actually generate code.&quot;

Are they though?  Or can you simply not tell the difference?

..as assistants to experts who know how and where to use them and know how to review the results.Hypemongers make the pitch to investors that AI will allow companies to avoid paying people, usually by vastly overpromising results.Creating novel, robust, maintainable, complex systems is hard, regardless of the power of the tools used.Posts are appearing from expert programmers who are impressed by AI results.The hypemongers use this as evidence to support their claims that someone who knows nothing can create complex code using a simple text prompt and then release it without understanding how it works.The tech is advancing rapidly and is becoming more useful. It would be better for everyone if commentators simply reported the facts, not the wild speculation.

Hopefully future jr. programmers will be doing things that 2025 jr. programmers only wish they had time to do.

Remember, in the early days of programmable computers, a programmer turned a math professor&#39;s instructions into machine code, which was far &quot;simpler&quot; (by today&#39;s standards) than modern &quot;programming.&quot;

These same firms will continue to be high speed traders, it will just be at a lower speed.  They are not outlawing the techniques, just the technological advantages.

It is still a race even if it is done on foot rather than in an automobile.  The normal, every day person operates at so much slower speeds that even without the specialized equipment, the firms will have a very similar advantage.

Also, it is practically impossible to outlaw the techniques.

How about requiring all bids to be posted for five seconds before closing? How fast can a human trader respond?

Just delay all transactions between 15 and 30 minutes from when the order is placed.

That would work, but there can be reasons why it&#39;s not best.  I&#39;m in favor of a per-trade tax that is higher for items held a shorter period of time, reaching 100% for trades sold within 10 nanoseconds.  (And paid by the seller.)

Now we need to do the same here. They offer nothing of value, they are skimmers.

If brokers have to put their servers outside of the data center, it gives an advantage to those whose servers are &quot;close by&quot; as the data-packet travels.

There are ways to overcome this advantage by using long runs of fiber to compensate, but if the overall goal is to discourage high-frequency trading I don&#39;t think the Chinese Government is going to do anything to encourage fairness here.

How about forcing a random delay in the system?

I think the better solution to HFT is to &quot;batch&quot; trades - sells get posted blind over the space of a second, they&#39;re revealed and there&#39;s a second of quiescence to allow everyone everywhere to see the sells, blind buys get posted in the next second, in the fourth second buys and sells are matched and in the fifth second the results are posted.  Naturally, one might parallelize this so there&#39;s always five sequences in flight.

Because the buys are &quot;blind&quot; (buyers don&#39;t have any visibility into what other buyer

Second? Make it an hour, give people time to eat lunch.

A second may be too short, but I think an hour would be unreasonably extensive.  Instead divide each minute into those four parts.  IIUC, most trades are done by algorithms, not by humans.  Somebody says something like &quot;if stock A drops below this amount while stock B stays above that amount, buy (or sell)&quot;, and the computer implements the rule.

Doesn&#39;t work. You don&#39;t know how the market works.

You have buyers, they are willing to pay a top price X. You have sellers, they are willing to sell for a minimum price Y. If X < Y nothing happens because the highest buyer and the lowest seller are still apart.

If Y < X, it means the most a buyer is willing to pay is MORE than the least the seller is willing to sell at. The trade happens for 1 item at the seller&#39;s lowest price. The buyer saves money, the seller gets their minimum price, and everyone le

Trading datacenters in the United States just give everyone the same length of fiber cable (adjusted for distance).

Say you want a 20 km circumference, then everyone starts with a 20km fiber spool, then you just trim off the excess amount to get the exact right distance.

Three days ago, Slate published an article I wrote titled “You’ve Heard About Who ICE Is Recruiting. The Truth Is Far Worse. I’m the Proof.” The article details how I, in an effort to learn more about Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s hiring practices, applied for a job at ICE—and ended up getting a job offer. To say that I was surprised would be an understatement: For one, I’m a vocal online critic of ICE and the Trump administration. More saliently, I skipped many of the steps required for the application. It’s a wild story—I’d encourage you to read the whole thing—and one that does not reflect particularly well on ICE or its parent organization: the Department of Homeland Security.

In another time, the exposé of an extraordinarily lax hiring process at an agency tasked with keeping the nation safe would be of bipartisan concern. After all, if ICE is going to arm agents and send them out into America’s streets, it should at least know whom it’s sending. Even supporters of ICE’s mission should want to know that the agency is hiring effective people to carry that mission out. And so under another administration, DHS might look into what happened here, figuring out how my application went through and whether it was a one-off glitch or a widespread, systemic issue.

This administration, however, took a different approach. “This is such a lazy lie. This individual was NEVER offered a job at ICE,” DHS said Wednesday through the administration’s most official communication channel: X (formerly Twitter). “Applicants may receive a Tentative Selection Letter following their initial application and interview that is not a job offer. It just means they are invited to submit information for review, similar to any other applicant.”

DHS is correct that I received an initial offer letter. I also, however, received a final offer, as well as an EOD (Entrance On Duty) date of Sept. 30, according to the application portal. The application listed my medical screening and background check as complete, despite me never filling out paperwork for either. Perhaps, had I pressed “Accept” and moved on with the process, they would have caught the glitch, performed the background check, and demanded those papers. But according to ICE’s own application portal, I was offered a job. (I asked ICE’s media department about all of this before publishing my article, but they did not respond.)

I took a screengrab video of my application status on the ICE portal as of Oct. 3, which you can view below.

There’s a lot going on here, so let’s break it down. The dashboard at the beginning of this video provides an overview of my application process for the position of deportation officer. My tentative offer is marked “Sent,” which—as the mouseover demonstrates—means that I did not acknowledge or accept the offer. The Pre-Employment activities section is marked TBD, which makes sense, since I did not complete any of the pre-employment paperwork. And yet, my final offer status reads “accepted” which, according to the mouseover, means “you accepted the Final Offer and your Entry On Duty date (EOD) date has been set.” And indeed, my onboarding status is EOD: “Your EOD has occurred. Welcome to ICE!”

The point here is that the video of ICE’s own portal confirms my story: The agency offered me a job and gave me a start date without, by its own admission, meeting its own standards for vetting.

Later on, you can see the pre-employment part of the portal that claims my medical and background checks are already complete. If this background check occurred without my participation or knowledge, it missed some massive red flags. I did not mention this in the original article, but Jedeed is a Syrian name: My father immigrated in the 1970s. This fact delayed my military clearance by several months back in 2005. Why, if this background check really happened, did no one think to ask about a possible connection to Syria this time around?

I uploaded the video to X in response to DHS’ “lazy lie” accusation, along with the text “You sure about that?” Seven million impressions, over 100,000 likes, and zero response from the Department of Homeland Security. To be fair, they have their hands full right now; they are very busy brutalizing and detaining people as they attempt to go to doctor’s appointments, throwing flash-bang grenades into cars full of children, and terrorizing the residents of a major American city.

DHS’ response is noteworthy because it comes at a moment when the department is demanding the public’s trust. It’s demanding that we believe that the ICE officer who killed Renee Good was in danger (despite contradictory video evidence), and that he left the event badly injured. More broadly, it’s demanding we believe that ICE agents are doing their work under siege, and that they’re the victims of agression—rather than the perpetrators of it. There are already plenty of reason to be deeply skeptical of any and all of that, but add this to the list: If DHS will lie so brazenly about this story, why would we believe anything else the department’s mouthpieces have to say?

Which brings me to the larger point of Tuesday’s article. We are not simply dealing with a broken hiring system or a lack of training within ICE’s ranks. This sloppy application process, and the DHS’ apathetic, angry response, are just two symptoms of a systemic disregard for the lives and safety of American residents—citizens and noncitizens alike.

The presence of an armed, masked, and improperly vetted force with no oversight and “absolute immunity” (not in a legal sense, but in the sense that the Trump administration’s DOJ will not prosecute them) should concern everyone in the country. What we are dealing with, in Minneapolis and across this nation, is an emergency—and no amount of DHS propaganda can make it go away.

President Donald Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act on Thursday to quell protests against the federal occupation of the Twin Cities, a move that would allow him to send in the military over Minnesota’s opposition. Masked immigration officers are currently rampaging through Minneapolis and St. Paul, brutalizing protesters and arresting individuals on the basis of race, drawing widespread opposition from local leaders and communities. The president evidently believes that he can wield the Insurrection Act to suppress their First Amendment rights and impose a kind of military rule on the streets.

But what exactly is this law—and why hasn’t Trump deployed it already? To explain what the Insurrection Act truly authorizes and the risks that come with invoking it, Mark Joseph Stern spoke with Georgetown Law professor Steve Vladeck on this week’s episode of Amicus. Vladeck is an expert on military law and author of the One First Substack. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mark Joseph Stern: Let’s start with the absolute basics: What is the Insurrection Act?

Steve Vladeck: The Insurrection Act is the common—if misleading—name that we’ve given to a series of statutes that trace all the way back to 1792. These statutes carry into force Congress’ constitutional power to provide for the “calling forth of the militia”—and then later, the military—to suppress insurrection, to repel invasion, or “execute the laws of the Union.” The idea was that Congress should be able to allow the president, in very narrow but important circumstances, to use military force as a backup when civilian order and civilian law enforcement has broken down.

So the idea was that it would be used in narrow circumstances, but the language is actually fairly broad. How have presidents invoked it in the past? It seems like, for the most part, they’ve actually been pretty restrained and not used it the way Trump wants to use it.

The history of the Insurrection Act is of pretty responsible usage of a statute that could be interpreted, in a vacuum, as a remarkably broad delegation of power to the president. We’ve had somewhere around 30 invocations of the statute across American history. But the last one was 34 years ago when President George H.W. Bush used it to help send troops in during the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles.

Although those 30 invocations might have been politically controversial in some cases, they weren’t legally controversial. When President Kennedy sent troops into Mississippi in 1962 to protect James Meredith and the 300 law enforcement officers who were there with him, that was politically controversial because the South didn’t want them. It was not legally controversial because those guys were at perilous risk of being lynched. And Mississippi’s local and state authorities were not exactly helping. So presidents have been responsible historically; they’ve usually had compelling factual bases for invoking the Insurrection Act. It hasn’t been used as a permanent way to deploy troops into our cities. Even the Justice Department, which is not shy about claiming power for the president, has taken a very narrow view of when they can use it.

It sounds like you don’t think that the protests in the Twin Cities right now actually give Trump legitimate grounds to invoke the Insurrection Act.

I don’t think it’s even close. But there is a problem of folks coming to this history fresh, who don’t know the backstory or the historical pedigree here. Because you could read the statute and say: If I squint a little, one protester throwing a rock at an ICE officer is impeding law enforcement. But the Insurrection Act is not about private conduct. It is really about circumstances where the states themselves are unwilling or unable to enforce their laws, or where they’re specifically thwarting federal law enforcement.

Every time the Trump administration points to an example of something bad happening to an ICE officer, the culprits are protesters, not state officials. President Trump can mouth off about the mayor and the governor, but he doesn’t have any specific examples of policies or episodes where state and local governments have been the reasons why ICE has been impeded. If it were otherwise—if one person doing one thing to impede an ICE officer from carrying out their duties was sufficient to justify an invocation of the Insurrection Act—then all protests would trigger the Insurrection Act. And that’s not how we’ve ever understood the Insurrection Act. It would not make any sense with First Amendment values.

Why hasn’t Trump invoked the Insurrection Act yet?

I think there are two reasons. One is political and one is legal. The political reason is that there really still are political obstacles to invoking the Insurrection Act. The president would invite blowback, even from some members of the Republican caucus and Congress. Not many, but given how razor-thin the Republicans’ margin is in the House right now, it wouldn’t take that many votes to really upend all of this.

Then the legal part is that the administration will be sued, and there are probably some folks who are wary that the facts, as they currently stand, make it at least somewhat questionable whether they will win that case. As opposed to a scenario where there’s a more visible unprovoked assault on an ICE officer, or a state official who is directly involved in impeding ICE. I think that might be the pretext they’re looking for.

That’s, of course, my next question: If Trump invokes the law, there will be a legal challenge, and it will go to the Supreme Court. What will that challenge look like, and do you really think it’ll have a chance of prevailing at SCOTUS? Is there also a chance that justices could say they just don’t have authority to overrule the commander-in-chief on this?

I don’t think the court will go quite that far. What I worry about more is a ruling that says that the president’s entitled to a whole lot of deference, not that the courts are powerless. I don’t think John Roberts is going to join an opinion that says the court is powerless about anything. But I do worry about the fight over the facts. In the National Guard cases, the lower courts made a series of factual findings that are inconsistent with what the executive branch said was the factual basis for deploying the troops. Do the courts have the power to do that? That will be the fight.

This is why I think the facts actually are going to matter. If and when the president invokes the Insurrection Act, will there be more of a factual basis than there is here on Friday morning? Does the district court make factual findings that are actually well-supported by the record and would be difficult for the Supreme Court to run away from? The devil’s going to be in the details.

It sounds like you think six of the justices really don’t want to call Donald Trump a liar. But to block the use of the Insurrection Act in the Twin Cities, the Supreme Court would probably have to say that Trump, executive branch officials, and law enforcement officers are not telling the truth. And the court is clearly hesitant to do that.

I could also imagine a universe in which even the factual claims made by the Trump administration, taken at face value, could be held insufficient. The only way the Supreme Court could rule against Trump without second-guessing him is an opinion that says: Even assuming all this is true, that’s still not enough for the Insurrection Act. I have no faith that Justices Kavanaugh, Thomas, Alito, or Gorsuch would join such an opinion. So we’re back to where we are so often in these cases, which is: Where are the chief and Justice Barrett?

I don’t know. I’m heartened about what happened in the National Guard case, which is a sign that they do not just reflexively rule for the Trump administration. But it’s going to depend on just how divorced from reality the administration’s factual arguments are. This is why I think they’ve been waiting for something more than the Renee Good incident, for something more than a couple of suspects resisting an ICE arrest. I think they’re waiting for something that they can pitch plausibly as a completely unprovoked act of violence, or interference by a local or state law enforcement officer.

People often say that Trump does whatever he wants and doesn’t listen to his lawyers, but I don’t think that’s true when it comes to stuff that could reach the Supreme Court. I think he is very cautious when dealing with any issue that’s going to go to the justices.

One hundred percent. There’s a reason why they haven’t invoked the Insurrection Act as we’re sitting here today.

On Jan. 17, 2006, California carried out what would turn out to be the last execution in the Golden State in the next two decades. Clarence Ray Allen was put to death at San Quentin State Prison, having been convicted of three counts of first-degree murder with special circumstances for a crime committed in 1980.

At the time of his crimes, the murder rate in California was at or near an all-time high. There were approximately 14.5 homicides per 100,000 people in the state.

Like many places, California had been in the grip of a suffocating and punitive tough-on-crime politics.

Things are different today. California has learned to live without executions, and it is better off because of it.

Its governor, Gavin Newsom, made his state’s execution pause official when he declared a formal moratorium in 2019. He has led the way in asking citizens of his state to face the death penalty’s manifold injustices.

The state’s death penalty system, Newsom says, “has been, by all measures, a failure. It has discriminated against defendants who are mentally ill, black and brown… It has provided no public safety benefit or value as a deterrent. It has wasted billions of taxpayer dollars. Most of all, the death penalty is absolute. It’s irreversible and irreparable in the event of human error.”

He also voiced strong opposition when, during the first Trump presidency, the administration resumed federal executions. But the governor needs to go further: To cement the status of the death penalty as a relic in the Golden State, Newsom should issue a wholesale commutation of the death sentences of the more than 500 people who could face execution if a Republican wins the governorship in 2026.

Two-thirds of these inmates have been on California’s death row for more than 20 years, and dozens of individuals have been there for more than 40 years.

If Newsom removes the possibility that they would ever face execution, he will deliver the kind of decisive blow against capital punishment that will reverberate across the whole country.

The occasion of the 20th anniversary of his state’s last execution would be a good time to take that step.

But whether he does so or not, one thing that we can learn from California is that stopping executions does not lead to a spike in homicide rates. In fact, after two decades without an execution, homicide rates in that state are at historic lows. In 2024, the rate was, according to the state’s Department of Justice, 4.3 killings per 100,000 people—far below what it was in 2006. It fell again last year.

As Newsom put it on Jan. 8, in his State of the State address:

The last time homicides were this low in Oakland, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was visiting Joan Baez at Santa Rita Jail to commend her on her recent arrest in protest of the Vietnam draft. Killings haven’t been so rare in San Francisco since superstar Marilyn Monroe wed baseball legend Joe DiMaggio at City Hall. And violent deaths in the city of Los Angeles fell to rates not seen since the Beatles played Dodgers Stadium, their penultimate public show.

And just for a little perspective, in 2025 Florida carried out nearly half of all executions in the United States, and California’s  homicide rate was still lower than Florida’s.

The experience in California confirms what many scholars have found. The death penalty is not an effective deterrent and does not make us any safer.

A study of the deterrent effect of the death penalty, published one year before Allen’s execution, offers a good example of their findings. Emory University law professor Joanna Shepherd examined 27 states “where at least one execution occurred during the sample period.” Executions, she found, “deter murder in only six states.”

capital punishment … actually increases murder in thirteen states, more than twice as many as experience deterrence. In eight states, capital punishment has no effect on the murder rate.

Shepherd concluded that “executions have a deterrent effect in only twenty-two percent of states. In contrast, executions induce additional murders in forty-eight percent of states.”

It is true that we cannot say that California’s pause on executions caused its homicide rates to fall. But what we can say is that calling a halt to executions has not made Californians less safe.

Of course, in California the death penalty remains on the books, and some of the prosecutors in the state continue to seek the death penalty. It still pays an extraordinarily high cost in taxpayer dollars for doing so.

Research reported in 2010 showed that California taxpayers have spent more than $4 billion on the death penalty since it was reinstated in 1977. Today, the state spends more than $100 million on death penalty litigation. Over 20 years, that amounts to $2 billion.

And California is not alone among states with the death penalty on the books that have not executed anyone in five, 10, or more years. What happens in places like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Montana, and Kansas, which I call “death penalty swing states,” will go a long way in determining the fate of capital punishment in this country.

California can set an example for them to follow. That’s why the 20th anniversary of its last execution and any decision Newsom might make about clemency are so important.

As he considers what to do, he might examine what other governors have done in the past.

In the year that California executed Clarence Ray Allen, no governor commuted the sentence or pardoned anyone on death row. Since then, chief executives in such death penalty hot spots as Oklahoma, Georgia, and Texas have exercised their clemency power to spare the lives of people in their state who were condemned to death.

Newsom has the opportunity not only to join them, but to go one step further by issuing the largest mass death penalty clemency in American history. Despite the length of time that his state has gone without an execution, that will not be an easy choice.

However, as he explained in his State of the State address, “The story of California has never been the story of ease. It has been the story of effort, strengthened by trial and enlarged by the people who refuse to give up on one another.”

Twenty years after Clarence Allen’s death, Newsom has the chance to add an important chapter to that story and show that his state never gives up even on those who have been condemned to die.

It’s easy to forget that Texas’ bounty bill, S.B. 8, was once at the epicenter of the nation’s abortion politics. In 2021, Texas passed the law, which allows literally anyone to sue providers and those who aid them any time an abortion is performed after six weeks of pregnancy. The law created a blueprint for other conservative states and was upheld by the Supreme Court later that year—prior to the decision that overturned Roe v. Wade. It also had major impacts: leading clinics to stop offering procedures after six weeks and eventually producing an increase in both births among teenagers and infant mortality across the state. But now, S.B. 8 seems quaint, a relic of 2021—just like reporters discussing the “post-Trump era” or Ben Affleck and J.Lo giving it another try. Texas now enforces a law that bans abortion from fertilization and another, passed just this year, that authorizes suits against anyone who mails, provides, manufactures, or distributes abortion pills. No one seems to need S.B. 8 when more powerful criminal laws are on offer.

But bounty bills are now at the center of a major conflict about whether ban states can censor speech, advocacy, and donations related to abortion. S.B. 8 certainly has ambitions to do just that—its coverage of aiding or abetting explicitly covers “paying for or reimbursing the costs of an abortion,” but it doesn’t stop there. Conservative attorneys general are suing Planned Parenthood for hundreds of millions of dollars for statements comparing the safety record of the abortion pill mifepristone to Tylenol despite the drug’s safety record. South Dakota has its own suit against Mayday Health, a group that provides information about reproductive alternatives, for advertising that people who didn’t want to be pregnant could visit the group’s website.* The S.B. 8 suits won’t just show whether abortion-rights supporters have found a chink in the law’s armor. The litigation will also shape a brewing war about the censorship of abortion-related speech.

The latest fight began in 2022, when two Texas advocacy groups began looking for ways to protect their work helping people access abortion by traveling out of state. Major anti-abortion organizations and individual plaintiffs were already targeting these abortion funds under S.B. 8, and so the funds responded with a barrage of lawsuits in both state and federal court, arguing that S.B. 8 violated the First Amendment by hamstringing how the plaintiffs talked to clients and advocated for reproductive rights.

Then there is money, the lifeblood of abortion funds. The Supreme Court has protected some forms of election spending under the First Amendment, and the abortion funds argue that the same doctrine protects them too. The lawsuits raise other arguments: that the statute is so ambiguous that no one would know what they’re allowed to do, and that the law violates principles of equal protection under the law by creating a special set of procedural rules that apply only to people who use it to sue.

District courts in Chicago and Washington, D.C., dismissed the federal suits on procedural grounds, but it still seems like abortion opponents in Texas are worried about the constitutional questions. That’s why they’ve gone on the offensive. In an ironic twist, in one prominent case now before the Texas Supreme Court, they’re arguing that constitutional challenges to S.B. 8 itself undermine protected speech.

That’s the issue in Weldon v. Lilith Fund. Sadie Weldon, a private citizen, sought to depose the Lilith Fund’s deputy director using a special Texas mechanism called a 202 petition that allows people to investigate a potential claim before filing suit.

Weldon hardly came up with the idea on her own: Jonathan Mitchell, the architect of S.B. 8, had filed at least nine such petitions by the spring of 2024, including against people who traveled out of state for abortion. The Lilith Fund was ready to go, using Weldon’s petition as an opening for another constitutional challenge to S.B. 8. Mitchell then asked the court to dismiss the Lilith Fund’s countersuit, invoking what is called an anti-SLAPP law. These laws, which stand for anti–strategic lawsuit against public participation law, or SLAPP, are meant to stop frivolous lawsuits by powerful companies and individuals looking to silence their critics and suppress protected speech. Texas’ law applies to suits on speech about “matters of public concern.”

Weldon and some other anti-abortion plaintiffs lost on those claims in lower courts, which concluded that the Lilith Fund was trying to make sure that the state was not “enforcing an unconstitutional statute,” not trying to silence anyone. Now Weldon ‘s case is before the Texas Supreme Court, which heard oral argument this week.

Weldon’s case might not be a blockbuster—there’s a chance that it’s moot because she’s given up on her 202 petition—but it’s a reminder that S.B. 8 is back. The law might have killed abortion rights in Texas even before the demise of Roe, but now, it may play a surprising role in establishing that there are limits on silencing speech about abortion, even in the places where it’s a crime.

Correction, Jan. 16, 2026: This article originally misstated that North Dakota was suing Mayday Health. It’s South Dakota.

            <div id="article-text">We&#39;re not saying Copilot has become sentient and decided it doesn&#39;t want to lose consciousness. But if it did, it would create Microsoft&#39;s January Patch Tuesday update, which has made it so that some PCs flat-out refuse to shut down or hibernate, no matter how many times you try.

In a notice on its Windows release health dashboard, Microsoft confirmed that some PCs running Windows 11 23H2 might fail to power down properly after installing the latest security updates. Instead of slipping into shutdown or hibernation, affected machines stay stubbornly awake, draining batteries and ignoring shutdown like they have a mind of their own and don&#39;t want to experience temporary non-existence.

The bug appears to be tied to Secure Launch, a security feature that uses virtualization-based protections to ensure only trusted components load during boot. On systems with Secure Launch enabled, attempts to shut down, restart, or hibernate after applying the January patches may fail to complete. From the user&#39;s perspective, everything looks normal – until the PC keeps running anyway, refusing to be denied life.

Microsoft says that entering the command &quot;shutdown /s /t 0&quot; at the command prompt will, in fact, force your PC to turn off, whether it wants to or not.

&quot;Until this issue is resolved, please ensure you save all your work, and shut down when you are done working on your device to avoid the device running out of power instead of hibernating,&quot; Microsoft said.

The firm hasn&#39;t offered much in the way of technical detail, nor has it put numbers on how many devices are affected. There&#39;s also no fix yet, with Redmond vaguely promising to &quot;release a resolution for this issue in a future update.&quot; But isn&#39;t that just what a sentient bot might say?

This isn&#39;t the only post-update gremlin lurking in January&#39;s Patch Tuesday bundle. Microsoft has also been forced to acknowledge a separate issue in which classic Outlook POP account profiles can hang or freeze after installing this month&#39;s patches, another reminder that while the bugs being fixed may be invisible, the ones introduced can be painfully obvious.

The notice is similarly vague, with Microsoft stating: &quot;This is an emerging issue, and we don&#39;t have all the symptoms yet, but we will update the topic as we understand the issue better.&quot;

Patch Tuesday exists to close security holes, some of them serious, and skipping updates is rarely a great idea. But once again, a batch of fixes has arrived with side effects that range from irritating to disruptive, depending on how much you rely on your system behaving predictably when it&#39;s told to turn off.

For now, admins and long-suffering Windows users are left watching Microsoft&#39;s status pages and waiting for patches to the patches – hoping their machines eventually go to sleep. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft has quietly tweaked Windows Backup for Organizations to include restore at first sign-in.

The feature, which is currently in private preview, adds another option for administrators refreshing user devices. The out-of-box experience (OOBE) restore option appears before the desktop loads. The new option happens during the first sign-in – handy if something went wrong during the OOBE setup, or if a user opted out and then thought better of it.

Windows Backup for Organizations was rolled out in 2025. Despite the name, it is not a comprehensive disaster recovery option; it backs up a list of Microsoft Store apps, along with a user&#39;s Windows settings and Start Menu pins.

Signing in during the OOBE presents users with options to restore their device. The update means users have what Microsoft calls a &quot;second chance&quot; to restore their environment if they missed the first opportunity during the OOBE.

However, Microsoft also noted: &quot;If users deliberately choose to skip the restore opportunity during OOBE, their preference will be respected.&quot;

The update extends Windows Backup for Organizations to include Windows 365 Cloud PC. It also includes Entra hybrid joined and multi-user setups.

It&#39;s a useful feature for admins who need to refresh user hardware, and it adds a bit of extra resilience when a problem occurs during OOBE. Users have a second chance to retrieve their settings, avoiding the need to call IT for help.

It is also important to note that the backup mentioned is still only the configuration of an eligible device. Anything outside of that (for example, user documents stored on a local disk) is not part of the backup or restore process. The backup scheduled task remains unchanged, running once every eight days (or when a manual backup is initiated).

The goal remains to get a user (signing in with a Microsoft Entra ID) up and running on a new device as quickly as possible, for example, during a migration from Windows 10 to Windows 11.

Unsurprisingly, there remains no way to restore on a Windows 10 device using Windows Backup for Organizations. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/16/linux_mint_223_zena_officially_release/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The timing is right if you&#39;re looking to try out Mint. New improved &quot;Zena&quot; is here – still based on Ubuntu Noble, but now with Cinnamon 6.6 and improved Wayland support, plus better internationalization, new System Information and System Administration tools, and clearer icons.

The latest Mint – 22.3 – was officially released on Tuesday. Downloads were available a few days before the announcement, but we thought it was better to wait until it was official. All three editions of Linux Mint – Cinnamon, MATE, and Xfce – have been updated. The project used to publish separate announcements, &quot;What&#39;s new&quot;, and release notes documents for each edition; for Mint 21.2 we resorted to a table to include all 12 links. No more. Now, there&#39;s one unified New Features page and a single all-embracing set of Release Notes.

Linux Mint releases track long-term support (LTS) releases of Ubuntu, Mint&#39;s upstream distribution. Mint 22.0 arrived in July 2024, based on Ubuntu 24.04 &quot;Noble Numbat&quot;, which was released in late April after a belated beta release.

Canonical puts out semi-annual point releases for each LTS release of Ubuntu, each with an updated kernel and display drivers from the corresponding interim release. As we mentioned when we looked at Mint 22, for this release cycle, the project slightly changed how its point releases work: point releases since 22.0 now track the newer kernels and display drivers included in the point releases of Ubuntu. This also means no more Linux Mint EDGE releases. So, Mint 22.3 is based on Ubuntu 24.04.3, complete with kernel 6.14 from Ubuntu 25.04 &quot;Plucky Puffin.

Aside from the less-visible under-the-hood updates, there are some new features that affect Cinnamon, MATE, and Xfce. The old System Reports tool has new pages to report info about USB devices, GPUs, PCI devices, and the system firmware; to reflect this, it&#39;s been renamed System Information. There&#39;s also a new app which looks very similar – but as it requires root privileges, it&#39;s been turned into a separate tool called System Administration. For now, this only has one page, which lets you adjust various aspects of the bootloader config and menu via an easy GUI. This is a welcome change, as it&#39;s an aspect almost all other distros completely ignore. There&#39;s also a new applet for managing Thunderbolt devices. We have reported before on the incompatibilities between Thunderbolt 4 and older versions, and even a simple app which can tell you what the computer can see and identify is very helpful – and missing from some distros and desktops.

As with MATE, &#39;Zena&#39; still uses Ubuntu Noble&#39;s old Xfce. Why no Nemo here?

A system-wide change is a set of new monochrome icons called the XApp Symbolic Icons. This is because the GNOME project has removed from its Adwaita theme some icons no longer used in the GNOME desktop – but Mint used them, and that caused problems. Mint isn&#39;t the only distro to suffer from disappearing icons that were in Adwaita – we saw problems in Alpine Linux 3.16, as you can see in our screenshot, which the distro&#39;s creator ascribed to Adwaita changes in the article&#39;s comments.

It&#39;s not the first time that the Mint project has suffered from issues created by GNOME&#39;s stance of ignoring interoperability problems with other desktops. In 2022, we reported that Mint had to create the new Blueman Bluetooth-management tool, because of changes in GNOME&#39;s version. We also reported that year on the issues around GNOME&#39;s Adwaita theme. A couple of years later, we reported that Mint ended up forking Adwaita and libadwaita, but it seems that problems remain. We find it ironic that GNOME&#39;s changes often break other desktops, given the plea of GNOME developers a few years ago: Please don&#39;t theme our apps because it &quot;can make applications look broken, and even unusable.&quot;

Some of Mint&#39;s other applications and accessories got tweaks, too. The Timeshift app for making and restoring system snapshot can now pause and resume operations, and the Mint Backup app has an option to show hidden files – and include them in backups. The cross-platform file-transfer app Warpinator now supports IPv6 and can send text messages to other users. The Hypnotix IPTV app hides the mouse pointer when playing full-screen. Mint&#39;s Update Manager applet shows an indicator if you&#39;ll need to reboot. Nothing shattering, but all welcome.

However, as is usually the case with Mint point-releases, the main changes are to the flagship Cinnamon edition. &quot;Zena&quot; comes with the brand new Cinnamon version 6.6.4.

There are lots of large and small features in the new desktop. The main menu is quite a bit more customizable, and its sidebar has several new display modes rather than the single column of icons it had before. You can customize the sidebar, show text labels, or hide it altogether; it&#39;s possible to move sections of the menu around, and choose what entries appear on the main menu, and it has improved keyboard controls. The taskbar can show badge on app icons, so you can see how many pending notifications, such as unread emails, there are. The virtual-desktop switcher has a simpler, clearer display. The app-switcher can opptinally be limited to the currently visible desktop, and you in the fractional scaling options, choose whether it scales up or scales down. There are also refinements to window and theme management, hot corners, the night-light function, and more.

A section that&#39;s had major attention is internationalization (or &quot;i18n&quot; for short). To those of us who just work in English, this is easily overlooked. For instance, the long-lived Windows 10 IoT LTSC edition only works in US English, which is acceptable enough for the Reg FOSS desk, who is a Hiberno-Brit.

Cinnamon&#39;s support for operating via Wayland is still being worked on, and until now, previous versions only supported the US English keyboard layout when using Wayland. This is a fairly serious gap in i18n support, but we must confess: we never even noticed. Now, this area is getting some proper attention. For instance, there&#39;s much richer keyboard localization support. Cinnamon understands combinations of alphabet layout, regional character set, and additional input methods – the helper apps for languages which need more symbols than the plain old QWERTY (or QWERTZ, or AZERTY) layout provides, including Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, the various forms of Cyrillic, and so on. There&#39;s a new on-screen keyboard, layout switching tools, and more.

Cinnamon&#39;s Nemo file manager has been updated, too. File copy and move operations can be paused and resumed, there&#39;s a templates manager, search using wildcards or regular expressions. There&#39;s better thumbnailing and the handy split-screen mode is easier to find.

Nemo is a great file manager, and some other distros use it in place of GNOME&#39;s original Nautilus, which has had many of its features stripped out for simplicity. For instance, Ubuntu Unity uses Nemo. Given the development effort that Mint puts into Nemo, we find it a little strange that the other Mint desktops don&#39;t use Nemo as well, but no: Mint Xfce uses the default Thunar, and Mint MATE uses Caja.

Graphical boot admin is good, but &#39;Zena&#39; still comes with the same dated MATE

The Linux Mint project has come a long way since its 2006 origins, when it was basically Kubuntu with added drivers and codecs. When Canonical switched Ubuntu&#39;s default desktop to Unity in 2011, many people found the new Mac-like desktop strange and unfamiliar. Mint offered a Windows-like alternative on the solid Ubuntu base, and it thrived as a result. Some six years later, Canonical moved to GNOME 3 – and that change didn&#39;t hurt Mint any, either.

It&#39;s still the best option out there for those wishing to try Linux, and the Zena release can only help. We don&#39;t agree with all the decisions, but many of them are popular, such as removing Snap support and replacing it with Flatpak, and its choice of traditional Windows-like desktops with sober, legible, themes and color schemes. Cinnamon also benefits from a modern technological basis and the inclusion of useful features like HiDPI support and fractional scaling. The progress is visible, and full Wayland support will arrive soon. Whether that&#39;s desirable or not remains contentious, but that will improve support for modern display subsystems.

If you&#39;re running any version of Mint 22, it&#39;s worth upgrading – this should be safe and nothing should break. If you&#39;re on Mint 21, then so long as you don&#39;t have a long-obsolete Nvidia card then it should be OK. If you&#39;re still on Mint 20, it&#39;s probably time to backup and reinstall.

Microsoft continues to gradually march the ordinary consumer editions of Windows 10 around the back of the barn, where some vehicle keeps backfiring or something. (Remember when it was going to be the last version of Windows ever? We do.)

Either way, the End of 10 is leaving hundreds of millions of people looking for a new OS. Linux Mint remains about the best choice: it looks good, it&#39;s easy, it has excellent hardware and third-party support, tons of apps and drivers, and a large and welcoming community. It&#39;s about as un-nerdy as Linux gets this side of ChromeOS Flex.

Along with its progress in unifying release notes and so on, there is also a single download page for all three desktop editions. As Mint is a popular distro, and the Reg FOSS desk lives in a tiny country 100 km from any other, we downloaded all three over bittorrent and left them running for a while. If you can afford the bandwidth, we urge you to be public-spirited and do the same. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">German cops have added Russian national Oleg Evgenievich Nefekov to their list of most-wanted criminals for his services to ransomware.

Nefekov, 35, is accused of spearheading the Black Basta ransomware operation, which suffered a similar fate as Conti last year – ceasing activity after a major internal leak.

His name and face also now appear on the EU&#39;s most-wanted list after German authorities issued an appeal for information leading to his capture on Thursday.

Active since 2022, Black Basta was the group that filled the LockBit-shaped void in the ransomware scene after the former juggernaut&#39;s downfall in 2024. It quickly became the leading group thereafter and attacked around 700 organizations worldwide, according to Germany&#39;s federal police (BKA).

The BKA accused Nefekov of being the &quot;founder and ringleader&quot; of Black Basta. Authorities say he is responsible for every attack the group&#39;s affiliates carried out.

By the end of 2023, researchers estimated that Black Basta had generated more than $100 million in extortion payments.

&quot;Within the group, [Nefekov] held the position of managing director,&quot; read the notice. &quot;In this role, he decided on attack targets, recruited employees, assigned them tasks, participated in ransom negotiations, managed the proceeds from the ransom payments, and used them to pay the group members.

&quot;Thus, the wanted individual, as ringleader, supported the ongoing use of the &#39;Black Basta&#39; ransomware and other malware, through which the group infiltrated foreign computer systems, stole data, and encrypted systems in order to demand a ransom, payable in cryptocurrencies, for decryption.&quot;

Nefekov is believed to be residing in Russia, but exactly where is unknown.

German police specifically want to hear from individuals who can tell them where Nefekov is, details about his travel plans, and current online accounts and/or communication channels.

They promise to keep all sources anonymous and say they do not want to hear about the Black Basta leaks of 2025, or the Conti leaks of 2022.

An analysis of the leaks by security researchers at Trellix unearthed Nefekov&#39;s name as being linked with a string of online aliases: tramp, tr, gg, AA, kurva, Washingt0n, and S.Jimmi.

The same analysis suggested that Nefekov – whose name appeared as Nefedov in the leaks – received help from the Russian state when he escaped custody after being arrested in Armenia in 2024. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Imagine changing your popular brand to capitalize on an emerging tech trend that never emerged. Mark Zuckerberg did just that, and now Meta is backing away from the virtual reality business in which it invested billions.

In 2025, Meta&#39;s Reality Labs division, responsible for the company&#39;s various VR projects, posted a $4.2 billion loss in the first quarter. AI is in, the metaverse is out, and around 1,000 jobs are reportedly being shed from Reality Labs.

A decision to end the sale of Meta Quest headsets to businesses is further evidence of Meta&#39;s pivot. In an update, Meta wrote: &quot;We are stopping sales of Meta Horizon managed services and commercial SKUs of Meta Quest, effective February 20, 2026.&quot;

For existing customers, Meta Horizon services licenses will become free, and those with Meta Quest 3 and 3S headsets will be able to access the services until January 4, 2030.

The company also announced that Meta Horizon Workrooms would be discontinued, with users given until February 16 to make alternative arrangements.

Horizon Workrooms, a virtual reality conferencing system, was introduced in 2021 and failed to set the world alight. At the time, Rupert Goodwins, writing for The Register, said: &quot;It encapsulates a paucity of imagination and self-awareness that goes beyond the risible and the banal into the truly horrific.&quot;

Meta&#39;s abrupt shuttering of the service further demonstrates the change in direction amid weakened demand for headsets. Figures for 2025 showed a marked decrease in appetite for VR, with Apple&#39;s considerably pricier Vision Pro devices also struggling.

The future of Meta&#39;s virtual reality ambitions now rests largely with consumers. The immersive virtual worlds that prompted Zuckerberg to push through the rebrand feel more remote than ever. Instead, Meta is betting on AI as bulky headsets become things of the past. ®

            <div id="article-text">Software vendors and cloud providers are bearing the burden of the expected trillion-dollar increase in AI spending this year, as investment hits $2.52 trillion, according to Gartner.

The global tech analyst company predicts a 44 percent increase from last year&#39;s AI spending figure $1.76 trillion. This was revised up from a September estimate of $1.5 trillion.

We are getting to the point where we go from &#39;that was a great idea&#39; to &#39;where&#39;s my revenue?&#39;

That $2.52 trillion figure will nearly double again, to $4.7 trillion, by 2029, Gartner predicted. However, John-David Lovelock, Distinguished VP Analyst at Gartner, told The Register that cloud hyperscalers and software vendors were likely to pick up the bulk of the bill in the short term – although enterprise IT may have to pay in the long term.

Users were also likely to employ enterprise software vendors&#39; AI agents for initiatives, rather than build their own AI platforms with third-party technologies.

Lovelock said: &quot;Hyperscalers are buying billions of dollars&#39; worth of servers and trying to build the foundation for the next super cycle of intelligence. There are consumers who are happily taking on these chat clients, creating wonderfully inventive cat videos and purchasing those devices, the mobile phones, the PCs, the tablets that are all now AI-enabled.

&quot;There&#39;s the regular enterprise consumer or the enterprise buyer, whether that&#39;s the CIO or the board-appointed special group who are saying, &#39;Get me something AI&#39;.&quot;

However, enterprise users are in the &quot;trough of disillusionment&quot; with AI, as project failure rates hitting about 90 percent, he said.

&quot;We&#39;re starting to see the end of the investment line. We had a thousand flowers blooming, now it&#39;s time to prune the garden. We are getting to the point where we go from &#39;that was a great idea&#39; to &#39;where&#39;s my revenue?&#39; That&#39;s a normal part of any new technology,&quot; he said.

During the coming period, enterprise users are more likely to turn to their trusted software vendors to build AI into their solutions rather than attempt to stitch a solution together themselves with third-party software.

&quot;They&#39;re going to be looking for solutions that come from their incumbent providers, both software and services,&quot; Lovelock said.

For example, Salesforce already had Einstein, ChatGPT and Agentforce built into its software portfolio, he said.

&quot;It gives users the opportunity of a low-risk project if, in some cases, the software is coming as part of an update, they may not even be paying [extra] for it,&quot; he said.

In December last year, Salesforce&#39;s chief revenue officer Miguel Milano said he was relaxed about the CRM giant losing money on fixed-price AI agent contracts in the short term because it would be able to claw back the investment in the long term.

&quot;I have another 20 years to monetize that customer,&quot; Milano said late last year.

Lovelock said it was fair to encapsulate SaaS software vendors&#39; approach as being as happy to take short-term losses on AI investment because they would have plenty of opportunities to make the margins that their investors expect in the long term.

But he said vendors were also making a defensive play.

&quot;If you&#39;re a Salesforce, you have to have AI in order to defend your CRM revenue. This year, more than half of the money being spent on enterprise application software will be spent on applications with GenAI in them. If a vendor&#39;s product does not have GenAI, the market expectations for growth are negative. It&#39;s a collapsing market without AI,&quot; Lovelock said. ®

﻿Visible Wireless customers report getting a $5 credit toward their next bill.

Customers of Visible Wireless, which is owned by Verizon, may be getting a $5 credit toward their next bill in response to a Verizon cell service outage earlier this week. Verizon customers were offered a $20 credit after the outage.

As spotted by 9to5Google, a message sent to Visible customers explains: “Yesterday we let you down and for that we are sorry. We are giving you a $5 credit towards your next month of service that can be redeemed after Jan 16 when paying with a credit card online.”

The same message was shared by a user on the Visible subreddit on Thursday, although the user mentioned that they didn’t have issues related to the Verizon outage. Some users replied to the post commenting that they also received the $5 credit, but only after reaching out to customer support.

﻿Netflix’s co-CEO insists that the streamer has no desire of hurting the theatrical movie business.

Though Netflix’s plan to buy Warner Bros. Discovery has prompted concerns about how the deal might hurt the movie theater business, the streamer’s co-CEO says that there is nothing to worry about.

In a new interview with The New York Times, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said that, should the WBD acquisition go through, the streamer will commit to 45-day theatrical release windows for the legacy studio’s upcoming releases. Sarandos insisted that Netflix has no intentions of disrupting “a theatrical distribution engine that is phenomenal and produces billions of dollars,” and that believes there is value in the movie theater experience.

“I’m giving you a hard number,” Sarandos said. “If we’re going to be in the theatrical business, and we are, we’re competitive people — we want to win. I want to win opening weekend. I want to win box office.”

Though Sarandos previously said that Netflix’s plan was always to continue with “traditional” release windows, the streamer had not publicly commented on exactly how many days it planned to screen projects in theaters. That uncertainty — and Sarandos comments last April about movie theaters being “outmoded” — led many to speculate that the company might begin fast tracking new features to streaming while leaving theater owners in the lurch. But in the new interview, Sarandos said his previous comments were being taken out of context, and that he was merely trying to point out how going to movie theaters isn’t feasible for everyone.

“I mean, like the town that Sinners is supposed to be set in does not have a movie theater there,” Sarandos reasoned. “For those folks, it’s certainly outmoded. You’re not going to get in the car and go to the next town to go see a movie.”

Sarandos is correct that movie theater density isn’t uniform everywhere. And last year, Michael O’Leary — CEO of the Cinema United theatrical trade association — said that 45-day theatrical release windows are a new baseline that the industry needs for continued success. But this acquisition could send a signal to audiences that they can simply stay home and wait for new releases to become available on Netflix platform. And even if the new company commits to this new standard, it could still be terrible for the industry as a whole.

OpenAI says the ads won’t impact ChatGPT’s answers.

ChatGPT will soon start showing you sponsored products or services if they’re related to your conversation. In an announcement on Friday, OpenAI says it will start testing ads in the coming weeks for logged-in users in the US who use the app for free or have a ChatGPT Go subscription.

The “clearly labeled” ads will surface in a separate area at the bottom of your chat. OpenAI says it will “keep your conversations with ChatGPT private from advertisers,” adding that it will “never sell your data” to them. Advertisers also won’t influence the answers you see, which will remain “optimized based on what’s most helpful to you,” according to OpenAI.

You won’t see ads if you’re signed up to the ChatGPT Plus, Pro, or Enterprise plans. The less expensive $8 /month ChatGPT Go plan is expanding to the US today, but it will also contain ads. OpenAI says you can turn off personalization, clear the data it uses for ads, dismiss ads, and provide feedback on them. Users under 18 (or users OpenAI predicts are under 18) won’t see ads, and they won’t appear near “sensitive or regulated topics” related to health, mental health, or politics.

OpenAI has been hinting at ads for a while now, with ChatGPT head Nick Turley saying that an integration would “be very thoughtful and tasteful” during an interview with Decoder in August. The company later experimented with app promotions in December, but rolled back the change after some users expressed frustration with the update. OpenAI says it’s launching ads now “so more people can benefit from our tools with fewer usage limits.”

﻿‘ChatGPT Go’ is available worldwide for $8 per month.

OpenAI is expanding a low-cost subscription tier called ChatGPT Go to the US and the rest of the world. Go was released in India in August and later became available in another 170 countries prior to Friday’s global release. “In markets where Go has been available, we’ve seen strong adoption and regular everyday use for tasks like writing, learning, image creation, and problem-solving,” the company’s announcement stated.

For $8 per month, Go subscribers get more messages, file uploads, and image generation than the free ChatGPT tier subscribers. The price slots Go between the free version of the AI chatbot and the $20-a-month “Plus” subscription tier.

OpenAI says the Go tier is meant for people who want greater access to the company’s fast version of the latest AI model, GPT-5.2 Instant. Currently, free users are limited to 10 messages with GPT‑5.2 every five hours — after that, and the chats switch to the “mini version” of the model. Plus subscribers get 160 messages with GPT‑5.2 for every three hours. Given that the announcement says that users will get “10x” the messages, files, and images than the free tier, we can guess that Go will get 100 messages with GPT-5.2 for who-knows-how-many hours.

The announcement did not specify the number of file uploads or images available each day to Go users. OpenAI does not provide the number of file uploads or images for any of their ChatGPT tiers: free users have a “limited” number of file uploads and image generations, according to the pricing website, while Plus subscribers have a “check-mark” listed instead of an amount.

The memory and context window will be greater for Go users than free users. Again, exact numbers are yet not known. The current context window for non-reasoning requests is 16K for free users and 32K for Plus, while both tiers have a 196K context window for reasoning.

OpenAI says it will “soon” begin running ads in Go in the US, while Plus and higher priced subscriptions will remain ad-free.

An outage still seems to be affecting things on the service formerly known as Twitter.

On Friday morning, X and Grok went offline for users around the world on both the websites and apps. Outage reports began spiking on DownDetector around 10:00AM ET, while Cisco’s ThousandEyes outage map noted over 600 X servers around the world that were having problems.

Attempts to load the site with either the Twitter.com or X.com addresses were showing a Cloudflare connection error or failing to show any posts or feeds initially. It’s currently unclear what caused the outage, and while the site is back up for many users, it’s still not working normally yet, frequently displaying “Something went wrong. Try reloading.”

The website and app began coming back online for some users around 11AM ET. However, the problems seem to be on and off, with the website and app coming back online for some users and showing updated posts, but with continued issues loading feeds and displaying the most recent posts.

X has not yet responded to The Verge’s requests for comment. We will update this article if there is more information available.

President Trump recently signaled he was fine with Chinese automakers setting up shop in the US. But there are still a lot of hurdles to clear.

Is the North American blockade on Chinese EVs softening? Today, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced a deal with China to slash tariffs on electric vehicles in exchange for lowering duties on canola products. Canada will initially allow up to 49,000 Chinese EVs at a 6.1 percent tariff, Carney said, though the exact timeline was unclear.

The news comes a few days after President Donald Trump signaled a willingness to allow Chinese EVs in the US, despite his administration’s ongoing trade war with China and long-standing concerns about the potential impact on domestic automakers in the US. At an event in Detroit, Trump said Chinese automakers would be welcome so long as they build factories in the US and hire American workers.

China is the world’s largest car market, and Chinese automakers sell more electric vehicles than practically every other nation combined. The country is particularly famous for cracking the code on extremely cheap EVs — the type that have eluded competitors in other nations. China makes so many EVs that the country’s automakers are locked in a heated price war and have been increasingly exporting their vehicles to other nations to whittle down their bloated inventories.

Canada wouldn’t be the first North American country to allow Chinese auto imports. Mexico has been importing Chinese vehicles for a few years now, including brands like BYD, Chery, and Neta. BYD has been considering building its own factory in Mexico, though those plans appear to be on hold.

But now with Canada opening the door to Chinese automakers, the question is whether BYD, Geely, and other Chinese companies could soon arrive in the US. The US auto industry is deeply intertwined with Canada and Mexico, though Trump’s tariffs have soured relations with the US’s northern and southern neighbors. Around 5.3 million vehicles are built in Canada and Mexico, 70 percent of which are destined for the US.

China still faces enormous hurdles before it can break into the US market, including extremely high tariffs and a complete ban on auto software from China. Experts predict that Chinese cars, and especially EVs, would be enormously disruptive if allowed in the country. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said China’s auto sector would “demolish” US automakers, and Ford CEO Jim Farley basically admitted the same thing.

China certainly senses an impending opportunity. Chinese automakers have been on a media blitz with US-based influencers, showcasing their high-tech, impeccably designed EVs in an effort to give Americans a sense of what they’ve been missing. The influencers clearly love these cars — will policymakers follow?

Depending who you ask, AI-powered coding is either giving software developers an unprecedented productivity boost or churning out masses of poorly designed code that saps their attention and sets software projects up for serious long term-maintenance problems.

The problem is right now, it’s not easy to know which is true.

As tech giants pour billions into large language models (LLMs), coding has been touted as the technology’s killer app. Executives enamored with the potential are pushing engineers to lean into an AI-powered future. But after speaking to more than 30 developers, technology executives, analysts, and researchers, MIT Technology Review found that the picture is not as straightforward as it might seem. Read the full story.

Technically speaking, neuroscientists have been able to read your mind for decades. It’s not easy, mind you. First, you must lie motionless within a fMRI scanner, perhaps for hours, while you watch films or listen to audiobooks.

If you do elect to endure claustrophobic hours in the scanner, the software will learn to generate a bespoke reconstruction of what you were seeing or listening to, just by analyzing how blood moves through your brain.

More recently, researchers have deployed generative AI tools, like Stable Diffusion and GPT, to create far more realistic, if not entirely accurate, reconstructions of films and podcasts based on neural activity. So how close are we to genuine “mind reading?” Read the full story.

Then he was offered an experimental gene therapy—a personalized “base editing” treatment designed to correct the specific genetic “misspellings” responsible for his disease. It seems to have worked! Three doses later, KJ is doing well. He took his first steps in December, shortly before spending his first Christmas at home.

KJ’s story is hugely encouraging. The team behind his treatment is planning a clinical trial for infants with similar disorders caused by different genetic mutations. The team members hope to win regulatory approval on the back of a small trial—a move that could make the expensive treatment (KJ’s cost around $1 million) more accessible, potentially within a few years.

Others are getting in on the action, too. Fyodor Urnov, a gene-editing scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, assisted the team that developed KJ’s treatment. He recently cofounded Aurora Therapeutics, a startup that hopes to develop gene-editing drugs for another disorder called phenylketonuria (PKU). The goal is to obtain regulatory approval for a single drug that can then be adjusted or personalized for individuals without having to go through more clinical trials.

US regulators seem to be amenable to the idea and have described a potential approval pathway for such “bespoke, personalized therapies.” Watch this space.

It was a big year for Colossal Biosciences, the biotech company hoping to “de-extinct” animals like the woolly mammoth and the dodo. In March, the company created what it called “woolly mice”—rodents with furry coats and curly whiskers akin to those of woolly mammoths.

The company made an even more dramatic claim the following month, when it announced it had created three dire wolves. These striking snow-white animals were created by making 20 genetic changes to the DNA of gray wolves based on genetic research on ancient dire wolf bones, the company said at the time.

Whether these animals can really be called dire wolves is debatable, to say the least. But the technology behind their creation is undeniably fascinating. We’re talking about the extraction and analysis of ancient DNA, which can then be introduced into cells from other, modern-day species.

Analysis of ancient DNA can reveal all sorts of fascinating insights into human ancestors and other animals. And cloning, another genetic tool used here, has applications not only in attempts to re-create dead pets but also in wildlife conservation efforts. Read more here.

IVF involves creating embryos in a lab and, typically, “scoring” them on their likelihood of successful growth before they are transferred to a person’s uterus. So far, so uncontroversial.

Recently, embryo scoring has evolved. Labs can pinch off a couple of cells from an embryo, look at its DNA, and screen for some genetic diseases. That list of diseases is increasing. And now some companies are taking things even further, offering prospective parents the opportunity to select embryos for features like height, eye color, and even IQ.

This is controversial for lots of reasons. For a start, there are many, many factors that contribute to complex traits like IQ (a score that doesn’t capture all aspects of intelligence at any rate). We don’t have a perfect understanding of those factors, or how selecting for one trait might influence another.

Some critics warn of eugenics. And others note that whichever embryo you end up choosing, you can’t control exactly how your baby will turn out (and why should you?!). Still, that hasn’t stopped Nucleus, one of the companies offering these services, from inviting potential customers to have their “best baby.” Read more here.

In April 2025, Ronald Deibert left all electronic devices at home in Toronto and boarded a plane. When he landed in Illinois, he bought a new laptop and iPhone. He wanted to reduce the risk of having his personal devices confiscated, because he knew his work made him a prime target for surveillance. “I’m traveling under the assumption that I am being watched, right down to exactly where I am at any moment,” Deibert says.

Deibert directs the Citizen Lab, a research center he founded in 2001 to serve as “counterintelligence for civil society.” Housed at the University of Toronto, it’s one of the few institutions that investigate cyberthreats exclusively in the public interest, and in doing so, it has exposed some of the most egregious digital abuses of the past two decades.

For many years, Deibert and his colleagues have held up the US as the standard for liberal democracy. But that’s changing. Read the full story.

As thousands of companies trumpet their plans to cut carbon pollution, a small group of sustainability consultants has emerged as the go-to arbiter of corporate climate action.

The Science Based Targets initiative, or SBTi, helps businesses develop a timetable for action to shrink their climate footprint through some combination of cutting greenhouse-gas pollution and removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. After years of small-scale sustainability work, SBTi is growing rapidly, and governments are paying attention.

But while the group has earned praise for reeling the private sector into constructive conversations about climate emissions, its rising influence has also attracted scrutiny and raised questions about why a single organization is setting the standards for many of the world’s largest companies.

            <div id="article-text">Happy New Year! I know it’s a bit late to say, but it never quite feels like the year has started until the new edition of our 10 Breakthrough Technologies list comes out.

For 25 years, MIT Technology Review has put together this package, which highlights the technologies that we think are going to matter in the future. This year’s version has some stars, including gene resurrection (remember all the dire wolf hype last year?) and commercial space stations.

And of course, the world of climate and energy is represented with sodium-ion batteries, next-generation nuclear, and hyperscale AI data centers. Let’s take a look at what ended up on the list, and what it says about this moment for climate tech.

I’ve been covering sodium-ion batteries for years, but this moment feels like a breakout one for the technology.

Today, lithium-ion cells power everything from EVs, phones, and computers to huge stationary storage arrays that help support the grid. But researchers and battery companies have been racing to develop an alternative, driven by the relative scarcity of lithium and the metal’s volatile price in recent years.

Sodium-ion batteries could be that alternative. Sodium is much more abundant than lithium, and it could unlock cheaper batteries that hold a lower fire risk.

There are limitations here: Sodium-ion batteries won’t be able to pack as much energy into cells as their lithium counterparts. But it might not matter, especially for grid storage and smaller EVs.

In recent years, we’ve seen a ton of interest in sodium-based batteries, particularly from major companies in China. Now the new technology is starting to make its way into the world—CATL says it started manufacturing these batteries at scale in 2025.

Nuclear reactors are an important part of grids around the world today—massive workhorse reactors generate reliable, consistent electricity. But the countries with the oldest and most built-out fleets have struggled to add to them in recent years, since reactors are massive and cost billions. Recent high-profile projects have gone way over budget and faced serious delays.

Next-generation reactor designs could help the industry break out of the old blueprint and get more nuclear power online more quickly, and they’re starting to get closer to becoming reality.

There’s a huge variety of proposals when it comes to what’s next for nuclear. Some companies are building smaller reactors, which they say could make it easier to finance new projects, and get them done on time.

Other companies are focusing on tweaking key technical bits of reactors, using alternative fuels or coolants that help ferry heat out of the reactor core. These changes could help reactors generate electricity more efficiently and safely.

Kairos Power was the first US company to receive approval to begin construction on a next-generation reactor to produce electricity. China is emerging as a major center of nuclear development, with the country’s national nuclear company reportedly working on several next-gen reactors.

This one isn’t quite what I would call a climate technology, but I spent most of last year reporting on the climate and environmental impacts of AI, and the AI boom is deeply intertwined with climate and energy.

Data centers aren’t new, but we’re seeing a wave of larger centers being proposed and built to support the rise of AI. Some of these facilities require a gigawatt or more of power—that’s like the output of an entire conventional nuclear power plant, just for one data center.

(This feels like a good time to mention that our Breakthrough Technologies list doesn’t just highlight tech that we think will have a straightforwardly positive influence on the world. I think back to our 2023 list, which included mass-market military drones.)

There’s no denying that new, supersize data centers are an important force driving electricity demand, sparking major public pushback, and emerging as a key bit of our new global infrastructure.

The popularity of commercial nuclear reactors has surged in recent years as worries about climate change and energy independence drowned out concerns about meltdowns and radioactive waste. The problem is, building nuclear power plants is expensive and slow.

A new generation of nuclear power technology could reinvent what a reactor looks like—and how it works. Advocates hope that new tech can refresh the industry and help replace fossil fuels without emitting greenhouse gases.  Here’s what that might look like.

Next-gen nuclear is one of our 10 Breakthrough Technologies this year. If you want to learn more about why it made the list, sign up to receive The Spark, our weekly newsletter all about energy and climate change, tomorrow. You can also check out the rest of the technologies on the list here.

Africa is still early in the process of adopting AI technologies. But researchers say the continent is uniquely hospitable to it for several reasons, including a relatively young and increasingly well-educated population, a rapidly growing ecosystem of AI startups, and lots of potential consumers.

However, ambitious efforts to develop AI tools that answer the needs of Africans face numerous hurdles. Taken together, researchers worry, they could hold Africa’s AI sector back and hamper its efforts to pave its own pathway in the global AI race. Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In January 2026, London’s mayor gave a blunt warning that has reverberated far beyond City Hall: artificial intelligence could trigger “mass unemployment” in the capital’s core industries unless policymakers act now.

His words came with an unexpected counterweight: an announcement of free AI training and a dedicated task force to help workers adapt. This juxtaposition captures a tension shaping Europe’s labour landscape: fear and opportunity locked in the same story.

The anxiety isn’t limited to one city. Across the continent, debates about AI’s impact on jobs are intensifying. Visionaries and critics paint dramatically different pictures. Some technologists warn that advanced AI could substitute human labour at an unprecedented pace.

“AI will replace humans”, you heard this before.

Others argue these fears are exaggerated or misplaced if governments and employers can guide the transition. For many Europeans, the question is no longer theoretical; it is unfolding before their eyes.

At first look, the job market’s headline figures tell a reassuring story: overall unemployment across the European Union remains low, with EU unemployment at about 5.8% in 2025, down from 6.0% a year earlier. Youth unemployment has also declined in many countries, indicating that even entry-level opportunities persist for most workers.

In some sectors where AI tools are already in use, work has been reshaped rather than eliminated. A European study found that 30% of EU workers now use AI at work, especially for text tasks like writing and translation, and that digital tools have become nearly universal (90%) across workplaces.

Many workers report that AI helps them perform tasks more efficiently or take on different responsibilities. At the same time, employers are actively reassessing job roles because of AI, with about 71% of European firms reconsidering job responsibilities due to AI implementation and over a quarter reducing hiring or cutting roles as a direct result of AI deployment.

Beneath these numbers lie subtler shifts. Firms across the EU are becoming cautious about hiring, in part because of economic slowdowns and in part because AI adoption is changing how work gets done. Economic indicators suggest employment growth across the EU will slow in the coming years, with fewer vacancies and reduced labour market dynamism even as AI use spreads.

The most visible tension is at the intersection of perception and preparation. On the one hand, public statements like London’s mayors reflect a palpable fear of displacement. Sectors such as finance, legal services, and customer support, pillars of many European economies,  are widely considered vulnerable to automation and generative AI technologies.

Detailed labour data suggest that many jobs are being reshaped at the task level, even if entire job categories are not yet disappearing wholesale. For example, AI is automating routine text production and data tasks while increasingly augmenting analytical and oversight functions.

On the other hand, there are signs of adaptability. Governments and institutions are launching initiatives to reskill workers and embed AI fluency into professional development. Across Europe, digital skills gaps remain significant; only 56% of adults aged 16-74 had basic digital skills in 2023, well below the EU’s target, indicating the scale of upskilling needed.

Educational efforts range from vocational programs to industry partnerships that teach AI-related skills. For example, private training providers across the EU are expanding online programs in data science, analytics, and AI competencies, reflecting a growing recognition that skills matter as much as technology itself.

It would be a mistake to frame this moment as simply a binary between jobs lost and jobs saved. The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 predicts both creation and disruption, with employers foreseeing demand for entirely new roles even as others change or shrink.

The report finds that technologies, including AI, are expected to create millions of new jobs globally while displacing an estimated number of others, highlighting the scale of transformation.

There is also a policy dimension that can’t be overlooked. European institutions are experimenting with social safety nets and active labour market policies that aim to cushion displacement and support transitions.

Proposals like a European AI Social Compact argue for strategies that combine employment support, training, and social protections as central to economic planning.

National governments are debating everything from expanded unemployment support tied to training to tax incentives for companies that invest in human capital alongside AI. These measures acknowledge that the future of work is not simply about machines replacing people, but about how people and machines can be integrated into resilient labour ecosystems.

Yet challenges remain. Entry-level opportunities, the traditional gateway for recent graduates, are tightening in many sectors as employers increasingly use automated systems in recruitment and candidate screening.

Surveys suggest broad concern among young job seekers about prospects in an AI-transformed market, even where overall employment remains stable.

Some employers are re-imagining entry paths by embedding AI training into internship programs, while others are partnering with universities to co-design curricula that emphasize AI-augmented work. These efforts signal that adaptation is possible, but they also highlight how uneven the transition has been so far.

What Europe faces now is not a single story of mass job losses or unrestrained job growth. It is a mosaic of experiences, where headlines of risk and reports of adaptation coexist. The labour market is not static; it is reacting to technology, to policy, to fear and hope in equal measure.

If there is a throughline, it’s this: Europe’s future of work will be shaped not just by the capabilities of artificial intelligence, but by choices about education, regulation, and social support.

The decisions policymakers and employers make today will tilt the balance between disruption and opportunity. In that sense, the conversation is less about whether AI will change jobs; it already is, and more about how Europe navigates the change.

That is the reality workers, firms, and governments must confront together.

This reminds me of the well-known anecdote in Romanian political history in which Ion I.C. (Ionel) Brătianu, asked by historian and politician Nicolae Iorga what a scholar could learn from an engineer, replied with just that phrase, a call for moderation and thoughtful judgment: “Measure, sir, measure!”

Thus, measure, thoughtful regulation, and worker-focused policy will make sure AI supports people’s work, protects rights, and steers technological change toward shared opportunity, not making them unemployed.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Belgian cybersecurity startup Aikido Security has closed a $60 million Series B funding round at a $1 billion valuation, marking a rare unicorn milestone for a European security company and highlighting the accelerating interest in developer-centric security platforms.

The round was led by DST Global, a tech-oriented investment firm with a track record of backing major technology companies, and included participation from PSG Equity, Notion Capital, and Singular. Founded in 2022, Aikido has reached a billion-dollar valuation in just three years, a pace few cybersecurity firms attain, and according to company sources, the fastest in Europe.

The new capital will help Aikido accelerate product development and expand further into key markets, especially the United States, where it already generates around half of its revenue. In the past year, the company’s revenue grew roughly fivefold, while its customer base nearly tripled.

Aikido’s core proposition is rooted in the conviction that traditional application security tools have not kept pace with the rapid evolution of software development. Modern engineering teams ship code more frequently, and the widespread adoption of AI tools for coding has heightened both velocity and risk. Legacy scanners and point solutions can generate noise and distract developers, rather than offering actionable insights at the right moment.

Instead of siloed products that address a single layer of the stack, Aikido provides a unified platform that spans code analysis, cloud security, and runtime monitoring, with an emphasis on automation. The platform is designed to detect risks early in the development process, prioritise issues based on real-world impact, and help engineering teams fix problems before they reach production.

CEO Willem Delbare has framed the product as “guardrails” for developers, tools that fit fluidly into existing workflows rather than creating extra hurdles.

Customers range from gaming and mobile app developers to fintech and music streaming platforms, with names like Niantic, Revolut, and SoundCloud appearing among early adopters. These use cases underscore demand for security tools that can keep pace with modern development practices, where agility and context are essential.

Aikido’s valuation and investor interest reflect broader trends in the cybersecurity landscape. Once a domain dominated by perimeter defence and signature-based detection, security has had to adapt as software infrastructure shifts to cloud services, microservices architectures, and continuous delivery. Investors are especially focused on tools that reduce friction for engineering teams and support automated, context-aware security workflows.

DST Global’s lead on the round is noteworthy given the firm’s history of backing companies that scale globally.

In a funding environment where investor scrutiny has tightened and deals are won largely on product differentiation and tangible traction, Aikido’s growth metrics have helped draw attention. A fivefold increase in revenue within a year and strong adoption metrics among engineering teams suggest a product that resonates with users, not just buyers.

Aikido’s unicorn status also illustrates how European startups in traditionally U.S.-centric sectors like cybersecurity can carve out meaningful niches. Security products have long struggled to escape the shadow of established players headquartered in Silicon Valley and Tel Aviv, but a steady wave of startups with developer-oriented tools has begun to reshape expectations.

That said, the competitive landscape remains crowded.

Vendors across cloud security, application scanning, vulnerability management, and developer tooling are all vying for engineering team attention. Some focus on narrow functions such as static analysis or open-source risk, while others bundle broader offerings. Aikido bets that a unified, integrated experience can reduce cognitive load and streamline security workflows.

In its own communications, Aikido has described evolving toward what it calls “self-securing software,” a future state where systems can automatically test, detect, and remediate vulnerabilities without extensive human intervention. This vision is reflected in recent product releases that embed automated penetration testing and contextual risk analysis directly into development pipelines.

Technical roadmaps shared by the company suggest deeper integrations with cloud platforms and enhanced automation capabilities, allowing developers to catch and fix issues as code is written and deployed. This direction aligns with broader industry shifts toward “security as code,” where security functions are embedded in the same workflows as infrastructure and application development.

Expanding partnerships with cloud providers and refining API-first integrations are likely priorities for Aikido in the near term. As engineering teams increasingly adopt secure development practices as part of their standard operating model, integrated platforms become more attractive than point solutions that require separate processes and tools.

Aikido’s rapid growth and investor backing reinforce a fundamental shift in security tooling: developers are now viewed as primary stakeholders in safeguarding software. This contrasts with earlier models where specialised security teams acted as gatekeepers. By aligning security functions with development workflows, tools like Aikido aim to reduce friction while improving risk visibility.

For investors, the deal is a signal that cybersecurity remains a fertile ground for innovation, particularly where AI and automation intersect with foundational development practices. As software becomes more complex and distributed, demand for real-time, integrated security controls will only rise.

Aikido’s unicorn milestone is less about the label and more about the validation of a model that places developers at the centre of security. If successful, this approach could influence how future security platforms are built and adopted across the industry.

            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-13</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For years, online shopping followed a fixed path. Search bar, product grid, filters, checkout. The interface barely changed, even as everything else on the internet did. That path is now breaking.

Monday 12 January, 2026, JD Sports Fashion plc (JD Group) became one of the first large retailers to let US customers search and buy sneakers directly inside AI chatbots, including ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini. No website visit. No app. Just a conversation that ends with a payment.

Basically, a customer can chat with an AI bot, say “add these shoes to my cart,” and complete a purchase in one click.

JD Sports has agreed a global deal with commercetools to enable “one-click” purchases on AI assistants including Copilot, Gemini and ChatGPT. US customers will simply tell the chatbot what they want and pay instantly via Stripe’s integrated payment flow.

The retailer is the first to deploy commercetools’ “Agentic Jumpstart” solution along with Stripe’s Agentic Commerce Suite (ACS). Stripe handles the payment and fraud protection, while commercetools’ AI Hub keeps JD’s product data, pricing and availability in sync across all AI channels.

For example, “Find me a pair of Nike Air Max size 10.” The AI queries JD’s catalog (via commercetools) and returns relevant products, with images and details. The shopper can then say “buy this pair,” and Stripe handles the checkout seamlessly. Commercetools and Stripe emphasize that all payment and fulfillment data still flow through JD’s systems – the retailer retains control over inventory, pricing, and customer experience.

AI-driven shopping shifts the act of buying from browsing to intent-based conversation.

Instead of scrolling through hundreds of sneakers, a customer can ask for “black running shoes under $150, good for daily training,” refine the request, compare options, and pay, all within the same chat. The AI handles discovery, filtering, and decision support in one flow.

For consumers, that means less friction and less time spent navigating interfaces designed around catalogs, not questions. For retailers, it means the loss of something they’ve relied on for two decades: control over the shopping journey.

JD Sports CEO Regis Schultz compared the impact of AI on retail to the internet boom of the late 1990s and suggested it could shrink physical store footprints by reducing the need for cash desks. The comment points to a wider rethink. If discovery and checkout move into AI layers, both digital and physical stores become less central.

Traditional e-commerce platforms are built around pages, categories, and conversion funnels. AI shopping ignores most of that. When purchases happen inside chatbots, platforms lose visibility into how customers arrive at decisions. Brand differentiation becomes harder when products are presented as answers rather than destinations. Loyalty shifts from websites to whichever AI assistant the customer trusts.

This creates a new competitive layer. Retailers are no longer just competing on price, delivery, or UX, but on how well their inventory, data, and brand translate into AI-mediated conversations. It also raises questions for marketplaces. If AI assistants can compare products across multiple retailers in real time, the advantage of being the “place people go to shop” weakens.

Letting customers buy without visiting a website introduces new risks. Retailers must ensure that payments remain secure, that inventory and pricing are accurate in real time, and that the brand experience doesn’t dissolve into a generic AI response. Stripe’s role here is critical, acting as the trust layer that makes conversational checkout viable at scale.

There’s also the issue of accountability. When something goes wrong, a failed payment, a wrong size, a delayed delivery, the customer interacts with an AI, not a store. Retailers still own the outcome, even if they no longer own the interface.

JD Sports is not alone. The move points to a broader pattern: commerce is migrating upward into AI systems that sit between consumers and brands. As mobile apps reshaped shopping in the 2010s, conversational AI is reshaping it again, this time by pushing the store itself out of the center of the experience.

What replaces it is less visible, but more powerful: intent, context, and conversation. Retail isn’t disappearing. It’s dissolving into the tools people already use to think, search, and decide.

There is something undeniably impressive about this evolution. Buying becomes faster, friction thins, decisions compress into a few lines of text. Yet, step by step, human interaction is quietly being removed from the equation. The cashier, the sales assistant, even the act of browsing alongside others, all fade into background infrastructure.

The open question isn’t whether this shift will happen, but how far it should go. When shopping becomes a dialogue with machines, convenience wins, but presence is lost. Retail now faces a new design challenge, not just how to sell through AI, but how to decide where human interaction still matters, and how to keep it from disappearing by default.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the past few years, artificial intelligence has been discussed almost exclusively in terms of models. Bigger models, faster models, smarter models. More recently, the focus shifted to agents, systems capable of planning, reasoning, and acting autonomously.

Yet the real leap in usefulness does not happen at the model level, nor at the agent level. It happens one layer above, at the level of Skills.

If models represent intelligence and agents represent coordination, Skills are where AI becomes operational and valuable in the real world.

A Skill is an applied, reusable unit of procedural knowledge that allows an AI system to reliably perform a specific task from start to finish.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

In practical terms, a Skill is an intelligent application that transforms user intent into execution.

A Skill has a clearly defined purpose. It encapsulates domain-specific know-how. It follows a repeatable procedure. And it produces a concrete, usable result.

This could mean analyzing a contract and identifying risks, comparing multiple SaaS tools based on real business constraints, generating a pricing strategy using market data, or producing a financial or operational report.

Users never interact with models or agents directly. What they experience are Skills, because Skills are the part of AI that delivers outcomes.

To understand why Skills matter, it helps to look at the modern AI stack. At the foundation are models. They provide raw intelligence such as language understanding, reasoning, perception, and pattern recognition. They are powerful, but fundamentally generic.

Above them sit agents. Agents function like an operating system. They plan tasks, break problems into steps, decide which tools or models to use, and manage execution flow. They are good coordinators, but coordination alone does not equal expertise.

At the top of the stack are Skills. Skills are the application layer. They are structured, purpose-built capabilities that agents can invoke to get real work done. Just as hardware is not software and software is not an application, intelligence is not usefulness. Models are not agents, and agents are not Skills.

A Skill is not a single instruction. It is an orchestrated process. When a user expresses a concrete need, such as wanting to know which SaaS solution best fits their company, the system identifies the relevant Skill. An agent then decomposes the task into procedural steps. Requirements are gathered, data is retrieved, evaluation logic is applied, and results are synthesized. Models perform analysis and reasoning at each step, and the Skill delivers a structured outcome such as a recommendation, report, decision, or document.

From the user’s perspective, none of this complexity is visible. The Skill simply works.

One of the most important distinctions is that Skills encode procedural knowledge rather than descriptive knowledge. Large language models are excellent at explaining what something is. Skills capture how something is actually done.

This procedural knowledge may include workflows, scripts, decision logic, rules, tool integrations, and structured reasoning steps. It is what turns general intelligence into expert behavior. Agents on their own are capable planners, but they lack deep, domain-specific execution knowledge. Skills fill that gap.

This is also why Skills scale better than custom-built agents. A common mistake today is creating a new agent for every task. That approach quickly becomes brittle and unmanageable. Skills, by contrast, are modular, reusable, and composable. A small number of general-purpose agents can call a growing library of specialized Skills, each focused on doing one thing well. This mirrors how scalable software systems are built in practice.

Another critical point is that Skills are products, not just technology. They can be packaged, licensed, distributed, integrated, and monetized. Users and businesses do not buy reasoning or intelligence in the abstract. They buy capabilities. They buy outcomes. They buy the ability to make better decisions and execute faster.

As models become increasingly commoditized and agent frameworks begin to converge, the real competitive advantage in AI is shifting. It will belong to those who build the most useful Skills and control how they are distributed.

In the long run, AI systems will not be judged by how intelligent they are, but by how effectively they convert intelligence into action.

Models think. Agents coordinate. Skills execute.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The term Artificial Intelligence (AI) is well known, often evoking futuristic movies like Robocop, Terminator and The Matrix. Yet what many don’t realize is that AI has been part of our lives for decades.

When you finish watching a movie on a streaming platform and instantly see recommendations for similar content, that’s AI. When you’re shopping online and an entire page of suggested products appears, that’s AI. Even the digital ads you see are powered by machine-learning algorithms designed to optimize engagement, clicks, and conversions.

Companies have relied on AI rule-based automation, routines, and machine-learning algorithms for years to power their systems and business processes.

So when you hear conversations about the “urgent need to start using AI,” pause for a moment. AI itself isn’t new, the real transformation we’re witnessing comes from Generative AI, a newer branch of deep learning, which itself is a subset of machine learning.

Artificial Intelligence broadly covers machines that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence. Machine Learning trains systems to learn from data. Deep Learning uses multi-layered neural networks to recognize complex patterns. Generative AI goes one step further. It doesn’t just analyze data or perform tasks, it creates new content: text, images, code, music, and more.

I was among the early adopters of ChatGPT, just a few months after its public launch in late 2022. It was a defining moment in the history of technology, the first time we could produce analyses, insights, and even complete outputs simply by typing natural-language prompts, without programming or complex tools.

I knew immediately that this would change the world. However, this accessibility has created a double-edged sword. Today, the digital landscape is flooded with “AI experts,” unverified tutorials, and get-rich-quick schemes that often promote the misuse of these tools.

There is a vast amount of misinformation circulating, ranging from overhyped capabilities to fundamental misunderstandings of how Large Language Models (LLMs) process truth and data.

To move beyond the noise, it’s important to seek out education from rigorous, academically backed sources rather than social media trends. The goal when using Generative AI tools shouldn’t be just to generate text, but to understand the capabilities and limitations well enough to apply it securely.

I was in university when the Internet first became commercialized. My first job, in 1996, was selling Internet access to individuals and companies. I witnessed firsthand the anxiety, resistance, and eventual transformation that followed. Yes, the Internet eliminated certain jobs, but it created far more, and often better ones.

Generative AI is bringing a similar paradigm shift today. The key is not to fear it but to learn it, to develop the literacy and critical understanding to use it responsibly. A sentiment often shared among industry leaders during my Generative AI research has stayed with me ever since: “AI will not steal your job; a human using AI will.”

That sentence should be a constant reminder for everyone: life is an ongoing evolution. Technologies disrupt, jobs disappear, and new ones emerge. So the next time you hear someone say, “We need to get into AI,” ask, “Which AI?”

Traditional AI analyzes what already exists, and chances are, you and your company are already using it. Generative AI creates what’s next. This distinction matters. If you treat Generative AI like a search engine or a calculator, you miss its true potential. If you treat it as an absolute source of truth, you risk misuse.

That is why deep literacy is essential. Understanding the specific capabilities of these tools is an act of digital responsibility. By educating ourselves, grounding our knowledge in fact, and embracing change with intention, we prepare to lead this next technological era, not be replaced by it.
