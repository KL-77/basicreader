            <h2>Texas sues biggest TV makers, alleging smart TVs spy on users without consent</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/texas-sues-biggest-tv-makers-alleging-smart-tvs-spy-on-users-without-consent/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued five large TV manufacturers yesterday, alleging that their smart TVs spy on viewers without consent. Paxton sued Samsung, the longtime TV market share leader, along with LG, Sony, Hisense, and TCL.

“These companies have been unlawfully collecting personal data through Automated Content Recognition (‘ACR’) technology,” Paxton’s office alleged in a press release that contains links to all five lawsuits. “ACR in its simplest terms is an uninvited, invisible digital invader. This software can capture screenshots of a user’s television display every 500 milliseconds, monitor viewing activity in real time, and transmit that information back to the company without the user’s knowledge or consent. The companies then sell that consumer information to target ads across platforms for a profit. This technology puts users’ privacy and sensitive information, such as passwords, bank information, and other personal information at risk.”

The lawsuits allege violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, seeking damages of up to $10,000 for each violation and up to $250,000 for each violation affecting people 65 years or older. Texas also wants restraining orders prohibiting the collection, sharing, and selling of ACR data while the lawsuits are pending.

Texas argues that providing personalized content and targeted advertising are not legitimate purposes for collecting ACR data about consumers. The companies’ “insatiable appetite for consumer data far exceeds what is reasonably necessary,” and the “invasive data harvesting is only needed to increase advertisement revenue, which does not satisfy a consumer-necessity standard,” the lawsuits say.

Paxton is far from the first person to raise privacy concerns about smart TVs. The Center for Digital Democracy advocacy group said in a report last year that in “the world of connected TV, viewer surveillance is now built directly into the television set, making manufacturers central players in data collection, monitoring, and digital marketing.” We recently published a guide on how to break free from smart TV ads and tracking.

“Companies using ACR claim that it is all opt-in data, with permission required to use it,” the Center for Digital Democracy report said. “But the ACR system is bundled into new TVs as part of the initial set-up, and its extensive role in monitoring and sharing viewer actions is not fully explained. As a consequence, most consumers would be unaware of the threats and risks involved in signing up for the service.”

Pointing out that Hisense and TCL are based in China, Paxton’s press release said the firms’ “Chinese ties pose serious concerns about consumer data harvesting and are exacerbated by China’s National Security Law, which gives its government the capability to get its hands on US consumer data.”

“Companies, especially those connected to the Chinese Communist Party, have no business illegally recording Americans’ devices inside their own homes,” Paxton said. “This conduct is invasive, deceptive, and unlawful. The fundamental right to privacy will be protected in Texas because owning a television does not mean surrendering your personal information to Big Tech or foreign adversaries.”

The Paxton lawsuits, filed in district courts in several Texas counties, are identical in many respects. The complaints allege that TVs made by the five companies “aren’t just entertainment devices—they’re a mass surveillance system sitting in millions of American living rooms. What consumers were told would enhance their viewing experience actually tracks, analyzes, and sells intimate details about everything they watch.”

Using ACR, each company “secretly monitors what consumers watch across streaming apps, cable, and even connected devices like gaming consoles or Blu-ray players,” and harvests the data to build profiles of consumer behavior and sell the data for profit, the complaints say.

We contacted the five companies sued by Texas today. Sony, LG, and Hisense responded and said they would not comment on a pending legal matter.

The complaints allege that the companies fail to obtain meaningful consent from users. The following excerpt is from the Samsung lawsuit but is repeated almost verbatim in the others:

Consumers never agreed to Samsung Watchware. When families buy a television, they don’t expect it to spy on them. They don’t expect their viewing habits packaged and auctioned to advertisers. Yet Samsung deceptively guides consumers to activate ACR and buries any explanation of what that means in dense legal jargon that few will read or understand. The so-called “consent” Samsung obtains is meaningless. Disclosures are hidden, vague, and misleading. The company collects far more data than necessary to make the TV work. Consumers are stripped of real choice and kept in the dark about what’s happening in their own homes on Samsung Smart TVs.

Samsung and other companies force consumers to go through multistep menus to exercise their privacy choices, Texas said. “Consumers must circumnavigate a long, non-intuitive path to exercise their right to opt-out,” the Samsung lawsuit said. This involves selecting menu choices for Settings, Additional Settings, General Privacy, Terms & Privacy, Viewing Information Services, and, finally, “Disable,” the lawsuit said. There are “additional toggles for Interest-Based Ads, Ad Personalization, and Privacy Choices,” the lawsuit said.

The “privacy choices are not meaningful because opt-out rights are scattered across four or more separate menus which requires approximately 15+ clicks,” the lawsuit continued. “To fully opt-out of ACR and related ad tracking on Samsung Smart TVs, consumers must disable at least two settings: (1) Viewing Information Services, and (2) Interest-Based Ads. Each of which appear in different parts of the setting UI. Conversely, Samsung provides consumers with a one-click enrollment option to opt-in during the initial start-up process.”

When consumers first start up a Samsung smart TV, they “must click through a multipage onboarding flow before landing on a consent screen, titled Smart Hub Terms & Conditions,” the lawsuit said. “Upon finally reaching the consent screen, consumers are presented with four notices: Terms & Conditions: Dispute Resolution Agreement, Smart Hub U.S. Policy Notice, Viewing Information Services, and Interest-Based Advertisements Service U.S. Privacy Notice, with only one button prominently displayed: I Agree to all.”

It would be unreasonable to expect consumers to understand that Samsung TVs come equipped with surveillance capabilities, the lawsuit said. “Most consumers do not know, nor have any reason to suspect, that Samsung Smart TVs are capturing in real-time the audio and visuals displayed on the screen and using the information to profile them for advertisers,” it said.

Paxton alleges that TV companies violated the state’s Deceptive Trade Practices Act with misrepresentations regarding the collection of personal information and failure to disclose the use of ACR technology. The lawsuit against Hisense additionally alleges a failure to disclose that it may provide the Chinese government with consumers’ personal data.

Hisense “fails to disclose to Texas Consumers that under Chinese law, Hisense is required to transfer its collections of Texas consumers’ personal data to the People’s Republic of China when requested by the PRC,” the lawsuit said.

The TCL lawsuit doesn’t include that specific charge. But both the Hisense and TCL complaints say the Chinese Communist Party may use ACR data from the companies’ smart TVs “to influence or compromise public figures in Texas, including judges, elected officials, and law enforcement, and for corporate espionage by surveilling those employed in critical infrastructure, as part of the CCP’s long-term plan to destabilize and undermine American democracy.”

The TVs “are effectively Chinese-sponsored surveillance devices, recording the viewing habits of Texans at every turn without their knowledge or consent,” the lawsuits said.</div>

            <h2>The $4.3 billion space telescope Trump tried to cancel is now complete</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/12/the-4-3-billion-space-telescope-trump-tried-to-cancel-is-now-complete/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A few weeks ago, technicians inside a cavernous clean room in Maryland made the final connection to complete assembly of NASA’s Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.

Parts of this new observatory, named for NASA’s first chief astronomer, recently completed a spate of tests to ensure it can survive the shaking and intense sound of a rocket launch. Engineers placed the core of the telescope inside a thermal vacuum chamber, where it withstood the airless conditions and extreme temperature swings it will see in space.

Then, on November 25, teams at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, joined the inner and outer portions of the Roman Space Telescope. With this milestone, NASA declared the observatory complete and on track for launch as soon as fall 2026.

“The team is ecstatic,” said Jackie Townsend, the observatory’s deputy project manager at Goddard, in a recent interview with Ars. “It has been a long road, but filled with lots of successes and an ordinary amount of challenges, I would say. It’s just so rewarding to get to this spot.”

An ordinary amount of challenges is not something you usually hear a NASA official say about a one-of-a-kind space mission. NASA does hard things, and they usually take more time than originally predicted. Astronomers endured more than 10 years of delays, fixes, and setbacks before the James Webb Space Telescope finally launched in 2021.

Webb is the largest telescope ever put into space. After launch, Webb had to perform a sequence of more than 50 major deployment steps, with 178 release mechanisms that had to work perfectly. Any one of the more than 300 single points of failure could have doomed the mission. In the end, Webb unfolded its giant segmented mirror and delicate sunshield without issue. After a quarter-century of development and more than $11 billion spent, the observatory is finally delivering images and science results. And they’re undeniably spectacular.

Roman is far less complex, with a 7.9-foot (2.4-meter) primary mirror that is nearly three times smaller than Webb’s. While it lacks Webb’s deep vision, Roman will see wider swaths of the sky, enabling a cosmic census of billions of stars and galaxies near and far (on the scale of the Universe). This broad vision will support research into dark matter and dark energy, which are thought to make up about 95 percent of the Universe. The rest of the Universe is made of regular atoms and molecules that we can see and touch.

It is also illustrative to compare Roman with the Hubble Space Telescope, which has primary mirrors of the same size. This means Roman will produce images with similar resolution to Hubble. The distinction lies deep inside Roman, where technicians have delicately laid an array of detectors to register the faint infrared light coming through the telescope’s aperture.

“Things like night vision goggles will use the same basic detector device, just tuned to a different wavelength,” Townsend said.

These detectors are located in Roman’s Wide Field Instrument, the mission’s primary imaging camera. There are 18 of them, each 4,096×4,096 pixels wide, combining to form a roughly 300-megapixel camera sensitive to visible and near-infrared light. Teledyne, the company that produced the detectors, says this is the largest infrared focal plane ever made.

The near-infrared channel on Hubble’s Wide Field Camera 3, which covers much the same part of the spectrum as Roman, has a single 1,024-pixel detector.

“That’s how you get to a much higher field-of-view for the Roman Space Telescope, and it was one of the key enabling technologies,” Townsend told Ars. “That was one place where Roman invested significant dollars, even before we started as a mission, to mature that technology so that it was ready to infuse into this mission.”

With these detectors in its bag, Roman will cover much more cosmic real estate than Hubble. For example, Roman will be able to re-create Hubble’s famous Ultra Deep Field image with the same sharpness, but expand it to show countless stars and galaxies over an area of the sky at least 100 times larger.

Roman has a second instrument, the Roman Coronagraph, with masks, filters, and adaptive optics to block out the glare from stars and reveal the faint glow from objects around them. It is designed to photograph planets 100 million times fainter than their stars, or 100 to 1,000 times better than similar instruments on Webb and Hubble. Roman can also detect exoplanets using the tried-and-true transit method, but scientists expect the new telescope will find a lot more than past space missions, thanks to its wider vision.

“With Roman’s construction complete, we are poised at the brink of unfathomable scientific discovery,” said Julie McEnery, Roman’s senior project scientist at NASA Goddard, in a press release. “In the mission’s first five years, it’s expected to unveil more than 100,000 distant worlds, hundreds of millions of stars, and billions of galaxies. We stand to learn a tremendous amount of new information about the universe very rapidly after Roman launches.”

Big numbers are crucial for learning how the Universe works, and Roman will feed vast volumes of data down to astronomers on Earth. “So much of what physics is trying to understand about the nature of the Universe today needs large number statistics in order to understand,” Townsend said.

In one of Roman’s planned sky surveys, the telescope will cover in nine months what would take Hubble between 1,000 and 2,000 years. In another survey, Roman will cover an area equivalent to 3,455 full moons in about three weeks, then go back and observe a smaller portion of that area repeatedly over five-and-a-half days—jobs that Hubble and Webb can’t do.

“We will do fundamentally different science,” Townsend said. “In some subset of our observations, we’re going to be making 3D movies of what is going on in the Milky Way galaxy and in distant galaxies. That is just something that’s never happened before.”

Roman’s promised scientific bounty will come at a cost of $4.3 billion, including expenses for development, manufacturing, launch, and five years of operations.

This is about $300 million more than NASA expected when it formally approved Roman for development in 2020, an overrun the agency blamed on complications related to the coronavirus pandemic. Otherwise, Roman’s budget has been stable since NASA officials finalized the mission’s architecture in 2017, when it was still known by a bulky acronym: WFIRST, the Wide Field InfraRed Survey Telescope.

At that time, the agency reclassified the Roman Coronagraph as a technology demonstration, allowing managers to relax their requirements for the instrument and stave off concerns about cost growth.

Roman survived multiple attempts by the first Trump administration to cancel the mission. Each time, Congress restored funding to keep the observatory on track for launch in the mid-2020s. With Donald Trump back in the White House, the administration’s budget office earlier this year again wanted to cancel Roman. Eventually, the Trump administration released its fiscal year 2026 budget request in May, calling for a drastic cut to Roman, but not total cancellation.

Once again, both houses of Congress signaled their opposition to the cuts, and the mission remains on track for launch next year, perhaps as soon as September. This is eight months ahead of the schedule NASA has publicized for Roman for the last few years.

Townsend told Ars the mission escaped the kind of crippling cost overruns and delays that afflicted Webb through careful planning and execution. “Roman was under a cost cap, and we operated to that,” she said. “We went through reasonable efforts to preclude those kinds of highly complex deployments that lead you to having trouble in integration and test.”

There are only a handful of mechanisms that must work after Roman’s launch. They include a deployable cover designed to shield the telescope’s mirror during launch and solar array wings that will unfold once Roman is in space. The observatory will head to an observing post about a million miles (1.5 million kilometers) from Earth.

“We don’t have moments of terror for the deployment,” Townsend said. “Obviously, launch is always a risk, the tip-off rates that you have when you separate from the launch vehicle… Then, obviously, getting the aperture door open so that it’s deployed is another one. But these feel like normal aerospace risks, not unusual, harrowing moments for Roman.”

It also helps that Roman will use a primary mirror gifted to NASA by the National Reconnaissance Office, the US government’s spy satellite agency. The NRO originally ordered the mirror for a telescope that would peer down on the Earth, but the spy agency no longer needed it. Before NASA got its hands on the surplus mirror in 2012, scientists working on the preliminary design for what became Roman were thinking of a smaller telescope.

The larger telescope will make Roman a more powerful tool for science, and the NRO’s donation eliminated the risk of a problem or delay manufacturing a new mirror. But the upside meant NASA had to build a more massive spacecraft and use a bigger rocket to accommodate it, adding to the observatory’s cost.

Tests of Roman’s components have gone well this year. Work on Roman continued at Goddard through the government shutdown in the fall. On Webb, engineers uncovered one problem after another as they tried to verify the observatory would perform as intended in space. There were leaky valves, tears in the Webb’s sunshield, a damaged transducer, and loose screws. With Roman, engineers so far have found no “significant surprises” during ground testing, Townsend said.

“What we always hope when you’re doing this final round of environmental tests is that you’ve wrung out the hardware at lower levels of assembly, and it looks like, in Roman’s case, we did a spectacular job at the lower level,” she said.

With Roman now fully assembled, attention at Goddard will turn to an end-to-end functional test of the observatory early next year, followed by electromagnetic interference testing, and another round of acoustic and vibration tests. Then, perhaps around June of next year, NASA will ship the observatory to Kennedy Space Center, Florida, to prepare for launch on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket.

“We’re really down to the last stretch of environmental testing for the system,” Townsend said. “It’s definitely already seen the worst environment until we get to launch.”</div>

In letters to seven AI firms, Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) cited a study estimating that “electricity prices have increased by as much as 267 percent in the past five years” in “areas located near significant data center activity.”

Prices increase, senators noted, when utility companies build out extra infrastructure to meet data centers’ energy demands—which can amount to one customer suddenly consuming as much power as an entire city. They also increase when demand for local power outweighs supply. In some cases, residents are blindsided by higher bills, not even realizing a data center project was approved, because tech companies seem intent on dodging backlash and frequently do not allow terms of deals to be publicly disclosed.

AI firms “ask public officials to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) preventing them from sharing information with their constituents, operate through what appear to be shell companies to mask the real owner of the data center, and require that landowners sign NDAs as part of the land sale while telling them only that a ‘Fortune 100 company’ is planning an ‘industrial development’ seemingly in an attempt to hide the very existence of the data center,” senators wrote.

States like Virginia with the highest concentration of data centers could see average electricity prices increase by another 25 percent by 2030, senators noted. But price increases aren’t limited to the states allegedly striking shady deals with tech companies and greenlighting data center projects, they said. “Interconnected and interstate power grids can lead to a data center built in one state raising costs for residents of a neighboring state,” senators reported.

Under fire for supposedly only pretending to care about keeping neighbors’ costs low were Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Equinix, Digital Realty, and CoreWeave. Senators accused firms of paying “lip service,” claiming that they would do everything in their power to avoid increasing residential electricity costs, while actively lobbying to pass billions in costs on to their neighbors.

For example, Amazon publicly claimed it would “make sure” it would cover costs so they wouldn’t be passed on. But it’s also a member of an industry lobbying group, the Data Center Coalition, that “has opposed state regulatory decisions requiring data center companies to pay a higher percentage of costs upfront,” senators wrote. And Google made similar statements, despite having an executive who opposed a regulatory solution that would set data centers into their own “rate class”—and therefore responsible for grid improvement costs that could not be passed on to other customers—on the grounds that it was supposedly “discriminatory.”

“The current, socialized model of electricity ratepaying,” senators explained—where costs are shared across all users—”was not designed for an era where just one customer requires the same amount of electricity as some of the largest cities in America.”

Particularly problematic, senators emphasized, were reports that tech firms were getting discounts on energy costs as utility companies competed for their business, while prices went up for their neighbors.

Ars contacted all firms targeted by lawmakers. Four did not respond. Microsoft and Meta declined to comment. Digital Realty told Ars that it “looks forward to working with all elected officials to continue to invest in the digital infrastructure required to support America’s leadership in technology, which underpins modern life and creates high-paying jobs.”

Senators are likely exploring whether to pass legislation that would help combat price increases that they say cause average Americans to struggle to keep the lights on. They’ve asked tech companies to respond to their biggest questions about data center projects by January 12, 2026.

Among their top questions, senators wanted to know about firms’ internal projections looking forward with data center projects. That includes sharing their projected energy use through 2030, as well as the “impact of your AI data centers on regional utility costs.” Companies are also expected to explain how “internal projections of data center energy consumption” justify any “opposition to the creation of a distinct data center rate class.”

Additionally, senators asked firms to outline steps they’ve taken to prevent passing on costs to neighbors and details of any impact studies companies have conducted.

Likely to raise the most eyebrows, however, would be answers to questions about “tax deductions or other financial incentives” tech firms have received from city and state governments. Those numbers would be interesting to compare with other information senators demanded that companies share, detailing how much they’ve spent on lobbying and advocacy for data centers. Senators appear keen to know how much tech companies are paying to avoid covering a proportionate amount of infrastructure costs.

“To protect consumers, data centers must pay a greater share of the costs upfront for future energy usage and updates to the electrical grid provided specifically to accommodate data centers’ energy needs,” senators wrote.

Requiring upfront payment is especially critical, senators noted, since some tech firms have abandoned data center projects, leaving local customers to bear the costs of infrastructure changes without utility companies ever generating any revenue. Communities must also consider that AI firms’ projected energy demand could severely dip if enterprise demand for AI falls short of expectations, AI capabilities “plateau” and trigger widespread indifference, AI companies shift strategies “away from scaling computer power,” or chip companies “find innovative ways to make AI more energy-efficient.”

“If data centers end up providing less business to the utility companies than anticipated, consumers could be left with massive electricity bills as utility companies recoup billions in new infrastructure costs, with nothing to show for it,” senators wrote.

Already, Utah, Oregon, and Ohio have passed laws “creating a separate class of utility customer for data centers which includes basic financial safeguards such as upfront payments and longer contract length,” senators noted, and Virginia is notably weighing a similar law.

At least one study, The New York Times noted, suggested that data centers may have recently helped reduce electricity costs by spreading the costs of upgrades over more customers, but those outcomes varied by state and could not account for future AI demand.

“It remains unclear whether broader, sustained load growth will increase long-run average costs and prices,” Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory researchers concluded. “In some cases, spikes in load growth can result in significant, near-term retail price increase.”

Until companies prove they’re paying their fair share, senators expect electricity bills to keep climbing, particularly in vulnerable areas. That will likely only increase pressure for regulators to intervene, the director of the Electricity Law Initiative at the Harvard Law School Environmental and Energy Law Program, Ari Peskoe, suggested in September.

“The utility business model is all about spreading costs of system expansion to everyone, because we all benefit from a reliable, robust electricity system,” Peskoe said. “But when it’s a single consumer that is using so much energy—basically that of an entire city—and when that new city happens to be owned by the wealthiest corporations in the world, I think it’s time to look at the fundamental assumptions of utility regulation and make sure that these facilities are really paying for all of the infrastructure costs to connect them to the system and to power them.”</div>

            <h2>Top Spy Says Tech Corporations Are Closer to Running Entire World Than Governments</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When it comes to toppling governments from behind the scenes, not many know the business better than MI6. Since the end of World War II, British covert operatives have executed 42 coup attempts in 27 countries throughout the world, in pursuit of economic or political outcomes that suit the nation’s interests.

In other words, they know a hostile takeover when they see one — which is why it’s alarming that Blaise Metreweli, the new head of the spy agency, issued a statement warning that global power is increasingly being transferred to the world’s tech corporations.

“Our world is being actively remade with profound implications for national and international security,” Metreweli declared in her first statement as chief of MI6. “Power itself is becoming more diffuse, more unpredictable as control over these technologies is shifting from states to corporations and sometimes to individuals.”

She also noted that “we’re now operating in a space between peace and war.”

“This is not a temporary state or a gradual, inevitable evolution,” she continued.

Over the past few months, politicians from the ruling Labour party have grown increasingly frustrated at political meddling from tech billionaires like Elon Musk, who called for the overthrow of the UK government at a far-right rally in September.

Notably, Metreweli stopped short of calling out any billionaires by name or identifying the systemic issues that got us here, according to The Paper. Instead, she followed other ministers in centering a vague loss of public trust, rather than the profit-driven forces reshaping global power for their own interests.

“The foundations of trust in our societies are eroding,” she said. “Information, once a unifying force, is increasingly weaponized. Falsehoods spread faster than fact, dividing communities and distorting reality. We live in an age of hyper-connection yet profound isolation. The algorithms flatter our biases and fracture our public squares.”

Metreweli is notably the first woman to lead as chief of MI6. Her own history speaks to the intricate web of colonial power brokers that have laid the groundwork for the increasingly monopolistic world we now live in.

For example, Metreweli grew up in the upper crust of British-occupied Hong Kong, where she received a lavish private education. Though she never would’ve had to worry about it, Western corporations have a long history of brutal exploitation of native-born workers and economic collusion with the occupation government.

After receiving her education, Metreweli went on to work as an intelligence operative in the US- and British-occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan, important economic zones which were regarded as part of the old British Empire. (Her official assignment was “Second Secretary for Economic Affairs at the Foreign Office” in Dubai, per The Times.)

In short, Metreweli’s alarm over corporate power isn’t so much a critique of tech monopolies in general, but a defense of the British state’s role in influencing world governments. Her speech, shaped by a career fighting for British interests, boils down to a simple refrain: that power should be ours to wield, not theirs.

            <h2>CoreWeave Has Lost a Staggering Amount of Stock Value Over the Past Six Months</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-16</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI cloud computing company CoreWave exploded onto the scene in March with the biggest tech IPO since 2021.

The company’s stock soared by more than 40 percent in the following days, riding on the coattails of immense hype surrounding generative AI. The hype was driven by insatiable AI companies like Microsoft, OpenAI, and Meta leasing hundreds of megawatts of compute as outfits like CoreWeave construct enormous data centers.

If AI chipmaker Nvidia is the one selling shovels during the ongoing AI gold rush, in other words, CoreWeave is the one buying those shovels in bulk and leasing access to the digging sites.

But persistent fears of an AI bubble have put a massive damper on investor enthusiasm, leaving many to wonder whether CoreWeave could be the canary in the coalmine — and even drawing comparisons to Enron, a company with an extremely speculative valuation that imploded following a major accounting scandal in 2001.

As the Wall Street Journal reports, CoreWeave’s share price has plunged 46 percent in just six weeks, with $33 billion of value going up in smoke. At press time, shares are hovering at just under $70, meaning the company has lost a staggering 56 percent of its stock value in just six months.

It may well be a sign that investors are jittery that the enormous spending by the likes of CoreWeave may not be justified in the long run. Even AI leaders have warned that a return may still be many years out, with OpenAI admitting last month that it won’t make any money until at least 2030.

It doesn’t take much reading between the lines to understand why they’re nervous. Taking on an enormous amount of high-interest debt to construct and lease AI data centers leaves the firm with a considerable degree of risk, potentially putting it first on the chopping block in case the AI bubble were to implode.

Its operations are also meeting some major headwinds, both literally and figuratively. Rainstorms in Texas forced the company to delay the pouring of a foundation for an AI data center complex, pushing back the completion date by months, the WSJ reports.

Investors have also balked at circular financing arrangements in the sector. For instance, Nvidia owns six percent of the company’s shares, while CoreWeave has signed an exclusivity contract with the AI chipmaker to only use its GPUs. Microsoft represented 62 percent of CoreWeave’s 2024 revenue, as the Wall Street Journal pointed out last month, and is also a major shareholder of CoreWeave’s top customer, OpenAI.

Then there’s CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator, who downplayed those fears last month.

“If you’re building something that accelerates the economy and has fundamental value to the world, the world will find ways to finance an enormous amount of business,” he said at a Wall Street Journal event in early November.

Days after downplaying concerns over an AI bubble, Intrator was probed by investors during a quarterly earnings call about the delays at the Texas data center construction site.

He argued that “there are 32 data centers in our portfolio,” and that “this one data center will catch up, and then we will move forward from there.”

As per the WSJ, the company’s CFO, Nitin Agrawal, was forced to intervene and clarify that there were delays plaguing several data centers for a single “data center provider.”

Investors are also concerned that the enormous amount of debt being taken on could compound significantly due to supply chain bottlenecks. Delays may not sound like a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but considering how much money and interest are on the line, an enormous amount of pressure is on CoreWeave to deliver some good news.

“The bull case is that they’ll scale into it, and that a lot of companies have low margins to start, but this is a company at scale,” DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria told the WSJ. “There is no scaling going on here.”

            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-16</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The outcry sparked by the Washington Post’s launch of AI-generated podcasts has gone in one ear of the newspaper’s leadership and out the other, which isn’t too dissimilar to what might happen to anyone listening to the slop it’s trying to peddle.

On Monday, the Jeff Bezos-owned publication doubled down on its personalized podcasts push, brushing aside the criticism from readers and its own reporters alike.

“This is how products get built and developed in the digital age: ideation, research, design and prototyping, development, and then Beta,” a WaPo spokesperson told TheWrap.  “Only if they prove to be successful for the customer do they then get launched. As stated clear on Your Personal Podcast, it is currently in Beta.”

WaPo launched its “Your Personal Podcast” feature last week, sparking immediate dissent in its ranks. Staffers were furious about the podcast AI inventing and misattributing quotes, Semafor reported Friday, and even sometimes editorializing on stories. Some staffers questioned the tech’s seemingly nonexistent guardrails, Status reported, while another described it as a “total disaster.”

Further underscoring the staggering incompetence on display, followup reporting from Semafor revealed that WaPo had conducted its own tests prior to launching which showed that up to 84 percent of the AI-generated podcasts scripts didn’t meet the newspaper’s standards — and were therefore unpublishable.

There’s a significant disconnect between the company’s newsroom and its product team in charge of the AI rollout. The podcast’s product team sees the errors as a normal part of rolling out a new and still experimental feature, and said it would “iterate through the remaining issues.”

Similar jargon was on display in the paper’s statement to TheWrap, and it’s equal parts telling and jarring that such tech-minded rhetoric is being deployed in the context of journalism. The AI may not be doing the work of an actual journalist, but it’s taking over the role of packaging the news to listeners. Would a human news anchor be given this much leeway, and be allowed to screw up more details than they get right because they’re learning on the job, or in tech parlance, “iterating through it”?

The Post isn’t the only newsroom deploying AI. The New York Times uses it to help generate headlines, and Bloomberg’s website features an AI that summarizes its articles. Many publications have some form of AI chatbot trained on their archives. But WaPo has been particularly AI-evangelistic, signifying its transformation under Jeff Bezos’ ownership. Along with deploying AI summaries and an AI chatbot, it also put forth a plan for letting non-professional writers submit articles written with AI.

The AI podcasts, however, seem to really have struck a nerve with its staff.

“It is truly astonishing that this was allowed to go forward at all,” one WaPo editor fumed on Slack, per Semafor. “Never would I have imagined that the Washington Post would deliberately warp its own journalism and then push these errors out to our audience at scale.”

“If we were serious, we would pull this tool immediately,” the editor added.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amazon is in early discussions to invest as much as $10 billion in OpenAI in a deal that would see the AI lab using the e-commerce giant’s AI chips, CNBC reported.

If it materializes, the deal would value OpenAI at more than $500 billion, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous source.

Amazon has been looking to diversify its bets in the AI race, which has so far seen it partner up and invest $8 billion in Anthropic, a rival to OpenAI. The e-commerce giant earlier this month also unveiled the latest iteration in its Trainium series of chips, and outlined the development of the next installment of those chips, complementing its cloud computing offerings via Amazon Web Services.

News of the deal comes a couple months after OpenAI completed its transition to a for-profit model, which gives it more freedom to strike deals with investors other than Microsoft, one of the company’s earliest backers with a stake of 27%.

Amazon investing in OpenAI would mark the latest in a series of circular deals in the AI space — major hardware manufacturers and cloud providers strike deals with young AI companies to use their products, while the upstarts commit to using their data centers and chips for training their AI models.

This past March, OpenAI invested $350 million of equity into CoreWeave, which used the funds to buy chips from its backer Nvidia. Those same chips provide compute to OpenAI, which increases CoreWeave’s revenue and in the end makes OpenAI’s stake more valuable. Then in October, OpenAI signed a deal to pick up a 10% stake in AMD and committed to using the chipmaker’s AI GPUs, and also signed a chip usage agreement with Broadcom that month. And in November, the ChatGPT maker signed a $38 billion cloud computing deal with Amazon.

OpenAI and Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

            <h2>Google deepens consumer credit push in India with UPI-linked card</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/google-deepens-consumer-credit-push-in-india-with-upi-linked-card/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google is expanding its push into consumer finance in India with the launch of a UPI-linked credit card, betting on a country of more than 1.4 billion people where fewer than 50 million currently hold a credit card.

On Wednesday, Google entered India’s growing co-branded credit card market with the launch of Flex by Google Pay, partnering with private lender Axis Bank to expand access to credit in the country’s UPI-driven payments ecosystem.

India’s rapid adoption of digital payments through the government-backed Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has transformed how consumers pay but has not translated into broad access to credit. That gap has created an opportunity for technology companies and banks to embed lending into widely used payments apps, helping explain Google’s move into the space.

Flex by Google Pay is issued digitally through the Google Pay app and can be used both online and at physical merchants, the company said. Built on the Indian government-backed RuPay network, the card includes a rewards programme that credits virtual “Stars” on transactions, with each Star worth ₹1. Users can monitor spending and bills within the app, choose to repay balances in full or convert them into installments, and manage security settings such as blocking the card or resetting a PIN.

The launch builds on Google Pay’s broader effort to expand access to credit in India, where it has already partnered with banks and non-bank lenders to offer personal and gold-backed loans through the app. As one of the country’s most widely used UPI platforms, Google Pay offers Axis Bank access to a large, digitally active user base at a time when lenders are increasingly looking to scale credit distribution through technology platforms rather than physical branches.

While Google has started with Axis Bank, it aims to add more issuer partners soon to expand its co-branded credit card offering in India.

Pricing on the card, including interest and applicable charges, will vary by user and credit profile, with no application fee, Google said, adding that charges linked to repayment choices are shown upfront in the app. Processing fees apply to EMI conversions, and late payment charges will be levied in line with the issuing bank’s policy.

India’s credit card market has been expanding rapidly in recent years. The number of outstanding cards has grown at an annual rate of about 14% over the past three years to around 110 million, while transaction volumes and values have risen at close to 30%, per a recent PwC report (PDF). Average annual spending per card has increased from about ₹132,000 (around $1,450) to roughly ₹192,000 (about $2,100), suggesting cards are being used more frequently for routine payments rather than occasional big-ticket purchases.

Despite growth in the number of outstanding cards and credit card spending in India, the expansion has largely been driven by existing users rather than a meaningful increase in the number of cardholders. Google aims to help address that gap by bringing new users into the credit system, particularly those wary of traditional card repayment structures. “It’s the same users getting more and more credit,” said Sharath Bulusu, senior director of product management for Google Pay, adding that flexible repayment options are designed to ease concerns around unpredictable billing for first-time credit users.

“We think we now understand the problem, the space and the user well enough to solve something uniquely for them,” Bulusu told TechCrunch, explaining Google’s timing.

Google’s move comes amid growing competition in India’s co-branded credit card market, where companies including Amazon, as well as Walmart-owned Flipkart and PhonePe, already offer similar products. Consumer internet platforms such as food delivery firms Swiggy and Zomato, along with online travel companies including MakeMyTrip and Yatra, have also entered the space in partnership with banks.

Co-branded credit cards accounted for about 12–15% of India’s total credit cards in the financial year ended 2024 and are projected to capture more than a quarter of the market by volume by 2028, growing at an annual rate of 35–40%, according to a report (PDF) by consultancy firm Redseer.

Alongside the co-branded card launch, Google is also rolling out “Pocket Money,” a feature in the Google Pay app that lets parents give children limited access to digital payments. Built on the recently introduced UPI Circle functionality, the feature lets parents set a monthly spending cap of up to ₹15,000 or approve individual transactions initiated by the child.

Parents receive notifications for each transaction and can view spending history or pause access to the feature through their own Google Pay app, the company said. The move could also help Google broaden Google Pay’s usage and addressable market in India, where it competes closely with Walmart-backed PhonePe among the country’s leading UPI platforms.

Google’s Pocket Money feature follows earlier efforts by Indian fintechs such as FamPay and Junio, which sought to enable children’s digital spending through prepaid cards. However, unlike prepaid instruments, Google uses the UPI Circle framework to let parents retain control of funds until the moment a transaction is made, rather than loading money in advance.

“With UPI Circle, the money stays in the parent’s account until it is spent,” Bulusu said, adding that the approach makes it easier for families already comfortable using Google Pay to introduce children to digital payments. He said the feature reflects a broader bet on familiar payments apps as a way to build financial confidence among younger users as digital payments become more pervasive.

Google is also upgrading the experience for small businesses on Google Pay, allowing customers to rate merchants directly after a transaction, with those reviews syncing to the merchant’s Google Maps listing. The company is also rolling out an AI-powered advertising feature within the Google Pay for Business app that assists merchants in creating and launching ads.

More than 530 million unique users have made at least one payment through Google Pay, while over 23 million small merchants have been onboarded to the platform over the years, Bulusu said. That reach, he added, gives the company confidence it can introduce new financial products to users already comfortable transacting digitally.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">MoEngage, a customer engagement platform used by consumer brands across 75 countries, has announced a $180 million Series F follow-on transaction just over a month after securing $100 million, with a majority of the latest funding providing liquidity to investors and employees through secondary transactions.

In the latest raise, about $123 million was secondary, including a $15 million employee tender that provided liquidity to 259 current and former employees, while the remaining $57 million was raised as primary capital and went into the business. The round was led by ChrysCapital and Dragon Funds, with participation from Schroders Capital and existing investors TR Capital and B Capital. Early backers, including Eight Roads Ventures, Helion Venture Partners, Z47, and Ventureast, sold shares in the secondary transactions.

The deal valued MoEngage at “well over” $900 million post-money, per a person close to the deal, who added that the startup was tracking toward $100 million in annualised recurring revenue this year. MoEngage did not disclose these figures.

MoEngage plans to use the fresh capital to invest further in its Merlin AI suite and expand its use of AI agents to improve decision-making and efficiency for marketing teams, said Raviteja Dodda (pictured above), co-founder and chief executive, in an interview. The startup is also pushing deeper into product and engineering teams by bundling its analytics and transactional messaging tools into a broader offering, a move it expects to lift average contract values and expand its addressable market.

“When you look at customer engagement, it is not necessarily focused on marketing teams. There are product and engineering teams, which also focus on how to make sense of customer behavior and data,” Dodda said.

MoEngage also plans to use part of its fresh capital raise to pursue strategic acquisitions, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, targeting software companies that complement its customer engagement platform or help accelerate its expansion in those markets. It also targets small AI teams to bolster its intelligence-led offerings.

The 11-year-old startup, which has its headquarters in Bengaluru and San Francisco, already gets more than 30% of its revenue from North America, about 25% from Europe and the Middle East, and the remaining 45% from India and Southeast Asia.

MoEngage’s secondary-heavy structure of the raise reflects its late-stage position, allowing early investors and employees to take liquidity without forcing the company into a near-term public listing. This approach gives MoEngage flexibility to choose its next steps based on business priorities rather than investor exit timelines.

“It gives us the opportunity not to have an urgency with regard to going IPO,” Dodda said, adding that the startup still aims to go public in a couple of years, depending on market conditions and other factors.

MoEngage expects to turn earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) positive this quarter and is targeting compound annual growth of about 35% over the next three years, Dodda said.

Bhavin Turakhia, co-founder and chief executive of fintech firm Zeta, a MoEngage customer, said the startup’s analytics and messaging tools have helped it improve onboarding, activation, and cross-sell across key customer journeys.

The secondary component of the round also enabled some early investors to exit fully. Ventureast, which backed MoEngage in 2018, is one of them. The VC firm recorded a roughly 10-times return on its investment on a blended basis, its partner Vinay Rao told TechCrunch.

Rao said that while many global customer engagement companies operate with cost structures geared toward the U.S. market, MoEngage has retained an India-based cost structure, which he said has helped it compete more effectively in the U.S. while scaling the business.

With the latest round, MoEngage has raised about $307 million in primary funding to date. Avendus advised MoEngage for the transaction.

            <h2>Trump Still Needs Susie Wiles</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2025/12/trump-susie-wiles-white-house/685287/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Susie Wiles styles herself as a White House chief of staff who avoids being in the headlines. When cameras come into the Oval Office, she tends to sit just out of frame. She rarely gives interviews. Unlike her predecessors, she seldom tries to curb President Donald Trump’s impulses. She has been lauded in Trump world for instilling a sense of discipline in a chaotic realm, and for providing steady leadership during both Trump’s historic political comeback and the steamrolling start to his second term.

Wiles committed the cardinal sin for a White House staffer—particularly a staffer for this White House—by becoming the news herself with the publication today of a two-part Vanity Fair story in which she offered stunningly forthright assessments of the president and much of his senior staff. Her blunt candor (she said that Trump has an “alcoholic’s personality” and that Elon Musk is “an avowed ketamine” user) was especially surprising because Wiles has presided over a (relatively) on-message White House and is usually so careful herself. The timing is also far from ideal for a West Wing already dealing with a series of GOP electoral defeats, the fallout from Trump repeatedly declaring the nation’s affordability crisis a hoax, and then, yesterday, the president blaming the beloved filmmaker Rob Reiner for his own murder.

Steve Bannon got excommunicated from Trump world—at least for a while—during the president’s first term after his own frank on-the-record exchange with a journalist. But this time, there was no firing, no public meltdown. Instead, Trump shrugged it off. Cabinet members mobilized to defend Wiles. Her job seems safe, at least for now. To many in Trump’s orbit, the White House’s response is a telling reflection of how indispensable she is to the president.

“She was a loyal fighter for him from the moment she came on board,” Donald Trump Jr. posted on social media today. “When things were tough and other supposed friends left my dad like a bunch of rats, Susie stood by his side.”

Still, her words were bracing. Often, senior administration officials talk to reporters on background—offering quotes without their names attached—so that they can speak honestly without deviating from the official White House message or alienating the president. But Wiles spoke on the record, and she appeared to hold little back. She revealed that Trump is indeed hoping to use military strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug boats to force that country’s leader out of power. She said that Vice President J. D. Vance has been “a conspiracy theorist for a decade” and that Russell Vought, the budget director, is “a right-wing absolute zealot.” And she tore into Musk, the tech billionaire who spent months destroying the federal bureaucracy, as “an odd, odd duck.”

Wiles’s cooperation with the author Chris Whipple was no secret. She talked with Whipple 11 times over the past year and sat with him in the chief of staff’s office, which occupies a prized perch in the West Wing just steps from the Oval Office. Several other senior staffers—including Vance, Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, and Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt—also spoke with Whipple and posed for glossy photographs. (Vanity Fair ran several extreme-close-up shots, not all of them flattering.) A few Trump allies told us that they suspected that Wiles had let her guard down with Whipple, who’d written a definitive history on modern White House chiefs of staff, and that the Trump aides had joined the long list of Washington staffers over the years who had succumbed to the lure of a glamorous Vanity Fair photo shoot. Despite Trump’s constant bashing of legacy media, he has spent a lifetime longing for their coverage and approval.

Wiles’s comments were so unexpected—and so, um, honest—that the story sparked frenzied speculation across Washington: Did Wiles think she was off the record? Was she trying to record her version of events for the history books? Was she planning to resign? After the story broke, Wiles called around to her West Wing colleagues in an attempt at damage control, insisting that her quotes had been taken out of context, aides told us. She told The New York Times that she took issue with the quotes attributed to her about Musk’s drug use, saying, “That’s ridiculous” and “I wouldn’t have said it and I wouldn’t know.” But the newspaper reported that Whipple had played the recording of Wiles’s comments confirming that, yes, she had indeed said what he’d written. (Wiles also told Whipple that she didn’t have firsthand knowledge of Musk’s drug use; the tech billionaire had previously admitted to using ketamine.)

Trump, in making his support for Wiles clear, went so far as to confirm in an interview with the New York Post her assessment that he has “an alcoholic’s personality.” Wiles had told Vanity Fair that Trump operates with “a view that there’s nothing he can’t do,” like her own father, the NFL legend Pat Summerall, who had a drinking problem. Trump does not drink and looks down on those who do, but he claimed not to have been bothered by that comparison. If he did imbibe, he said, “I’d have a very good chance of being an alcoholic. I have said that many times about myself, I do. It’s a very possessive personality.” (When Trump first met Wiles, then a Florida political operative, he loved that she was Summerall’s daughter; many of the president’s favorite cultural touchstones date from the 1980s, the decade in which Summerall and John Madden teamed up to become the NFL’s signature TV-broadcast team.)

In a social-media statement posted soon after the story’s publication, Wiles called it “a disingenuously framed hit piece.” Leavitt did as well, writing that “President Trump has no greater or more loyal advisor than Susie.” And then she directed top Trump officials to fan out on social media to defend Wiles; agency heads such as Pete Hegseth, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Doug Burgum were among the nearly two dozen senior officials who posted praise for the chief of staff. The vice president, delivering a speech in Allentown, Pennsylvania, even laughingly acknowledged that he could, in fact, be a conspiracy theorist.

“We have our disagreements,” Vance said of Wiles. “We agree on much more than we disagree, but I’ve never seen her be disloyal to the president of the United States, and that makes you the best White House chief of staff that I think the president could ask for.”

The show of force underscored Wiles’s importance to Trump, who churned through four chiefs of staff during his first term. After Trump left office in disgrace in early 2021, Wiles agreed to coordinate his fundraising efforts and political activity. A year later, she took the helm of his reelection campaign, which, at the time, seemed like a long-shot bid. She, along with the GOP consultant Chris LaCivita, put together a far more professional operation than in any previous Trump campaign, and cut down on the staff infighting and leaking that defined his two earlier runs. She publicly claimed that she never tried to control Trump, but she did, on occasion, get him to back away from outlandish ideas. In a moment famous in Trump’s circles, Wiles stepped into the candidate’s line of sight during a particularly dark and rambling Pennsylvania rally in the campaign’s final week and simply glared at him. The unspoken message: Stop it, and move on. Trump eventually did. The president is deeply fond of her, staffers told us, and once praised her as the “most powerful person in the world” while also, oddly, at times calling her “Susie Trump.”

The circle of power in the West Wing is small—Vance, Miller, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and a few others—and Wiles, in many ways, wields the most influence. She streamlined processes, cracked down on talking to the press, and demanded loyalty from the staff. Wiles largely reduced the chaos, dysfunction, and turnover that permeated Trump’s first term and was able to help secure passage of a sweeping tax bill and a dramatic expansion of executive power.

She revealed to Vanity Fair a number of occasions when Trump ignored her advice. She said that she’d tried to persuade him not to pardon the most violent January 6, 2021, rioters and urged him to hold off on announcing his sweeping tariffs plan. She openly criticized the way Musk slashed international-aid programs. She admitted that some of the prosecutions brought by the Department of Justice directly stemmed from Trump’s desire for revenge. And she said that Trump broke their “loose agreement” to end his “score settling” against political enemies that she’d feared would distract from his agenda after the first 90 days.

Now Wiles herself has become the latest in a string of distractions. The momentum that she helped engineer stalled out this summer when the GOP legislation proved unpopular and Jeffrey Epstein returned to the headlines. Since then, rising prices and a sense that Trump has overreached in expanding his executive power have led to a string of Democratic wins at the ballot box and a fear among Republicans that the president has lost touch with the promises that returned him to the White House. And yesterday, even some in the president’s own party denounced his assertion that Reiner was killed alongside his wife because he was a Trump critic. (Prosecutors have said that the couple’s son, who has spoken openly about his struggles with drug addiction, will be charged with their murder.)

Although Trump announced a speech to the nation tomorrow night that is meant to recap a year of accomplishments, some in the West Wing privately admit that a revised approach to governing—including possible staffing changes—could be on the horizon in the new year. Wiles has said that she told Trump that he needs to start campaigning again. And the vice president volunteered his own idea for a course correction.

“If any of us have learned a lesson from that Vanity Fair article,” Vance said in Pennsylvania, “I hope that the lesson is that we should be giving fewer interviews to mainstream-media outlets.”

For months, President Donald Trump’s crusade against the drug trade has carried the threat of violence: “I think we’re just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country,” he said in October. Yesterday, hours before his administration announced that the United States had conducted three more strikes on alleged drug boats, he designated fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction—a move that could help him further justify the deadly conflict.

Under U.S. law, the definition of a WMD is broad enough to encompass incendiary bombs, rockets, grenades, biological agents, toxins, and other weapons that “can have a large-scale impact on people, property, or infrastructure.” Lawmakers have pushed to classify fentanyl as a WMD in the past; the drug belongs to the category of synthetic opioids, which accounted for roughly 48,000 deaths in the U.S. last year (approximately 60 percent of all overdose deaths). The idea was discussed and eventually abandoned during Trump’s first term and under Joe Biden—but ongoing military activity in the Caribbean and political tensions with Venezuela may have given Trump a reason to reverse course.

On his first day of his second term in office, Trump signed an executive order designating certain drug cartels as terrorist organizations. And since early September, the U.S. has launched 25 known attacks against boats that officials have claimed were carrying illicit drugs; at least 95 people have been killed, and at least one strike may have been a war crime. “Killing cartel members who poison our fellow citizens is the highest and best use of our military,” Vice President J. D. Vance wrote after the strikes began. “Every boat kills 25,000 on average—some people say more,” Trump said in September. “These boats, they’re stacked up with bags of white powder that’s mostly fentanyl and other drugs, too.” Never mind that some of the slain may not have worked for cartels, or that no evidence of fentanyl has been found on these boats: Cocaine and marijuana, not fentanyl, represent the majority of drugs intercepted on the high seas.

Yesterday’s reclassification of fentanyl may not grant the president special power to authorize new military activity, or to unilaterally declare war. But it is a rhetorical escalation that reaffirms this administration’s posture in the armed conflict that’s already under way. Similar to how WMDs were used as a pretext for the Iraq War, Trump is “using that same language, that same authority to be able to do what he wants,” Christopher Sabatini, a senior research fellow at the think tank Chatham House, told me. It’s a “public relations” tactic, according to Regina LaBelle, a professor of addiction policy at Georgetown University. The reclassification may be playing on the public’s understanding of WMDs as a global, existential threat: the kind of thing a country could go to war over.

In apparent contravention of Trump’s campaign promise to extract the country from foreign conflicts, the U.S. has mounted a large-scale military buildup off the coast of Venezuela. An estimated 10,000 troops and 6,000 sailors are now deployed on Navy warships, including an aircraft carrier. Last week, the U.S. seized a Venezuelan oil tanker. Trump said on Friday that he will be “starting” land strikes on drug operations in Latin American countries, Venezuela among them, although he hasn’t said when. And he has explicitly threatened Venezuela’s autocratic leader, President Nicolás Maduro: When asked last week whether he’d push for regime change, Trump said that Maduro’s “days are numbered.”

The new designation for fentanyl was “part of trying to put forward some sort of justification for taking military action,” Paul Poast, a University of Chicago political-science professor, told me. But if that justification was aimed in part at Venezuela, as some experts have suggested, it’s not a very good one. The illicit fentanyl now flooding the U.S. doesn’t come here through Venezuela; most of it is manufactured in Mexico. The fact that Venezuela wasn’t explicitly invoked in yesterday’s announcement could also indicate that the executive order is a “signal that’s being sent to governments and transnational criminals in Latin America to watch out—you could be next,” Sabatini said.

Perhaps a bigger problem with the classification of fentanyl as a WMD is that unlike, say, sarin gas, it is not actually being used as a weapon. Although a chemical can be a WMD, “the vast majority of time when Americans die because of a fentanyl overdose, it was not an intentional outcome,” Jonathan Caulkins, a policy professor at Carnegie Mellon, explained. Fentanyl has been used as a weapon at least once: During the Moscow-theater hostage crisis in 2002, Russian Spetsnaz commandos deployed fentanyl in gas form, killing the Chechan terrorists and many of the hostages too. But just because the drug can be deadly on a large scale doesn’t necessarily mean it is a WMD. “We don’t use that term for cigarettes, bullets, cars,” Caulkins said—each of which also causes tens of thousands of deaths every year.

Although the WMD designation may not have immediate legal implications for Trump’s military powers, it could potentially change how domestic drug cases are prosecuted. The use of a WMD against people or property in the U.S. carries a maximum sentence of life in prison; if someone dies, prosecutors can argue for the death penalty. According to research co-authored by LaBelle, that could impose “a life sentence on any person who uses drugs laced with illicitly manufactured fentanyl, or anyone who gives drugs laced with illicitly manufactured fentanyl to their friend.” As of now, the Trump administration has offered no guidance on how this might play out.

Although the reclassification of fentanyl reinforces Trump’s position against drug trafficking, it may not do much on its own to solve the opioid crisis. Overdose deaths have been declining in the U.S. since before Trump took office, long before the boat strikes began. Many theories have been proposed as to why—but the escalation of armed conflict isn’t one of them.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

Hot autumn night has fallen over Worcester, Massachusetts, over the huge, baked asphalt lot behind the Palladium, the ancestral seat of the Northeast’s heavy-metal kingdom. This is the New England Metal and Hardcore Festival, 25 bands on three stages, 10 unbroken hours of heavy music, and all day, I’ve been watching the pit—the mosh pit, the area close to the stage where inflamed dancers whirl and collide. I’ve been watching it, and skulking around it journalistically, because I am possessed by an idea: What if the pit, this ritualized maelstrom at the heart of the hardcore-metal crowd, could teach us something about how to live together in 2025—about how to be?

            <div id="article-text">When I visited the Snapple website this week, I was served one of the drink brand’s famous fun facts: that a jiffy is an “actual time measurement equaling 1/100th of a second.” Fun indeed! And arguably even a little bit true!

In 2013 in The Atlantic, Adrienne LaFrance courageously exposed that many of Snapple’s bottle-cap facts were false. I wished to determine whether the company had since cleaned up its act; the intervening rebrand from “Real Facts” (scare quotes theirs) to Real Facts (no quotes!) felt like a vow.

Alas, a jiffy was first proposed as the name for the time light takes to travel one centimeter in a vacuum—about 33 trillionths of a second. In electronics, a jiffy might be 1/50 or 1/60 of a second. Only in Linux computing specifically can it be 1/100 of a second, and even then only sometimes.

Oh well. I did not have the heart to check the next statement: “Mangoes can get sunburned.” Whatever, sure. For the foreseeable future, stick with Atlantic Trivia for your fun facts.

And by the way, did you know that the country of Liberia was founded when formerly enslaved Black Americans migrated there en masse in the mid-19th century? It’s the oldest republic in Africa (it declared independence in 1847), and it’s the only state there never colonized or occupied by a European power.

Its first 10 presidents were all born in the United States, and its capital, Monrovia, is the only in the world (other than America’s) to honor an American—namely, President James Monroe.

The leaching is not just iron, it is also other metals, some of them quite dangerous to fish and people. We do not yet know what the effect will be.

What doesn&#39;t get enough attention are sea currents. Aside from the atmosphere, they are the key to the climate, and not something we can really control. Changing sea currents in the Atlantic can cause much colder weather in the lower part of the Northern hemisphere, and also cause more extreme weather patterns. Everything is connected, everything influences everything, and the Earth is a closed ecosphere which we&#39;re all a part of. Since we have passed the point where things could be reversed, things will ju

Can the reaction cause more problems than the phenomenon, as with immune responses to Covid, drug wars, etc.?

It is not a foregone conclusion that the die is cast, but the future&#39;s prospects are dimming.

It appeared for the longest time that humanity might rise above its base instinct for self fulfillment: perhaps rejecting tribalism for the species greater good.

Worst case scenario? Whatever is coming won&#39;t get us all. We&#39;re a resilient creature, and may survive in the numbers necessary to muck this all up again.

Why can&#39;t we repopulate the south pole with polar bears to save them?

Russia is basically counting on an ice free Arctic within our lifetimes.

We really should recognize Denmark&#39;s claim before shit gets explodey.

Trying to increase penalties is incredibly stupid. That only makes things worse.  Let me be clear There is NO way to stop this kind of breach from happening again.

The problem is that morons believe they will never be robbed.  There is no one with perfect security.  The more valuable your data, the more likely it WILL be broken into.  Every security professional or database designer (AND their bosses) should be required to sign a statement that says this every year.

AI will only make it worse as bad actors /

Increasing penalties will just create more people who had no active ability to change stuff, but are left to hang out to dry as a sacrifice.  Stuff will still go on.

Even worse, harsher penalties will lead to more coverups and less disclosure.

Coupang voluntarily reported the breach. That should be encouraged.

The only solution is to prevent companies from collecting and maintaining this level of information.

Yes, this has been said by many people, in many countries over many decades. In some cases this sensative data is being kept years after a customer ceases business.

In this case I shake my head at the laziness of the security team, as credential management in Sec/Sys/Dev/Ops/CM is pretty standard, but does need the company culture that it matters, or one ends up with main admin password pairs being &quot;admin/

So are you saying that no business should be allowed to have more than one million customers? If you&#39;re operating an online retailer, you can&#39;t really avoid storing the name, address, and contact details for each customer, and a password for them to log in - otherwise, how do they log in, and get a parcel delivered? And if you have 34 million customers, you have 34 million people&#39;s personal data.

Things like building-access-codes don&#39;t need to be kept on a &quot;live&quot; database.  If a customer places an order, the key-access-code for that specific customer can be copied from nearline storage to &quot;live&quot; storage well before delivery, then deleted after delivery is complete.

This way, if the &quot;live&quot; database is completely compromised, only the relatively-few customers who have pending or very-recently-delivered items will have their key-access-code data stolen.

A similar principle can apply to the customer&#39;s con

The problem in this case was a stolen credential that was left usable for an extended period of time.  Near-line storage alone would&#39;ve only been a small &quot;bump in the road&quot; for this particular leak, assuming the person knew enough to ask for all the data to be loaded from near-line storage before stealing it.

>> if the bad actor had unlimited employee access

There&#39;s no reason for any employee to have unlimited access. That was the point. Everyone should be limited and encapsulated to the work at hand.

The last time I left a company, I had a high (but not unlimited) level of access there.  On leaving, I had to return my access card, my tamagotchi (the device which gave me the 6-digit code I needed to log in, the code changed every 10 or 12 seconds) and my laptop.  I did forward my emails and phone to my private account, partially so I could tell people who asked that I&#39;d left and partially to see how long it took them to delete them (it was almost exactly 3 months).Why did Coupang not have similar securit

Discussions of race are everywhere and nowhere in 2025. On one hand, President Donald Trump is openly insulting Somali immigrants, describing entire nations as “shithole” countries, and insisting that the most persecuted class of humans are white South Africans. On the other, none of this is actually registering as anything other than Trump being Trump, and so when the Supreme Court agrees to revisit a foundational doctrine like birthright citizenship, too many of us shrug it off. On this week’s Amicus podcast, Dahlia Lithwick spoke to civil rights attorney Sherrilyn Ifill about her recent Substack, “Is It Too Late,” in which she argued that it is not too late to save American ideals of democracy and equality, but it is assuredly too late to remain indifferent. Part of that conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity below.

Dahlia Lithwick: There is a very human propensity, especially in times of crisis, to normalize and rationalize and temporize. We comfort the comfortable, and we look for hope in norms and in institutions and in rationality. So many people have this perpetual hope that something’s going to come along and life is going to go back to 2010 or 2012. This hope says that with enough time, and even if it’s uncomfortable right now, someone else is going to come along, or some institution is going to come along, and put us in the DeLorean and we’re all going to go back. Can you talk about the ways in which American exceptionalism and the American normalization bias and the profound—just to talk about the Supreme Court as an example—American trust in institutions can get us to the point where it’s not that we don’t see the fire, we can’t even smell the smoke. You write, “everyone should be on full alert,” but you and I both know that not only are people not on full alert, I’m not even sure what could put them on full alert.

Sherrilyn Ifill: I think things are unraveling pretty fast and people will get on full alert. The only question is, when they get on full alert, will it be too late? That’s why I’m saying: “You might want to do that now.” I’ve been guilty of this as well: not ringing the alarm bell with sufficient urgency. This is something lawyers do all the time, because we’re used to finding the little interstices and figuring out how to move within these small spaces so that we can get where we want to go and so that we can make change. I was trained in that tradition—you find a way, you find a pathway, and all of that presumes the legitimacy of the framework.

I’m not a nihilist. I actually always do have hope. And I think one of the reasons I feel so clear, in this moment, is that I have no desire to return to 2010. I have no desire to return to the ’80s. I’ve been a civil rights lawyer for 35 years. The ’80s were a nightmare.

What are we returning to? I don’t have a dream time calling out to me. People will say, “When Obama was president.” I mean, really? Because most of the videos you’ve seen of police killing unarmed black men, most of that was in the second Obama administration. That was Eric Garner. That was Ferguson. That was Walter Scott running in that park. So if you’ve been doing the work that I’ve been doing, you’re always invested in the future.

I have excitement and hope in this time because as this whole thing begins to unravel, we have the opportunity to create something new. This is where the 14th Amendment is so helpful for me, because it’s one of the biggest moments of creating something absolutely new in this country, so I use it as inspiration, not only its very words and provisions and guarantees, but also to remind me that we have the right and the obligation to refound our country when it goes astray. That’s what those young kids in college during the Civil Rights Movement did. They did a version of refounding. So I don’t want to suggest that I don’t feel hope for the future. I do feel quite hopeful. But I also feel that pretending that all we need to do is just make some incremental changes to get us back to 2010 interferes with our ability to do that reset. What has been laid bare is that 2010 ain’t it.

We have some serious structural problems. As a litigator, I don’t know how anyone can purport to pretend that they know what the rules are at the Supreme Court anymore. We have a Supreme Court that not only has the power to say what the law is, pursuant to Chief Justice John Marshall and Marbury v. Madison, but they’ve now decided that they have the power to say what the facts are. That has never been part of our system of adjudication and litigation. Assigning factual findings to the Supreme Court? No, that is for the trial courts, for district courts. But we are now seeing a majority on the Supreme Court that regularly swats away the findings of the district court. That is the power of the district court. They are closest to the conflict. They can evaluate the credibility of the witnesses. They’re seeing the exhibits, the documents, all of it. It’s playing out in real time. It’s not theoretical for them. And now we have a Supreme Court that months later will swat away a two-week trial and the findings of fact over 160 pages by a district court. That’s real. That is real and structural. And it should not be dependent on the personnel of the court.

Last week was a startling and arresting moment for me in terms of the Trump v. Slaughter arguments about Humphrey’s Executor. Put aside originalism, that’s gone, there’s not even a pretense of text and history. But the idea that, “Well, you know, since agencies don’t look like they did 100 years ago, I guess we don’t have to think about them the same way.” It is so strange to see serious people pretending to be doing serious work in this serious place, when all pretense of intellectual seriousness has fallen away. Instead you have feelingsball and “How does executive power make me feel today?” There is no commitment to the principles that were laid out and in which people like you and I as institutionalists took a lot of solace. Part of what is so challenging about this moment is that by the time most Americans get around to the point that they can say the sentence “Amy Coney Barrett’s not going to save us,” or “Brett Kavanaugh is not going to save us,” it’s all going to be too late. It seems we are so committed to the principle that they are originalists, that they are textualists, that they care about a precedent, and so committed to the proposition that the U.S. Supreme Court is going to save us in the end.

The irony of it is that the U.S. Supreme Court got this reputation and the confidence of the American public after Brown. And that’s why, as much as this court is hollowing out Brown, they’ll never overturn it because that is how they became—how they got the reputation, certainly among Black people, for many decades, of being the people who come to your rescue. The shift started to happen with the Burger court in the 1980s.

So many of those who have the greatest platforms are still speaking and behaving in a way that suggests that this is something easily solved, or this is just how it goes, or we can just do this for a couple of years. But if you are watching the videos of people being chased by masked figures who claim to be federal agents, but we don’t know, and who are kidnapping people and throwing them in vans and doing this to American citizens and holding them? The danger is just there. It  is apparent. The more we treat it as though this is just Trumpism, this is Trump 2.0—all the little things that we say to tamp down the alarm are really profoundly problematic.

Many of those who have the greatest microphones frankly don’t know very much about race or racism or the history of it in this country. They want to be experts, so they play to their expertise. These are also the people who have said, “We talk about race too much. We talk about identity too much. We’re scaring people off with that. Everything’s not race.” We’ve made it seem illegitimate to talk about racism. It’s almost like you’re being soft, you’re being anti-intellectual, you’re not doing the rigorous work of politics if you’re talking about race.

In fact, race is threaded through every institutional structure of this country. And we have someone who is exploiting it every day. It’s not that I’m talking about race, it’s that he just stood up the other day and said, We want the Danes, the Swedes, and the Norwegians. We don’t want people from shithole countries. We’re being told that it’s illegitimate to keep talking about race when we’re confronting a tsunami of a movement that uses racism as its stalking horse. It is the lure that brought so many people into this movement. It’s important to help people understand that that’s the bait they’re using. The bait that says, “Yeah, I’m not sure that those people are qualified,” right? Yeah, all of that stuff that just lives in this country, that’s being used as the bait for this smash-and-grab, for this power grab. And I don’t think we’re doing this country any favors by steering people away from that realization.

In A24’s Civil War, a journalist, played by Wagner Moura, pleads with the militiaman, played by Jesse Plemons, who has detained him and his colleagues at gunpoint. “We’re American.” The militiaman replies, “What kind of American?” In a flood of executive orders and proposed bills, the GOP asks U.S. citizens the same question.

This month, Bernie Moreno, a Senate Republican from Ohio, introduced the Exclusive Citizenship Act of 2025, legislation that would compel any U.S. citizen with a second citizenship to choose between the two. Though Moreno’s bill is likely to face heavy resistance due to 14th Amendment protections, it’s a reminder for people like my family and me: Not all U.S. citizenships are created equal.

I was born and raised in the U.S. I’m a U.S. citizen, but I’m also a Spanish citizen through my parents, who were both Spanish citizens when I was born. I never really thought much about my Spanish citizenship. More than anything, I’m American. I grew up watching The Wonder Years, building model planes with my dad, and playing basketball. Plus, my English is a lot stronger than my Spanish. But the more this administration and its acolytes insist I choose, the more fiercely I cling to my heritage.

This isn’t the first time this year that Republicans have reminded me of my family’s second-tier citizenship. Though foiled by the courts so far, this administration has made a concerted effort to end birthright citizenship—the way I became a U.S. citizen—an effort that has made its way back to the Supreme Court. The administration’s plan for birthright citizenship wouldn’t affect me directly, as it wouldn’t be—at least in its current version—retroactive. But it underscores a fundamental truth of this movement’s worldview: How one becomes a U.S. citizen affects the perceived value of said citizenship, which effectively creates tiers of citizenship. (Incidentally, historians and legal scholars consistently cite tiered citizenship as a hallmark of fascist states.)

The Department of Justice has prioritized denaturalization more broadly, as outlined in a June memo. I worry about the implications for people I love, like my wife, my mom, and my sister, all of whom are naturalized U.S. citizens. On paper, I shouldn’t worry. They’re all law-abiding people, and this directive ostensibly aims to ferret out terrorists and criminals.

That’s what this administration said about Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s mission, but the agency’s egregious flouting of due process tells a starkly different story. According to ICE’s own numbers, the majority of migrants in detention have no criminal convictions.

In other words, I don’t trust this administration and its devotees when they say they’re only going after the “bad guys.” It’s clear they think the bad guys are anyone with the temerity to speak another language or identify with another culture. A few days after Moreno introduced this piece of legislation, Donald Trump called Somali immigrants “garbage.”

This White House is hell-bent on upholding an English-speaking monoculture, hence the designation of English as the official language of the United States back in March. There’s no room for another language or another culture. If the bill were to pass, I wonder if special dispensations would be made for Melania Trump and Barron Trump, both of whom are dual citizens.

It all stems from a zero-sum philosophy, to which the author of this proposed legislation subscribes. Born in Colombia and naturalized at 18 years old, Moreno insists: “It’s all or nothing. It’s time to end dual citizenship for good.” Therein lies the crux of our differences: Moreno believes that the only way to be a “true” American is to slough off your heritage and pledge your exclusive loyalty, whereas I, like many others, believe that the U.S. is at its best when it activates all participating cultures—and at its worst when it attempts to homogenize them.

I grew up in a mixed-status household. My parents and my sister lacked legal status when I was growing up. As a child, I was oblivious to their fears and the dangers we faced as a family. Immigration hard-liners would argue that they should’ve followed the law and that I should never have become a U.S. citizen. Well, birthright citizenship is enshrined by the 14th Amendment and the General Amnesty of 1986, passed by the Reagan administration, which both say otherwise. You don’t have to like existing immigration laws. You can work to change or overturn them, but then you have no choice but to admit that this fight isn’t about following existing law.

Immigration hard-liners also like to say that the immigrants should’ve come here the proverbial “right way.” What they don’t realize is that many immigrants do come here the so-called right way. They may live in the United States legally for many years with temporary protections, for so long that they lay down roots, buy homes, and raise children, only to have those protections revoked overnight. Then, suddenly, having never committed a crime, they’re called criminals, subject to government-sanctioned abduction.

That’s the funny thing about rules in this country: They have a nasty habit of suddenly turning on you—especially when, in Republicans’ eyes, you’re not the right kind of American.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">MPs have blasted the UK government for complacency over surging mobile thefts after a &quot;long-delayed&quot; summit on the issue disappeared into the New Year.

In a letter to Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, Dame Chi Onwurah, chair of the Science, Innovation and Technology Committee, raised the prospect of families unwrapping new phones on Christmas Day – then being too scared to leave the house thanks to inaction from phone vendors and the government.

&quot;While people may be worried about keeping their new possessions safe from theft on Britain&#39;s streets, it seems that the government is not nearly as concerned about the risks to property and privacy,&quot; she thundered.

A statement from the committee added that six months after it heard from experts, tech companies, and the Metropolitan Police about technological solutions to deter phone theft, &quot;the government has still failed to act.&quot;

Onwurah had followed the evidence session with an October letter to the government, arguing &quot;phone theft can be designed out using technical solutions that make stolen phones less valuable.&quot; She also said the government needs to adopt a more robust stance on &quot;spiraling phone theft and hold its much-delayed follow-up phone theft summit.&quot;

Tech companies and the government, she claimed, had shown little urge to implement measures such as cloud-based blocking or IMEI-linked device locks.

Today, the committee revealed it had received a &quot;holding reply&quot; from the government in November. This vaguely said meetings with police and industry &quot;were taking place in the coming weeks.&quot;

This would &quot;include discussions on the way tech companies, the Met Police, the Mayor&#39;s Office for Policing and Crime, and government can each maximize their impact on this issue. I will write again to update you on progress shortly.&quot;

The committee said: &quot;This holding response offered no answers, commitment to action, or clarity on when the summit will take place, or why it had been delayed for so long.&quot;

This smacked of complacency, Onwurah added, and &quot;without action, theft could keep surging, and Christmas gifts remain at risk.&quot;

This raises a bleak alternative of family members having to do jigsaws, play charades, or even talk to each other, presumably.

Back in June, the Met Police&#39;s chief digital data and technology officer told the committee that 80,000 smartphones were reported as stolen in London alone in 2024, up from 64,000 in 2023.

He said that blocking at the IMEI level could put a big dent in the international trade since most stolen handsets end up abroad. But Apple argued this would only create other attack vectors, while Google said its relationship with customers was through the cloud, not devices. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Most students taking school and college GCSE, A-level, and AS-level exams in England will continue to use pen and paper, according to proposals from the sector&#39;s regulator for a very limited expansion of screen-based assessments.

The Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual) is consulting on plans that will require exam boards to stick to paper-based exams for the 13 most taken GCSEs as well as A-level mathematics for the foreseeable future.

It plans to allow each of its four exam boards to submit proposals for just two further subject-based specifications for screen-based assessments. Where permitted, on-screen assessments must use substantially different questions to paper equivalents and students will not be allowed to use their own devices for taking exams.

Exam boards already offer on-screen assessments for GCSE and A-level computer science, as well as for GCSEs in geology and food preparation and nutrition. Ofqual says these may continue, as well as assessments for British Sign Language and music technology, although they will need to follow any new rules.

Exam boards will also be able to continue offering digital assessments to disabled students to meet their legal requirements to provide reasonable adjustments for accessibility needs.

&quot;We&#39;re consulting on a carefully balanced approach to on-screen assessment,&quot; Jo Handford, Ofqual&#39;s associate director for strategic projects and innovation, wrote in a blog post aimed at schools and colleges.

&quot;One that protects the integrity of qualifications you and your students work so hard for, while enabling measured innovation where the evidence supports it.&quot;

Handford said that reasons for caution include the variability of the quality of IT infrastructure in schools and colleges, the operational demands of on-screen assessment, and limited evidence of it having any benefits.

&quot;On-screen assessment introduces new challenges around cybersecurity, technical failures during exams, and maintaining standards across different modes,&quot; she wrote. &quot;Our controlled approach ensures these risks are carefully managed.&quot;

&quot;The rigor and value of qualifications won&#39;t be compromised. And traditional pen and paper assessment will remain the primary mode for most exams,&quot; she added.

Most UK universities make some use of digital exams after many introduced these during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In a paper published earlier this year [PDF], Swansea University academics Philip Newton and Michael Draper found that 93 of 119 universities that responded to their Freedom of Information requests use remote online exams for &quot;summative&quot; assessments of how much students have learned.

Only 23 of 90 universities used remote invigilation technology, such as locking browsers or monitoring activity, during these exams. Newton and Draper said this raised questions over the validity of unsupervised online assessments, particularly given the rise of generative artificial intelligence services.

Meanwhile, Estonia, which last year launched an e-divorce service as the final part of its state digitization program, is planning to move away from paper-based exams for middle school graduation, although it has pushed this back from 2024 to 2027 due to IT glitches. ®

            <h2>UK plans right for flat owners to demand gigabit broadband</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/17/flat_leaseholder_access_to_gigabit/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The UK government is consulting on plans to give the owners of 1.2 million flats in England and Wales a formal right to request gigabit-capable broadband.

Flat owners would gain the right through proposed changes to the Electronic Communications Code that would make it easier for service providers to install network infrastructure when a building&#39;s owners are unknown or unresponsive, according to the consultation published by the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT).

DSIT proposes that leaseholders of flats gain a formal right to request a connection of at least one gigabit per second (Gbps), which the building&#39;s freehold owners could not reasonably refuse. Under the plans, flat owners would make the formal requests, meaning that renters would have to ask their landlords, although the consultation asks whether the right should be extended to renters as well.

Using data from May 2025, DSIT estimates that 1.2 million flats in England and Wales do not have access to gigabit-capable internet services, although in some cases it admits this may be due to services not being commercially viable.

It reckons that 90.8 percent of all residential properties in urban and suburban areas have access to 1 Gbps services. However, this falls to 80.7 percent for flats.

&quot;These proposed measures would help deliver better connectivity for properties that face additional challenges to gigabit broadband rollout, and will ensure all UK families can benefit from the digital age,&quot; said telecoms minister Liz Lloyd.

The government wants at least 99 percent of premises to have access to broadband capable of 1 Gbps by 2032.

The Reg recently spoke to a reader living in a block of flats who is unable to access high-speed fiber broadband because potential supplier CityFibre said it did not have permission from the landlord to install kit in his building.

Openreach, the unit of telco BT that undertakes infrastructure work for more than 600 internet service providers, said it was seeking a change in the law.

Openreach welcomed DSIT&#39;s announcement. &quot;It&#39;s something we&#39;ve long campaigned for to make sure no one&#39;s left behind,&quot; it said in a statement to The Reg.

&quot;We believe that everyone should have access to the latest broadband technology and it&#39;s a zero-cost move that will support growth in the economy. We&#39;ll respond to the consultation and urge the government to review responses and introduce legislation rapidly to benefit homes and businesses across the UK.&quot;

However, internet access research website Thinkbroadband, said it was concerned the planned legislation will focus specifically on 1 Gbps as requirements change over time, and it is important for consumers to have choice rather than a single provider.

Further, it said problems are not limited to flats as houses can have connections blocked by landowners, such as of private roads.

The consultation, which includes a question on whether changes should also apply to commercial properties or houses, closes on February 16. ®

            <div id="article-text">California’s DMV has ordered Tesla to rename ‘Autopilot’ or face a sales suspension in the state.

California’s DMV has ordered Tesla to rename ‘Autopilot’ or face a sales suspension in the state.

Tesla could be temporarily locked out of its biggest US market if it doesn’t change deceptive marketing that exaggerates the self-driving capabilities of its cars, the California Department of Motor Vehicles warned on Tuesday, adopting the ruling of an administrative law judge.

The DMV said Tesla’s use of terms like “Autopilot” and “Full Self-Driving” to describe its advanced driver assist systems “is misleading and violates state law.” The agency ordered a 30-day suspension of Tesla’s license to sell cars in the state if Tesla does not fix marketing concerns surrounding the term “Autopilot” within a 60-day window.

However, the DMV decided not to impose a suspension on Tesla’s manufacturing license that had been recommended by the judge, avoiding a costly shutdown during a difficult time for the electric vehicle industry as it faces falling demand following the death of EV tax credits.

Compliance could require a rebrand of Tesla’s driver assistance software; the company currently uses the Autopilot and Full Self-Driving names for the products, which, unlike technology from robotaxi firms like Waymo, are not fully autonomous and require full driver attention at all times.

The decision comes after the DMV asked an administrative judge to consider Tesla’s marketing practices and weigh if a suspension of its licenses was justified. The agency said Tesla has made false and misleading statements about its self-driving systems for years, implying that they can operate autonomously when at no point have they been able to. Tesla has rejected the suggestion it misleads customers and insists it has always made it clear drivers can’t fully rely on the cars to drive themselves.

            <div id="article-text">﻿“He knew it would be horrifying to others.”

﻿“He knew it would be horrifying to others.”

Elon Musk, a billionaire who decimated the United States federal workforce using the Department of Government Efficiency, is not remembered fondly by the most powerful woman in Washington: Susie Wiles, White House Chief of Staff and the gatekeeper to President Donald Trump.

In several on-the-record interviews with Vanity Fair’s Chris Whipple conducted over the past year, Wiles, who had corralled the notoriously backstabby Trump political operation into coherence and discipline, described Musk as a “complete solo actor” who had plunged the Trump administration into several unnecessary crises — including the shuttering of USAID, the United States Agency for International Development, which Musk had cut during his DOGE tenure.

“I was initially aghast,” Wiles told Whipple. “Because I think anybody that pays attention to government and has ever paid attention to USAID believed, as I did, that they do very good work.” This week, The Center for Global Development published a report estimating that USAID humanitarian aid cuts could contribute to the deaths of 500,000 to 700,000 individuals a year.

It says a lot about the chaotic 2025 news cycle that the DOGE saga was a minor mention in the wide-ranging, two-part feature which included interviews with Trump’s inner circle, and real-time conversations in the middle of major political crises like the botched release of the Jeffrey Epstein files. But Wiles’s on-the-record assessment of Musk can be viewed as how the administration remembers the Tesla billionaire’s impact — or perhaps damage — to their political agenda:

In his executive order freezing foreign aid, Trump had decreed that lifesaving programs should be spared. Instead, they were shuttered. “When Elon said, ‘We’re doing this,’ he was already into it,” said Wiles. “And that’s probably because he knew it would be horrifying to others. But he decided that it was a better approach to shut it down, fire everybody, shut them out, and then go rebuild. Not the way I would do it.”

According to Wiles, the only immediate patch was to jam USAID into the State Department under Secretary of State Marco Rubio, but even then Musk was obstructive:

Wiles says she called Musk on the carpet. “You can’t just lock people out of their offices,” she recalls telling him. At first, Wiles didn’t grasp the effect that slashing USAID programs would have on humanitarian aid. “I didn’t know a lot about the extent of their grant making.” But with immunizations halted in Africa, lives would be lost. Soon she was getting frantic calls from relief agency heads and former government officials with a dire message: Thousands of lives were in the balance.

Wiles continued: “So Marco is on his way to Panama. We call him and say, ‘You’re Senate-confirmed. You’re going to have to be the custodian, essentially, of [USAID].’ ‘Okay,’ he says.” But Musk forged ahead—all throttle, no brake. “Elon’s attitude is you have to get it done fast. If you’re an incrementalist, you just won’t get your rocket to the moon,” Wiles said. “And so with that attitude, you’re going to break some china. But no rational person could think the USAID process was a good one. Nobody.”

It’s rare for a White House chief of staff to be this open and candid while working for the President, even to a journalist who’s written a book about former chiefs of staff. But when it comes to Musk, Wiles seemed willing to be frank. “The challenge with Elon is keeping up with him,” she told Whipple in an interview conducted while Musk was still working in the Trump administration. “He’s an avowed ketamine [user]. And he sleeps in a sleeping bag in the EOB [Executive Office Building] in the daytime. And he’s an odd, odd duck, as I think geniuses are. You know, it’s not helpful, but he is his own person.”

Whipple recounts later: “When I asked her what she thought of Musk reposting a tweet about public sector workers killing millions under Hitler, Stalin, and Mao, she replied: ‘I think that’s when he’s microdosing.’ (She says she doesn’t have first-hand knowledge.)”

‘Select assets’ of the home arcade machine company are being acquired by another toy brand.

Days after a rumor circulated that home arcade machine maker Arcade1Up would be shutting down, the company has finally shared a statement about its future. “Select assets” from Arcade1Up have been acquired by toy company Basic Fun, and although Arcade1Up isn’t dead, what’s next for the brand is still a little murky.

Last week, a screenshot of an email appearing to be sent from an Arcade1Up staffer painted a grim picture. As stated in the email, which you can see on Reddit:

Arcade1Up is closing operations. For the majority of us, our last day is this coming Friday.

I cannot speak to the future of the brand, it is not my place to share what might be next and whom will be in charge of it.

I do not know the plans for the arcade systems or the Infinity Tables. I believe they will continue to operate as they currently do, but I do not know for certain.

At the time, I tried contacting Arcade1Up for comment, but didn’t hear back.

On Tuesday, however, Arcade1Up and Basic Fun posted their statement about the deal:

We want to address a few questions we’ve seen circulating about the Arcade1Up product lines.

Basic Fun! has acquired select assets of Arcade1Up and intends to support, to the best of our ability, the home arcade category and existing Arcade1Up products currently in the market.

This asset acquisition reflects our ongoing commitment to expanding our presence in the home arcade space, supporting current Arcade1up titles and products alongside our own existing arcade offerings.

We’ll have more to share in the new year and look forward to continuing to serve the arcade fan community. Game on!

Arcade1Up and Basic Fun didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment asking for additional clarification about the deal and planned support for Arcade1Up products.

            <h2>This Nobel Prize–winning chemist dreams of making water from thin air</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/17/1129259/omar-yaghi-chemist-nobel-prize-crystals-water-air/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Omar Yaghi was a quiet child, diligent, unlikely to roughhouse with his nine siblings. So when he was old enough, his parents tasked him with one of the family’s most vital chores: fetching water. Like most homes in his Palestinian neighborhood in Amman, Jordan, the Yaghis’ had no electricity or running water. At least once every two weeks, the city switched on local taps for a few hours so residents could fill their tanks. Young Omar helped top up the family supply. Decades later, he says he can’t remember once showing up late. The fear of leaving his parents, seven brothers, and two sisters parched kept him punctual.

Yaghi proved so dependable that his father put him in charge of monitoring how much the cattle destined for the family butcher shop ate and drank. The best-­quality cuts came from well-fed, hydrated animals—a challenge given that they were raised in arid desert.

Specially designed materials called metal-organic frameworks can pull water from the air like a sponge—and then give it back.

But at 10 years old, Yaghi learned of a different occupation. Hoping to avoid a rambunctious crowd at recess, he found the library doors in his school unbolted and sneaked in. Thumbing through a chemistry textbook, he saw an image he didn’t understand: little balls connected by sticks in fascinating shapes. Molecules. The building blocks of everything.

“I didn’t know what they were, but it captivated my attention,” Yaghi says. “I kept trying to figure out what they might be.”

That’s how he discovered chemistry—or maybe how chemistry discovered him. After coming to the United States and, eventually, a postdoctoral program at Harvard University, Yaghi devoted his career to finding ways to make entirely new and fascinating shapes for those little sticks and balls. In October 2025, he was one of three scientists who won a Nobel Prize in chemistry for identifying metal-­organic frameworks, or MOFs—metal ions tethered to organic molecules that form repeating structural landscapes. Today that work is the basis for a new project that sounds like science fiction, or a miracle: conjuring water out of thin air.

When he first started working with MOFs, Yaghi thought they might be able to absorb climate-damaging carbon dioxide—or maybe hold hydrogen molecules, solving the thorny problem of storing that climate-friendly but hard-to-contain fuel. But then, in 2014, Yaghi’s team of researchers at UC Berkeley had an epiphany. The tiny pores in MOFs could be designed so the material would pull water molecules from the air around them, like a sponge—and then, with just a little heat, give back that water as if squeezed dry. Just one gram of a water-absorbing MOF has an internal surface area of roughly 7,000 square meters.

Yaghi wasn’t the first to try to pull potable water from the atmosphere. But his method could do it at lower levels of humidity than rivals—potentially shaking up a tiny, nascent industry that could be critical to humanity in the thirsty decades to come. Now the company he founded, called Atoco, is racing to demonstrate a pair of machines that Yaghi believes could produce clean, fresh, drinkable water virtually anywhere on Earth, without even hooking up to an energy supply.

That’s the goal Yaghi has been working toward for more than a decade now, with the rigid determination that he learned while doing chores in his father’s butcher shop.

“It was in that shop where I learned how to perfect things, how to have a work ethic,” he says. “I learned that a job is not done until it is well done. Don’t start a job unless you can finish it.”

Most of Earth is covered in water, but just 3% of it is fresh, with no salt—the kind of water all terrestrial living things need. Today, desalination plants that take the salt out of seawater provide the bulk of potable water in technologically advanced desert nations like Israel and the United Arab Emirates, but at a high cost. Desalination facilities either heat water to distill out the drinkable stuff or filter it with membranes the salt doesn’t pass through; both methods require a lot of energy and leave behind concentrated brine. Typically desal pumps send that brine back into the ocean, with devastating ecological effects.

I was talking to Atoco executives about carbon dioxide capture earlier this year when they mentioned the possibility of harvesting water from the atmosphere. Of course my mind immediately jumped to Star Wars, and Luke Skywalker working on his family’s moisture farm, using “vaporators” to pull water from the atmosphere of the arid planet Tatooine. (Other sci-fi fans’ minds might go to Dune, and the water-gathering technology of the Fremen.) Could this possibly be real?

It turns out people have been doing it for millennia. Archaeological evidence of water harvesting from fog dates back as far as 5000 BCE. The ancient Greeks harvested dew, and 500 years ago so did the Inca, using mesh nets and buckets under trees.

Today, harvesting water from the air is a business already worth billions of dollars, say industry analysts—and it’s on track to be worth billions more in the next five years. In part that’s because typical sources of fresh water are in crisis. Less snowfall in mountains during hotter winters means less meltwater in the spring, which means less water downstream. Droughts regularly break records. Rising seas seep into underground aquifers, already drained by farming and sprawling cities. Aging septic tanks leach bacteria into water, and cancer-causing “forever chemicals” are creating what the US Government Accountability Office last year said “may be the biggest water problem since lead.” That doesn’t even get to the emerging catastrophe from microplastics.

So lots of places are turning to atmospheric water harvesting. Watergen, an Israel-based company working on the tech, initially planned on deploying in the arid, poorer parts of the world. Instead, buyers in Europe and the United States have approached the company as a way to ensure a clean supply of water. And one of Watergen’s biggest markets is the wealthy United Arab Emirates. “When you say ‘water crisis,’ it’s not just the lack of water—it’s access to good-quality water,” says Anna Chernyavsky, Watergen’s vice president of marketing.

In other words, the technology “has evolved from lab prototypes to robust, field-deployable systems,” says Guihua Yu, a mechanical engineer at the University of Texas at Austin. “There is still room to improve productivity and energy efficiency in the whole-system level, but so much progress has been steady and encouraging.”

MOFs are just the latest approach to the idea. The first generation of commercial tech depended on compressors and refrigerant chemicals—large-scale versions of the machine that keeps food cold and fresh in your kitchen. Both use electricity and a clot of pipes and exchangers to make cold by phase-shifting a chemical from gas to liquid and back; refrigerators try to limit condensation, and water generators basically try to enhance it.

That’s how Watergen’s tech works: using a compressor and a heat exchanger to wring water from air at humidity levels as low as 20%—Death Valley in the spring. “We’re talking about deserts,” Chernyavsky says. “Below 20%, you get nosebleeds.”

That still might not be good enough. “Refrigeration works pretty well when you are above a certain relative humidity,” says Sameer Rao, a mechanical engineer at the University of Utah who researches atmospheric water harvesting. “As the environment dries out, you go to lower relative humidities, and it becomes harder and harder. In some cases, it’s impossible for refrigeration-based systems to really work.”

So a second wave of technology has found a market. Companies like Source Global use desiccants—substances that absorb moisture from the air, like the silica packets found in vitamin bottles—to pull in moisture and then release it when heated. In theory, the benefit of desiccant-­based tech is that it could absorb water at lower humidity levels, and it uses less energy on the front end since it isn’t running a condenser system. Source Global claims its off-grid, solar-powered system is deployed in dozens of countries.

But both technologies still require a lot of energy, either to run the heat exchangers or to generate sufficient heat to release water from the desiccants. MOFs, Yaghi hopes, do not. Now Atoco is trying to prove it. Instead of using heat exchangers to bring the air temperature to dew point or desiccants to attract water from the atmosphere, a system can rely on specially designed MOFs to attract water molecules. Atoco’s prototype version uses an MOF that looks like baby powder, stuck to a surface like glass. The pores in the MOF naturally draw in water molecules but remain open, making it theoretically easy to discharge the water with no more heat than what comes from direct sunlight. Atoco’s industrial-scale design uses electricity to speed up the process, but the company is working on a second design that can operate completely off grid, without any energy input.

Yaghi’s Atoco isn’t the only contender seeking to use MOFs for water harvesting. A competitor, AirJoule, has introduced MOF-based atmospheric water generators in Texas and the UAE and is working with researchers at Arizona State University, planning to deploy more units in the coming months. The company started out trying to build more efficient air-­conditioning for electric buses operating on hot, humid city streets. But then founder Matt Jore heard about US government efforts to harvest water from air—and pivoted. The startup’s stock price has been a bit of a roller-­coaster, but Jore says the sheer size of the market should keep him in business. Take Maricopa County, encompassing Phoenix and its environs—it uses 1.2 billion gallons of water from its shrinking aquifer every day, and another 874 million gallons from surface sources like rivers.

“So, a couple of billion gallons a day, right?” Jore tells me. “You know how much influx is in the atmosphere every day? Twenty-five billion gallons.”

“Just the greater Phoenix area gets influx of about 25 billion gallons of water in the air,” he says. “If you can tap into it, that’s your source. And it’s not going away. It’s all around the world. We view the atmosphere as the world’s free pipeline.”

Besides AirJoule’s head start on Atoco, the companies also differ on where they get their MOFs. AirJoule’s system relies on an off-the-shelf version the company buys from the chemical giant BASF; Atoco aims to use Yaghi’s skill with designing the novel material to create bespoke MOFs for different applications and locations.

“Given the fact that we have the inventor of the whole class of materials, and we leverage the stuff that comes out of his lab at Berkeley—everything else equal, we have a good starting point to engineer maybe the best materials in the world,” says Magnus Bach, Atoco’s VP of business development.

Yaghi envisions a two-pronged product line. Industrial-scale water generators that run on electricity would be capable of producing thousands of liters per day on one end, while units that run on passive systems could operate in remote locations without power, just harnessing energy from the sun and ambient temperatures. In theory, these units could someday replace desalination and even entire municipal water supplies. The next round of field tests is scheduled for early 2026, in the Mojave Desert—one of the hottest, driest places on Earth.

“That’s my dream,” Yaghi says. “To give people water independence, so they’re not reliant on another party for their lives.”

Both Yaghi and Watergen’s Chernyavsky say they’re looking at more decentralized versions that could operate outside municipal utility systems. Home appliances, similar to rooftop solar panels and batteries, could allow households to generate their own water off grid.

That could be tricky, though, without economies of scale to bring down prices. “You have to produce, you have to cool, you have to filter—all in one place,” Chernyavsky says. “So to make it small is very, very challenging.”

Difficult as that may be, Yaghi’s childhood gave him a particular appreciation for the freedom to go off grid, to liberate the basic necessity of water from the whims of systems that dictate when and how people can access it.

“That’s really my dream,” he says. “To give people independence, water independence, so that they’re not reliant on another party for their livelihood or lives.”

Toward the end of one of our conversations, I asked Yaghi what he would tell the younger version of himself if he could. “Jordan is one of the worst countries in terms of the impact of water stress,” he said. “I would say, ‘Continue to be diligent and observant. It doesn’t really matter what you’re pursuing, as long as you’re passionate.’”

I pressed him for something more specific: “What do you think he’d say when you described this technology to him?”

Yaghi smiled: “I think young Omar would think you’re putting him on, that this is all fictitious and you’re trying to take something from him.” This reality, in other words, would be beyond young Omar’s wildest dreams.

            <h2>Creating psychological safety in the AI era</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/16/1125899/creating-psychological-safety-in-the-ai-era/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Rolling out enterprise-grade AI means climbing two steep cliffs at once. First, understanding and implementing the tech itself. And second, creating the cultural conditions where employees can maximize its value. While the technical hurdles are signiﬁcant, the human element can be even more consequential; fear and ambiguity can stall momentum of even the most promising initiatives.

Psychological safety—feeling free to express opinions and take calculated risks without worrying about career repercussions1—is essential for successful AI adoption. In psychologically safe workspaces, employees are empowered to challenge assumptions and raise concerns about new tools without fear of reprisal. This is nothing short of a necessity when introducing a nascent and profoundly powerful technology that still lacks established best practices.

“Psychological safety is mandatory in this new era of AI,” says Rafee Tarafdar, executive vice president and chief technology officer at Infosys. “The tech itself is evolving so fast—companies have to experiment, and some things will fail. There needs to be a safety net.”

To gauge how psychological safety influences success with enterprise-level AI, MIT Technology Review Insights conducted a survey of 500 business leaders. The ﬁndings reveal high self-reported levels of psychological safety, but also suggest that fear still has a foothold. Anecdotally, industry experts highlight a reason for the disconnect between rhetoric and reality: while organizations may promote a safe to experiment message publicly, deeper cultural undercurrents can counteract that intent.

Building psychological safety requires a coordinated, systems-level approach, and human resources (HR) alone cannot deliver such transformation. Instead, enterprises must deeply embed psychological safety into their collaboration processes.

AI tools that may have been used were limited to secondary production processes that passed thorough human review.

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you’ll see it’s a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

            <div id="article-text">This is today&#39;s edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what&#39;s going on in the world of technology.

Some disillusionment was inevitable. When OpenAI released a free web app called ChatGPT in late 2022, it changed the course of an entire industry—and several world economies. Millions of people started talking to their computers, and their computers started talking back. We were enchanted, and we expected more.Well, 2025 has been a year of reckoning. For a start, the heads of the top AI companies made promises they couldn’t keep. At the same time, updates to the core technology are no longer the step changes they once were.To be clear, the last few years have been filled with genuine “Wow” moments. But this remarkable technology is only a few years old, and in many ways it is still experimental. Its successes come with big caveats. Read the full story to learn more about why we may need to readjust our expectations.

This story is part of our new Hype Correction package, a collection of stories designed to help you reset your expectations about what AI makes possible—and what it doesn’t.

Quantum navigation could solve the military’s GPS jamming problem

Since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thousands of flights have been affected by a far-reaching Russian campaign of using radio transmissions that jammed its GPS system.The growing inconvenience to air traffic and risk of a real disaster have highlighted the vulnerability of GPS and focused attention on more secure ways for planes to navigate the gauntlet of jamming and spoofing, the term for tricking a GPS receiver into thinking it’s somewhere else.One approach that’s emerging from labs is quantum navigation: exploiting the quantum nature of light and atoms to build ultra-sensitive sensors that can allow vehicles to navigate independently, without depending on satellites.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard.

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you.  We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <h2>Is ChatGPT’s New Shopping Research Solving a Problem, or Creating One?</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/is-chatgpts-new-shopping-research-solving-a-problem-or-creating-one">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tekpon has acquired 100% of the TNW media and events brands, which cover and convene the European technology ecosystem, from the FT.

The transaction is Tekpon’s largest investment in media and events so far. It broadens the company’s reach across SaaS and AI and strengthens its role in the global innovation landscape.

TNW’s brand and editorial standards will be maintained, while its events and digital platforms will be integrated into Tekpon’s wider strategy.

The FT will continue to own and operate TNW Spaces, Amsterdam’s dynamic tech hub, offering private offices and coworking spaces that support a thriving community of startups, scale-ups, and innovators.

Alexandru Stan, Founder and CEO of Tekpon, said:

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

TNW is one of Europe’s most respected technology brands. Its legacy, its community, and its influence have shaped the European tech scene for nearly twenty years. This acquisition accelerates our mission to connect the global SaaS and AI ecosystem and supports Europe’s position in the next decade of innovation.

Tekpon will begin working on TNW branded initiatives immediately. Plans for 2026 include an expanded TNW Conference, new SaaS and AI program tracks curated by Tekpon, cross-regional executive programmes, and specialised gatherings for founders, executives, and investors.

The acquisition is part of Tekpon’s long-term plan to build an international ecosystem connecting software, media, events, advisory, and innovation.
