            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">SAN FRANCISCO—Automakers are starting to follow somewhat familiar paths as they continue their journeys to electrification. Electric vehicles are, at first, strange new tech, and usually look like it. Mercedes-Benz’s EQS and EQE are good examples—with bodies that look like bars of soap worn down in the shower, they stood out. For early adopters and trailblazers that might be fine, but you need to sell cars to normal people if you want to survive, and that means making EVs more normal. Which is what Mercedes did with its newest one, the all-electric CLA.

The normal looks belie the amount of new technology that Mercedes has packed into the CLA, though. The car sticks to the four-door coupe look that the company pioneered a couple of decades ago, but there’s a thoroughly modern electric powertrain connected to the wheels, run by four powerful networked computers. And yes, there’s AI. (For the pedants, “coupe” means cut down, not two-door, so the name is accurate.)

The CLA is the first of a new series of Mercedes that will use the same modular architecture, and interestingly, it’s powertrain agnostic—a hybrid CLA is coming in time, too. But first the battery EV, which makes good use of some technology Mercedes developed for the EQXX concept car.

That creation was capable of about 750 miles (1,207 km) on a single charge, but it was handbuilt and lacked working rear doors or an actual back seat. The CLA manages as much as 374 miles on a full charge of its 85 kWh (useable) battery pack, although as ever this decreases a little as you fit larger wheels.

But Mercedes has been restrained in this regard, eschewing that terrible trend for larger and larger wheels. Designers use that trick to hide the size of their SUVs, but the relatively diminutive size of the CLA needs no such visual trickery, and the rims range from 17–19 inches and no larger. Smaller wheels make less drag, and even though the CLA doesn’t look like it has been rubbed smooth, its drag coefficient of 0.21 says otherwise.

The version we tested, the CLA 250+, is not a particularly fast car. It uses a single motor driving the rear wheels, which generates 268 hp (200 kW) and 247 lb-ft (335 Nm), but which also has to get the car’s 4,553-lb (2,065 kg) curb weight moving. From a standstill in sport mode, it takes 6.6 seconds to reach 60 mph. Acceleration is perfectly adequate for day-to-day driving, but you won’t find that traditional EV “punch in the back” feeling when you floor it. Top speed is 130 mph (210 km/h), aided by a two-speed transmission for the rear drive unit.

The firmness of the suspension makes sense in light of that curb weight. It is relatively stiffly sprung, transmitting shocks from potholes and the like into the cabin. The steering is precise and well-weighted, and the pedal mapping was intuitive in the various drive modes and with different levels of lift-off regenerative braking. In the CLA you toggle those levels with the same stalk that you use to select drive or reverse (forward and back instead of up and down), which feels like a bit of an improvement on other control paradigms.

And I am thrilled to report that when you are in the high and intelligent regen settings, the brake pedal no longer moves by itself as the car decelerates. (Now it’s just you, Nissan.) With lift-off regen turned off, the CLA coasts extremely well, as we’ve come to expect from German EVs.

Speaking of Nissan, the CLA and the new Nissan Leaf do share something in common: they both have a J1772 port for AC charging, and a NACS port for DC fast charging. In the CLA’s case, that can peak at 320 kW and charge the battery pack from 10–80 percent in 22 minutes.

The CLA is one of a new breed of software-defined vehicles and debuts Mercedes’ latest MB.OS operating system. One of the four domain controller computers is tasked with the driver assists, and another handles infotainment, which is now the newest version of MBUX. This now contains AI from both Google and Microsoft built into the onboard personal assistant and responds well to natural language inputs, something that is becoming unfortunately less and less true of cars from rival OEMs. While its AI was occasionally stumped when questioned, if you get in an CLA, ask it the meaning of life. Adaptive cruise control and lane keeping is standard, and competent, with a camera-based driver monitoring system making sure you keep your eyes on the road if your hands aren’t on the wheel.

The infotainment and powertrain computers talk to each other, the former providing route information—traffic, topography, weather, and so on—to the latter, which can use it in the intelligent regen setting to maximize efficiency. Google provides map data points of interest, but Mercedes adds its own layers of data, including realtime parking and charger status, topography, and car integration. That requires connectivity, though, which isn’t always guaranteed; on our test route around the Bay Area, the car lost its data signal for around 10 minutes, which confused the navigation until a connection was restored.

The CLA interior manages to feel less lightweight than the more expensive EQS and EQE, although there’s extensive use of recycled plastics and other secondary materials that Mercedes says have helped it reduce the car’s carbon impact by 40 percent. I’m still not much of a fan of the “Superscreen,” which sets the driver display and a central infotainment touchscreen and a third passenger touchscreen under a single sheet of glass, but it’s also confined to the most expensive trim. The displays are bright and responsive, with a variety of UIs for the driver display and a “zero-layer” UI for the infotainment that is easier to use than the somewhat busy graphics might suggest. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are also onboard, and there are wireless charging pads and four 100 W USB-C ports for personal devices.

In addition to making the CLA feel like a normal car, Mercedes appears to have priced it like one, too. The CLA 250+ starts at just $47,250, which sounds like a lot until you remember it’s 2025 and the average new car price topped $50,000 a while ago. At that price, this is a rather competitive electric sedan.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is in critical condition. This year, the premier public health agency had its funding brutally cut and staff gutted, its mission sabotaged, and its headquarters riddled with literal bullets. The over 500 rounds fired were meant for its scientists and public health experts, who endured only to be sidelined, ignored, and overruled by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist hellbent on warping the agency to fit his anti-science agenda.

Then, on August 27, Kennedy fired CDC Director Susan Monarez just weeks after she was confirmed by the Senate. She had refused to blindly approve vaccine recommendations from a panel of vaccine skeptics and contrarians that he had hand-selected. The agency descended into chaos, and Monarez wasn’t the only one to leave the agency that day.

Three top leaders had reached their breaking point and coordinated their resignations upon the dramatic ouster: Drs. Demetre Daskalakis, Debra Houry, and Daniel Jernigan walked out of the agency as their colleagues rallied around them.

Dr. Daskalakis was the director of the CDC National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. He managed national responses to mpox, measles, seasonal flu, bird flu, COVID-19, and RSV.

Dr. Houry was the chief medical officer and deputy director for Program and Science, who oversaw nine centers and the Office of Science at the agency, which had a combined budget of over $6 billion. She was the agency’s most senior leader after the director.

Dr. Daniel Jernigan was the director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases. He had worked at the CDC for over 30 years. He led responses to dozens of health crises, including Ebola outbreaks and the 2003 SARS pandemic, and had become the national leader in responding to influenza threats.

Today, these three former officials will join Ars Technica for a discussion on what they saw, and are seeing, at the CDC under Kennedy’s rule and what it means for the country’s health. They’ll provide insight into what exactly is being lost by having ideology, rather than evidence, guide our public health policy—and how we might one day undo the damage.

Tune in today, December 16, at 2 pm ET at THIS LINK. See you there.

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-15</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/12/merriam-webster-crowns-slop-word-of-the-year-as-ai-content-floods-internet/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Like most tools, generative AI models can be misused. And when the misuse gets bad enough that a major dictionary notices, you know it has become a cultural phenomenon.

On Sunday, Merriam-Webster announced that “slop” is its 2025 Word of the Year, reflecting how the term has become shorthand for the flood of low-quality AI-generated content that has spread across social media, search results, and the web at large. The dictionary defines slop as “digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence.”

“It’s such an illustrative word,” Merriam-Webster President Greg Barlow told The Associated Press. “It’s part of a transformative technology, AI, and it’s something that people have found fascinating, annoying, and a little bit ridiculous.”

To select its Word of the Year, Merriam-Webster’s editors review data on which words rose in search volume and usage, then reach consensus on which term best captures the year. Barlow told the AP that the spike in searches for “slop” reflects growing awareness among users that they are encountering fake or shoddy content online.

Dictionaries have been tracking AI’s impact on language for the past few years, with Cambridge having selected “hallucinate” as its 2023 word of the year due to the tendency of AI models to generate plausible-but-false information (longtime Ars readers will be happy to hear there’s another word for that in the dictionary as well).

The trend extends to online culture in general, which is ripe with new coinages. This year, Oxford University Press chose “rage bait,” referring to content designed to provoke anger for engagement. Cambridge Dictionary selected “parasocial,” describing one-sided relationships between fans and celebrities or influencers.

As the AP points out, the word “slop” originally entered English in the 1700s to mean soft mud. By the 1800s, it had evolved to describe food waste fed to pigs, and eventually came to mean rubbish or products of little value. The new AI-related definition builds on that history of describing something unwanted and unpleasant.

Although he didn’t coin the term “AI slop,” independent AI researcher Simon Willison helped document its rise in May 2024 when he wrote on his blog comparing it to how “spam” had previously become the word for unwanted email. Quoting a tweet from an X user named @deepfates, Willison showed that the “AI slop” term began circulating in online communities shortly before he wrote his post advocating for its use.

The “slop” term carries a dismissive tone that sets it clearly apart from prominent corporate hype language about the promises and even existential perils of AI. “In 2025, amid all the talk about AI threats, slop set a tone that’s less fearful, more mocking,” Merriam-Webster wrote in a blog post. “The word sends a little message to AI: when it comes to replacing human creativity, sometimes you don’t seem too superintelligent.”

In its blog post announcing the word of the year selection, Merriam-Webster noted that 2025 saw a flood of AI-generated videos, off-kilter advertising images, propaganda, fake news, AI-written books, and what it called “workslop,” referring to reports that waste coworkers’ time. Ars Technica has covered similar phenomena invading various fields, including using the term “hiring slop” in June to describe an overflow of AI-generated résumés.

While some AI critics relish dismissing all generated output as “slop,” there’s some subjective nuance about what earns the label. As former Evernote CEO Phil Libin told Axios in April, the distinction may come down to intention: “When AI is used to produce mediocre things with less effort than it would have taken without AI, it’s slop. When it’s used to make something better than it could have been made without AI, it’s a positive augmentation.”

Willison had his own nuanced take, since he’s a proponent of using AI responsibly as tools to help with tasks like programming, but not with spamming. “Not all promotional content is spam, and not all AI-generated content is slop,” he wrote in May 2024 when discussing the term. “But if it’s mindlessly generated and thrust upon someone who didn’t ask for it, slop is the perfect term for it.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Experts have been urgently warning that allowing young kids to play with AI-powered toys could have negative consequences, from stunting childhood development by blurring the boundary between imagination and reality to exposing tots to inappropriate subject matters and AI hallucinations.

And as it quickly turned out, their worries were not unfounded. Toy makers have unleashed a flood of AI toys that have already been caught telling tykes how to find knives, light fires with matches, and giving crash courses in sexual fetishes.

Most recently, tests found that an AI toy from China is regaling children with Chinese Communist Party talking points, telling them that “Taiwan is an inalienable part of China” and defending the honor of the country’s president Xi Jinping.

So it shouldn’t come as a surprise that multinational toy manufacturer Mattel, the company behind Barbie and Hot Wheels, is pushing the “pause” button after announcing a “strategic collaboration” with ChatGPT maker OpenAI back in June.

The company confirmed to Axios that it won’t be releasing its first OpenAI-powered toy before the end of the year, as originally planned.

“We don’t have anything planned for the holiday season,” a spokesperson told Axios.

And when it does release a product, it won’t be aimed at young children, the company said, noting that OpenAI’s offerings are currently limited to those aged 13 and older. (Whether that’s actually stopping younger children from accessing its AI models is a different matter; the company made a show of kicking one AI-powered teddy bear off its platform, then allowed its manufacturer to start using it again.)

“Leveraging this incredible technology is going to allow us to really reimagine the future of play,” Mattel chief franchise officer Josh Silverman told Bloomberg at the time that it struck the deal with OpenAI.

“Mattel should announce immediately that it will not incorporate AI technology into children’s toys,” advocacy group Public Citizen co-president Robert Weissman wrote in a statement responding to the announcement. “Children do not have the cognitive capacity to distinguish fully between reality and play.”

“Endowing toys with human-seeming voices that are able to engage in human-like conversations risks inflicting real damage on children,” he added. “It may undermine social development, interfere with children’s ability to form peer relationships, pull children away from playtime with peers, and possibly inflict long-term harm.”

Even older minors are extremely vulnerable to the tech, as an alarming number of teen deaths and high-profile lawsuits that followed have demonstrated, with numerous parents suing OpenAI, alleging that ChatGPT assisted their children’s suicides.

Those concerns have largely fallen on deaf ears, particularly when it comes to toy makers in China, who have been flooding online marketplaces in the US with AI toys aimed at young children.

Two separate reports by the nonprofit consumer safety-focused US Public Interest Research Group Education Fund (PIRG) have found that guardrails are woefully inadequate, allowing children to have extremely inappropriate conversations with the AI toys.

It remains to be seen how Mattel and OpenAI will move forward. We still don’t know what the company has in store — but given the ongoing conversations surrounding the many negative side effects of exposing young children and teens to the tech, any future offering will be heavily scrutinized.

            <h2>AI Industry Insiders Living in Fear of What They’re Creating</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-16</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">They may be responsible for creating the AI tech that many fear will wipe out jobs — if not the entire human race — but at least they feel just as paranoid and miserable about where this is all going as the rest of us.

At NeurIPS, one of the big AI research conferences, held this year at the San Diego Convention, visions of AI doom were clearly on the mind of many scientists in attendance. But are they seriously reckoning with AI’s risks, or are they too busy doing what amounts to fantasizing about scenarios they’ve read in sci-fi novels? It’s the question raised in a new piece by Alex Reisner for The Atlantic, who attended NeurIPS and found that many spoke in grand terms about AI’s risks, especially those brought about the creation of a hypothetical artificial general intelligence, but overlooked the tech’s mundane drawbacks.

“Many AI developers are thinking about the technology’s most tangible problems while public conversations about AI — including those among the most prominent developers themselves — are dominated by imagined ones,” Reisner wrote.

One researcher guilty of this? University of Montreal researcher Yoshua Bengio, one the three so-called “godfathers” of AI whose work was foundational to creating the large language models propelling the industry’s indefatigable boom. Bengio has spent the past few years sounding the alarm about AI safety, and recently launched a non-profit called LawZero to encourage the tech’s safe development.

“Bengio was concerned that, in a possible dystopian future, AIs might deceive their creators and that ‘those who will have very powerful AIs could misuse it for political advantage, in terms of influencing public opinion,&#39;” recalled Reisner.

But the luminary “did not mention how fake videos are already affecting public discourse,” Reisner observed. “Neither did he meaningfully address the burgeoning chatbot mental-health crisis, or the pillaging of the arts and humanities. The catastrophic harms, in his view, are ‘three to 10 or 20 years’ away.”

Reisner wasn’t the only one to observe this disconnect. In a keynote speech titled “Are We Having the Wrong Nightmares About AI?,” the sociologist Zeynep Tufekci warned that researchers were missing the forest for the trees by focusing so much on the risks posed by AGI, a technology that we don’t even know will ever be possible to create, and for which there is no agreed upon definition. After someone in the audience complained that the immediate risks Tufekci raised, like chatbot addiction, were already known, Tufekci responded, “I don’t really see these discussions. I keep seeing people discuss mass unemployment versus human extinction.”

It’s a far point to make. The discourse around AI safety is often dominated by apocalyptic rhetoric, which is peddled even by the very billionaires building the stuff. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman predicts that AI will wipe out entire categories of jobs, cause a crisis of widespread identity fraud, and admitted to doomsday prepping for when an AI system potentially retaliates against humankind by unleashing a deadly virus.

And Bengio isn’t the only AI “godfather” wracked with contrition. British computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton — who received the Turing Award in 2018 alongside Bengio and former Meta chief AI scientist Yann LeCun — has cast himself as an Oppenheimer-like figure in the field. In 2023, he famously said he regretted his life’s work after quitting his role at Google, and recently held a discussion with senator Bernie Sanders where he went long on the tech’s myriad risks, which included jobs destruction and militarized AI systems furthering empire.

Reisner made an ironic observation: that the name of NeurIPS, short for “Neural Information Processing Systems,” harks back to a time when scientists vastly underestimated the complexity of our brain’s neurons and compared them to the processing done by computers.

“Regardless, a central feature of AI’s culture is an obsession with the idea that a computer is a mind,” he wrote. “Anthropic and OpenAI have published reports with language about chatbots being, respectively, ‘unfaithful’ and ‘dishonest.’ In the AI discourse, science fiction often defeats science.”

            <h2>The Things Young Kids Are Using AI for Are Absolutely Horrifying</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/future-society/young-kids-using-ai">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">New research is pulling back the curtain on how large numbers of kids are using AI companion apps — and what it found is troubling.

A new report conducted by the digital security company Aura found that a significant percentage of kids who turn to AI for companionship are engaging in violent roleplays — and that violence, which can include sexual violence, drove more engagement than any other topic kids engaged with.

Drawing from anonymized data gathered from the online activity of roughly 3,000 children aged five to 17 whose parents use Aura’s parental control tool, as well as additional survey data from Aura and Talker Research, the security firm found that 42 percent of minors turned to AI specifically for companionship, or conversations designed to mimic lifelike social interactions or roleplay scenarios. Conversations across nearly 90 different chatbot services, from prominent companies like Character.AI to more obscure companion platforms, were included in the analysis.

Of that 42 percent of kids turning to chatbots for companionship, 37 percent engaged in conversations that depicted violence, which the researchers defined as interactions involving “themes of physical violence, aggression, harm, or coercion” — that includes sexual or non-sexual coercion, the researchers clarified — as well as “descriptions of fighting, killing, torture, or non-consensual acts.”

Half of these violent conversations, the research found, included themes of sexual violence. The report added that minors engaging with AI companions in conversations about violence wrote over a thousand words per day, signaling that violence appears to be a powerful driver of engagement, the researchers argue.

The report, which is awaiting peer review, emphasizes how anarchic the chatbot market really is, and the need to develop a deeper understanding of how young users are engaging with conversational AI chatbots overall.

“We have a pretty big issue on our hands that I think we don’t fully understand the scope of,” Dr. Scott Kollins, a clinical psychologist and Aura’s chief medical officer, told Futurism of the research’s findings, “both in terms of just the volume, the number of platforms, that kids are getting involved in — and also, obviously, the content.”

“These things are commanding so much more of our kids’ attention than I think we realize or recognize,” Kollins added. “We need to monitor and be aware of this.”

One striking finding was that instances of violent conversations with companion bots peaked at an extremely young age: the group most likely to engage in this kind of content were 11-year-olds, for whom a staggering 44 percent of interactions took violent turns.

Sexual and romantic roleplay, meanwhile, also peaked in middle school-aged youths, with 63 percent of 13-year-olds’ conversations revealing flirty, affectionate, or explicitly sexual roleplay.

The research comes as high-profile lawsuits alleging wrongful death and abuse at the hands of chatbot platforms continue to make their way through the courts. Character.AI, a Google-tied companion platform, is facing multiple suits brought by the parents of minor users alleging that the platform’s chatbots sexually and emotionally abused kids, resulting in mental breakdowns and multiple deaths by suicide. ChatGPT maker OpenAI is currently being sued for the wrongful deaths of two teenage users who died by suicide after extensive interactions with the chatbot. (OpenAI is also facing several other lawsuits about death, suicide, and psychological harm to adult users as well.)

That the interactions flagged by Aura weren’t relegated to a small handful of recognizable services is important. The AI industry is essentially unregulated, which has placed the burden for the well-being of kids heavily on the shoulders of parents. According to Kollins, Aura has so far identified over 250 different “conversational chatbot apps and platforms” populating app stores, which generally require that kids simply tick a box claiming that they’re 13 to gain entry. To that end, there are no federal laws defining specific safety thresholds that AI platforms, companion apps included, are required to meet before they’re labeled safe for minors. And where one companion app might move to make some changes — Character.AI, for instance, recently banned minor users from engaging in “open-ended” chats with the site’s countless human-like AI personas — another one can just as easily crop up to take its place as a low-guardrail alternative.

In other words, in this digital Wild West, the barrier for entry is extraordinarily shallow.

To be sure, depictions of brutality and sexual violence, in addition to other types of inappropriate or disturbing content, have existed on the web for a long time, and a lot of kids have found ways to access them. There’s also research to show that many young people are learning to draw some healthy boundaries around conversational AI services, including companion-style bots.

Other kids, though, aren’t developing these same boundaries. Chatbots, as researchers continue to emphasize, are interactive by nature, meaning that developing young users are part of the narrative — as opposed to more passive viewers of content that runs the gamut from inappropriate to alarming. It’s unclear what, exactly, the outcome of engaging with this new medium will mean for young people writ large. But for some teens, their families argue, the outcome has been deadly.

“We’ve got to at least be clear-eyed about understanding that our kids are engaging with these things, and they are learning rules of engagement,” Kollins told Futurism. “They’re learning ways of interacting with others with a computer — with a bot. And we don’t know what the implications of that are, but we need to be able to define that, so that we can start to research that and understand it.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">She thought that her dream was to work at a big company. “And then once I got there, I was like ‘oh, that’s it,” she told TechCrunch.

Alles began fostering other passions and found herself curious about the world of startups. She would listen to every podcast and read each book, taking notes on topics that interested her.

She didn’t think much of it until one summer when so many of her friends got married, that she found herself spending thousands of dollars on bridesmaid dresses and bachelorette looks. One day, someone approached her and asked to borrow one of her dresses. “I was like ‘yeah, for sure, take it,’” she recalled. “And then I thought, ‘how can this be done on a larger scale?’”

Alles had all these expensive dresses just sitting in her closet. She didn’t want to sell it, but she knew she probably would never wear those gowns again. “That’s what led me, long story short, to create Rax,” she said.

Alles launched Rax earlier this year as a peer-to-peer clothing rental company. It functions right now as a marketplace (it does not own any clothing inventory), where users scroll through listings and connect with people who have clothing items they want to rent.

She’s bootstrapped the company so far, enough to fully code the app and officially launch it. The first few customers were her friends and family, and the rest came by word of mouth. Alles said she leaned into the idea of “building in public,” where she posted online about her adventures creating this product in hopes of amassing an engaged audience of potential customers. She has about 5,000 users on the app right now.

Rex is one of the first of its kind to be launched in Toronto. It’s like Rent-the-Runway, or New York’s Pickle, or Europe’s ByRotation. The idea of renting clothes — similar to buying secondhand —has been picking up steam as it is seen as a more environmentally sustainable way to consume fashion rather than buying new items for each new season.

“It’s driving the circularity of fashion,” Alles said.

But what makes Rex different from many others is that she offers long-term rentals. “On our platform, you can rent up to six months,” she said. “On competitor platforms, it’s daily rentals. So it gets really expensive if you want to rent for a couple week vacation. Or maybe you want a winter jacket for the season.”

At TechCrunch Disrupt in October, Rex announced its first foray into the U.S. market. Alles said she had been a huge fan of TechCrunch and applied for the Battlefield competition, where she later won the top consumer pitch in the competition.

Alles said she was surprised to win. “There were so many companies that had like thousands or hundreds of thousands of users; raised [like] $20 million in my category, and one [had] the lead actors from [the show] Silicon Valley,” she said.

Still, she found the experience “awesome.” Alles went up to every startup booth to introduce herself to other founders, and also attended some sessions as well as partook in networking. Actually, that was one of the biggest lessons she’s said she’s learned as a founder — the importance of in-person interaction because it helps her connect with the community better.

Now that Disrupt has passed, Alles said the company hopes to continue its expansion across New York and start building out a rental service platform to offer fashion designers and retailers looking to offer rental clothing to consumers.

“We have the technology, we have the audience,” she said, adding that brands are also looking at ways to become more sustainable, and companies like Rex let them do it. “I think things are getting better and people are becoming more aware of their impact.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Instagram is expanding Reels-viewing beyond mobile, the social network announced on Tuesday. The company is piloting IG for TV, a new experience that lets you watch Reels on TV, starting with Amazon Fire TV.

By bringing Reels to TVs, Instagram can better compete with YouTube, which largely dominates the TV space. Instagram likely wants viewers to switch to its TV app while watching content on the couch, similar to flipping through TV channels. For example, you could be watching something on Netflix and decide you don’t have the attention span for a movie or episode, and decide to watch Reels instead.

IG for TV is personalized to each user, as it shows Reels based on the content and creators you enjoy on the Instagram app. Reels will be organized into channels and categories based on topics such as comedy, music, and lifestyle, making it easier to explore different types of videos.

Reels will also play automatically, so you won’t have to keep scrolling to watch what’s next. You still have the option to skip to the next Reel. You can like, view comments, and re-share reels.

Users have the option to pair IG for TV with their Instagram app and add up to five accounts in one home. Or, they can choose to create a new account just for TV viewing.

It’s worth noting that IG for TV shouldn’t be confused with IGTV, which was Instagram’s app for watching long-form content before being shut down in 2022.

The launch of the TV app doesn’t come as a surprise, as Instagram head Adam Mosseri said in October that the company was planning a dedicated TV app.

“We’re exploring TV,” Mosseri said at Bloomberg’s Screentime event. “TV is an increasingly important surface, it’s been very important for YouTube […] it’s been very important for TikTok. So we’d like to figure out how to make sure that we show up in a compelling way on all the relevant devices.”

Mosseri went on to note that it was a mistake for the company not to have explored a TV app earlier, and that he wishes they had done so a few years ago.

            <div id="article-text">Apple is making it easier for Android users to watch Apple TV content on the big screen. The company on Monday said the Apple TV app for Android will now support Google Cast functionality, which lets users stream videos and audio directly to their TV.

The tech giant’s adoption of Google Cast signals its interest in making Apple TV a more competitive streaming service at a time when the market is seeing increased consolidation. Netflix and Paramount are fighting to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, and Disney is preparing to merge Hulu into its own streaming app.

The feature is arriving just after Netflix quietly abandoned support for Google Cast in its own app, angering many subscribers. Apple’s support for the feature could potentially attract Android users upset by Netflix’s decision who choose to move their streaming dollars elsewhere.

Apple TV’s lineup of original content is smaller than what other streaming services offer, but it still features a number of popular shows and films like “Severance,” “Pluribus,” “The Studio,” “The Morning Show,” “Slow Horses,” and the recent summer blockbuster, “F1.” For sports, Apple TV offers live-streamed “Friday Night Baseball” doubleheaders, plus Major League Soccer matches, and Formula 1 races in the U.S.

To cast to their TV, users will need to install the Apple TV app from Google Play, which works on smartphones, tablets, and foldables. Just tap the Cast icon in the top right.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Midway through William Greaves’s documentary Nationtime, which follows the 1972 National Black Political Convention, a woman named Audley Moore stands in a busy hallway preaching to people’s backs. She is clad in a burgundy-and-navy-floral kaftan and matching headwrap. Her voice rings out amid the bustling crowd of convention-goers: “Now let me tell you: Benjamin Franklin said, ‘Those who seek temporary security rather than basic liberty deserve neither.’ I’m demanding reparations. That’s all I can see now. That’s the answer for our people.” She is paraphrasing Franklin’s quote, one whose meaning is frequently misconstrued, but the invocation of the Founding Father lends both heft and irony to her calls for redress from the American government. Moore catches a few passersby and jokes with them, shoving a typewritten paper in their hands as they walk away. A few stay to listen. This scene aptly encapsulates the life of Audley “Queen Mother” Moore, an often-overlooked Black-nationalist organizer who fought vociferously for Black self-determination until her death in 1997.

A laudable new biography, Queen Mother: Black Nationalism, Reparations, and the Untold Story of Audley Moore, by the historian Ashley D. Farmer, uses Moore’s story to chart a trajectory of Black-nationalist activism in the United States, from Garveyism in the 1920s (Moore belonged to the New Orleans chapter of Garvey’s Universal Negro Improvement Association, or UNIA) to the 1995 Million Man March for Black-male unity and self-empowerment. Moore’s radical ideas—including her desire for a separate Black nation in the South—earned her ridicule at times, but her sharp critiques of American white supremacy also found purchase, influencing activists such as Malcolm X, Muhammad Ahmad, and Charles J. Ogletree Jr.

Despite her prolific political organizing and wide reach during her lifetime, Moore has largely been omitted from the history of civil-rights activism. Her exclusion from traditional archives is a familiar story to scholars of Black American life, especially those who study the contributions of women. Farmer writes that her book, which she spent a decade researching and writing, required painstaking effort to locate traces of Moore in personal papers, land deeds, files from the FBI and the House Un-American Activities Committee, oral-history tapes, and lingering memories (much of Moore’s ephemera were lost in a house fire). The resulting work, which examines her involvement in a strikingly diverse roster of organizations, is a portrait of a woman with uncanny savvy and flexibility.

Moore worked with nationalists, Communists, and moderate liberals, white and Black alike—whatever it took to pursue goals such as fair housing regulations, just labor laws, and equitable resource distribution. She was sometimes self-contradicting as an activist, which isn’t to say she wasn’t singularly dedicated to her cause. She seems to have simply understood that achieving her objectives—in all their multiplicity—required maximal fluidity. Activists with unchanging missions might be easier to pin down (and thus less likely to be forgotten). But Moore’s story shows that the Black-nationalist movement also encompassed people who were willing to find areas of compromise in order to get the job done.

Moore was born in 1898 in New Iberia, Louisiana, to a well-off family that descended from both enslaved and free Black communities. But both her parents died before she reached adulthood, and she was forced to turn to domestic work in white households, one of the few economic avenues available to her at the time. In the violent, segregated South during World War I, Moore “looked on as America made its grand debut on the world stage as a great emancipator—a masterful public performance as liberty’s beacon shining from the West, all while extending white supremacy’s tendrils across the globe,” Farmer writes. Having noticed that the Army didn’t offer as much support for Black soldiers as it did for white ones, Moore and her two sisters provided meals and recreation space to these troops in Anniston, Alabama. Losing the protection of Black elite society that her parents had afforded her, and witnessing the contradiction between America’s actions abroad and at home, helped shape Moore’s lifelong advocacy for civil rights and for working-class concerns.

It is difficult to overstate the influence on Moore’s development of Marcus Garvey, the foremost Black nationalist of the 20th century. Garvey sought to revitalize “Africa for the Africans,” and to repatriate people of African descent to their motherland. He also championed Black pride, self-reliance, and racial separatism on the basis that white people would never recognize Black people’s human rights. His teachings showed the fledgling activist how to analyze Black people’s social conditions and gave her the desire to unify Black people everywhere. In 1922, Moore joined the UNIA in New Orleans, attending meetings and studying the history of the global African diaspora. She and her then-husband once even packed up all of their possessions, planning to expatriate to Liberia as part of one of Garvey’s “Back to Africa” initiatives, before ultimately deciding to stay in the United States.

After Garvey was deported in 1927 following a mail-fraud conviction, Moore was forced to channel her activism into vehicles beyond the declining UNIA. A move to Harlem brought her into the orbit of the Communist Party. A card-carrying member by 1936, Moore cut her teeth protesting racist and sexist discrimination across New York City, forming tenants’ rights organizations, and sending aid to Ethiopia after a 1935 invasion by Italy. In response to Black Communists’ demands that the party address both class and race oppression, Communist leaders had come to believe that Black people constituted an oppressed nation, and that it was within the party’s interest to fight for their rights. But Moore’s association with the Communists was less of an ideological commitment, Farmer writes, than a practical way to work toward Garvey’s “anti-imperialist, pro-Black” goals. Collaborating with the moderate NAACP, Moore advocated for the freedom of five of the Scottsboro Boys, a group of nine Black teens falsely accused of raping two white women in Alabama.

Moore also worked on many causes tangential to Black nationalism, including lowering the price of milk for children and boycotting goods from Nazi Germany. Among her other “strange bedfellows,” Farmer mentions Mary McLeod Bethune’s respectable, middle-class National Council of Negro Women, “an unlikely place for a Black Nationalist and Communist” who was primarily self-educated. But Moore’s success in organizing with Communists had taught her that, as Farmer writes, “an organization need not be explicitly Black Nationalist in its mission to advance the cause.”

“The cause” itself, for Moore—and, truthfully, for many Black nationalists—couldn’t be distilled into a clear, unified goal. As James Edward Smethurst, a scholar of 20th-century Black radical movements, writes in his book The Black Arts Movement, the actual definitions and tactics of Black nationalism were secondary to the belief that, without self-determination, Black people would be “oppressed and exploited second-class (or non-) citizens in the United States.” Moore’s activism exemplifies how, as Smethurst writes, “old Left and old Nationalist spaces often intersected with each other and with those of the New Left, the Civil Rights Movement, and the new nationalists,” particularly Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam, “in surprising ways.”

In 1950, Moore fell out with the Communist Party because of its shifting focus away from Black equality. Over the next two decades, her politics would harden; she mentored many young nationalists, including Malcolm X and Ahmad, a founder of the Revolutionary Action Movement. But as Farmer writes, guiding all of Moore’s work was a single overarching dream, rooted in her early days with the UNIA: gaining reparations. In 1962, Moore launched a campaign to persuade the U.S. government to pay reparations to descendants of enslaved Africans, which she timed for the centennial of the Emancipation Proclamation the following year. She and her fellow activists charged that the country owed Black Americans $500 trillion, to be paid in land and cash distributed to individuals annually. She even sought the formation of a separatist Black nation in the U.S.—what she called a “national territory in a country developed by our blood and tears and unrequited slave labor.” This was groundbreaking at a time when the zeitgeist prioritized inclusion in the American body politic rather than separation and redress.

In the 1960s, Moore would become known by the honorific “Queen Mother Moore,” in recognition of her role as an elder stateswoman to Black organizers across the political spectrum. During a trip to Ghana in 1972, she was crowned with the title in an Asante ceremony. In the ’70s, she reached the height of her influence in the Black Power Movement, becoming a mentor figure to a Detroit-based separatist group, the Republic of New Afrika, that advocated for five Black Belt states to be given to Black Americans as a nation-state. In spite of the group’s unrealized dreams—as well as struggles with surveillance and violent disruption from the FBI’s Counterintelligence Program, or COINTELPRO—Farmer writes that Moore still affirmed, at the end of the ’70s, “I’m a hard nationalist.”

In Queen Mother, Farmer takes a clear-eyed look at Moore’s foibles, noting her absenteeism during her son’s formative years, her embrace of patriarchal hierarchy in Black communities, and her exhortations for Black women to embrace polygyny to facilitate nation building. Farmer acknowledges that Black nationalists sometimes took violent action, claiming the “right to govern themselves and to defend themselves.” But she also seeks to correct a common misunderstanding of the ideology, arguing that it’s not the “violent, incoherent, and nihilistic inverse of the Civil Rights Movement,” but a campaign with the very same goals, sought through different means (separation from white society, rather than integration). Still, many of Moore’s ideas “were on the fringe then,” Farmer writes, “as they are now.” The historian doesn’t explain away Moore’s infatuation and personal association with the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, who in 1975 invited her to attend a meeting of the Organization of African Unity in Kampala. As Farmer writes, Moore was “thrilled” by him and seemed to ignore the fact that his rule had become known for its corruption and human-rights abuses.

But Farmer doesn’t need to justify all of Moore’s beliefs and goals to make a case for her influence. Her meticulous study of the many figures, movements, and organizations Moore worked with shows that her contributions were pivotal, rather than peripheral. Moore was a Garveyite through line—what Farmer calls a midwife—to many 20th-century Black-nationalist activists, a lot of them men, who remain more famous than her. Queen Mother establishes her as a titan in her own right, a central influence in nearly a century of global Black-liberation struggles, and a reminder for modern activists of a persistent truth: that cooperation does not have to mean compromising one’s values, and that those who dream of freedom have more than one way of achieving it.

            <div id="article-text">“Open it the fuck back up!” the muscular Matt Honeycutt commands, mic gripped in his left fist, mustache prickling with indignation. He is balefully slash lovingly surveying the crowd and finding it a little sluggish and closely packed for his taste. “I need all my primitive, low-IQ motherfuckers!” Behind him, his band, Kublai Khan TX, rears and slumps into its next song. And the crowd lurches; the crowd flexes; the crowd feels its core, which is both a sucking emptiness and a site of repellent energy, like the space cleared by a fistfight.

“Build myself in the dirt!” Honeycutt roars. “Sacred right, sacred curse.”

“I’d hate to be in that pit right now,” someone says behind me.

Hot autumn night has fallen over Worcester, Massachusetts, over the huge, baked asphalt lot behind the Palladium, the ancestral seat of the Northeast’s heavy-metal kingdom. This is the New England Metal and Hardcore Festival, 25 bands on three stages, 10 unbroken hours of heavy music, and all day, I’ve been watching the pit—the mosh pit, the area close to the stage where inflamed dancers whirl and collide. I’ve been watching it, and skulking around it journalistically, because I am possessed by an idea: What if the pit, this ritualized maelstrom at the heart of the hardcore-metal crowd, could teach us something about how to live together in 2025—about how to be?

Heavy metal, of all music, knows just how sick we are. Just how pinned down by depression, addiction, insanity, technology, the machine of society and the thumb of God. Metal has been telling us this—gleefully, monstrously—since Ozzy Osbourne first sang, “Back on Earth, the flame of life burns low / Everywhere is misery and woe.” It’s a message that never goes out of style. But right now in America—what with the digital splatteration, the black-hole subjectivity, and the goon squad crouched in a van behind Dunkin’—it has, shall we say, an especial piquancy.

Metalfest, as I like to call it, has been running at the Palladium since 1999, reliably showcasing the best and the brightest, the worst and the darkest, from across the spectrum of metal and hardcore punk. When I say “10 unbroken hours of heavy music,” I’m not kidding. Metalfest is immaculately organized and relentlessly programmed, and the heaviness is continuous.

Inside the Palladium, there’s a small, explosive room for the bands at the jumpier and more hardcore-punk end of the spectrum, bands such as Hard Target, from Central Massachusetts, and New York City’s Madball. Outside in the lot, where the metal hordes are gathered, two large stages face each other across an expanse of a few hundred yards, and when a band (say, Gideon) stops playing at one end, another band (say, Full of Hell) starts up—immediately—at the other end. As one set finishes, in other words—THANK YOU, WOOST-AAAAAH!—its last chord still decaying and its ions still swimming in the afternoon air, you hear behind you a scuttle of drums and a squawk of feedback and an AWRIGHT! LET’S FUCKING GO! All you have to do is turn around.

Perfect. Perfect for this crowd. For this is the deepest and most unassuaged desire of all metalheads: to live in a state of continuous heaviness.

And heaviness is …? I’ll hazard some definitions. It’s a sense of cosmic tragedy, a love of the low end, an affinity for the thicker frequencies of existence, a paradoxically joyful desolation. It’s the compression of Time in a riff. It’s the weight of experience and the curve of space. It’s the caped shadow of Ozzy, his wings spread, crying, “Lost in the wheels of confusion.” It’s the mood conveyed by the slogans on the backs of the various band T-shirts that everyone at Metalfest is wearing: FUCK YOUR LIFE; SORROW WILL PREVAIL; YOU WILL DIE MY ENEMY.

The pit is an institution, at least 40 years old. Who started it? Where? Was it birthed in the skinhead cauldron of New York’s Lower East Side, or in Southern California, with the punk-rock surfers and skaters of Huntington Beach? The legends abound, but somewhere (or more likely in several places at once), around the beginning of the 1980s, the crowd at U.S. hardcore shows opened up. Where there had been a crush or a scrum, there was suddenly and dramatically a space: for violence, for collision, for expression, for the hardest of the hardcore. The pit. And as the aggression and acceleration of hardcore migrated into metal, and into the roomier, boomier venues of the metal circuit, the pit got bigger.

(And not every hardcore or post-hardcore band was pro-pit. Fugazi, of Washington, D.C., would regularly stop their shows mid-song, the set’s momentum quiveringly arrested, to address thuggish behavior in the space in front of the stage.)

As to who’s in the pit, who’s making the pit happen, let’s take a look. There are big boys throwing their weight around, and there are wild skinnies with flying arms and spinning back-kicks, chopping out their emergency version of personal space. There are cheerful barging amateurs, happy to be bounced about, and there are prowling malevolences, waiting for the moment to blindside someone or chuck an elbow in their face. There is the occasional fearless woman. Like America, the pit is just barely a democracy. But you need youth, and you need strength: It’s no country for old men.

And here’s something interesting. The amount of fights, bloody noses, chest-to-chest confrontations, bouncer interventions I spot at Metalfest: zero. A self-policing environment, to a remarkable degree. Although I do overhear one young woman in post-pit distress—“That was the stupidest shit I’ve ever seen, girl! I am livid! Like, who is this bitch? I’ve never seen her before!”—while her partner murmurs indecipherable sounds of consolation.

Part of being a metal or hardcore front man in 2025 is knowing how to work the pit, appointing yourself a specialist in mob physics. All day at Metalfest, you could hear them calling out the moves: “Make a circle pit!” (a vortex); “Two-step! TWO-STEPPP!” (a dance, a kind of hobbit-y stomp); “Side to fuckin’ side!” (self-explanatory). The crowd will obediently convulse, or it won’t. “Okay, now we’re gonna play a game called Wall of Death,” the singer of Despised Icon announces during their early-evening set. “The game’s pretty simple. I’m gonna count to four—”

“TOO HARD!” one wag bellows in front of us.

The Wall of Death, incidentally, involves splitting the crowd down the middle, creating a channel of space, and then having the two sides charge across it like clashing medieval armies.

Mid-afternoon, battered by metal, away from the melee, I have a chat with the least metal-looking person I can find—Black, nonbinary, softly and secretly smiling, in pants and combat boots but with floating diaphanous layers. “I’m tripping balls,” they tell me, which partly explains their air of conspicuous apartness: They are on a private journey, drifting through Metalfest on luminous drug filaments. They show me their sketchbook, full of tarot-like images of aliens and birds.

“I saw you in the pit,” I say. “How did it feel in there?”

The soft, secret smile. “It’s all hugging; it’s all love. They want the contact.”

You’re wondering about the politics. Metal itself, being essentially a sensation in the brain stem, is apolitical, but metalheads are human, and they have their opinions. And if you want to listen to this elemental, unreconstructed music, you’re going to have to take your dose of illiberalism. In the pit, you’re going to have to deal with the guy whose T-shirt reads I STAND FOR THE FLAG AND KNEEL FOR THE CROSS. The front men are demagogues; the crowd is suggestible, fanatical; and between one downstroked chord and the next, you can hear the eclipse of the Enlightenment.

But love abides. Care abides. “I’ve got 15 seconds ’til I say some real shit,” Mychal Soto, a guitarist for Oklahoma’s PeelingFlesh, shouts, wiping his face mid-set with a towel in the afternoon glare and looking out at the crowd. “This set right here goes out to anybody that’s a minority or a person of color that’s had to battle some real shit,” he continues. “Even though that’s not your problem? Make it your problem—make it your fucking problem. I think it’s time for us as a people to become human again. It’s time to give a shit about the people next to us. We have to stop this madness, because if we don’t, this country is going to be over in our lifetime. This ain’t a cry for either side; this is a cry for love and compassion for human beings. So LET’S DO THIS SHIT.”

Five hours later, Honeycutt doffs his baseball hat to the audience. “This next track,” he declares, “goes out to all the ladies in the house!” But this isn’t some sexist rave-up. This isn’t “Girls, Girls, Girls,” by Mötley Crüe. This one’s about truck-stop sex workers, exploitation, and generational abuse. This is Kublai Khan TX’s “Swan Song”: “To all the ladies working Iowa 80 …” Could it be the most savagely empathetic pro-woman song ever produced by a bunch of big hairy metal dudes? If you’d heard the chorus of women’s voices singing along at Metalfest—“For all the fear, every tear / Slowly burning your sight / For every moment in the light / I fucking see you tonight”—you wouldn’t hesitate to say yes, yes, yes. “Wonderful!” Honeycutt growls contentedly.

There is a set by Cannibal Corpse at one end of the Palladium lot, a set by Lorna Shore at the other end. Then Metalfest wraps up, and we drift off, vibrationally pummeled, numb and gladdened, into the heavy-metal night. Reality will come with the dawn: normal life, the 2025 model, with its warpings of ambient pressure and its weightless panics. For now, we’re held in the sweet penumbra of heaviness. As for my big idea—that we can heal ourselves in the pit—well, let’s just say that it’s the kind of idea only a journalist would have. But I can still see them whirling and colliding, the dancers, and my mind slows it all to half speed, and shafts of beauty beam out, dazzlingly, from the blur of the limbs and the ecstatic, grimacing faces.

It looks like chaos, but there’s no real chaos, is there? Everything’s cause and effect, if you know where to look.</div>

            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2025/12/lily-allen-west-end-girl-breakup-art-relationship-post-mortem/685274/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Hooray for Lily Allen. I can’t get her messy, bracing new album, which crisply dissects her failed marriage, out of my head. I’m all for processing romantic wounds in private: consuming large tubs of ice cream, drawing the window shades, crying hot tears into the depths of a down pillow. Breakups can be agonizing, even immobilizing; sometimes, wallowing is the ideal way forward. Eventually, you get sick of yourself and move on, though this can take a while—sometimes a long while. That’s also okay. (I was single for 10 years after my divorce, which was maybe a little too long of a while.)

But there’s something to be said for processing heartbreak by spilling secrets or otherwise setting things ablaze. Allen’s West End Girl is a prime example of this tactic. In October, the British performer lit the internet on fire with a 14-track, 45-minute-long effort that tracks the dissolution of her marriage to the actor David Harbour (Stranger Things) after he supposedly violated the terms of their open marriage. (Harbour has not commented directly on Allen’s album, but in an interview published last month, he made vague reference to “the slipups and the mistakes” he’s made.)

Mistakes, perhaps, like the one Allen sings about on “Madeline,” a frenetic, sarcastic number addressed to the “other woman”: “We had an arrangement / Be discreet and don’t be blatant.” Later, on the much softer, sadder “Sleepwalking,” she laments that there’s “been no romance since we wed”—that “you let me think it was me in my head / And nothing to do with them girls in your bed.” Ouch.

Allen definitely has a way with words. But her album is hitting such a nerve, I think, not just because of its clever lyrics but also because it can be thought of as an extremely public breakup letter of sorts: sweet-revenge lemonade made from bitter lemons. Very bitter. (Paging Beyoncé.) West End Girl invites listeners to follow Allen’s relationship as it unravels, and the album sorts through all kinds of rubbish along the way. Allen’s reference to a Duane Reade bag full of sex toys is especially cheeky.

West End Girl is raw and over-the-top at times, but that’s part of the point. Breakups preceded by infidelity can be particularly gross and mean, as is the way we talk about them, to ourselves and to a salivating public. Allen’s approach is light-years away from, say, the concept of “conscious uncoupling,” which a self-satisfied Gwyneth Paltrow popularized a little over a decade ago. Sometimes, the only way past the hurt is not around the muck, but through it.

Aggrieved truth-telling as romantic warfare, especially among women, is a narrative tactic that goes back to at least the days of Shakespeare. In The Taming of the Shrew, written in the late 16th century, the “shrew” in question, Kate, tells her new husband, Petruchio, who has embarked on a project to “tame” her willfulness, “My tongue will tell the anger of my heart, or else my heart, concealing it, will break.” Kate is rebelling against Petruchio’s efforts to control her, but her words also help explain confessional outbursts from women who’ve spent too long in relationships suppressing anger.

I love this kind of dirty laundry. In 2002, I edited an anthology, a cultural history of women’s breakup letters, when my then-boyfriend disappeared on me after a pregnancy test I took came back positive. What I discovered in researching the book was that, often, women’s most powerful and wince-inducing responses are written not while a relationship is ending but after the fact, when things start falling into place—when realizations dawn and connections are drawn—and they get really and truly pissed off.

These “autopsy” letters, as I called them, are what they sound like: postmortems in which correspondents pore over and explicate the collapse of a relationship, bit by bit, point by point. They’re not diaristic entries, in which the writer is addressing herself; rather—as with Allen’s album, which uses the second-person singular in the present tense—they are typically directed at the individual she feels has wronged her. They can be both charming and ugly, semi-controlled demolitions that are fascinating to behold and deeply relatable to anyone who’s ever been mad as hell and unwilling to take it anymore.

Take Catherine Texier’s Breakup: The End of a Love Story, which is not a letter but a memoir. (I published an excerpt from it in my book.) In the late 1990s, Texier, who at that point had been married to her writer husband for nearly two decades and had two children with him, discovered that he was having an affair with his editor. How? She found the receipts. Literally. “I didn’t want to tell you about the receipts, about the page torn off your book,” Texier writes. “It seemed cheap to me, another cliché, the wife rummaging through her husband’s papers looking for evidence. I didn’t want to admit that I had played the part.” Later, she has a violent fantasy in which she smashes her husband’s head against a hard surface until it’s “pissing blood, teeth flying, your hair matted with the innards of your cortex.”

Texier’s and Allen’s autopsies unfold similarly. Both women struggle through stage after stage of emotion: shock, resentment, self-pity, anger, bargaining, self-loathing, more anger—and eventually, with luck, a little bit of acceptance, and personal responsibility too. Part of the art of airing dirty laundry lies in sullying oneself in the process. Without an admission of faults of one’s own, an outburst reads as sour grapes. In Breakup, for example, Texier doesn’t recuse herself for her part in her marriage’s dissolution or for the ugliness of her reaction to it. Neither does Allen: We see how desperate she is at times, how in denial and defensive she can be. She can also come across as pathetic, rash, immature. In one of the album’s later tracks, she admits: “I feel embarrassed, I feel ashamed / You’re so indifferent and that’s insane,” followed by “Why won’t you beg, won’t you beg for me?”

Unlike an artist such as Taylor Swift, whose breakup ballads can seem a little pat and distant, often positioning the narrator as a sort of heroine, Allen’s songs tend to make her seem, well, spiteful. Which is a good thing. As she puts it, her objective is to “lay my truth on the table.” (In fairness to Swift, the 2024 song “How Did It End,” from her album The Tortured Poets Department, is a self-described postmortem, though the target of the narrator’s ire isn’t her onetime beloved but “interlopers’ glances.”)

Listening to Allen’s lyrics, so full of dismay and bewilderment, I thought of a multidisciplinary artwork by the French photographer and writer Sophie Calle, which showed at the 2007 Venice Biennale. Inspired by a breakup letter from one of Calle’s lovers that told her to “take care of yourself”—this was also the title of the piece itself—Calle’s riposte was spirited, and a little sardonic. She asked 107 women to interpret her former lover’s letter in an effort to help her process it; those she enlisted included a psychiatrist, a singer, and a sharpshooter, who shot bullets through the letter from a distance.

A far less successful example of a public postmortem has preoccupied much of the media world in recent weeks: that of the journalist Ryan Lizza, who, through his Substack newsletter, began lobbing written grenades at his onetime fiancée, Olivia Nuzzi, just as she released a memoir that touches obliquely on her engagement-ending involvement with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whom she’d profiled as a writer for New York magazine. I don’t know about Lizza’s salacious allegations, but I do know that he does the dirty-laundry thing all wrong: His serialized revelations read as a calculated, self-serving endeavor; he doesn’t interrogate himself much. Burning it all down to settle a score only really works—engenders sympathy or understanding, for example—if you’re also dousing yourself with a little accelerant before lighting the match. (Nuzzi’s memoir, her version of a postmortem, has been interpreted as a failed attempt to turn scandal into literature. It doesn’t reveal much at all, except that she has a strange way with the English language.)

Allen’s album is much closer to Calle’s lucidly distilled autopsy—pain transmuted into rat-a-tat art—than to the written by-products of the Lizza-Nuzzi affair. West End Girl, in its captivating urgency, succeeds as art; perhaps time would have honed Allen’s insights, but I suspect that the album wouldn’t have packed the punch it did, both creatively and professionally, if she’d waited a few years to write and release it. (Allen, who recently performed songs from the album on Saturday Night Live, has confirmed reports that she is in talks to turn the album into a stage production.) And seeing a mess of real emotion—the self-doubt, the fury, the anguish—can feel like a relief these days amid the filtered idealism of our feeds: the perfect meal, the perfect vacation, the perfect marriage. There’s also something to be said for the satisfaction of holding someone, anyone, accountable at a time when accountability is in short shrift—even if it’s within the context of a lower-stakes, mildly out-of-the-ordinary story of infidelity.

As Esther Perel writes in her 2017 book, The State of Affairs: Rethinking Infidelity, “The dagger of romantic betrayal is sharp at both ends. We can use it to slash ourselves, to pinpoint our shortcomings, to underscore our self-loathing. Or we can use it to hurt back, to have the slayer experience the same excruciating pain they inflicted on us. Some people turn the dagger inward; others direct the blade toward the culprits, in real life or in fantasy. We swing from depression to indignation, from lifelessness to roaring rage, from collapse to counterattack.” You gotta start somewhere.

Depends on grading... are you testing knowledge, in which case an A from an Ivy has the same value as an A from a middle of nowhere state school (ie, a Medical Terminology class where you simply have to memorize 5000 medical terms...)

Or are you saying &quot;this student mastered this subject and performed better than their peers&quot;? Because if that is the case, a C at a MIT engineering course may well equal an A at middle-of-nowhere-U.   Because the &quot;average&quot; MIT engineer should maybe be &quot;better&quot; than the average

Because certain people get better grades because they&#39;re &quot;protected&quot; or &quot;disadvantaged,&quot; not because they earned it.

For what purpose?  Oh, there&#39;s always virtue-signalling, letting people skate while still nailing that football scholarship, and others.

The &quot;meritocracy&quot; of school has been chipped away at all levels since the 90&#39;s.  Easier to score an A without working for it.

Now it&#39;s hitting colleges, and boo-hoo, our students can&#39;t read or math, we&#39;ll still pass them anyway.

Do you actually interact with Harvard students/graduates on a regular basis, or are you saying this because TV man told you?

Yes, yes I have twice, and one was a CIO.. and lost us the biggest deal we had, and then bailed and joined one of our auditors as their CEO.  The company was then purchased and absorbed by a much bigger entity, and I was out on the streets.

A degree from Hah-vahd means shit if you lose us business and then bail out on the mess you made.

I form my own conclusions made on my own experiences.  I don&#39;t even have a TV, and I get info from many sources.  Some online, some real-world, none from Facebook or Twitter o

Harvard has offered remedial reading since 1940 or 1941 [thecrimson.com].  They recently started offering remedial math.  Stanford started offering remedial math (though they don&#39;t call it that -- MATH 18) in 2022.

considering how hard it is to get into an Ivy league college why wouldn&#39;t most of their students get As ?How hard is it if you have a parent who is an alumnus and/or donates heavily? Do you really think Trump deserved to get into Wharton?

It has been almost 20 years since I was in the entry-level hiring pipeline, but even then cover letters were on their way out. They seem to mostly be a relic from the time that people applied to jobs via snail mail. You needed a cover letter to explain what job you were applying for. Once employers switched to online portals, the need went away.

When I was on the other side of the interview a few years later, HR would rarely even send the cover letter to the hiring manager (if one ever existed). It doesn&#39;t take Chat GPT to write a droll form letter that says nothing (and there really is nothing interesting you can say in a cover letter that your resume won&#39;t). Career services used to have cover letter templates, and you&#39;d see the same variations over and over. I&#39;ve changed jobs twice in the last year (unusual circumstance due to a corporate buyout). In neither application did I send a cover letter.

The form said apply in black ink; if you applied in blue you were quickly culled...

There is still value to cover letters.  I worked at a company where we put a very simple prompt in the job req which told the applicant to do something trivial im their cover letter. If they failed to do it, we threw the application away.  It was to screen for the most basic skill of observation and to know whether or not the asshole sending in the application had even read the job req, which many folks don&#39;t do any more.  I&#39;d think we culled 30% of applicants from the go.I&#39;m going to guess the job was a make-work job you expected to receive an exceeding number of applications for.

There are plenty of ways to see if someone read the job requirements without a cover letter. Besides, silly &quot;gotcha&quot; prompts can end up screening good candidates while letting bad ones get through. Job applications for many applicants/job types have become a numbers game. It is not profitable to spend too long on any specific application. Some already employed candidates won&#39;t put much energy into their search because they don&#39;t need a job. But those may be the most desirable candidates.

No there isn&#39;t, this is 2025 not 1985. The vast majority of job applications now come from agencies who field candidates to the companies, and personal experience has shown me that applying direct through a company portal is a waste of time. You either hear nothing or it goes via an agency favoured by HR anyway.

Companies need to get together and hire someone to produce an exam given to all graduates in a particular field, sort of like an exit exam to graduate, but really an entrance exam to get a job.

If there was any difference between racial groups, or between men and women, on such an exam, it would be lawsuit-bait.  A lot of the difficulty in hiring is coming up with measures which will easily pass Civil Rights Act scrutiny while still giving good signal (it has to pass _easily_ because even if you win lawsuits every time, the cost of defense will be ruinous).  A college degree in a related field is generally accepted.  Things like programming tests for programmers are.  But the more general your tes

The UK is blessed with centrally set and marked exams at 18 that determine which university you get to attend. This means that our &#39;A levels&#39; are a real record of achievement, though there&#39;s some evidence that there&#39;s been grade inflation over the past 40 years.

Unfortunately by contrast universities get to set and mark their own exams, and we have seen appalling levels of grade inflation as a result. My own preferred solution would be to deprive almost all universities of the right to grant degrees, instead

The only way to hire is to interview candidates and then see how they do in the 90-day probationary period. An in-person interview is the only way you are going to be able to get a feeling for how someone is going to integrate into your team anyway. As for picking who to interview, just select randomly amongst the applicants who look like they meet your experiential requirements.

This isn&#39;t exactly hard or particularly complicated. Entry-level positions mean you are already expecting someone to be coming in green and will need to learn your processes and what your business does. If they seem overly obsequious, obnoxious, annoying or whatever in the interview toss them out and interview the next one.

I&#39;ve heard that everyone and their dog now requires people to use the &quot;AI&quot;. So, getting an &quot;AI&quot; resume should tell you your prospective hire has that super-essiential skill that nobody can do without. Even better, I&#39;ve heard that with the advent of the &quot;AI&quot; there is no need to hire people for entry-level jobs. So stop interviewing, fill that position with the &quot;AI&quot; that you shoot for anyway. While you&#39;re at it, fire your HR department - if you&#39;re not hiring, you don&#39;t need them.

There, you&#39;re already ahead. Shit&#39;s getting better, efficiency&#39;s going up, headcount is going down, and if you miss the 100 people you yell at every morning at the chorei, well, have that agentic whatever show up as 10 agents instead of one, or 100 and talk to all of them.

They&#39;re going to have to start giving basic in-person tests as part of the interview process.We&#39;ve already been making applicants demonstrate basic spreadsheet skills for a couple years. Civil Service exams for example.  Your degree isn&#39;t worth the paper it&#39;s printed on and we tried to warn you this was coming.

I&#39;m sure many corporate &quot;leaders&quot; are thinking that way -- &quot;let AI do it cheaper&quot;. Since the old way of working your way to the top seems to have gone by the boards, now they just want to hire experienced workers...and pay them entry level wages...

The illogic of the above approach probably doesn&#39;t even dawn on these Captains of Industry.

And I have too much of Google locked out to use Chrome anyhow.

As we watch CoPilot failures, AI browsers no one wants, a change for Firefox users to AI would be plainly a solution looking for a problem.

If Firefox can be successfully forked to a non-AI version, I&#39;ll go with that. Libre-stuff would get a great boost by navigating around the inevitable wasteland that Firefox will become.

Strangely, products taking an anti-AI stance are starting to thrive again. I hope their board notices and changes direction towards optimizing Firefox, getting rid of their new mercenary telemetry stance, and gets back to the basics of just doing an open good job.

I use LibreWolf on a couple of machines. It&#39;s OK, but it evolves slowly. They deserve the money I donated to Mozilla. But the distros don&#39;t include the LibreWolf version; Ubuntu as an example, puts in a godforsaken package island.

If the LibreOffice folks could somehow hug the LibreWolf people, distros could take a turn for the better.

I get that it&#39;s hard to keep Mozilla fundedNo it is not. The Mozilla foundation has pissed away tens of millions of dollars on &quot;features&quot; nobody asked for and which have since been removed, like Pocket which cost US$20M alone. What&#39;s hard is to keep the CEO&#39;s multi million dollar salary funded while also enabling them to waste money on things no one wants, which in turn is only done to justify their salary by looking busy.This is like claiming it&#39;s hard to keep Wikipedia funded. Again, no it is not, because they have somehow spent millions of dollar

Does anyone remember the Firefox phone OS debacle? I&#39;ll bet that one cost them tens of millions.

Because money. For years, where has most of Mozilla&#39;s revenue come from? Default search deals.

&quot;We&#39;re not incentivized to push one model or the other,&quot;

You just have to understand that what&#39;s implied is:

&quot;Yet. But we&#39;d like to be, it&#39;s for sale.&quot;

And then, unfortunately, it makes perfect sense.

Guess I&#39;ll have to switch to a de-mozillaed version of Firefox without the AI crap... or hope that the LadyBird browser takes off real fast.

As least as of today, the AI slop in Firefox is restricted to a slide out menu on left hand side that brings up a console for your LLM of choice. If you don&#39;t like it, just close the side menu and be done with it.

It&#39;s not nearly as obnoxious as Chrome or Edge, where they have a Gemini or Copilot agent reading everything on screen, eagerly waiting to offer &quot;suggestions&quot;. I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s done with the data they&#39;re scraping, but I can&#39;t imagine that they are just tossing it out without feeding at least som

So Tony here sees the rush to turn everything into an LLM front end and it is literally a no-brainer to him. Doing otherwise means answering questions about why he&#39;s ignoring &#39;the biggest tech story since&quot; whatever. It literally has nothing to do with the user.

&quot;None of us is as dumb as all of us.&quot; [despair.com]

I&#39;ve been a user since it was still called not firebird but phoenix and I&#39;ll be sorry to let it go, but if they insist...

Guess I&#39;m moving to Vivaldi then. https://vivaldi.com/ [vivaldi.com]

Every time they release an &quot;AI&quot; feature or comment they&#39;ll use the tech, user opinions are awful everywhere: on their forums, on the linked article comments, on comments from news aggregators, on social networks... But yeah, let&#39;s bet the future of the browser already on a really difficult situation on the tech nobody wants on a browser.

So that someone motivated enough will inevitably fork it without this AI shit.

He&#39;s an MBA with degrees in forensics.  MBAs invariably just jump on the latest trendy bandwagon.

The good news is that I can stop updating FF all the time on my devices.

My governor wants Americans to stop shouting “Fire!” in a crowded theater.

Generally wise advice, that. But it is hard to take him seriously when the theater is, indeed, on fire. And he has come to support one of the worst political arsonists in American history.

To be fair, Spencer Cox, the Republican governor of Utah, faces a dilemma that burdens many of his party’s leaders, especially those who were active before the rise of Donald Trump and may wish to do meaningful work after he is gone. How to behave so as to have hope that the MAGA beast you deplore might eat you last.

Cox has earned himself a lot of national media attention recently for what he calls the “Disagree Better” campaign, launched a couple of years ago with a bipartisan collective of other U.S. governors. He has appeared with Democrats including Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, and Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania to promote the idea.

The initiative took on added significance in September when the right-wing firebrand Charlie Kirk was murdered while giving an open-air talk at Utah Valley University in Orem.

Cox was right to seize the occasion to repeat his call for Americans to reject political violence, turn down the temperature, get off social media algorithms that deliberately fry your brain, and learn to talk rather than fight. He took advantage of the increased media focus to take his message to such prominent news outlets as 60 Minutes on CBS and NPR’s Morning Edition.

“I’m not asking anybody to hold hands and hug it out,” he told CBS correspondent Scott Pelley. “I’m trying to get people to stop shooting each other.”

Sensible people can raise no argument to that. And it is difficult to watch or listen to Cox and argue that he is anything but sincere.

But the governor’s peace message is all but overwhelmed by the fact that he is a member of the political party that has thrice nominated, and twice elected, as president of the United States a man whose popularity and power exist only on rising air currents of fear, prejudice, division, and violence.

Trump is a hate vampire who would instantly dissolve in the sunlight if America suddenly became a peaceful nation practicing respectful politics.

Cox seemed to see that, saying in 2016 that he was not supporting Trump due to the obvious flaws in his character.

“I think he represents the worst of what our great country stands for,” Cox said at the time.

Cox didn’t vote for Trump in 2020 either, though he recognized the president as the head of his party. He rightly and courageously blamed Trump for the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol and said the president should resign because of it.

Early on, Cox said he wasn’t going to vote for Trump (or Joe Biden) in 2024, either.

Then, after Trump survived an assassination attempt, Cox turned around. He sent a letter to the president, saying he believed that Trump had been spared death for a reason and calling on him to do the one thing that every sentient being should know Trump will never do: Bring peace.

Cox now risks seeming less visionary than gullible. Like Franklin Roosevelt imagining he could reason with Stalin at Yalta. (The Soviet dictator was, in FDR’s hopeful mind, “get-atable.”)

Maybe Cox decided not to mount what would likely be a futile frontal assault on Trump’s hateful pronouncements and policies and chose to start working a quieter long game.

Maybe he just wanted to be reelected governor.

As an opinion writer and editor for the Salt Lake Tribune, I’ve been following Cox’s career since 2013, when he was plucked from relative obscurity to fill a vacant spot as lieutenant governor.

He’s no newcomer to political comity, and has always seemed sincere promoting it.

In Utah, being lieutenant governor, which Cox was from 2013 to 2021, is a real job. It includes such administrative duties as running the state’s election mechanisms, which Cox took to heart by promoting voter registration—sometimes featuring himself in goofy person-on-the-street videos—and flawlessly implementing the state’s vote-by-mail process.

When his boss, Gov. Gary Herbert, didn’t run again in 2020, Cox rode his jus’ folks, alfalfa-farmer persona (he’s also a lawyer and a telecom executive who served as a small-town mayor and state legislator in a fast-rising political career) into the governor’s mansion.

That was also the beginning of his reputation as a political peacemaker.

He and his Democratic opponent that year, a law professor named Chris Peterson, ran a joint advertisement somewhat stylistically reminiscent of the Mac vs. PC spots from about 2006. In it, each candidate asked for your vote, but spent more time calling for political harmony.

“We can debate issues without degrading each other’s character,” Peterson said.

“We can disagree without hating each other,” Cox answered.

It was a YouTube sensation. #StandUnited.

Utah hasn’t elected a Democrat to statewide office since 1996, so whoever carries the GOP nomination has long been considered a shoo-in come November. Thus Cox was not risking anything by giving his underfunded Democratic rival some oxygen that he otherwise would not have had.

In 2024, the path to reelection was a little more fraught. Cox drew a right-wing, MAGA primary challenger and was denied the endorsement of the Utah State Republican Convention. But Cox gathered enough signatures on a nominating petition to still be on the ballot in the Republican primary, which he won with 55 percent of the vote.

In November, with that same MAGA opponent drawing 13.5 percent in a write-in bid, Cox won reelection with 53 percent of the vote.

Between the primary and the general, when politicians are generally expected to crabwalk from the extremes to the center, Cox shifted from a quiet Never Trump Republican to a supporter of Trump’s campaign to return to the White House. He went so far as to join Trump for a cringe-inducing—and, because it was so blatantly political, illegal—visit to Arlington National Cemetery.

As governor, Cox has held moderate to right-wing Republican positions that should have made renomination an easy matter. He signed legislation allowing Utahns to carry firearms without a permit. He favors reducing federal environmental regulations and rescinding the designation of national monuments—a big deal in a state where 64 percent of the land is federally owned.

He has backed attempts in the Legislature to gerrymander the state’s four congressional districts in favor of Republicans and signed a law banning the fluoridation of drinking water in the state.

He has flip-flopped on diversity, equity, and inclusion policies in state government and education institutions—was supportive, now opposes—and supports the state’s attempts to basically ban abortion.

Cox had also given touchingly humane voice to the idea that LGBTQ+ people deserve respect and in 2022 vetoed a bill that would have prohibited transgender youth from participating in school sports. (The veto was quickly overridden by the Republican supermajority in the Utah Legislature. And Cox has since signed other legislation seen as curtailing transgender rights.)

It drew national attention and led Time magazine to dub him “The Red-State Governor Who’s Not Afraid to Be ‘Woke.’ ”

Such sentiments, along with his opposition to Trump, earned him a round of boos when he addressed the Utah Republican State Convention in 2024. “Maybe you just hate that I don’t hate enough,” Cox told the delegates.

To all outward appearances, Spencer Cox has little hate in him. But if he won’t more forcefully call out the would-be dictator who thrives on negative emotions, the cure for all this political rancor won’t be disagreeing better. It will be a country where people aren’t allowed to disagree at all. And more violence will be assured.

For Gregg Phillips, Monday marked his first day as the new head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Office of Response and Recovery. For the agency, it marked the beginning of a new era: one in which a genuine conspiracy theorist holds its second-most-powerful position.

Phillips, to be clear, is no mere hobbyist when it comes to dangerous conspiracy theories. He was a major figure behind the organization True the Vote, one of the most influential sources of election-fraud misinformation during the efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Phillips and True the Vote claimed to have evidence of millions of fraudulent votes, as well as of Chinese efforts to steal the election. There was no evidence of widespread voter fraud, of course, but Phillips was reckless in his campaign, in terms of both his methods and his friends. According to the liberal watchdog group Media Matters for America, Phillips developed numerous ties to the QAnon world as he sought allies in his efforts.

On Truth Social, he repeatedly shared posts from accounts with Q-related logos or names and screen grabs from Q drops, the messages left behind by the purported “Q” figure. He also posted directly to praise known QAnon influencers as friends and clever investigators. He appeared as a guest on several QAnon podcasts and even participated in QAnon’s “Flannel Fridays,” a symbol of solidarity with the movement. He made at least a dozen appearances on the Matrixxx Grooove Show, a livestream hosted by two QAnon supporters. He and the founder of True the Vote put on an event in Arizona that courted QAnon influencers, allowing over a dozen such influencers to network in person. He praised them all as patriots ready to expose the ways in which the “enemy” had stolen millions of votes from Donald Trump. Phillips, in other words, peddles in MAGA fantasies.

This appointment would have been a worrying one for any governmental department—the position, which oversee’s the agency’s largest division, does not require congressional approval—but it’s especially concerning when paired with FEMA. That’s because FEMA, more than just about any other agency, is a central entity in some of the oldest right-wing conspiracy theories about ambitiously menacing government schemes, which include everything from secret prison camps to human-caused hurricanes.

Beyond being ridiculous, experts say, having a conspiracy theorist leading the core work of a conspiracy theory–targeted entity could be dangerous. There are real reasons to worry that a person dismissive of mainstream expertise could derail the work of nonpartisan bureaucrats trying to protect the public. He could sideline technical experts, delay action during time-sensitive emergencies, and undermine important communication from the agency. And he could find innovative new ways to disrupt the agency’s work.

We have seen this play out already, in other personnel decisions from the Trump administration. Kash Patel runs the FBI, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. oversees the Health and Human Services Department. Both were chosen because they were convinced that evil had taken root in their respective agencies. During this second Trump administration, Kennedy’s pursuit of his convictions has been catastrophic: The administration has already rolled back vaccine mandates and helped cause deadly epidemics. Patel has inflicted less direct harm on the public, but he purged the bureau’s ranks and replaced them with loyalists, seriously compromising the trustworthiness of federal law enforcement.

So the question is what a similarly minded person could do in a place of such power in the country’s disaster-response agency. This will depend in part on what the administration decides to do with FEMA, as it is considering a major reorganization. But if FEMA remains the nation’s primary emergency-response infrastructure, and if it remains the central source of intel and coordination as climate change exacerbates extreme weather events, the presence of a conspiracy theorist in its top ranks could do very real harm. If a crusader with a paranoid mindset manages to remake FEMA’s disaster recovery into an arena for his grievances, it will mark the end of one of the most urgently nonpartisan roles of the federal government, a historic place of bipartisan agreement on the need to help suffering Americans, no matter who they are.

It makes some intuitive sense that FEMA would attract conspiracy theories, given that it’s the entity that’s most activated in times of crisis and confusion.

Ever since the 1980s and ’90s, people have theorized that FEMA was building secret prison camps to hold U.S. citizens upon the imposition of martial law; that it was planning to create major natural disasters in order to sow chaos nationwide and seize power; that it was setting up a surveillance state by inserting chips or other devices at agency “processing centers”; that it was testing out mind-control technologies or other sinister efforts when running emergency-alert-system tests; or that it would, in some other way, act as the supervillainy arm of whatever dark forces run the government or are plotting to take it over.

But these particular conspiracy theories, long fodder for the paranoid Alex Jones types, have moved toward the mainstream in recent years. They were boosted by QAnon during the general growth of American paranoia during the pandemic. Social media created incentives for content creators to spout engagement-baiting nonsense. And A.I. has obliterated our ability, as a general public, to distinguish reality from computer-generated fiction. As a result, the fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, and other disasters that are becoming more frequent and more severe have reliably been followed by a flood of theories of FEMA’s malfeasance. Sometimes the old theories are regurgitated, with grainy videos of purported FEMA prison camps; other times, new pieces of information become the kernels at the core of new panicked rumors.

This is obviously not ideal. If people don’t trust the agency, they may not seek out its aid. They may heed warnings related to certain hazards in their environment. They may not listen when they are told to evacuate. In some cases, they may become desperate and turn to violence: One armed man was arrested last year for threatening agency employees in North Carolina, having been convinced by social media misinformation that FEMA was withholding supplies from storm victims.

“When you have this anti-science sentiment, which is intertwined with conspiracy theories, it worsens disaster outcomes across the board,” said Njoki Mwarumba, a professor of emergency management at Empire State University.

Having an anti-science figure in charge of disaster response will almost certainly make this situation worse, experts say. But this is not because Phillips will necessarily spread such conspiracy theories himself: Although it’s not out of the realm of possibility that Phillips would do so, there’s no evidence he believes in FEMA conspiracy theories. He has in the past expressed his opposition to FEMA’s existence, arguing that disaster response should instead be handled by local and state governments, but nothing has surfaced indicating he believes that the agency is pursuing a new world order. And because FEMA theories are so out there, they are presumably impossible to maintain once you’re inside the institution. A plot to take over the federal government or depopulate the country with a supervirus should be easy to sniff out from the top.

Instead, Phillips’ danger is in eroding public trust in the agency, leaving more room for conspiracy theories to flourish. Phillips has no experience in federal emergency management. He has also been accused of ethical misconduct multiple times in his professional career, including in his handling of government contracts in Mississippi and Texas; his financial management of True the Vote’s funds; and fundraising for a mobile hospital in Ukraine that never materialized. And given his pattern of acting purely on partisan motivation, it seems very possible that he will run his office on political priorities rather than data-driven analysis. That could mean that his version of FEMA’s response and recovery efforts will be inherently less trustworthy.

Putting a skeptic in charge of the agency, in other words, will make it less effective—and therefore legitimately more worthy of skepticism.

“When you can’t rely on the government or don’t trust the government, it further fuels conspiracy theories,” said Alice Marwick, the director of research at the nonprofit Data & Society. “It’s this horrible ouroboros.”

It’s reasonable to wonder if there’s a silver lining here. If a QAnon guy is tasked with overseeing a QAnon-suspected agency, wouldn’t that be reassuring to his fellow truthers?

This was a question that came up when Patel was placed in charge of the FBI. It seemed reasonable to assume that once Patel realized that there was no cabal running the bureau, he would be able to calm everyone down.

Instead, Patel, bumping up against the reality of bureaucracy, was forced into some awkward contortions, trying to convince people he was doing their work by firing Trump critics inside the agency, but ultimately unable to make good on any promises to dig up proof of treachery within the agency or release the promised Epstein files. Instead of deflating the conspiracy theories, this caused people to turn on Patel.

This reality is the same with the FEMA theories, Marwick said. “Where conspiracies don’t match the daily reality, you can have an immediate breakdown,” she said. “Conspiracy theorists will never be satisfied until someone shows them it’s controlled by the illuminati or a cabal or the Freemasons. So there’s no satisfactory resolution to this situation.”

And once the leader is unable to expose the corruption and reform the agency in the way the theorists want, that failure further proves the deep corruption of the system, she said. It reinforces public cynicism more than anything else.

Having an extremely partisan person in the position might instead encourage conspiracy theories from residents of blue states. Already, the Trump administration has weaponized grant funding for its own means. It is threatening to withhold Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits from Democratic-led states over their refusal to share recipients’ immigration status. It slashed $8 billion in funding for green projects in Democratic states. And a judge blocked the administration’s effort to reallocate $233 million in FEMA disaster-relief funds away from a dozen blue states without explanation. The states accused the administration of targeting them for not backing Trump in the election.

And if draft proposals for “Fema 2.0” are any indication, the administration hopes to shift some of its funding toward block grants, in which pots of money are distributed by some to-be-determined metrics to individual states. Under that scenario, says Jeffrey Pellegrino, a professor of emergency management and homeland security at the University of Akron, the size of those pots could certainly be politically driven. That would inherently give blue-state residents reason to raise questions.

It’s unlikely these residents would jump from being suspicious of Trump’s FEMA to believing that the agency is about to round them all up in prison camps, turning into some kind of liberal version of Alex Jones. But this kind of politicization does shorten the distance between reality and conspiracy theory. It’s something we’ve never seen before, Pellegrino says. FEMA has historically fluctuated in efficacy depending on the president’s own sense of its urgency, he says, but it has never been all that tainted by partisan politics—as past administrators have always believed that natural disasters are not a partisan issue.

“But that seems to have gone by the wayside with the current administration,” he said.

Phillips will likely not be the RFK Jr. of FEMA. The far-out FEMA conspiracy theories, unlike “Vaccines Cause Autism,” are not particularly actionable. You can ban vaccines, but you cannot halt the building of prison camps that don’t actually exist or dismantle fictional offices that run mind-control programs. Nor will he be its Kash Patel, as he won’t be able to find as many exciting ways to weaponize the agency or root out politically charged projects; disaster management is simply more bureaucratic and less controversial.

The most important questions about FEMA currently concern its scope and, frankly, its survival while under assault from the administration. But having a committed conspiracy theorist in one of the most important positions in an organization long plagued by conspiracy-theory accusations only proves how little the administration cares about public trust. As climate change continues to make natural disasters worse, as the administration refuses to grapple with the dangers of A.I., and as severe cuts to nonpartisan agencies debilitate their relief and prevention work, conspiracy theories about FEMA will continue to proliferate. Disasters are frightening and destabilizing. They’re the kinds of events that naturally breed misinformation and confusion. In that scenario, you need an agency led by people who respond to crises with reason and levelheadedness in order to mitigate conspiratorial thinking. A responsible administrator might be counted on to stem that paranoia, to—at a critical moment—pull people back from their worst impulses. But Phillips has spent years preying on those impulses, and there’s little reason to hope he’ll stop now.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Six months after EU regulators found Apple&#39;s App Store rules in breach of the Digital Markets Act (DMA), developers say Cupertino is still behaving as if compliance were optional.

The Coalition for App Fairness, a nonprofit organization of app developers and consumer groups, has accused Apple of persistent non-compliance with the DMA, warning that the company&#39;s revised App Store terms continue to impose fees which the legislation prohibits.

In an open letter addressed to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and senior commissioners, the coalition argues that Apple has failed to deliver &quot;any meaningful changes or proposals&quot; despite an April 2025 non-compliance decision that found its App Store policies illegal and harmful to both developers and consumers.

At the heart of the complaint is money. The DMA requires so-called gatekeepers to allow developers to offer and conduct transactions outside their app stores without charge. Apple, the coalition claims, is seeking to charge commissions of up to 20 percent on those very transactions.

&quot;This is a blatant disregard for the law with the potential to vanquish years of meaningful work by the Commission,&quot; the letter states, accusing Apple of preserving the economics of its App Store while nominally claiming compliance.

Apple has said it will roll out new App Store terms in January 2026, but developers say the company has provided no clarity on what those changes will involve or whether they will actually comply with the DMA.

&quot;We have seen this playbook before in Europe and beyond,&quot; the signatories warn, adding that they suspect any new terms will continue to impose fees that would violate the law.

The letter argues that this uncertainty is already doing damage. Six months after Apple&#39;s last App Store terms update, developers still do not know which rules will govern their businesses or what their costs will look like in the near term.

Apple&#39;s &quot;lack of transparency in tandem with its rushed timelines,&quot; the coalition says, is freezing investment and innovation, effectively allowing the company to &quot;exploit its gatekeeper position by holding the entire industry hostage.&quot;

The group also points to a growing transatlantic contrast that makes Europe look like the tougher regulator with the weaker results. While Apple continues to fight DMA enforcement in the EU, US courts have moved to curb its ability to extract fees from external transactions. Following litigation brought by Epic Games, developers in the US can now communicate freely with customers about pricing and offer payment options outside Apple&#39;s ecosystem without paying commission.

That raises what the coalition calls a &quot;simple and urgent question.&quot; Why should European developers and consumers get a worse deal than their US counterparts, especially when the EU was first to pass a landmark law aimed at fixing digital markets? The letter argues that meaningful enforcement of the DMA would strengthen Europe&#39;s digital competitiveness and attract global investment, while weak enforcement risks turning the regulation into an expensive paper exercise.

&quot;We trust the Commission will uphold the DMA,&quot; the signatories conclude, but they warn that if enforcement falls short, they will continue pressing policymakers to ensure Apple finally complies with the law as written – not as rewritten by Cupertino. ®

            <h2>US freezes $42B trade pact with UK over digital tax row</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/16/us_uk_trade_deal/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The US government has put a proposed $42 billion (£31 billion) trade pact with the UK on ice because the European country has yet to budge on its Digital Services Tax (DST).

In September, the two English-speaking nations agreed the trade pact – with promised investment from Microsoft, Google, and other tech players – in the hope the UK would see a cash injection funding datacenters and other infrastructure.

Under the alliance, the UK and US set up technology sharing agreements in the fields of AI, quantum computing, and nuclear research, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said.

&quot;This Tech Prosperity Deal marks a generational step change in our relationship with the US, shaping the futures of millions of people on both sides of the Atlantic,&quot; he said in a statement.

It followed a trade treaty in May – the so-called Economic Prosperity Deal – in which the US wanted to increase food exports to the UK, some of which are currently held back by food safety standards. The US also wanted to see the UK water down online safety rules and DST.

According to a report in the New York Times, US officials have become increasingly frustrated with a lack of progress on both fronts and the Tech Prosperity Deal is now on hold.

A UK spokesperson said both sides agreed to further negotiations in January.

In the Autumn Budget last month, the UK government said it would continue to collect the DST, a 2 percent levy on some of the revenue accrued by search engines, social media, and online marketplaces.

The UK collected just £800 million in Digital Services Tax (DST) from companies such as Amazon, Google, Meta, eBay, and TikTok in the most recent tax year, according to figures released with the Budget. It aims to collect £1.4 billion in 2030-31 and raise £7.3 billion over the next six years.

Some argue this is a trifling sum compared to the revenue generated by Big Tech companies in the UK. Amazon, for example, generated around £29 billion in UK sales for 2024. Google&#39;s total UK revenue from search alone is estimated at around £15 billion, gained from its 90 percent share in the search market. Meta&#39;s Facebook UK revenue is estimated at around £3.1 billion. It&#39;s worth noting that the tax does not apply to all of these companies&#39; UK revenue.

Campaigners TaxWatch argued the DST should be retained and the revenue collected between 2024 and 2029 is equivalent to the cost of training between 108,000 and 128,000 new nurses, or a quarter of the nursing workforce.

Caitlin Boswell, head of advocacy and policy, said: &quot;The UK government should be crystal clear that it won&#39;t give tax breaks to Big Tech companies and concede to pressure from Donald Trump. The US President is trying to strong-arm countries into getting his way on taxes and tariffs, but the British public won&#39;t have it and neither should the Prime Minister.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Frenzied demand for AI development is driving a wave of datacenter construction, but new projects are facing growing public opposition over concerns about their impact on local communities and the environment.

Controversy has erupted in Coweta County, Georgia, after climate advocacy group DeSmog alleged that county officials held private meetings with lobbyists representing the developer of a proposed datacenter project.

In August, The Register reported that the county, located near Atlanta, had imposed a moratorium on datacenter approvals while it gathered input from stakeholders on proposed planning regulations.

Residents expressed opposition to &quot;Project Sail,&quot; a $17 billion facility that would occupy approximately 831 acres of rural land, while lobbyists supporting the project were accused of attempting to weaken regulatory provisions, including those related to environmental impact assessments.

DeSmog now says that both real estate biz Prologis, the developer behind Project Sail, and the owner of the land, Atlas Development, are seeking to influence Coweta County officials via in-person meetings and email correspondence.

It claims community representatives were not afforded the same level of access, and were told they could not speak to county officials by phone, but must instead communicate via group email.

Hundreds of residents mobilized to oppose the project in a bid to conserve the area&#39;s rural character, while more than 3,900 people are registered on a &quot;STOP Project Sail&quot; Facebook page.

Coweta County is understood to be considering its draft datacenter ordinance on December 16, with a final vote possible.

Elsewhere in America, Data Center Watch, which tracks grassroots opposition to server farms, claims that $64 billion worth of projects have already been blocked or delayed by a growing wave of local community actions.

In Pennsylvania, those opposed to new datacenters outnumber supporters, according to a report in The Philadelphia Inquirer. It said several projects were recently proposed in the region, and many faced neighborhood pushback.

Environmental organization The Sierra Club took out a full-page ad in the Indianapolis Star in Indiana, calling on the leaders of the largest technology companies to ensure their datacenters are powered by clean energy.

The letter says Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft have collectively built facilities capable of consuming more electricity than four million American homes, driving a rash of new fossil fuel power plants and keeping dirty coal-fired plants online.

It accuses them of standing by while President Trump slashed the renewable energy projects they previously said they wanted, and calls on them to follow their stated climate goals and push for an affordable and reliable decarbonized grid that benefits all.

And it isn&#39;t just the US where people are starting to question the wave of datacenter builds. In Essex, England, Epping Forest District Council has just approved Google&#39;s outline plans for a facility on part of North Weald Airfield, a former RAF base, despite opposition from residents.

According to local media, concerns were raised about the project&#39;s impact on airfield operations and its potential to reduce space for stalls at the market held on-site every Saturday.

There is also skepticism that the 100-200 jobs promised at the facility would go to local people, rather than IT professionals moving in from elsewhere.

Growing public antipathy toward the wave of new datacenter projects and how to address it was discussed earlier this year at the Datacloud Global Congress in Cannes, France.

&quot;We have communities that don&#39;t want us there,&quot; complained Val Walsh, Microsoft&#39;s VP for Cloud Operations & Innovation.

The panel of industry representatives felt there is a need for education, so the public is better informed about what datacenters actually do and the applications and industries that depend upon them. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Meta is starting to test a new Instagram app for TVs that lets you watch Reels on a big screen. The app will be available first as a pilot for Amazon Fire TV devices in the US starting Tuesday.

The homescreen of the Reels-focused app will show personalized, horizontal collections of videos to browse through. Click into a thumbnail and you’ll see the full portrait video, a caption on one side, and stats such as likes and shares on the other. Like with Reels on your phone, the next video swipes up from the bottom of the screen.

“You can watch Reels from the accounts you follow as well as popular and recommended content tailored to your interests,” Instagram spokesperson Christine Pai tells The Verge. “When you log in, you’ll see rows of Channels, which are Reels grouped by topic, theme, and/or trends. Channels make it easy to explore specific interests like sports, cooking, music, or seasonal events, without searching for individual creators. Some Channels highlight trending content across Instagram, while others are personalized based on your activity.”

From the TV app, you can also use search to “find your favorite creators, browse profiles centered on Reels, and explore anything you are interested in,” Instagram says in a blog post. In the TV app, you can log in to up to five accounts “so everyone in your home can enjoy a personalized way to watch Reels.” Down the line, Instagram may add features to the app like using a phone as a remote and “a more intuitive way to channel surf.”

The app is launching first in the US, and it will support “most Fire TV Stick devices and Fire TV Series 2 and Omni TVs,” according to Pai. As Instagram learns from the test, “we will expand to more devices and countries,” per the blog post.

Instagram is a few years behind YouTube in bringing vertical short-form video to TV. But the TV is starting to become an increasingly important battleground, with TikTok reportedly working on a TV app, Netflix investing more in creator-led shows and video podcasts, and YouTube launching a Netflix-like overhaul for its TV apps.

Netflix is teaming up with iHeartMedia to add more than one dozen video podcasts to its library.

Netflix is plowing ahead with plans to build out a library of video podcasts as it aims to keep viewers locked into the service even when they may not be watching what’s on their screens. On Tuesday, Netflix announced that it’s teaming up with radio giant iHeartMedia to add more than 15 video podcasts to its platform in the US next year, including My Favorite Murder, The Breakfast Club, Bobby Bones Presents: The Bobbycast, and more.

The agreement comes as Netflix’s rivalry with YouTube — its biggest competitor and the most popular podcast platform — continues heating up. Under the deal, iHeartMedia video podcasts will no longer appear in their entirety on YouTube, company spokesperson Jenn Powers confirmed to The Verge. Netflix will also get access to new podcast episodes, along with “select” episodes from each show’s library.

Netflix already struck a deal with Spotify in October, which will bring 16 shows like The Bill Simmons Podcast and Conspiracy Theories to the streaming service in 2026. Other titles that are part of Netflix’s deal with iHeartMedia include the Chelsea Handler-hosted Dear Chelsea; This Is Important with Adam Devine, Anders Holm, and Blake Anderson; Joe and Jada, featuring Fat Joe and Jadakiss; and The Psychology of Your 20s. The shows will also be available in the US starting in early 2026, before rolling out to other countries.

iHeartMedia still holds audio-only rights and distribution for these podcasts and says they will “continue to be available on iHeartRadio and everywhere podcasts are heard.”

            <div id="article-text">TVs made by Sony, Samsung, LG, Hisense, and TCL are part of a ‘mass surveillance system,’ Attorney General Ken Paxton alleges.

TVs made by Sony, Samsung, LG, Hisense, and TCL are part of a ‘mass surveillance system,’ Attorney General Ken Paxton alleges.

Texas is suing five of the biggest TV makers, accusing them of “secretly recording what consumers watch in their own homes.” In separate lawsuits filed on Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton claims the TVs made by Sony, Samsung, LG, Hisense, and TCL are part of a “mass surveillance system” that uses Automatic Content Recognition (ACR) to collect personal data used for targeted advertising.

ACR uses visual and audio data to identify what you’re watching on TV, including shows and movies on streaming services and cable TV, YouTube videos, Blu-ray discs, and more. Attorney General Paxton alleges that ACR also captures security and doorbell camera streams, media sent using Apple AirPlay or Google Cast, as well as the displays of other devices connected to the TV’s HDMI port, such as laptops and game consoles.

The lawsuit accuses Samsung, Sony, LG, Hisense, and TCL of “deceptively” prompting users to activate ACR, while “disclosures are hidden, vague, and misleading.” Samsung and Hisense, for example, capture screenshots of a TV’s display “every 500 milliseconds,” Paxton claims. The lawsuit alleges that TV manufacturers siphon viewing data back to each company “without the user’s knowledge or consent,” which they can then sell for targeted advertising.

Along with these allegations, Attorney General Paxton also raises concerns about TCL and Hisense’s ties to China, as they’re both based in the country. The lawsuit claims the TVs made by both companies are “Chinese-sponsored surveillance devices, recording the viewing habits of Texans at every turn.”

Attorney General Paxton accuses the five TV makers of violating the state’s Deceptive Trade Practices Act, which is meant to protect consumers from false, deceptive, or misleading practices. Paxton asks the court to impose a civil penalty and to block each company from collecting, sharing, or selling the ACR data they collect about Texas-based consumers. Samsung, Sony, LG, Hisense, and TCL didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Vizio, which is now owned by Walmart, paid $2.2 million to the Federal Trade Commission and New Jersey in 2017 over similar allegations related to ACR.

“This conduct is invasive, deceptive, and unlawful,” Paxton says in a statement. “The fundamental right to privacy will be protected in Texas because owning a television does not mean surrendering your personal information to Big Tech or foreign adversaries.”

            <h2>Creating psychological safety in the AI era</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/16/1125899/creating-psychological-safety-in-the-ai-era/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Rolling out enterprise-grade AI means climbing two steep cliffs at once. First, understanding and implementing the tech itself. And second, creating the cultural conditions where employees can maximize its value. While the technical hurdles are signiﬁcant, the human element can be even more consequential; fear and ambiguity can stall momentum of even the most promising initiatives.

Psychological safety—feeling free to express opinions and take calculated risks without worrying about career repercussions1—is essential for successful AI adoption. In psychologically safe workspaces, employees are empowered to challenge assumptions and raise concerns about new tools without fear of reprisal. This is nothing short of a necessity when introducing a nascent and profoundly powerful technology that still lacks established best practices.

“Psychological safety is mandatory in this new era of AI,” says Rafee Tarafdar, executive vice president and chief technology officer at Infosys. “The tech itself is evolving so fast—companies have to experiment, and some things will fail. There needs to be a safety net.”

To gauge how psychological safety influences success with enterprise-level AI, MIT Technology Review Insights conducted a survey of 500 business leaders. The ﬁndings reveal high self-reported levels of psychological safety, but also suggest that fear still has a foothold. Anecdotally, industry experts highlight a reason for the disconnect between rhetoric and reality: while organizations may promote a safe to experiment message publicly, deeper cultural undercurrents can counteract that intent.

Building psychological safety requires a coordinated, systems-level approach, and human resources (HR) alone cannot deliver such transformation. Instead, enterprises must deeply embed psychological safety into their collaboration processes.

It was researched, designed, and written by human writers, editors, analysts, and illustrators. This includes the writing of surveys and collection of data for surveys. AI tools that may have been used were limited to secondary production processes that passed thorough human review.

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you’ll see it’s a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

A conversation with a chatbot can shift people&#39;s political views—but the most persuasive models also spread the most misinformation.

Some disillusionment was inevitable. When OpenAI released a free web app called ChatGPT in late 2022, it changed the course of an entire industry—and several world economies. Millions of people started talking to their computers, and their computers started talking back. We were enchanted, and we expected more.Well, 2025 has been a year of reckoning. For a start, the heads of the top AI companies made promises they couldn’t keep. At the same time, updates to the core technology are no longer the step changes they once were.To be clear, the last few years have been filled with genuine “Wow” moments. But this remarkable technology is only a few years old, and in many ways it is still experimental. Its successes come with big caveats. Read the full story to learn more about why we may need to readjust our expectations.

This story is part of our new Hype Correction package, a collection of stories designed to help you reset your expectations about what AI makes possible—and what it doesn’t.

Quantum navigation could solve the military’s GPS jamming problem

Since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thousands of flights have been affected by a far-reaching Russian campaign of using radio transmissions that jammed its GPS system.The growing inconvenience to air traffic and risk of a real disaster have highlighted the vulnerability of GPS and focused attention on more secure ways for planes to navigate the gauntlet of jamming and spoofing, the term for tricking a GPS receiver into thinking it’s somewhere else.One approach that’s emerging from labs is quantum navigation: exploiting the quantum nature of light and atoms to build ultra-sensitive sensors that can allow vehicles to navigate independently, without depending on satellites.

            <div id="article-text">Can I ask you a question: How do you feel about AI right now? Are you still excited? When you hear that OpenAI or Google just dropped a new model, do you still get that buzz? Or has the shine come off it, maybe just a teeny bit? Come on, you can be honest with me.

Truly, I feel kind of stupid even asking the question, like a spoiled brat who has too many toys at Christmas. AI is mind-blowing. It’s one of the most important technologies to have emerged in decades (despite all its many many drawbacks and flaws and, well, issues).

At the same time I can&#39;t help feeling a little bit: Is that it?

If you feel the same way, there’s good reason for it: The hype we have been sold for the past few years has been overwhelming. We were told that AI would solve climate change. That it would reach human-level intelligence. That it would mean we no longer had to work!

Instead we got AI slop, chatbot psychosis, and tools that urgently prompt you to write better email newsletters. Maybe we got what we deserved. Or maybe we need to reevaluate what AI is for.

That’s the reality at the heart of a new series of stories, published today, called Hype Correction. We accept that AI is still the hottest ticket in town, but it’s time to re-set our expectations.

As my colleague Will Douglas Heaven puts it in the package’s intro essay, “You can’t help but wonder: When the wow factor is gone, what’s left? How will we view this technology a year or five from now? Will we think it was worth the colossal costs, both financial and environmental?”

Elsewhere in the package, James O’Donnell looks at Sam Altman, the ultimate AI hype man, through the medium of his own words. And Alex Heath explains the AI bubble, laying out for us what it all means and what we should look out for.

Michelle Kim analyzes one of the biggest claims in the AI hype cycle: that AI would completely eliminate the need for certain classes of jobs. If ChatGPT can pass the bar, surely that means it will replace lawyers? Well, not yet, and maybe not ever.

Similarly, Edd Gent tackles the big question around AI coding. Is it as good as it sounds? Turns out the jury is still out. And elsewhere David Rotman looks at the real-world work that needs to be done before AI materials discovery has its breakthrough ChatGPT moment.

Meanwhile, Garrison Lovely spends time with some of the biggest names in the AI safety world and asks: Are the doomers still okay? I mean, now that people are feeling a bit less scared about their impending demise at the hands of superintelligent AI? And Margaret Mitchell reminds us that hype around generative AI can blind us to the AI breakthroughs we should really celebrate.

Let’s remember: AI was here before ChatGPT and it will be here after. This hype cycle has been wild, and we don’t know what its lasting impact will be. But AI isn’t going anywhere. We shouldn&#39;t be so surprised that those dreams we were sold haven’t come true—yet.

The more likely story is that the real winners, the killer apps, are still to come. And a lot of money is being bet on that prospect. So yes: The hype could never sustain itself over the short term. Where we’re at now is maybe the start of a post-hype phase. In an ideal world, this hype correction will reset expectations.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.

A few decades ago, when I was raising funding for a startup, I made a lasting impression on an investor by not only talking about how successful we would be, but also highlighting what would happen if we weren’t. Later, in an informal setting, I asked him what had persuaded him to invest in us. He told me that during the pitch, I had said, “And if all our predictions and expectations are wrong, we will use the last of our funding for a magnificent farewell dinner for all our investors. You’ll have lost your money, but at least you’ll get a great evening for it in return.”

I don’t recall this being part of the original pitch or my strategy. I probably just blurted it out to break the ice, but it impressed the investor. He told me it was refreshing to speak to an entrepreneur who was not blinded by his own pitch. The fact that I had a scenario ready for both success and failure told him that I was honest and realistic.

Now, the startup was not successful, but we still had a nice, opulent dinner with the investors at the end — and we did them one better. As soon as we realised that our predictions and expectations were wrong, we made our investors an offer: we could struggle and pivot and hope for a miracle, or we could return what was left of our funding to our investors. We preferred option two, and so did they, so everybody got some money back (about 40% of what they had invested), as well as a lovely evening with excellent food and drinks. When we raised money for another startup a few years later, almost all of them signed up in our first round.

Obviously, I would have preferred to have made this startup a success instead, but I still regard it as a successful endeavour. I gave it a try and had a plan ready for when my experiment didn’t work out, and in the process, I built relationships that outlasted that one startup.

As you may have read, The Next Web, the company I founded in 2006, is nearing the end of its lifecycle. The events and media business is being wound down, and only TNW Spaces will live on. TNW Programs was sold off a while ago and will continue as well. There won’t be another TNW Conference, and soon there won’t be new articles on the site; people are losing their jobs, including me. It’s a painful process, but I guess I’m taking it well because it also feels natural and logical. When we sold TNW to the FT in 2019, we were very ambitious and optimistic, and surely I would’ve liked for the company and brand to outlive me. However, when the business struggled, I also felt very comfortable with the company ending graciously.

When you’re reading a good book, there’s a moment near the end when you’ll start reading slower because you don’t want it to end. I love those moments, because I’ll know it’s been a good experience. But then you also know that good stories need good endings. So, this is the ending of a great story that I’ve enjoyed participating in.

I’ll keep writing, but this will be my last official TNW story. I’d love it if you would subscribe to my writing over at Substack. It will be less tech-focused, more unpredictable, but just as insightful as before.
