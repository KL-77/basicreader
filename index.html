            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Blue Origin confirmed Thursday that the next launch of its New Glenn rocket will carry a large communications satellite into low-Earth orbit for AST SpaceMobile.

The rocket will launch the next-generation Block 2 BlueBird satellite “no earlier than late February” from Launch Complex 36 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.

However, the update from Blue Origin appears to have buried the real news toward the end: “The mission follows the successful NG-2 mission, which included the landing of the ‘Never Tell Me The Odds’ booster. The same booster is being refurbished to power NG-3,” the company said.

The second New Glenn mission launched on November 13, just 10 weeks ago. If the company makes the late-February target for the next mission—and Ars was told last week to expect the launch to slip into March—it will represent a remarkably short turnaround for an orbital booster.

By way of comparison, SpaceX did not attempt to refly the first Falcon 9 booster it landed in December 2015. Instead, initial tests revealed that the vehicle’s interior had been somewhat torn up. It was scrapped and inspected closely so that engineers could learn from the wear and tear.

SpaceX successfully landed its second Falcon 9 booster in April 2016, on the 23rd overall flight of the Falcon 9 fleet. This booster was refurbished and, after a lengthy series of inspections, it was reflown successfully in March 2017, nearly 11 months later.

With New Glenn, Blue Origin is seeking to refly a booster on just the third overall flight of the New Glenn fleet and turn the rocket around in less than four months. Even for a well-capitalized program with the benefit of learning from both Blue Origin’s own suborbital New Shepard rocket and the industry’s experience with the Falcon 9, this represents an impressive turnaround in first stage reuse.

Blue Origin originally planned to launch its MK1 lunar lander on the third flight of New Glenn, but it pivoted to a commercial launch as the lunar vehicle continues preparatory work.

On Wednesday, the company announced that it had completed the integration of the MK1 vehicle and put it on a barge bound for Johnson Space Center in Houston. There, it will undergo vacuum chamber testing before a launch later this spring—or, more likely, sometime this summer.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/01/google-ai-mode-can-now-customize-responses-with-your-email-and-photos/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google believes AI is the future of search, and it’s not shy about saying it. After adding account-level personalization to Gemini earlier this month, it’s now updating AI Mode with so-called “Personal Intelligence.” According to Google, this makes the bot’s answers more useful because they are tailored to your personal context.

Starting today, the feature is rolling out to all users who subscribe to Google AI Pro or AI Ultra. However, it will be a Labs feature that needs to be explicitly enabled (subscribers will be prompted to do this). Google tends to expand access to new AI features to free accounts later on, so free users will most likely get access to Personal Intelligence in the future. Whenever this option does land on your account, it’s entirely optional and can be disabled at any time.

If you decide to integrate your data with AI Mode, the search bot will be able to scan your Gmail and Google Photos. That’s less extensive than the Gemini app version, which supports Gmail, Photos, Search, and YouTube history. Gmail will probably be the biggest contributor to AI Mode—a great many life events involve confirmation emails. Traditional search results when you are logged in are adjusted based on your usage history, but this goes a step further.

If you’re going to use AI Mode to find information, Personal Intelligence could actually be quite helpful. When you connect data from other Google apps, Google’s custom Gemini search model will instantly know about your preferences and background—that’s the kind of information you’d otherwise have to include in your search query to get the best output. With Personal Intelligence, AI Mode can just pull those details from your email or photos.

For example, as in the video below, you could ask about clothing options for an upcoming trip. Instead of telling the robot when and where you’re going in the prompt, it can get that information from your email confirmation. When AI Mode uses your personal context in a response, it will cite it in-line the same way it does for websites.

Google says, as it often does, that AI is not perfect. AI Mode with Personal Intelligence can make mistakes, drawing the wrong conclusions from the data it mines from your account. In that case, Google suggests using a follow-up prompt to correct it and get more accurate information. It’s similar to the way you might refine a traditional Google search when the links aren’t to your liking.

AI Mode and Google AI are generally supposed to improve over time to reduce such failures. The way you use the service contributes to that, but Google says the model is not being trained directly on your email or photos, even if you connect them to AI Mode. Instead, Google uses your prompts and the resulting output to train its AI models. Access to Gmail and Photos can be revoked at any time, but it sounds like there won’t be a simple way to toggle off Personal Intelligence for a single query, which is possible in Gemini.</div>

            <h2>Finally, a new controller that solves the Switch 2's "flat Joy-Con" problem</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/finally-a-new-controller-that-solves-the-switch-2s-flat-joy-con-problem/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When I reviewed the Switch 2 back in June, I noted that the lack of any sort of extended grip on the extremely thin Joy-Con 2 controllers made them relatively awkward to hold, both when connected to the system and when cradled in separate hands. At the time, I said that “my Switch 2 will probably need something like the Nyxi Hyperion Pro, which I’ve come to rely on to make portable play on the original Switch much more comfortable.”

Over half a year later, Nyxi is once again addressing my Switch controller-related comfort concerns with the Hyperion 3, which was made available for preorder earlier this week ahead of planned March 1 shipments. Unfortunately, it looks like players will have to pay a relatively high price for a potentially more ergonomic Switch 2 experience.

While there are plenty of third-party controllers for the Switch 2, none of the current options mimic the official Joy-Cons’ ability to connect magnetically to the console tablet itself (controllers designed to slide into the grooves on the original Switch tablet also can’t hook to the successor console). The Hyperion 3 is the first Switch 2 controller to offer this magnetic connection, making it uniquely suited for handheld play on the system.

And although I haven’t held the Hyperion 3 in my hands yet, my experience with the similar Hyperion 2 on the original Switch suggests that the ergonomic design here will be a welcome upgrade from the relatively small buttons and cramp-inducing flat back of the official Switch 2 Joy-Cons (“Say Goodbye to Tendonitis,” as Nyxi claims in its marketing materials). The controller can also connect wirelessly via Bluetooth 5.0 for when you want to switch to docked play, unlike some Switch Joy-Con replacements that only work in portable mode.

The Hyperion 3 boasts many of the added features you’d expect from a high-end third-party controller these days, including gyro controls, turbo support, programmable rear buttons, and Hall Effect joysticks that should be more resistant to the dreaded stick drift that has plagued Nintendo controllers. The controller can even wake up a sleeping Switch 2 wirelessly, something original Switch controllers can’t do.

Unfortunately, all these upgrades come at a price. Nyxi is asking $170 for the Hyperion 3, a significant increase over the already-high $100 that Nintendo charges for the official Switch 2 Joy-Cons. Even with a current 30 percent preorder discount, the upgraded controllers will still set you back nearly $120.

That asking price puts the Hyperion 3 in the same class as premium first-party controllers like Microsoft’s Xbox Elite 2 or Sony’s DualSense Edge. But although you can find cheaper alternatives for PS5 or Xbox Series X|S controllers, Nyxi’s expensive Hyperion 3 is currently the only third-party option for Switch 2 players who want a more comfortable portable experience.

It’s a shame that Nintendo’s official Joy-Con design practically demands this kind of costly upgrade if you want a truly comfortable portable experience. For those looking for a slightly cheaper upgrade option, though, this Mobapad adapter lets you connect your favorite Switch-compatible Joy-Con replacement to the Switch 2.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/ebay-bans-illicit-automated-shopping-amid-rapid-rise-of-ai-agents/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Tuesday, eBay updated its User Agreement to explicitly ban third-party “buy for me” agents and AI chatbots from interacting with its platform without permission, first spotted by Value Added Resource. On its face, a one-line terms of service update doesn’t seem like major news, but what it implies is more significant: The change reflects the rapid emergence of what some are calling “agentic commerce,” a new category of AI tools designed to browse, compare, and purchase products on behalf of users.

eBay’s updated terms, which go into effect on February 20, 2026, specifically prohibit users from employing “buy-for-me agents, LLM-driven bots, or any end-to-end flow that attempts to place orders without human review” to access eBay’s services without the site’s permission. The previous version of the agreement contained a general prohibition on robots, spiders, scrapers, and automated data gathering tools but did not mention AI agents or LLMs by name.

At first glance, the phrase “agentic commerce” may sound like aspirational marketing jargon, but the tools are already here, and people are apparently using them. While fitting loosely under one label, these tools come in many forms.

OpenAI first added shopping features to ChatGPT Search in April 2025, allowing users to browse product recommendations. By September, the company launched Instant Checkout, which lets users purchase items from Etsy and Shopify merchants directly within the chat interface. (In November, eBay CEO Jamie Iannone suggested the company might join OpenAI’s Instant Checkout program in the future.)

Elsewhere, Perplexity offers “Buy with Pro,” a one-click checkout feature for its paying subscribers. Google recently announced its Universal Commerce Protocol, an open standard for AI agents to interact with retailers. And Amazon offers a “Buy For Me” feature, which uses AI to purchase items from external brand websites within the Amazon app.

eBay’s policy update follows the company’s quiet changes to its robots.txt file in December, a special file on a web server that lists rules and prohibitions that sites hope web-crawling bots will follow. According to Modern Retail, eBay added a new “Robot & Agent Policy” to the file that prohibited automated scraping and buy-for-me agents. eBay later updated the file to add explicit blocks against bots from Perplexity, Anthropic, Amazon, and others, though it allowed Google’s shopping bot to access the site.

However, restrictions in robots.txt files are basically honor-system suggestions. By adding the language to its User Agreement, eBay can now more easily take legal action against users or companies who violate the policy.

Notably, even with this general mood against robotic commerce from outsiders, eBay’s new User Agreement policy does not prevent the company from developing its own AI shopping tools. CEO Jamie Iannone said on an October earnings call that eBay is “testing a variety of agentic experiences in search and shopping.” The rules also allow such bots “with the prior express permission of eBay,” which could open the door to official shopping partnerships with companies like OpenAI.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">NASA’s first astronauts to fly to the Moon in more than 50 years will pay tribute to the lunar and space exploration missions that preceded them, as well as aviation and American history, by taking with them artifacts and mementos representing those past accomplishments.

NASA, on Wednesday, January 21, revealed the contents of the Artemis II mission’s Official Flight Kit (OFK), continuing a tradition dating back to the Apollo program of packing a duffel bag-sized pouch of symbolic and celebratory items to commemorate the flight and recognize the people behind it. The kit includes more than 2,300 items, including a handful of relics.

“This mission will bring together pieces of our earliest achievements in aviation, defining moments from human spaceflight and symbols of where we’re headed next,” Jared Isaacman, NASA’s administrator, said in a statement. “Historical artifacts flying aboard Artemis II reflect the long arc of American exploration and the generations of innovators who made this moment possible.”

The Artemis II mission, which may launch as soon as early February, is set to take three NASA astronauts—commander Reid Wiseman, pilot Victor Glover, and mission specialist Christina Koch—and a representative of the Canadian Space Agency, mission specialist Jeremy Hansen, on a 10-day flight that takes them farther out into space than any humans have ever traveled before and then return them safely to Earth.

The mission includes a flyby of the Moon, affording the crew an opportunity to see parts of the far side never observed directly by human eyes.

“During America’s 250th anniversary, Orion will carry astronauts around the Moon, while also carrying our history forward into the next chapter beyond Earth,” said Isaacman.

Inside the OFK are numerous flags of different types, including hundreds of US and “America 250” flags for post-flight presentation. The kit also holds two special examples of the stars and stripes, one that is returning to space for its third time, and another that is finally getting its chance to fly.

The “Legacy Flag,” which first flew on STS-1, the inaugural space shuttle mission in 1981, was then launched to the International Space Station on STS-135, the final space shuttle mission, in 2011 and brought back to Earth by the SpaceX Demo-2 crew, the first astronauts to fly into orbit on a US commercial spacecraft in 2020. NASA then pledged to fly the 13×8 inch (33×20 centimeter) American flag yet again on the next crewed flight to the Moon.

A larger, 3×5-foot (0.9×1.5-meter) US flag is also in the Artemis II OFK. It was prepared like at least seven others to be deployed on the lunar surface until its mission, Apollo 18, was canceled due to budget cuts. The banner was instead put on display at NASA Headquarters in Washington until recently, when it was taken off exhibit to make its premiere flight to the Moon on Artemis.

Other flags inside the mission’s OFK include those representing US states and military branches, the United Nations, various schools, and other countries. The European Space Agency (ESA), which provided the service module for the Artemis II Orion spacecraft, has aboard one of its logo flags for display after the mission.

The Artemis I OFK that flew on an uncrewed test flight in 2022 carried tree seeds around the Moon, similar to how Apollo 14 astronaut Stuart Roosa did in 1971. The resulting Artemis Moon trees, like the Apollo Moon trees before them, have since grown to become living reminders of what humanity is capable of achieving.

On Artemis II, NASA is flying soil samples collected from the base of established Artemis Moon trees that were planted at the agency’s 10 centers. The packets of earth represent “the full cycle of exploration: launch, flight, growth and return to space again,” as explained by NASA. The Canadian Space Agency will restart that cycle with tree seeds it is flying on Artemis II to be planted around Canada.

The Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum has loaned a 1×1-inch (2.54×2.54 cm) swatch of muslin fabric that was cut from the right wing of the original Flyer that the Wright Brothers used to make the first powered flight in 1903. The swatch was cut from a larger sample that previously launched on the space shuttle Discovery‘s STS-51D mission in 1985.

After Artemis II, NASA will return the fabric to the museum, which displays the Wright Flyer as well as other space-flown swatches, including pieces that were landed on the Moon by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin in 1969.

Before Apollo 11 touched down with the first humans, NASA’s Ranger 7 became the first US mission to successfully make contact with the lunar surface. Artemis II will carry a copy of a 4×5 inch (10×13 cm) negative of a photo from that 1964 robotic mission. The photo represents “a major turning point in the race to the Moon that will be echoed today through the success of Artemis,” according to NASA officials.

Beyond patches, pins, and decals, a few other standout items in the 10 lb (4.5 kg) Artemis II Official Flight Kit include an SD card recorded with the names of 2.9 million (and counting) people who signed up to be on the mission and metal shavings from the construction of the Space Launch System (SLS) core stage, the largest component of the mission’s launch vehicle.

There is also a badge and a “leather back number” from the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, an annual event in “Space City,” home to the Johnson Space Center in Texas.

In addition to the OFK, the astronauts each have their own Personal Preference Kit (PPK), a smaller pouch in which they can carry mementos that have significance to them. As examples, Wiseman said he is flying a notecard to take down his thoughts during the flight; Glover has a Bible, heirlooms for his wife and children, and a collection of inspirational quotes compiled by Apollo 9 astronaut Rusty Schweickart; Koch has handwritten notes from people she loves to serve as a tactile connection between her and them; and Hansen has four Moon pendants that he is taking for his wife and three children.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/meta-wants-to-block-data-about-social-media-use-mental-health-in-child-safety-trial/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As Meta heads to trial in the state of New Mexico for allegedly failing to protect minors from sexual exploitation, the company is making an aggressive push to have certain information excluded from the court proceedings.

The company has petitioned the judge to exclude certain research studies and articles around social media and youth mental health; any mention of a recent high-profile case involving teen suicide and social media content; and any references to Meta’s financial resources, the personal activities of employees, and Mark Zuckerberg’s time as a student at Harvard University.

Meta’s requests to exclude information, known as motions in limine, are a standard part of pretrial proceedings, in which a party can ask a judge to determine in advance which evidence or arguments are permissible in court. This is to ensure the jury is presented with facts and not irrelevant or prejudicial information and that the defendant is granted a fair trial.

Meta has emphasized in pretrial motions that the only questions the jury should be asked are whether Meta violated New Mexico’s Unfair Practices Act because of how it has allegedly handled child safety and youth mental health, and that other information—such as Meta’s alleged election interference and misinformation, or privacy violations—shouldn’t be factored in.

But some of the requests seem unusually aggressive, two legal scholars tell WIRED, including requests that the court not mention the company’s AI chatbots, and the extensive reputation protection Meta is seeking. WIRED was able to review Meta’s in limine requests through a public records request from the New Mexico courts.

These motions are part of a landmark case brought by New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez in late 2023. The state is alleging that Meta failed to protect minors from online solicitation, human trafficking, and sexual abuse on its platforms. It claims the company proactively served pornographic content to minors on its apps and failed to enact certain child safety measures.

The state complaint details how its investigators were easily able to set up fake Facebook and Instagram accounts posing as underage girls, and how these accounts were soon sent explicit messages and shown algorithmically amplified pornographic content. In another test case cited in the complaint, investigators created a fake account as a mother looking to traffic her young daughter. According to the complaint, Meta did not flag suggestive remarks that other users commented on her posts, nor did it shut down some of the accounts that were reported to be in violation of Meta’s policies.

Meta spokesperson Aaron Simpson told WIRED via email that the company has, for over a decade, listened to parents, experts, and law enforcement, and has conducted in-depth research, to “understand the issues that matter the most,” and to “use these insights to make meaningful changes—like introducing Teen Accounts with built-in protections and providing parents with tools to manage their teens’ experiences.”

“While New Mexico makes sensationalist, irrelevant and distracting arguments, we’re focused on demonstrating our longstanding commitment to supporting young people,” Simpson said. “We’re proud of the progress we’ve made, and we’re always working to do better.”

In its motions ahead of the New Mexico trial, Meta asked that the court exclude any references to a public advisory published by Vivek Murthy, the former US surgeon general, about social media and youth mental health. It also asked the court to exclude an op-ed article by Murthy and Murthy’s calls for social media to come with a warning label. Meta argues that the former surgeon general’s statements treat social media companies as a monolith and are “irrelevant, inadmissible hearsay, and unduly prejudicial.”

Meta has also insisted that the state of New Mexico should not be able to admit in court any third-party surveys—or Meta’s own internal surveys—that purport to show a high amount of inappropriate content on Meta’s platforms, because the surveys are, in legal terms, hearsay.

The social media giant seems particularly concerned that its CEO’s reputation, the company’s past privacy violations, and its overall dominance in social media could unfairly sway the jury. Meta has asked the court to preclude the state from introducing any argument, testimony, or evidence about Zuckerberg’s college years, saying “any effort by the state to pluck unflattering comments or incidents from when Mr. Zuckerberg (now in his 40s) was a college student would be both unfairly prejudicial and an impermissible use of propensity evidence to attack Mr. Zuckerberg’s and Meta’s character.” (Zuckerberg famously created an attractiveness-rating website in 2003; Meta’s lawyers have also sought to keep this information out of court in a consolidated trial in California that’s set to begin later this month.)

Meta has also requested that any evidence regarding Meta’s finances, “including its financial size, financial condition, market capitalization, revenues, profits, and wealth—as well as the wealth, compensation, and personal activities of its officers and employees,” be precluded.

It asks that the court not refer to former Meta employees or contractors who the state may call as witnesses as “whistleblowers,” insisting the word “whistleblower” is a legal term of art and that inaccurate or misleading references to people who may not qualify as whistleblowers “would serve only to inflame and confuse the jury.” And it has asked the court that any law enforcement officials who appear as witnesses not appear in uniform.

Meta also wants the court to exclude any reference to Molly Russell, a British teenager who died by suicide in 2017 after consuming content on social media that depicted self-harm and suicide. Meta has argued that “evidence about her use of Instagram and material she allegedly saw on Instagram, her tragic death by suicide, and the United Kingdom Coroner’s investigation into her death” bear no connection to New Mexico or Meta’s case there, nor does the testimony of Russell’s father.

And, despite the company’s recent massive investments into and promotions of its artificial intelligence products, Meta has asked the New Mexico court to exclude any mention of its AI chatbots, stating, “This case has never been about AI chatbots,” and that introducing a “new, complex subject—emerging AI chatbot technology—would risk confusing and misleading the jury about the conduct and statements actually at issue.”

Some of these requests, such as withholding references to “previous cases, Meta’s wealth, or Mark Zuckerberg’s college hotness-rating app, seem pretty standard and straightforward,” says Mark Lemley, a partner at litigation firm Lex Lumina and the William H. Neukom professor at Stanford Law School. “But other requests from Meta seem quite aggressive, such as no reference to self-harm, or state-wide harms, or chatbots, for instance.”

“It’s hard to know without being closer to the case whether there is a specific reason for those requests, though,” Lemley added. (Lemley previously defended Meta in a high-profile copyright lawsuit, then parted ways with the company because of what he described as the company’s “descent into toxic masculinity and neo-Nazi madness.”)

Meta’s alleged failures to prevent child exploitation on its apps have been previously reported. Over the past two years the social media company has been sued by more than 40 US states for allegedly harming youth mental health and has come under fire for reportedly halting internal research that showed that people who stopped using Facebook apps were less depressed and anxious.

The New Mexico case is now headed to trial court for jury selection in Santa Fe on February 2; hearings have been ongoing leading up to the trial.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last year, questions regarding president Donald Trump’s physical health started swirling after photographs showed a large, greenish bruise appearing on his right hand.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt offered an eyebrow-raising explanation, telling reporters at the time that the bruises were the result of him “constantly working and shaking hands all day every day.”

But now onlookers have spotted a similar bruise on his left hand. In other words, Trump has either been using his left hand to shake the hands of world leaders — or Leavitt’s explanation was one more example of the Trump administration’s dismal relationship with the truth.

One thing’s for sure: the mysterious injury is looking grisly. Photos of Trump at this year’s World Economic Forum in Switzerland show an even gnarlier darkish bruise on his left hand.

Experts have suggested that the bruising is the result of blood being drawn via an intravenous needle. Needles can puncture the walls of veins, causing blood to leak into surrounding tissues.

That explanation dovetails with other details the public has learned about Trump’s medical situation. After the 79-year-old was spotted with significant swelling in his legs, the White House announced in July that Trump had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common condition among older people that causes blood to pool in the extremities.

George Washington University professor Jonathan Reiner told CNN last month that he has seen similar bruising in patients who take strong blood-thinner medications, including ones that are more potent than aspirin, a drug Trump is known to be fond of.

Any attempts to gain clarity on the situation have been met by hostility, suggesting it’s a highly sensitive topic among Trump administration officials.

“Any so-called medical professionals engaging in armchair diagnosis or false speculation for political purposes are clearly breaking the Hippocratic Oath they’ve sworn to, and they should get their head examined,” fumed White House communications director Steven Cheung in a statement to CNN.

Yet Trump’s inability to form coherent sentences, his garbling of words, and recent shuffling of his feet have once again raised questions over the president’s health.

Last week, Washington State University professor of medicine Bruce Davidson argued during a podcast appearance that Trump appears to have suffered a stroke that’s impacting his ability to move.

Beyond questions surrounding Trump’s physical health, experts have long speculated about his cognitive health as well. Former White House attorney Ty Cobb speculated this week that there has been a “significant decline” in his mental faculties.

“He’s always been driven by narcissism,” he told MS Now on Wednesday. “But I think the dementia and the cognitive decline are, you know, palpable, as do many experts, including many physicians.”

            <div id="article-text">The International Space Station is scheduled to be retired in 2030, bringing an end to three decades of cutting-edge space research. What comes next remains to be seen, as several private companies compete for NASA funding to once again establish an outpost in our planet’s orbit — outside of China’s existing Tiangong space station, that is.

As part of Phase 2 of its Commercial Space Stations program, NASA has been seeking feedback from its industry partners. While we have yet to find out the requirements, let alone which company — or companies — the agency will choose to move onto the next phase, some firms have started making tangible progress.

As Ars Technica reports, space startup Vast has opted to build a smaller and more feasible interim station, dubbed Haven-1, which will serve as the precursor for much larger outposts capable of continuous habitation in the more distant future.

Vast first showed off flashy renders of the capsule in October 2024, including luxuriously plush beds, enormous domed glass windows, and a minimalist interior layout. However, how much the final product will resemble these renders remains to be seen.

The company’s CEO, Max Haot, told Ars that “we reached the key milestone of fully completing the primary structure, and some of the secondary structure” last week. The company has since kicked off “clean room integration” ahead of a “full test campaign” with NASA scheduled for later this fall. The hope is to launch the capsule in early 2027.

Haven-1 will rely heavily on SpaceX’s existing hardware. The small capsule is designed to launch on a single SpaceX Falcon 9 and dock with a Crew Dragon spacecraft.

During its inaugural mission, the goal is to first check whether the capsule can stay pressurized and maintain its attitude before allowing any humans on board, Haot told Ars, a process that could take anywhere from two weeks to three years.

“The nominal plan is for a two-week mission,” he said, “and we have one fully contracted with SpaceX, as well as a second one that we have a deposit and an option on.”

The company is still waiting to hear from NASA about what its requirements will be for its commercial space station program until it decides whether to compete for funding.

Last week, lawmakers called on NASA to accelerate its plans to replace the ISS ahead of its decommissioning a mere four years from now.

“With the current budget, we don’t think more than two winners is reasonable, but it should absolutely be two in the best interest of the country,” Haot told Ars. “If there was a bigger budget, obviously, three would be great.”

There are several other companies looking to make inroads in the space. Voyager Technologies recently moved into “full-scale development” of its “Starlab” station. Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin is still exploring its options after showing off plans for its “Orbital Reef.”

Axiom Space is also hoping to launch the “world’s first commercial space station.” The company released a detailed plan for its modular station last week, with a goal of launching as early as 2028.

But given the degree of complexity involved, plenty of questions remain about what will ultimately replace the ISS.

            <div id="article-text">Four astronauts had to cut their mission on board the International Space Station short after a “medical concern” forced NASA to return them to Earth weeks early.

The space agency has been incredibly careful about not revealing too much in an effort to “protect the crew’s medical privacy.” We don’t know which of the four crew members — including NASA astronauts Mike Fincke and Zena Cardman, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui, and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov — fell ill. We also don’t know anything about what the medical issue actually was.

Now, Fincke has revealed a tantalizing clue about what went down during the first medical evacuation in the space station’s 25 years of continuous occupation. During their first public appearance following the medical evacuation on Wednesday — during which all four members appeared to be doing well enough to field questions — Fincke said that an onboard ultrasound machine “came in super handy” when “we had this emergency.”

“It really helped,” he added. “Of course, we didn’t have other big machines that we have here on planet Earth. We do try to make sure that everybody before we fly are really, really not prone to surprises.”

“But sometimes things happen and surprises happen, and the team was ready,” Fincke said.

“We can handle any kind of difficult situation,” he told reporters. “This is actually very, very good experience for the future of human spaceflight.”

While we now know that identifying the medical issue involves using a portable ultrasound machine, we’re still left guessing, since a litany of diagnoses can involve the versatile gadget.

After splashdown, the team was helicoptered to the Scripps Memorial Hospital in San Diego via helicopter for a “planned overnight stay at a local medical facility for additional evaluation,” and was “released as expected,” per NASA.

Among other things, ultrasound can be used to identify issues affecting muscles, joints, and tendons. Considering one of the most common types of injuries on board the space station is musculoskeletal in nature — a 2020 report suggests exercise is ironically the number one source of injuries — it’s entirely possible one of the crew members had injured themselves.

Medical professionals also use ultrasound for cancer screening and checking heart valves for leaks and clots, which could certainly make for an extremely serious situation on board the space station that would warrant an evacuation.

To be clear, NASA hasn’t revealed any details about what caused the agency to orchestrate the first-ever medical evacuation. And whether it ever will remains unclear. Before even jumping into questions during Wednesday’s conference, Cardman preempted any probing questions.

“Just to say it upfront, we are not going to be identifying the crew member or talking through the differential or any of the details of the medical situation,” she said. “Thank you so much for respecting our agency.”

Nonetheless, given the stakes involved, this month’s evacuation is a first test in case things were to go wrong during even longer missions into deep space — like NASA’s Artemis 2 mission to the Moon, which is scheduled to launch just over two weeks from now — in a possibility that the agency will have to prepare for no matter what.

“How we handled everything all the way through nominal operations to this unforeseen operation, it really bodes well for future exploration,” Fincke said.

We’re a well-honed machine here at Johnson Space Center and around the world,” he added. “So when we’re getting ready for Artemis, I am very optimistic.”

            <h2>Sani Diego Comic Con Quietly Bans AI Art</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-22</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The San Diego Comic Con has quietly updated its policy to ban AI-generated art, 404 Media reports, providing a major victory to artists.

The about-face is a welcome surprise. Until now, the massive convention — which has become a melting pot of all kinds of pop entertainment beyond the comic medium, with everyone ranging from game developers to movie studios using it as a platform to tease new content — has allowed some AI art to be displayed, so long as it was labeled as such and wasn’t for sale, as well as other stipulations that have been in place since at least 2024, according to 404.

In an interview with 404, Karla Ortiz, an artist who’s worked with major studios that attend Comic Con, called the decision a “relief.”

“Generative AI is still going to creep its nasty way in some way or another,” she said, “but at least it’s not something we have to take lying down. It’s something we can actively speak out against.”

Artists have been hostile towards AI pretty much from the moment it became popular, as the models were trained on troves of photos and artworks ripped from the internet without permission or compensation.

But this past year saw a particularly notable surge in anti-AI sentiment, which now seems to have finally reached a boiling point in the Comic Con community.

When the convention posted its latest rules for its upcoming Art Show this July, artists and fans on social media blasted it for allowing AI images. Ortiz was among the vocal critics.

“Comic-[C]on deciding to allow GenAI imagery in the art show — giving valuable space to GenAI users to show slop right NEXT to actual artists who worked their asses off to be there—is a disgrace!” she wrote in a post highlighted by 404.

Strikingly, less than a day after the AI backlash started, the convention quietly updated its policy: “Material created by Artificial Intelligence (AI) either partially or wholly, is not allowed in the art show,” it now reads. It’s seemingly keeping its cards close to its chest, as it made no announcement about the policy change.

The decision isn’t the only sign of resistance to AI in the world of comics and fandoms. President of DC Comics Jim Lee vowed to uphold human creativity and not support AI: “Not now, not ever,” Lee said last October. In August, another fandom convention, GalaxyCon, instituted a “sweeping AI art ban,” with its president saying it would “fight against unethical AI companies.” The following month, a vendor accused of selling AI art at Dragon Con was shown out by cops after organizers, with onlookers’ approval, demanded that the vendor leave.

Now, Comic Con’s reversal on the issue represents one of the biggest and most consequential shifts in the comic and fandom worlds, and seems to be part of a much greater turning tide sweeping across the entertainment landscape. Last week, musicians rejoiced when Bandcamp, a major music distribution platform favored by indie artists, also instituted an AI ban, prohibiting any songs that generated “wholly or in substantial part by AI.”

            <div id="article-text">A new AI startup formed from the cast-offs of some of the industry’s biggest, most ethically dubious players says it’s definitely pursuing building the tech with humanity’s best interests in mind.

Called Humans& — that’s its actual name, not a typo — the outfit’s founders say their vision is to build AI that empowers people instead of trying to replace their jobs, the New York Times reports, such as by building collaboration software that works like an “AI version of an instant messaging app.”

This nonpareil vision, according to the reporting, has helped Humans& to already raise $480 million in seed funding despite launching just three months ago. Powering its $4.48 billion valuation, its investors include Nvidia, Jeff Bezos, and Google Ventures — moral paragons of human empowerment all.

One of the founders is Andi Peng, a research scientist at Anthropic, which builds the chatbot Claude, and whose CEO Dario Amodei casually predicted that the tech he was helping develop would replace over half of all entry-level white collar jobs. At some point, Peng began to no longer see philosophically eye to eye with her former employer.

“Anthropic is training its model to work autonomously. It loved to highlight how its models churned for eight hours, 24 hours, 50 hours by itself to complete a task,” Peng told the NYT. “That was never my motivation. I think of machines and humans as complementary.”

Two others founders, Eric Zelikman and Yuchen He, are from Elon Musk’s xAI, where they helped build Grok, née “MechaHitler,” a chatbot which so regularly thrusts itself into controversy that it somehow barely registered as newsworthy earlier this month when it generated thousands of nonconsensual — and likely illegal — AI nudes of women and children. Now manumitted from the shackles of Musk leadership, Zelikman is imagining an AI beyond such chatbots as Grok.

“AI has enormous potential to allow people to do more together,” Zelikman told the NYT. “The current paradigm — questioning and answering — is not going to get us there.”

Generally, tech companies don’t say they’re building AI to disenfranchise the working human, dressing up what possibly lies ahead with euphemisms like “boosting productivity.” Still, they do acknowledge the tech’s disruptive effects, if only as a qualifier for how awesome AI will be in the long run. Along with Anthropic’s Amodei, OpenAI Sam Altman predicts that AI will wipe out entire categories of labor. Microsoft chief Satya Nadella expresses his anxiety that AI could make his entire company obsolete at the same time he brags about 30 percent of the company’s code being written with AI. Meanwhile, these companies’ customers openly brag about replacing employees with their AI models.

The barely disguised soullessness with which AI leaders operate, perhaps, has provided a window for entrepreneurs to peddle a more humane message, in good faith or not in good faith, naively or cynically.

“There are some pretty clear principles that designers are beginning to take that favor human-centered approaches,” Ben Shneiderman, a computer science professor at the University of Maryland and an advocate of “human centric” AI, told the NYT. “It goes back to the fundamental principle of ensuring human control.”

            <h2>Newspaper Makes Brain-Melting Error in AI-Generated Graphic</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The advent of generative AI has turned much of the internet into an unrecognizable flood plain of mind-numbing slop.

In the latest sign of the times, the Economic Times — the second most widely-read English-language newspaper in the world, as of 2012 — picked the word “Kafkaesque” as its “Word of the Day” earlier this week. But even the briefest glance at the accompanying illustration reveals that the piece involved little, if any, human oversight.

The issue is the image at the top of the piece — which, to be fair, is labeled as being AI-generated — that attempts to write the word on a blackboard. But it clearly struggles to even spell it, settling on mangled characters that spell something like “Kafkaesliue,” which obviously isn’t a word at all.

It’s a particularly galling fumble given the particular word. Trudging through a wasteland of AI slop online does frequently feel like being trapped in one of Franz Kafka’s works, in the sense that it’s a surreal and illogical experience that feels impossible to break out of.

Netizens have been dunking on the screwup all day, but so far the Economic Times has left the butchered image live on the article. The newspaper didn’t respond to a request for comment.

A quick perusal of the paper’s deluge of “Word of the Day” features — it seems to publish far more than one per day, running three on the day of its “Kafkaesliue” flub alone — suggests that the AI error isn’t a one off. A write-up about the word “pensive,” for instance, features an image showing a coffee cup labeled “celffee.”

The blunders highlight how the news industry is desperately trying to reinvent itself as publishers brace against a torrent of bottom-tier AI-generated content. Media executives have been gearing up for AI to deal the journalism industry a fatal blow as the advent of the tech has left devastating holes in web traffic.

A report published last year found that over half of the internet now consists of AI slop. The result might be described as Kafkaesque. Or maybe “Kafkaesliue.”

“In simple terms, Kafkaesque is what happens when reality stops making sense but still insists you comply,” the Economic Times‘ more-than-likely AI-generated copy explains. “The pronunciation of the word as per Merriam-Webster is- käf-kə-ˈesk.”

The cold rehashing of the word certainly invokes the reality we increasingly find ourselves trapped in. Tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT have indeed turned our media environment upside down — in an “absurd, oppressive, and strangely unreal” fate, in the words of the Economic Times.

            <h2>Substack launches a TV app</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/substack-launches-a-tv-app/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Substack, a platform known primarily for newsletters, is launching a TV app for Apple TV and Google TV. The company announced on Thursday that the beta app will allow subscribers to watch video posts and livestreams on TV created by authors on its platform.

The TV app features a TikTok-like “For You” row that will highlight videos from these creators, along with recommended videos.

Free and paid subscribers can now start using the TV app, with access based on their subscription tier. Substack plans to add paid content previews for free subscribers in the future. The platform also plans to add audio posts and read-alouds, enhanced search and discovery features, in-app upgrades to paid subscriptions, and dedicated sections for each publication where subscribers can explore all videos from a specific creator.

The move comes as Substack has been investing more heavily in video and livestreaming, as it looks to compete with platforms like YouTube and Patreon for both creators and viewers.

Substack began its push into video with the launch of video posts back in 2022. It then started allowing creators to monetize videos early last year. Around the same time, it rolled out livestreaming capabilities to all publishers. The company has also embraced short-form video, launching a TikTok-like video feed in its app in March 2025.

“Substack is the home for the best longform—work creators put real care into and subscribers choose to spend time with,” the company wrote in a blog post. “Now these thought-provoking videos and livestreams have a natural home on the TV, where subscribers can settle in for the extended viewing that great video deserves.”

While Substack sees the launch as the next step in its video ambitions, comments on its announcement tell another story. The top comment on the company’s blog post reads: “Please don’t do this. This is not YouTube. Elevate the written word.” Another popular comment reads: “You guys have gone from saying Substack is the best home for longform writing/writers to ‘Substack is the home for the best longform—work…’. I get trying to evolve, but this just seems like another venture capital-fueled idea.”

Other comments reflect a similar sentiment, questioning why the platform appears to be shifting its focus from writing to video.

It’s worth noting that Substack isn’t the only platform pushing into the living room, as Instagram recently launched IG for TV, a new experience that lets users watch Reels on TV, starting with Amazon Fire TV.

            <div id="article-text">Tesla is offering passengers robotaxi rides in Austin without a human safety driver in the front seat.

CEO Elon Musk on Thursday posted on X, his social media platform: “Just started Tesla Robotaxi drives in Austin with no safety monitor in the car. Congrats to the Tesla AI team!”

He then made a recruitment pitch for engineers interested in “solving real-world AI,” which he says will “likely lead to AGI” to join the Tesla AI team.

The automaker launched its robotaxis in the Texas city last June in a limited deployment with a safety operator in the front passenger seat. Tesla initially offered those first rides to influencers and handpicked customers. In December, Tesla began testing its robotaxis in Austin without a safety driver in the front seat — a precaution in case the vehicle needs a human to take over.

Not all of Tesla’s fleet in Austin will be fully driverless. Per Tesla’s AI lead Ashok Elluswamy, the company will be “starting with a few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors, and the ratio will increase over time.”

It’s not clear whether the rides are free or if Tesla is charging a fare. Some of Tesla’s rivals, like Zoox and Waymo, did not immediately charge for driverless rides upon initial deployment.

TechCrunch has attempted to reach out to Tesla for clarification.

            <div id="article-text">Meta is about to go on trial in New Mexico, accused of not doing enough to protect kids from sexual exploitation on its platforms. As the court date gets closer, Meta’s lawyers are working hard to limit what can be used against the company in court.

According to public records reviewed by Wired, the company wants to block research about social media’s impact on youth mental health, stories about teen suicides linked to social media, any mention of Meta’s finances, the company’s past privacy violations, and even things about CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s college years.

These efforts are part of a lawsuit filed by New Mexico attorney general Raúl Torrez in late 2023. The state accuses Meta of failing to protect minors from online predators, trafficking, and sexual abuse on its platforms. The case claims Meta allegedly allowed explicit material to reach minors and didn’t put adequate child safety measures in place.

Notably, this lawsuit is considered the first trial of its kind at the state level, scheduled to begin on February 2.

It’s fairly standard that Meta would try to keep the case as narrow as possible. However, two legal experts who talked to Wired believe the company’s attempt to keep out so much information is unusually broad, including its requests not to mention its AI chatbots.

Additionally, Meta requested that the court block any mention of a public health warning issued by former U.S. surgeon general Vivek Murthy regarding social media’s effect on youth mental health. The company also doesn’t want surveys (including its own) about the amount of inappropriate content on its platforms. It argues that all this information is irrelevant or could unfairly sway the jury.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Prepping for the SAT is nobody’s idea of fun, but Google aims to make it less stressful with AI. The company announced that it’s now focusing its AI education efforts on standardized testing with free SAT practice exams powered by Gemini.

Students can prompt Gemini by typing “I want to take a practice SAT test,” and the AI will provide them with a free practice exam. Gemini then analyzes the results, highlighting strengths and identifying areas that need further review. It also offers detailed explanations for any incorrect answers.

The company said it partnered with education companies like the Princeton Review to ensure the content is vetted and that students are working with questions that closely mirror what they will encounter on the actual SAT.

This recent move by Google is viewed as a game-changer for students who can’t readily access personalized SAT tutoring. By making SAT prep free, Google is trying to open the door for more students to compete on equal footing. However, it also sparks a broader conversation about the role of AI in education and just how much we want AI to shape how students learn.

The adoption of AI in education is not without controversy. Many teachers worry that students might end up leaning too heavily on tools like Gemini and ChatGPT to get their work done. If students let AI do all the thinking, it could chip away at their problem-solving skills. There are even studies out there that back this up, suggesting that relying too much on AI can actually weaken students’ ability to think critically and tackle challenges on their own.

Let’s also not forget about human SAT tutors. Free AI-powered exam prep poses a significant threat to the traditional tutoring industry, which has long thrived on providing personalized coaching to college-bound students. With Google offering a free alternative, the job security of private SAT tutors may be at risk.

This news follows Google’s recent launch of a Gemini-powered feature that lets teachers create podcast-style audio lessons, which could help catch the attention of Gen Z students. Other available Gemini tools include features that help teachers brainstorm ideas, build lesson plans, and tailor learning materials for their classes.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/former-ceo-of-celeb-fav-gym-dogpound-launches-5m-fund-to-back-wellness-companies/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Jenny Liu, former CEO of exclusive, celebrity-favorite gym Dogpound, said there were two reasons she wanted to start her own venture fund.

For one, she was surrounded by wellness founders at her local gym who loved testing new products and building community. Second, Liu also realized that many of these founders, especially women and minorities, were struggling to fund their ideas due to limited access to founder networks.

To bridge this gap, she launched Crush It Ventures, a wellness-focused early-stage fund. The firm hopes to back companies building across the wellness sector, including in mental health, fitness and sport, beauty, and hospitality. On Thursday, it announced the final close of a $5 million Fund I.

The wellness industry often overlaps with the health sector (like sleep and body health), making it quite hard to estimate how big it truly is. Nonetheless, wellness trends have been booming in the past few years. Gyms have become a Gen Z obsession, and so have run clubs.

A McKinsey study from last year found that the U.S. alone spends more than $500 billion a year on wellness. Young people in particular have become big spenders as they continue to openly talk about mental health and burnout. The McKinsey report said that though Gen Z makes up 36% of the adult U.S. population, they are responsible for over 41% of wellness spending. This is compared to those 58 and older, who make up around 35% of the U.S. population, yet account for 28% of wellness spending.

Liu believes this area has become so popular because people are realizing that health is more than just physical fitness — it also involves mental, emotional, and social well-being. “As we automate more with technology in our daily lives, we’re valuing experiences and products that foster real connection and long-term well-being,” she said. “It’s also a reflection of shifting values: younger generations want purpose-driven brands and are craving real community.”

Liu said she started raising the fund in 2024. Though the environment was “cautious,” she said, there was a growing interest in wellness, “especially from LPs looking for more diverse mission-driven funds.” The environment for new funds is still tough (especially for a woman solo GP) as most of the capital continues to flow to the top firms.

Liu declined to share the name of the LPs in the fund but said she was able to break through as a new fund manager by leaning into her network. She has a background in banking before angel investing in the gym, later joining as CFO. During her decade there, she was CEO for two years.

At Dogpound, she worked with founders and celebrities around the world. “I learned that brand building is not just about marketing a product or service, but about creating a space for shared experiences, joy, and genuine connection,” she said, adding that her fund is keen on helping founders build their brand and communities as they scale their businesses.

Crush It plans to typically write checks of $100,000 to $250,000, and invest in between 20 and 25 companies, she said. So far, the firm has invested in 18 companies, like the wearable tech company Elemind and CPG business Caliwater. She hopes to deploy all of the checks within the next 12-18 months.

“We want to help close the gap in wellness funding for underrepresented founders, build stronger founder networks, and show that purpose and community-driven companies can scale and make a meaningful difference in health and lifestyle,” she said.

            <h2>Struggling fusion power company General Fusion to go public via $1B reverse merger</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/struggling-fusion-power-company-general-fusion-to-go-public-via-1b-reverse-merger/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last year, fusion power startup General Fusion was struggling to raise funds, laying off at least 25% of its staff before receiving a $22 million lifeline investment while it figured out how to keep the company afloat.

Today, General Fusion revealed its survival plan: It will go public through a reverse merger with a special purpose acquisition company, Spring Valley III, combined with additional investment from institutional investors. It’s a significant change in fortunes for a company whose CEO wrote a public letter just last year pleading for funding.

If the deal closes as planned, General Fusion could receive up to $335 million from the transaction, more than double what it was reportedly seeking to raise last year before it landed the $22 million lifeline.

The transaction will value the combined company at about $1 billion, General Fusion said. Before the merger was announced. The fusion startup, which was founded in 2002, had previously raised over $440 million, according to PitchBook.

General Fusion plans to use the money to complete its demonstration reactor, Lawson Machine 26 (LM26). The device uses an approach called “magnetized target fusion,” which works by compressing a fuel pellet until its atoms fuse together, releasing energy in the process. The National Ignition Facility used inertial confinement in its successful fusion experiments, using lasers to bombard the fuel pellets to unleash the compressive force.

LM26 eschews the lasers, though. Instead, it uses steam-driven pistons that drive a wall of liquid lithium metal inward to compress the fuel pellet. That liquid lithium then circulates through a heat exchanger, which generates steam to spin a generator. By avoiding expensive lasers or superconducting magnets, which are required in other fusion reactor designs, General Fusion hopes to build a fusion power plant for less money. But first the company has to prove its approach is viable.

Last year, before it revealed its financial problems, General Fusion said that in 2026, LM26 would hit scientific breakeven, in which a fusion reaction generates more power than was required to start it. Scientific breakeven is a key milestone, though distinct from and easier to attain than commercial breakeven, in which fusion reactions release enough energy to export electricity to the grid. In an email to TechCrunch, General Fusion said it was now aiming to reach breakeven in 2028.

The acquisition company, Spring Valley, is something of a specialist in reverser mergers with energy companies. It previously took NuScale Power, a small modular nuclear reactor company, public in a deal whose stock price has since fallen more than 50% from its peak last year. The firm is also in the midst of completing a merger with Eagle Energy Metals, a uranium mining company that’s also supposedly developing its own SMR.

General Fusion isn’t the first fusion company to go public. In December, TAE Technologies announced it would merge with Trump Media & Technology Group in a deal valuing the combined company at more than $6 billion.

The common thread connecting these deals is data centers, of course. They’re expected to consume nearly 300% more power by 2035, according to BloombergNEF, and General Fusion explicitly points to rising data center energy demand in its merger announcement.

But the company also pointed to broader electrification trends, including EVs and electric heating, that could increase overall electricity demand by up to 50% by 2035. It’s a reminder that, while the Trump administration has cast doubts on an electrified future, other countries are charging ahead. While General Fusion may face technological challenges, trends in the energy world suggest that if it can deliver fusion power at a reasonable cost, it will find plenty of willing buyers.

Update: 1:50 pm ET: Added comment from General Fusion regarding new breakeven target date.

            <div id="article-text">This morning’s Oscar nominations capped a year marked by a stunning run of critical and commercial success for one of Hollywood’s biggest—and most discussed—studios. Warner Bros. dominated proceedings with big hauls for One Battle After Another and Sinners.

The Academy Awards are commonly defined these days by a struggle for relevance, making the fact that such high-quality, non-franchise movies from a major studio connected with audiences a considerable boon—especially after last year’s show, which celebrated a swath of more inscrutable indie pictures.

That success still came with familiar existential baggage for the film industry. Warner Bros., while making creative bets that paid off, has been embroiled in high-stakes merger drama for several months. Netflix and Paramount have both vied to purchase the studio, which in either case would create a corporate behemoth likely less inclined to take the risks that lead to a One Battle, or a Sinners, or even a Weapons (which nabbed a Best Supporting Actress nod for Amy Madigan, who played the antagonist). No matter what the future holds, though, the Warner Bros. triumph can’t be undermined: It helped define 2025 as a year in which movies coaxed adult audiences to theaters by blending action and spectacle with more challenging, trenchant storytelling.

Other big nomination-getters included Chloé Zhao’s Hamnet, an adaptation of Maggie O’Farrell’s novel that especially drew plaudits for its emotionally demanding performances. (Jessie Buckley, who plays a grief-stricken mother, has been the presumed front-runner for Best Actress since awards season began.) A24’s gamble on a big-budget table-tennis epic paid off, with Marty Supreme earning nine nominations; not only has the film become the indie studio’s highest-grossing release ever, but its star, Timothée Chalamet, is also tipped for Best Actor. Meanwhile, Apple’s hit sports drama F1, which collected four nods, including Best Picture, is the closest thing to a typical blockbuster contender. Two box-office smashes that once seemed like guarantees, meanwhile, are absent from Best Picture, namely Avatar: Fire and Ash and Wicked: For Good; the sequel to last year’s Oscar-winning Wicked blanked entirely this year. Handing out nominations to a film headed up by a big name like Brad Pitt—as well as several of his movie-star peers, such as One Battle After Another’s lead, Leonardo DiCaprio; Michael B. Jordan, who plays two roles in Sinners; and Emma Stone, for Yorgos Lanthimos’s acidic satire Bugonia—guarantees a glitzier show, which is vital to the point of the Oscars: The ceremony is essentially an advertisement for the act of theatergoing.

In recent years, the Academy Awards have been shaped by the more international and art-house tilt of the nominations. This run began with Parasite’s Best Picture win in 2020, and perhaps peaked last year with a slew of less commercial nominees. The controversial French musical Emilia Pérez led the field; the indie dramas Anora and The Brutalist picked up several major nods, as did the gory horror satire The Substance; Anora took Best Picture. Meanwhile, bigger franchise hits such as Wicked and Dune: Part Two were relegated to wins in the technical categories. In decades past, winning the Cannes Film Festival’s top prize, the coveted Palme D’or, was of little relevance to later awards success. But of late, it’s been a vital indicator: Anora and Parasite used it as a springboard to Oscar glory, and fellow Palme d’Or victors such as Triangle of Sadness and Anatomy of a Fall ended up with awards-season success.

With that track record in mind, the indie powerhouse Neon snapped up every big Cannes winner that it could, including this year’s Palme winner, It Was Just an Accident; the Brazilian period drama The Secret Agent; the nail-biting thriller Sirāt, a co-production from France and Spain; and the director Joachim Trier’s Norwegian family dramedy, Sentimental Value, his follow-up to the well-regarded The Worst Person in the World. Some pundits wondered whether Neon had gone overboard with its awards slate, but all four movies were recognized in the International Feature Film category and elsewhere; The Secret Agent and Sentimental Value also made it to Best Picture. Sentimental Value was particularly beloved, earning nine nominations, while Wagner Moura’s Best Actor nod for The Secret Agent makes him the first Brazilian ever recognized in that category.

There were a few other surprises, particularly in the acting categories. Among the nominees for Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress were two Sinners stars, Wunmi Mosaku and Delroy Lindo—the latter a Hollywood veteran finally getting his first nod. Kate Hudson sneaked into the Best Actress category for Song Sung Blue, an inspirational true-story musical drama; the One Battle After Another ingénue, Chase Infiniti, meanwhile, was locked out. Hamnet, which won Best Motion Picture—Drama at the Golden Globes earlier this month, slightly under-indexed; Paul Mescal missed out on Supporting Actor despite noms at several other awards ceremonies this year. The film also missed out on key technical nods, such as Cinematography and Editing. And in the Best Picture lineup, Netflix’s meditative drama Train Dreams earned a spot, whereas two of the streamer’s splashier movies—the George Clooney–starring Jay Kelly and the latest Knives Out sequel, Wake Up Dead Man—didn’t make the cut.

Now the nearly two-month trudge to the ceremony itself begins. Although there’s likely to be the usual hand-wringing in the press about plateauing viewership, the Oscars’ long-term future has already been secured: YouTube will own the broadcast rights starting in 2029. That deal will keep funding the show, guarantee a wider audience, and banish any larger concerns about Nielsen ratings as the traditional broadcast model continues to go extinct.

This year’s awards narrative was already feeling especially ossified. One Battle After Another has been the front-runner since sweeping the critics’ prizes and winning four Golden Globes, including for Best Motion Picture—Musical or Comedy. Sinners’ huge nomination haul, however, will throw it back into the mix as One Battle’s biggest potential rival—rewarding Warner Bros.’s year of risk-taking mightily, regardless of what happens.</div>

            <h2>The Upside of Professional Rejection</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/01/professional-rejection-work-upside/685713/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">My relationship with rejection, professionally speaking, is complicated. I’m a writer, and although I’ve been hearing “thanks, but no thanks” in response to pitches since the ’90s, that hasn’t made the no’s easy; I still smart when I think of story ideas that editors swatted away years ago.

It’s normal to hear “no” and jump to the conclusion that something is fundamentally wrong—with one’s work or, worse, with oneself. As I’ve aged, however, I’ve found that the disappointment that comes after being rebuffed doesn’t last as long as it used to. In one recent instance, after a longtime collaborator rejected a project I was passionate about, the feeling of dejection never even arrived. Instead, the “no” energized me to find someone else who believed in the idea.

Since then, I’ve grown curious about why I responded the way I did—and about whether, in this new year, I might be able to reframe how I see rejection entirely: not as a final answer, but as a provocation or an opportunity.

How people process rejection is tied to culture. I grew up in the United States, which has long espoused an ethos of individualism and grit, so I’ve been surrounded by messages about the “power of positive thinking” and exhortations that people should push through dispiriting dismissals—or, as Ronald Reagan put it, “try and try again.” That attitude, if you can summon it, can be invigorating. But it doesn’t come naturally to everyone. And some people, no matter how hard they try, are rejected not because of their shortcomings but because of influences—political, societal—that they may have little power to overcome. Alison Kinney, the author of the forthcoming book United States of Rejection: A Story of Love, Hate, and Hope, told me that she worries about the notion that failing to overcome obstacles is proof of a lack of willpower, given how much is out of a person’s control. When people are rejected and blame themselves, they risk experiencing their situation as a sort of double failure.

People with certain personalities seem better suited to processing setbacks than others. Daniel Pink, the author of the 2009 book Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us, told me that, in his experience, the people who handle rejection best are typically confident in their ability to succeed, high in autonomy, and sure of who they are. For these people, rejection can even be a marker of distinction, Pink said. Their attitude might be: “You rejected me because you don’t understand that I’m unique.”

A 2012 study on the way rejection affects creativity echoed that finding. In a series of experiments, the authors repeatedly found that being rejected could spur people to be more creative, but only if those people had an “independent self-concept”—that is, if they were the type of people who prefer to remain “distinctly separate” from others, and to “emphasize personal goals over group goals.” The authors theorized that because such people don’t feel a strong need to belong, failure might not sting so much, and the opportunity to distinguish themselves might be extra appealing. This resonated with me: I’ve never cared much about being part of an “in-group,” and I’ve found that when I ignore external markers of success, I’m more likely to measure myself against myself and focus on my goals, not others’ expectations.

The context in which a professional rejection plays out can also help determine how someone responds. It matters, for example, what a person’s relationship is to the project they’re working on, Ayelet Fishbach, a behavioral-science professor at the University of Chicago, told me. If the endeavor feels central to their identity and they are deeply committed to it, they’re probably more likely to keep going regardless of other people’s opinions. That may be why I was so motivated after my recent rejection; the project was a memoir I’d been dreaming of writing for years.

The identity of the person who does the rejecting might also shape the outcome, Samir Nurmohamed, an associate professor of management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, told me. He described a study he ran, in which participants were asked to complete a simple online task and were informed, beforehand, both how well an observer expected them to perform and how likely that observer was to be correct in their prediction. Nurmohamed found that when the participants were told that the observer wasn’t credible, hearing that they had low expectations actually boosted performance, perhaps because the participant wanted to work hard to prove the observer wrong. When the participants learned that the observer’s opinion was respected, though, their performance was more likely to falter; the participants were still generally motivated to prove their naysayers wrong, but their anxiety tended to make them less successful.

The people most likely to push through rejection tend to share a specific quality: They “are willing to embrace discomfort,” Fishbach said. These people, she explained, have the ability to reframe that sense of discomfort as growth—as “a sign that I’m pushing myself, that I am doing something new, that I’m developing as a person.” After all, at its core, rejection is just feedback, Pink told me. It can provide an opportunity to approach a situation differently or at least to learn something.

Nurmohamed said that for those trying to overcome self-doubt, a helpful tactic is to recall moments in the past when they’ve succeeded despite others’ doubts. In 2021, he co-authored a paper in which several groups of job seekers at reemployment centers in Philadelphia were asked to come up with various types of stories about themselves. The researchers found that those who were asked to tell “underdog narratives”—accounts of times when they believed in themselves and others didn’t—were more likely to find employment than those who’d been asked to tell any other type of story. They speculated that this was because the “underdog narratives” reminded the job seekers that they could succeed even when obstacles were in the way, and because the stories highlighted how much control a person has over their life.

This doesn’t mean that people should always push through in the face of negative professional feedback. As Pink reminded me, sometimes a rejection is worth taking seriously. Though a person who soldiers on through difficulty may seem stubborn, or at least admirably persistent, they’re not necessarily smart. “I want to cheer for those people from the sidelines, but sometimes they’re wrong,” he said. “They could just be escalating their commitment to a failing course of action, digging the hole even deeper.” Ryan Holiday, the author of The Obstacle Is the Way, told me he also worries about those who use others’ skepticism as a primary motivation to succeed. In that way lies madness, or at least chronic acrimony. He pointed to Michael Jordan’s 2009 Basketball Hall of Fame speech, in which Jordan made a series of ungenerous remarks about people he felt had slighted him over the years. “Here you have the most successful athlete of all time, and he’s using the crowning moment of his career to prove that he’s still haunted by these grievances,” Holiday said. It was “tragic.”

It’s also understandable. Being rejected hurts, and finding success may not erase the emotional residue of all those prior rebuffs. But a conversation with Jessica Bacal, a writer and educator, reframed for me how one might work through the soreness. Five years ago, Bacal told me, she received a particularly painful professional rejection, and she decided to process her feelings through writing. Eventually, she came up with an idea for a book: The Rejection That Changed My Life, which featured interviews with dozens of women about their professional rejections and was published in 2021. She told me she now sees that first rejection as a “gift.”

I know what she means. The worst no’s can be confidence-shattering. But for people ready to respond not with hardheadedness but with strength and grace, they also offer a rare chance: to pick up the pieces of a broken ego and rebuild.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There’s a double helix in my local Sephora. It’s roughly the size and shape of a soda can, and it is accompanied by a placard referencing patents and peptides, as if in a science fair. It’s trying to sell me a hair mask.

Online, the company responsible for this display describes itself as a “biology-first haircare brand, powered by biotech.” It practices “biomimetic hairscience,” and, thanks to “a decade of complex research into the bioscience of hair,” has patented a peptide that repairs hair “at a molecular level across multiple types of bonds including polypeptide chains and disulfide bonds.” I have no idea what any of this means. The mask costs $75.

In 2026, it is possible to cover your body in science. You can put on probiotic leggings and a patented bra, and then you can apply lipstick containing hyaluronic acids “with differentiated molecular weights” and slather your face in a “triple-lipid peptide cream” developed by self-identified “skintellectuals.” You can also eat your science, by way of “clinically-studied key herbs, adaptogens, and minerals—at amounts informed by research.” If you get thirsty, you can have water that has been chemically manipulated with extra hydrogen atoms, just in case two aren’t enough for you. Even decades-old products have been newly recast as miracles of modern chemistry: After years of selling itself purely impressionistically, via close-up shots of hot athletes dripping sweat and swilling neon liquid, Gatorade has recently begun touting itself as “Lab Tested.” As the wellness movement collides with the supercharged demands of selling products in a crowded market, science-speak seems to have invaded every crevice of the fashion, beauty, and food industries.

Many of the claims these products make are perfectly legitimate, if a bit goofy; others are transparently nonsense. And dubious, science-flecked marketing claims have existed about as long as marketing has. But they used to be comparatively unsophisticated, and quite literal: Cheerios contain a certain amount of fiber, and fiber is good for you, thus Cheerios are good for you and you should buy them. A skin-care product is superior to its competitors because it has more vitamin C, and vitamin C is good for your skin. These ads were informed but plainspoken, employing the simple logic of cause and effect, inputs and outputs, using words most people recognized. They talked, basically, like a family-medicine doctor.

Today’s ads, by contrast, talk like the Ph.D. kind of doctor, using polysyllabic words and alluding to things viewable only under a microscope. They seem designed not to illuminate but to obfuscate, to impart the veneer of science at such a high level that people will never really ask how, or if, it works. Almost no one is looking up a peer-reviewed study, or spelunking through the patent database, to make sure the claims on their package of goo are accurate. “People like buying products that are, quote, research backed,” Neil Lewis Jr., a behavioral scientist at Cornell, told me. “But most people, they’re not equipped to actually evaluate those claims. They don’t have the time or expertise, often, and so they sort of just look for some heuristic cue, and that’s good enough.” What science-washed products promise—more than what they actually promise on the package—is that someone else did the work for you.

For years, the trend in consumption was beautiful but useless trash. Now, Stephen Zagor, who teaches courses in food business at NYU and Columbia, told me, “science is the new it thing.” For companies, nodding to state-of-the-art technology and papering a corporate website in clip art of molecules is an indication that their product is the best, empirically. And for consumers, drinking a soda that went to grad school is a signal too—of savviness and responsibility. It’s cultural capital: If others “see us eating a food item that has been surrounded by scientific discussions, people think automatically we know what we’re talking about, when we don’t have a clue either,” Zagor said. “Science makes ignorance feel smart.”

Many companies do actually employ professionals—cosmetic chemists, food scientists. But science in the private interest doesn’t necessarily work like science in the public interest. It tends to operate on a different timescale, and to use different yardsticks. The scientists who work for corporations need to be sure that their products provide enough short-term benefit to keep people buying, while abiding by consumer regulations. They are employed to ask questions the market wants answered, ideally as quickly as possible.

The irony here, of course, is that this is happening at a time when institutional science, the kind that doesn’t come with next-day shipping, is under considerable threat. The federal government has embarked on a concerted, and largely successful, effort to undermine, discredit, and defund serious scientific research at any opportunity. Influencers and pundits have sought to cast scientists themselves as elitists and liars, in an effort that appears to be working: Nearly one in four Americans has little or no confidence in scientists to act in the public’s best interest. Thousands of scientific minds have, by brute force or something subtler, left the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, and academia. Their absence leaves a vacuum. Some of these people worked on projects that couldn’t be sold; others worked to regulate the ones that could. Sometimes, when I am feeling particularly pessimistic, I worry that we are approaching a world in which scientists are employed not by independent institutions but only by companies—a world in which science itself is marketing copy, and little more.</div>

            <h2>Why Conservatives Defend ICE</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/ice-conservatives-minnesota-dhs-protests/685705/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Department of Homeland Security, communicating with the public through its official account on X, sent an ominous message last week: “FEAR NOT, GREAT PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA, THE DAY OF RECKONING & RETRIBUTION IS COMING!”

What ensued, as you might expect when a heavily armed security agency announces an operation in terms typically employed by comic-book-movie villains, was chaos. ICE agents, many of them masked, went on to detain citizens and noncitizens alike. They threatened and sometimes employed violence, provoking widespread protests.

Republicans have deplored the mayhem in Minnesota. But they don’t hold the agency that set it off responsible. Instead they’ve condemned the protesters and the Democratic politicians who encouraged them. When President Trump undertakes a policy or goal that the rest of his party cannot bring itself to endorse, his allies’ usual move is to attribute a different and more noble motivation to him, while shifting the blame to his opponents. So it is in Minnesota.

“The scenes of destruction and damage taking place in Minneapolis are abhorrent. This violence cannot be tolerated. Unfortunately, our state leaders’ inaction and support of these violent riots are failing every Minnesotan and putting law enforcement’s lives at risk,” wrote House Whip Tom Emmer, a Minnesotan. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz “want the crazy,” Representative Byron Donalds charged.

In this view, the people who “want the crazy” are not the ones posting wild threats in all caps, but the ones saying things like this, from Walz: “What Donald Trump wants is violence in the streets. But Minnesota will remain an island of decency, of justice, of community, and of peace. Don’t give him what he wants.” Scott Jennings, the CNN talking head and potential Republican Senate candidate for Kentucky, replied, “‘Minnesota will remain an island.’ Walz cannot be more explicit - this buffoon believes he is seceding from the Union. We are well into Insurrection Act territory.”

David Frum: Why Vance committed so hard to the Minneapolis shooter

Referring to Minnesota as an “island of decency” and to other virtues is not even a subtle secession threat, let alone an “explicit” one. Yet the Jennings perspective is pervasive among Republicans. Even Republicans who sometimes refrain from endorsing the president’s most unhinged demands seem to believe that the ICE protests have no legitimacy and that Minnesota’s Democratic officials are, if not outright criminals, bad actors.

Some protesters have in fact adopted confrontational tactics—in one awful instance, they stormed a church and disrupted a service to confront a pastor who works for ICE. But the Republican argument is not merely that the protests have occasionally gone too far. It is that the protests are themselves the core problem, and Walz’s specific suggestion that Minnesotans record agents’ actions is escalatory, if not illegal.

Walz “is courting more ugly incidents,” the Wall Street Journal editorial page scolds. “The President has the legal authority to unleash ICE, and the agents are doing what they are told to do. The way to defeat the Trump policy is at the ballot box, not by obstructing agents in violation of the law.” National Review’s Noah Rothman argues, “What Walz is advising his citizens to do is likely to result in more violence and, potentially, more death.” Zachary Faria writes in the Washington Examiner, “What you have with ICE agents in Minneapolis is people exercising the lawful authority to detain illegal immigrants and, on the other end of that, anyone interfering with federal law enforcement actions.”

The premise underpinning this argument is that ICE is acting legally and in the service of legitimate immigration-enforcement goals. That assumption is difficult to square with on-the-ground reporting. The shooting death of Renee Nicole Good is the most high-profile incident, but the Journal found that the episode “shares characteristics with others the Journal reviewed: Agents box in a vehicle, try to remove an individual, block attempts to flee, then fire”—tactics that violate law-enforcement protocol.

The New York Times reported on a couple driving home from a basketball game who were attacked with tear gas. The Associated Press found footage of agents brutalizing a man they had pinned to the ground. A group of local police chiefs told reporters that their officers, while off duty, were stopped with guns drawn solely based on their skin color. After a toy-store owner criticized ICE in a television interview, its agents raided the shop and conducted an audit. Multiple attorneys have claimed that their clients are being held incommunicado, in plain violation of the Constitution.

What’s more, the administration’s accounts of ICE’s actions have repeatedly proved untrue. The administration accused Good of steering her car directly into the ICE agent who shot her. But a New York Times video analysis demonstrates both that Good’s car was steered away from the agent, and that the agent fired shots into the car from a safe distance. Just a week after Good’s death, agents in Minneapolis shot a Venezuelan man in the leg. The administration claimed that the man provoked the shooting by assaulting ICE agents with a deadly weapon, but that was also contradicted by video evidence.

Gal Beckerman: Minnesota had its Birmingham moment

These episodes do not appear to be exceptional. A judge reviewing evidence of ICE’s conduct concluded, “The record adequately illustrates that the defendants have made, and will continue to make, a common practice of conduct that chills observers’ and protesters’ First Amendment rights,” and another judge wrote that Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino was “outright lying” under oath about his methods.

The context behind all of these actions is a barely disguised desire to reverse the demographic changes of the past half century. DHS regularly shares white-nationalist memes. Trump has described Somalia in such terms as filthy, dirty, and disgusting, and its people as being “low IQ.” His immigration agenda appears to be aimed not so much at enforcing the law as attacking categories of people he believes do not deserve to live in the United States, irrespective of legal status.

The president has unleashed something akin to an occupying army that feels entitled to brutalize the population and routinely ignore the law. For those communities quaking in terror, simply waiting three years for a new president is not sufficient. Violence is not the answer, but calling out Trump for fomenting it, and advising Minnesotans to record agents on the streets, seems like a measured response.

Conservatives are making the same error they made during the civil-rights era, when outlets such as National Review dismissed protesters as criminals. It is fair enough to give law enforcement some benefit of the doubt, but treating its actions as presumptively legitimate even in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary gives license to the sort of despotism that is staring us in the face.</div>

            <h2>George Saunders Has a New Mantra</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/2026/01/george-saunders-on-his-new-book-vigil/685698/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anyone who loves George Saunders’s writing can tell you about his wicked imagination: luminous, dark, wholly original, and quite frequently supernatural. Saunders is, after all, the man who gave us Lincoln in the Bardo, about a grieving president and the chorus of ghosts he meets in the graveyard; “Escape From Spiderhead,” a Huxley-esque vision of criminal justice and personal responsibility; and “Fox 8,” about a fox who begins to understand human language by eavesdropping on people’s bedtime stories.

The twin currents that run through these and all of his works, including his newest novel, Vigil, about a spirit tending to a dying oil executive, is large-heartedness paired with unsparing wit. Saunders is funny. Hilarious even. (See also: his short story “The Moron Factory,” published in this magazine last year.) I recently spoke with him about how his ideas come to him, karma, and fiction as a source of truth. Our conversation has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.

Adrienne LaFrance: Set the scene for me: Where are you doing your writing? What tools are around you? What do you see on your desk as you write?

George Saunders: Honestly, it doesn’t matter that much to me. I have a really low threshold for vibe. Just whatever. There’s something that happens, I think neurologically, where I’m just like, Okay, this is serious now. I can be on a bus or on a plane, and it’s just like some walls go up where I’m like, Okay, we’re not going outside of this sacred space. I do think of it as sacred. But you could probably say a little more honestly that it’s just where it has to happen, this space where I made my bread and butter.

So it doesn’t really matter. But I do have these little ritual objects. Like I have a quote from Ed Ruscha: Every artist wants to make a picture that will open the gates to heaven. And then there’s a picture that our daughter took of a restaurant in New York that had—I think the restaurant was called America—and it had an inverted American flag [where the stars and stripes have switched spots]. That excites me a little bit, like, Oh yeah, that’s what I’m trying to do.

LaFrance: You’ve said before that sometimes a line of prose will come to you almost in a dream. Do you actually wake up with a sentence or character that has come to you fully formed, or does it flow to you in pieces as you’re walking around?

Saunders: This is a really good writer-talking-to-another-writer question. It’s the interview I would conduct, too! The truth is, it comes so many different ways. And I think the skill that I’ve developed over the years is that, no matter how it comes, I can vet it pretty quickly. Like, I can feel something in the quality of the idea—if it’s a bullshit idea, or one of the ideas that you think about writing but probably should never touch. And then there’s another feeling like, Yeah, maybe. Come back tomorrow. And if it comes back a few times, then I start to take it seriously. Sometimes a little fragment will appear within the wrong story and I’ll move it out. But for me, there is something about the low-intention feeling, where I’m not looking for a story, I’m not hoping to find a way to embed a theme or something. I’m just pretty much an idiot walking through the woods and something goes, Hey, I am delightful!

Read: ‘The Moron Factory,’ a short story by George Saunders

LaFrance: For Vigil, did you start with a character or an idea?

Saunders: It was the idea that there was a generation of people—mostly men—who had spent the best years of their lives refuting climate change when they had pretty good reason to know that it was true. I was doing some reading. And I realized that those men were getting old now. And it was also during a period—one of those almost comical periods—where the weather was going completely haywire. You know, a different disaster every week. And I thought, I wonder if a person like that, if they’re watching the weather, do they go, Oooh, shit? And then that seemed to resonate with other works of literature—of course A Christmas Carol and a lot of Tolstoy—but also it was something that I’m going through as an older person. Just like: How did you do? And how would you decide how you did? Could a person ever arrive at a place where certain truths that seemed undeniable in their youth had been overturned? I mean, I look at my own taste in music.

Saunders: I won’t name bands, but I was so much into that real baroque art rock. Or with reading. I was a big Ayn Rand fan when I was in college. Seemed great to me! It’s lovely that your experience with your life can undermine those earlier ideas, and change them. For most of us, I would imagine those changes are kind of fun and maybe not so bad. But I was thinking, what about for people who started a war? Or delayed action on climate change for 20 or 30 years? Does that truth ever settle on them? Obviously, some people look back and just go, Nope. That’s not a good book. But could someone dislodge them? That is the question.

LaFrance: Dwelling in that mental space—How did I do?, as you put it—how did that affect how you think about your own life?

Saunders: It did something I didn’t expect. It made me resolve to, as regrets come up, just face them. Admit it. That has become a new inner mantra: Admit it. And on so many levels. If you’re reading your work and it’s not quite working, admit it.

We’ve found this with our daughters. They’re such wonderful people. And as they got older, we would have talks with them where we’d say, You know, we kind of messed that up. Sorry. And it’s amazing how that kind of just takes the wind out of any negative sails, to just admit it.

So that’s what this guy in the book can’t do at all. And it’s tragic. It was kind of fun to be him, you know, like, I’m not listening to you. But it was also sad because you keep thinking, Oh, come on, you could give a little bit here. And he’s like, If I give a little bit, I have to give all the way. It also started to make me think a little about various political positions that are very built around denial—the denial of other people’s experience, the denial of the other 50 percent of the population. Ultimately, that’s a terrible, hellish fix to get in, where part of your mind knows that you messed up and would love to repent, and the other part is too frightened. And, of course, the problem is that that combination makes people quite aggressive.

LaFrance: I think what you’re describing—both in your book and in reality—is also this culture of extreme certainty and of doubling down no matter what.

LaFrance: And that takes a toll on everyone, including the people perpetuating it.

Saunders: Yes, 100 percent. I would say it’s karmic in the sense of cause and effect. If you are denying something and you know that it’s true, that’s costing you something every minute in terms of your attention to the rest of the world and your ability to respond to it.

LaFrance: You alluded to getting at the truth in your writing. I’ve talked to a lot of journalists who sometimes find themselves wondering, is the work we’re doing enough? Is it enough to just keep telling the truth? Of course I believe the answer is yes. But I also find myself turning to the arts for truth in a world where reality seems ever shakier. Do you think of the work you’re doing as truth-seeking at its core, or is it all just creative expression?

Saunders: I think they’re the same, actually. As a writer of fiction, you’re seeking truth, but that sounds a little lofty. For me—I’m trying to compel you to come in closer as a reader. How do I do that? Truth is a pretty good way. For example, let’s say I was writing a character, your age, and I got it just right about what high school was like—the smell and the feel of the high-school hallway. You’re leaning in. That’s a technique that writers have always used, but it’s also a form of intimacy, or honesty, to say I know you. We have the same basic brain structure. So if I talk to you about fresh-cut grass on a summer day, I’m going, You know that? And you go, Yeah. And even in times like this, if I try to become the most alert version of myself in that, and I hand it to you, and it lights up your brain, then we’ve just reassured ourselves that that’s a real thing. To reach across time and space and say, You’re not alone. And I don’t mean that in a mushy greeting-card way. You’re not alone. I’m just you on a different day.

I don’t know if you feel this, but I have felt sometimes, reading different magazines and newspapers, that in a certain way, we’re like a very polite older gentleman who’s used to talking in a certain way. And then some thug comes along and knocks him over. And he’s like, I say! It’s like our modes of fairness are getting outlapped by this ridiculousness. But in my work, what I think I’m doing is imagining all these readers who are as frustrated—and maybe even as agitated and scared—as I am, and saying, Okay, let’s resist, but let us not lose ourselves. And one way we can continue to be ourselves is to reassure ourselves that truth and love are still operative. Of course they’re still operative! Cause and effect, still operative. Sometimes I feel like I’m painting the baseboards in a house in which the roof is collapsing. But then maybe somebody would go, Oh, it’s raining in here, but nice baseboards!

LaFrance: But then the sunlight’s coming in where the roof used to be—and did you see those baseboards with all that beautiful sunlight on them?

LaFrance: I’m curious what you’re reading now.

Saunders: I’m reading The Power Broker. It’s really humbling. Just the detail. And then the other thing I read before that, I read Nabokov’s Speak, Memory, which I also hadn’t read. And then I read—I found, in Santa Monica, they had these boxes where people put out their old books, and I found a 1960 combined edition of Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass. And it was mind-blowing! It was so funny. And deeply political without being political at all—I loved that.

LaFrance: Which books have you reread most over the years?

Saunders: I reread Chekhov. And I read Dead Souls [by Nikolai Gogol] often.

LaFrance: It’s very funny. It’s also Mel Brooks’s favorite book, and I always want to read and watch everything he ever loved.

Saunders: I love that fact. That’s amazing. And, yeah, of course. It makes sense.

LaFrance: This is funny to me because there’s a quality that I ascribe to his work that I also see in yours—this insistent lightness, or even playfulness, in spite of everything else. People don’t necessarily think of Chekhov or Gogol as funny—but they really were. And your books and stories explore the darkest themes while also retaining that light.

Saunders: I do think that’s a comic view of the world. In those moments when we lose control of our lives—which thankfully don’t happen that often, but they do happen. It’s kind of like there’s this action—and this is total Gogol—that produces a reaction, but it’s off. It’s off, and then somebody reacts to the reaction and that’s off. Like life is a pool table but the billiard balls are all weighted in a funny way. That for me is the root of comedy, or at least one root of comedy.

The other one is for somebody to kind of vault over the conventional way of approaching something because those conventional truths sometimes protect power. If you vault over that, say the true thing, and the person laughs? Boom, you’ve made a connection. But maybe the simpler answer here is: I’ve always been a person who jokes.

Saunders: My first girlfriend broke up with me in front of the locker room at the high school and she said, You just make too many jokes. You’re always joking.

Saunders: Yeah! And then I made a joke! And she walked off.

LaFrance: Do you remember what the joke was?

Saunders: I don’t. I know I said something funny, but I don’t remember what it could possibly have been. I think for me it’s a reflex. And sometimes it’s kind of a place to hide, you know?

LaFrance: Of course. Humor as deflection.

Saunders: But in the exact same flavor, it is when I’m feeling things the most deeply that some form of humor comes out. With Lincoln in the Bardo, I realized that humor is actually a subcategory of the thing we just might call wit. And wit is basically the alertness of the writer—being aware of where the reader might be, and then responding to that. So we’re in a really close dance. Sometimes it’s funny, but other times it can be a whole bunch of other different nuanced things where I see where you are, I move you slightly left, you know.

Read: George Saunders on Chekhov’s different visions of happiness

LaFrance: As you’re writing, how are you assessing what’s working or not? How much are you thinking about this dance with the reader in the moment of writing?

Saunders: You know, this is the funny thing. I’m never thinking about it, actually. What it reminds me of most is when I was in high school, I could sometimes be a good class clown. And I had one teacher who really didn’t particularly like you interrupting in class. With her, if you got it right, her face would do this thing where she just would look at you like, All right.

Saunders: So I think about that still. It’s all about when you pull the switch. As a joke comes into your head, if it stays there just a second too long and then you say it, it doesn’t land. There’s an optimal launching point. When I’m typing something fresh, I’m in that mindset. And it’s the same when I’m revising.

LaFrance: The timing, the rhythm, all of it. Though comedians develop their sense over time by experiencing the audience react. With other forms of writing, it’s so solitary, but you still develop this instinct without any feedback from the audience.

Saunders: That’s right. Junot Díaz, I heard him say once that a writer is just somebody who realized rather early that language is power. That’s true of a lot of stand-up or even just comedic riffing—where if you could do it well, you could stay with the grown-ups.

LaFrance: I’ve been thinking so much about the power of language lately, with regard to artificial intelligence—just the degree to which it will change us, having machines that people assume can converse like humans, even though anybody can discern pretty quickly that these models are sycophantic fabulists. But what does it mean to have machines mimicking us in this way?

Saunders: It’s fun, on some level. It’s a fascinating thing. And I think it’s one of those moments where it’s actually as simple as it appears, at least in terms of writing: You should do it yourself. It’s honorable to do it yourself. And when you do it yourself, you put things in there that a machine doesn’t know about you or anything else, things that you learned, you know? So of course you can have a pretty good simulation, but why? What’s the value? I hear people say, Oh, but I really struggle with personal writing. And I’m like, then struggle.

When I pick up a book by anybody, I want that person’s life filtered through that particular art form to come and land on me with my particular experience of both life and the form. So I don’t see what all the fuss is. The only reason I’m afraid is—you know, if you put somebody in a world where they only heard Muzak, their aesthetics would change. Their discernment would change. And then if they listened to Mozart, it would just bother them; they wouldn’t get it. So I do worry about that. And anybody who’s been moved by a novel knows that that’s a big sacrifice. To give up your ability to be moved by a work of prose is a big loss for you.

LaFrance: I’m an optimistic person generally, but I really do believe that despite what you hear about people not wanting to read anymore and not knowing how to read anymore—the power of the written word is undisputed. Maybe it’s not for everyone. But for the people it is for? A few weekends ago, I went to this marathon reading of Moby-Dick at the New Bedford Whaling Museum. It takes place over the course of 30 hours. I loved it so much. One of the most beautiful aspects was that as the hours went on, more and more people started showing up in the hallways, just sitting there reading Moby-Dick silently together. I left thinking, As long as people continue to gather around literature this way, humans are going to be fine. We’re going to be great.

Saunders: That’s true. You know, I do this Substack Story Club. If anyone wants to be encouraged, just look at the comments. Because people are so humane and so smart and so generous with each other. I’ve been thinking about this, that maybe the way we judge how we’re doing is wrong. Because if there’s a core of dedicated readers like there was in the hallways at the museum, they have a disproportionate influence in the world. One, because they themselves are powerful, but also because the way that the light comes to them—through a work of prose—is so much more exquisite. But I do have to say, I feel that part of our political mess has to do with cognitive degradation. The things that people say, the way they say them, the way we accept it.

LaFrance: The informational environment is a mess.

Saunders: It’s a big mess. I was thinking recently about the story about the poison well. How there’s a kingdom, and it has only one well, and if you drink from it, it makes you insane. And then the king, who has his own well, has a decision to make: Should he drink from the poison well and rule his people? Now here’s where the metaphor gets a little messy, because what I think we have to do is protect the clean well. Even if it’s just a little bit of flame in your hand, don’t let the flame go out. In the ’60s, they would talk about the silent majority. Now I think there is a silent majority—or maybe a silent semi-majority—of literary, literate people. So I take some encouragement in that.

LaFrance: Did you ever read that Carl Sagan book from the 1990s, The Demon-Haunted World?

LaFrance: You should take a look at it. He was extraordinarily prescient and always humane and sort of romantic in the way that some of your work is. He was very worried then about a lot of what actually has come to pass. Hearing you talk about the poison well makes me think of him—and how that little flame in our hands is not just about believing in literature but believing in empiricism and the Enlightenment, beauty and truth.

Saunders: Essentially, we’re set up to be selfish. And all those things that you just listed—beauty, truth, empiricism—if a person abides in hardship long enough, they’ll see that all those things you just mentioned are quantifiable goods. The way that they can escape from misery is to be alert to truth. I mean, if you’re in the jungle, you’d better be alert to truth, because otherwise you’ll die. And so if we see literature as just a rarefied version of truth, any sensible person would eventually gravitate toward it because it is life-enhancing, sometimes lifesaving. So it’s not like we’re trying to sell them a lofty, lacy-filigree thing. It’s like, do you want to be in touch with reality or not? Do you want it to be in touch with reality in the deepest way, or do you want to be an amateur?

LaFrance: Water, sunlight, truth, beauty. That’s all we need.

            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/2026/01/ai-slop-science-publishing/685704/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On a frigid Norwegian afternoon earlier this month, Dan Quintana, a psychology professor at the University of Oslo, decided to stay in and complete a tedious task that he had been putting off for weeks. An editor from a well-known journal in his field had asked him to review a paper that they were considering for publication. It seemed like a straightforward piece of science. Nothing set off any alarm bells, until Quintana looked at the references and saw his own name. The citation of his work looked correct—it contained a plausible title and included authors whom he’d worked with in the past—but the paper it referred to did not exist.

Every day, on Bluesky and LinkedIn, Quintana had seen academics posting about finding these “phantom citations” in scientific papers. (The initial version of the Trump administration’s “MAHA Report” on children’s health, released last spring, contained more than half a dozen of them.) But until Quintana found a fake “Quintana” paper cited in a journal he was refereeing, he’d figured that the problem was limited to publications with lower standards. “When it happens at a journal that you respect, you realize how widespread this problem is,” he told me.

For more than a century, scientific journals have been the pipes through which knowledge of the natural world flows into our culture. Now they’re being clogged with AI slop.

Scientific publishing has always had its plumbing problems. Even before ChatGPT, journal editors struggled to control the quantity and quality of submitted work. Alex Csiszar, a historian of science at Harvard, told me that he has found letters from editors going all the way back to the early 19th century in which they complain about receiving unmanageable volumes of manuscripts. This glut was part of the reason that peer review arose in the first place. Editors would ease their workload by sending articles to outside experts. When journals proliferated during the Cold War spike in science funding, this practice first became widespread. Today it’s nearly universal.

But the editors and unpaid reviewers who act as guardians of the scientific literature are newly besieged. Almost immediately after large language models went mainstream, manuscripts started pouring into journal inboxes in unprecedented numbers. Some portion of this effect can be chalked up to AI’s ability to juice productivity, especially among non-English-speaking scientists who need help presenting their research. But ChatGPT and its ilk are also being used to give fraudulent or shoddy work a new veneer of plausibility, according to Mandy Hill, the managing director of academic publishing at Cambridge University Press & Assessment. That makes the task of sorting wheat from chaff much more time-consuming for editors and referees, and also more technically difficult. “From here on, it’s going to be a constant arms race,” Hill told me.

Adam Day runs a company in the United Kingdom called Clear Skies that uses AI to help scientific publishers stay ahead of scammers. He told me that he has a considerable advantage over investigators of, say, financial fraud because the people he’s after publish the evidence of their wrongdoing where lots of people can see it. Day knows that individual scientists might go rogue and have ChatGPT generate a paper or two, but he’s not that interested in these cases. Like a narcotics detective who wants to take down a cartel, he focuses on companies that engage in industrialized cheating by selling papers in large quantities to scientist customers.

These “paper mills” have to do their work at scale, and so they tend to recycle their own materials, even to the point of putting out multiple papers with closely matching text. Day told me that he finds these templates by looking through the papers flagged as being fraudulent by scientific publishers. When he sees a high rate of retractions on a particular template, he trains his tool to look for other, unflagged papers that might have been produced the same way.

Some scientific disciplines have become hotbeds for slop. Publishers are sharing intelligence about the most egregious ones, according to Jennifer Wright, the head of research integrity and publication ethics at Cambridge University Press. Unfortunately, many are fields that society would very much like to be populated with genuinely qualified scientists—cancer research, for one. The mills have hit on a very effective template for a cancer paper, Day told me. Someone can claim to have tested the interactions between a tumor cell and just one protein of the many thousands that exist, and as long as they aren’t reporting a dramatic finding, no one will have much reason to replicate their results.

AI can also generate the images for a fake paper. A now-retracted 2024 review paper in Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology featured an AI-generated illustration of a rat with hilariously disproportionate testicles, which not only passed peer review but was published before anyone noticed. As embarrassing as this was for the journal, little harm was done. Much more worrying is the ability of generative AI to conjure up convincing pictures of thinly sliced tissue, microscopic fields, or electrophoresis gels that are commonly used as evidence in biomedical research.

Day told me that waves of LLM-assisted fraud have recently hit faddish tech-related fields in academia, including blockchain research. Now, somewhat ironically, the problem is affecting AI research itself. It’s easy to see why: The job market for people who can credibly claim to have published original research in machine learning or robotics is as strong, if not stronger, than the one for cancer biologists. There’s also a fraud template for AI researchers: All they have to do is claim to have run a machine-learning algorithm on some kind of data, and say that it produced an interesting outcome. Again, so long as the outcome isn’t too interesting, few people, if any, will bother to vet it.

Conference proceedings are the main publishing venue for articles in AI and other computer sciences, and in recent years they’ve been overrun with submissions. NeurIPS, one of the top AI conferences, has seen them double in five years. ICLR, the leading conference for deep learning, has also experienced an increase, and it appears to include a fair amount of slop: An LLM-detection start-up analyzed submissions for its upcoming meeting in Brazil and found more than 50 that included hallucinated citations. Most had not been caught during peer review.

That might be because many of the peer reviews were themselves done by AI. Pangram Labs recently analyzed thousands of peer reviews that were submitted to ICLR, and found that more than half of them were written with help from an LLM, and about a fifth of them were wholly AI-generated. Across the academic sciences, paper authors have even started using tiny white fonts to embed secret messages to LLM reviewers. They urge the AIs to rave about the paper they’re reading, to describe it as “groundbreaking” and “transformative,” and to save them the trouble of a tough revision by suggesting only easy fixes.

AI science slop has spread beyond the journals now, and is also overrunning other venues for disseminating research. In 1991, Paul Ginsparg, who was then a physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, set up a special server where his colleagues could upload their forthcoming papers right after they finished writing them. That way, they could get immediate feedback on these “preprints” while the notoriously slow peer-review process played out. The arXiv, as the server came to be called, grew quickly, and spawned sister sites in other disciplines. Together, they now form the fastest-moving firehose of new scientific knowledge that has ever existed. But in the months after ChatGPT was released, preprint servers experienced the same spike in submissions that journals did.

Ginsparg, who is now a professor of information science at Cornell, told me he hoped that this would be a short-lived trend, but the rate of submissions continues to rise. Every arXiv preprint now gets at least a brief glance by a scientist before it’s posted, to make sure it’s at least a plausible piece of science, but the models are getting better at clearing this hurdle. In 2025, Ginsparg collaborated with several colleagues on an analysis of submissions that had recently been posted to the arXiv. They found that scientists who appeared to be using LLMs were posting about 33 percent more papers than researchers who didn’t.

A similar influx of AI-assisted submissions has hit bioRxiv and medRxiv, the preprint servers for biology and medicine. Richard Sever, the chief science and strategy officer at the nonprofit organization that runs them, told me that in 2024 and 2025, he saw examples of researchers who had never once submitted a paper sending in 50 in a year. Research communities have always had to sift out some junk on preprint servers, but this practice makes sense only when the signal-to-noise ratio is high. “That won’t be the case if 99 out of 100 papers are manufactured or fake,” Sever said. “It’s potentially an existential crisis.”

Given that it’s so easy to publish on preprint servers, they may be the places where AI slop has its most powerful diluting effect on scientific discourse. At scientific journals, especially the top ones, peer reviewers like Quintana will look at papers carefully. But this sort of work was already burdensome for scientists, even before they had to face the glut of chatbot-made submissions, and the AIs themselves are improving, too. Easy giveaways, such as the false citation that Quintana found, may disappear completely. Automated slop-detectors may also fail. If the tools become too good, all of scientific publishing could be upended.

When I called A. J. Boston, a professor at Murray State University who has written about this issue, he asked me if I’d heard of the dead-internet conspiracy theory. Its adherents believe that on social media and in other online spaces, only a few real people create posts, comments, and images. The rest are generated and amplified by competing networks of bots. Boston said that in the worst-case scenario, the scientific literature might come to look something like that. AIs would write most papers, and review most of them, too. This empty back-and-forth would be used to train newer AI models. Fraudulent images and phantom citations would embed themselves deeper and deeper in our systems of knowledge. They’d become a permanent epistemological pollution that could never be filtered out.</div>

You know something is true when a CEO comes out and says it&#39;s not true. #Microslop anyone?

Well, one CEO says it&#39;s true that AI is taking over everything, another says it&#39;s true that AI is overblown. Now what do we do?

I think it&#39;s a bubble.  And in the case of Workday&#39;s shitty ATS that can&#39;t even read a resume and requires you to *completely retype your resume into a web form* I think their AI is a failure.

How did Workday get so big? Is it following the WeWork trajectory?

Bamboo engineered materials are superior to almost anything else we currently use for certain applications.I spec laminated bamboo structural panels for designs requiring better strength, dimensional stability and vibrational attenuation than current engineered wood productsIt even exceeds some traditional metal structural elements in certain applications.It also costs about 3x as much as other wood for the panels I use, so no one uses it for cost savings. But it does justify that cost with a lot of extra value.Bamboo does happen to also grow in China, like it does in much of the world, but that does not justify your blind bigotry and racism against a building material.Seriously? Racism, against plants that happen to grow near by people you don&#39;t like? You must be very intelligent.

I understand that we have had some very serious fires in buildings that use wood, too.Can you explain to us why we don&#39;t stop completely using wood as well?By your logic, any use of wood for anything after the 1666 Great Fire of London was pure idiocyConcrete and steel should have been banned after the 9/11 building collapses, as those proved unsafe to you as well I suppose?

A highrise in Hong Kong that burned up that had a lot of bamboo in it burn up recently?

Look this is impressive, and I&#39;m all for carbon-friendly building materials. But a 20 m tall building is hardly a &quot;high-rise.&quot;

And what does &quot;win&quot; mean?I think the win state is being the last one standing and establishing the type of dominant monopoly status that Google, Amazon, Nvidia, or TSMC have in their domains. But, even bigger. Is it possible? I dont know, but I think thats the dream of these companies/nations/whatever.

For the CEO of this French AI company, it means getting the EU to give him money to restore French pride while claiming it&#39;s all about the European economy. See also Quaero, which had the same goal, aiming to replace Google back when search engines were all the rage. Why these guys think playing the &quot;also ran&quot; game is going to get them ahead at anything is anybody&#39;s guess.

Artificial General Intelligence, I would imagine.

The Chinese are spending much less on it, and on top of that, they have a lot more to spend. It has been debated whether it was the US/SU arms race that broke the SU&#39;s back, but here we almost certainly have one that will break the US&#39;s back. The US has basically put their whole economy all in on the one chip that is AI.There&#39;s far less transparency into Chinese funding and spending for AI.  However, it&#39;s unreasonable for the Chinese to have both more funding and less spending on a technology that has been identified as critical on a national level.  That makes no sense.  It&#39;s clear that the Chinese are spending lots of money and resources on AI.  Most of the Chinese money is coming essentially (directly or indirectly) from the government, in contrast to the US where the funding is essentially private.Will this spending &quot;b

How is none false? Are any of the firms training models actually profitable yet? Last I checked they were all in the red.

China switched to optical processors.Since nearly 3 years already.

100 - 1000 times faster than GPU/TPUs, and for 1/30th of the energy.

160 tera-operations per second per watt (TOPS/W)See for example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?... [youtube.com]Google &quot;Tai Chi optical processor&quot; or &quot;Tai Chi II&quot;.In Germany we have a few start ups that do the same.

AI executive, talking about China, at the WEF.  Three strong reasons to completely disregard everything said here.

Even if the AI CEOs are right, and China is 6 months behind, that only means that the rate of improvement is more important than the questionable benchmarks they cite. And in that regard, China is far ahead.

China is behind the cutting edge by months or yearsBeing ahead by months is trivial, and the competition is on your heels and possibly gaining. Being ahead by years gives you some substantial breathing room.If they can&#39;t pin down the size of the gap better than that, maybe they should get their AIs to figure it out for them. /sarc

Right.  And probably just as well.  If it doesn&#39;t have Japanese &quot;guts&quot;, it shouldn&#39;t be called a Sony

Samsung ate Sony&#39;s lunch. Then Samsung got uppity and priced themselves out of the running. Today LG is king.

It&#39;s LG&#39;s market to lose. TLC is utter shit. But, dat price doh.

LG is quite shit also. WebOS is the laggiest crap ever.

I have to use it to change inputs, genius. Unless you want to buy me a nice 4k HDMI switch.

Well unfortunately they haven&#39;t nailed single tasking. The interface lag is astounding. Just getting into the menu and changing image settings is agonizing.

Today LG is king. It&#39;s LG&#39;s market to lose.

The Law of Enshittification [wikipedia.org] means LG will get arrogant & greedy, grab their money one day, milk their cow dry, and then run away.

we&#39;re not sure yet if the new facility will have the ability to make TV-sized OLED panels, at least to start.Most people will be watching TikTok* on their phones, walking along, head down, while crossing the street against the light.
*Most probably episodes of Ow! My balls!

My father used to work at RCA (computers and aerospace) and tells this story of how RCA lost its way in TVs. The background of RCA is that they were the premier high-end TV maker during the 60s and into the 70s. They were riding high and then lost it all.

Step one: RCA signs a contract with Sears to make RCA black-and-white TVs under the &quot;Sears&quot; name

Step two: Sony, then a scrappy little company, goes to RCA and offers to sell to RCA the TVs for the Sears contract for less than RCA can build them. Note that RCA is not the first high-end manufacturer that is unable to stay up to date when making low-cost devices.  RCA accepts this offer.

Step three: Sony goes to Sears and grabs the previously lucrative contract from RCA. It&#39;s a &quot;curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal&quot; kind of deal.

Only one company sells TVs.Only two companies (or maybe one) sell smartphones.How wonderful for ROI.ObDisclosure: When I worked for Ameritech, I was required to sign, and thus become a co-signer, to the legal settlement that dismembered Ma Bell.

The Sony Trinitron [wikipedia.org] was one of the best consumer-grade color TV display technologies around during the life of its key patents (late 1960s through 1996).

After the patents expired, Sony couldn&#39;t charge the premium it could during the patent life.  That was the beginning of the end.  The switch to newer technologies sealed its fate.

Most &quot;creative&quot; works nowadays are built upon years of influence from other existing work. What an LLM is doing isn&#39;t all that different really.

True!  And not just that: one of the claims of AI advocates, like Mark Cuban, was that AI would take over all the drudgery and repetitive work that humans do, and the only thing humans will have to be is become more creative.  Not only are most humans not creative: AI does a pretty good job of its own in the creative realm.  I&#39;ve watched quite a few AI videos, and was pretty impressed

Also, what if less talented humans use AI to create music?  Will they get the same recognition as normal musicians, who use

&quot;those old Blues masters they &quot;lifted&quot; from ....&quot;But they also contributed by changing and adding to said riffs.So-called AI is not capable of adding to the gestalt, but can only derive from existing data. It can&#39;t create anything new.Now if you as a person were to use AI as a basis to begin from and then add to, there is a possiblity of creation.

Posting A/C since I know I&#39;ll be pounded into oblivion for this.  However, I used to pay people to draw stuff for an AD&D campaign run on Discord, as commissions.  I&#39;d get people flaking out, lying about what has been paid, given art that might be ok for a furry pr0n lover or scribbled in MSPaint.  I suck at drawing, so that isn&#39;t an issue.

The fix?  MidJourney, and other AI programs.  Once I got approval from players to use AI, I was able to get the pictures/drawings about events, and they were more tha

That&#39;s a good use of AI.
  You are not trying to sell what was &quot;created&quot;. For your personal use it is a great tool. I use meta to do a similar thing. I &quot;created&quot; a unique monetary system and the coins to support it. I think of using AI like that as similar to the quick NPC generator at https://www.fastcharacter.com/ [fastcharacter.com] Trying to sell somthing created by AI leaves a multitude of issues. Do you/can you &quot;OWN&quot; something AI created ?

Says someone who&#39;s never created anything, including dinner.

Usually you&#39;d pay the authors or artists for your own personal copy of their work to influence and inspire your own, though. The AI companies don&#39;t even do that.

What if I just I borrowed it from a library or heard it on the radio?

The AI companies are slimy, but copyright should never control who can read those books or listen to that music, that would be cultural and intellectual suicide.

When you borrowed it at the library a small but non-zero royalty payment went to the author. Same when it was played on the radio, paid for by advertising, media tax, or however your radio station of choice is financed.

Take a look at the story about Nvidia trying to get high-speed access to a library of pirated books.

This. But what you mention is not all of it. No one likes AI slop, but it is not slop because it is created by AI. It is slop because it is bad, REGARDLESS of how it was made. Stop blaming AI on the slop issue. People have the option to continue tuning for better output but they stop when it&#39;s good enough to get views. If the content is GOOD, who cares where it came from? Same for when it is bad. ALSO, if someone creates two identical videos, one completely done by humans using software tools like photoshop

The point on terms and the subversion of them stands, but I&#39;d like to nitpick a bit - most of the process of conversion of copyright and other temporary monopolies to the &quot;intellectual property&quot; fiction and to extending it until forever isn&#39;t artists&#39; doing, but the doing of their hungry lawyers.

I don&#39;t think you understood what I wrote based on your reply. I said it was for corporations.

Stealing isn&#39;t innovation, which is why we shouldn&#39;t respect the modern term of copyright. Its original limit&#39;s intent was to allow The People to have control of their cultural identity. Those terms have been extended again and again specifically to prevent that for the purpose of guaranteeing profit not for creators, but for corporations.The natural limitation on copying is no limit. Copyright was supposed to be a limited time thing, not for longer than the typical creator&#39;s lifetime. Copying is a natural right.I&#39;d like to see copyright go back to a reasonable time limit, like author&#39;s lifetime, or even less. But I really don&#39;t like the trend of folks decrying copyright as a concept at all right when it&#39;s convenient for the corporations who have traditionally supported extended copyright to abolish copyright outright so they have the right to outright steal all creative works from the moment of inception. Copyright of reasonable limits? Yes. Abolish it outright right now? Fuck no. Let those fucking tech companies work around it like the other corporations have made all of humanity work around it over the past few decades.

The problem for most writers and movie-makers is not people stealing their work but people finding their work. Copyright primarily exists to keep Disney and other big media companies in business.

And big business has mostly worked around it in recent decades by bribing politicians to keep extending the duration.

If Disney takes my book and republishes it with their name instead of mine, that&#39;s fraud. If Disney takes my book, copies the plot and turns it into a movie, their lawyers will ensure they don&#39;t have to pay me for it.

&quot;I&#39;d like to see copyright go back to a reasonable time limit, like author&#39;s lifetime, or even less.&quot;

Copyright in the US was originally 14 years, renewable once for another period of 14 years if the copyright holder was still alive.

Training AI models isn&#39;t &quot;stealing&quot; or &quot;theft&quot;, nor is that training claimed to be the &quot;innovation&quot;.

Current intellectual property laws simply don&#39;t work, making dishonest claims about that law doesn&#39;t work either.  We need new law, billionaires won&#39;t allow it except to protect their wealth and power.

It&#39;s not, because you can theoretically determine exactly which documents, songs or movies the LLM used to create its output. You can&#39;t do that for a human unless they&#39;re doing it intentionally and obviously.

We can do a lot with an AI trained in pre-1923 literature, pre-1923 sheet music (especially classical and other pre-20th-century styles), etc.

&quot;ChatGPT, give me music in the style of J. S. Bach, suitable for playing by a small ensemble consisting of ...&quot;

Good ideas will always be copied. Artificial gatekeeper laws are doomed to fail.

The logical answer to people copying your shit is to keep making new shit. Don&#39;t expect a free ride forever on that one idea you came up with 10 years ago. I mean you&#39;re a &quot;creative&quot; right? so go create.

The version of Spencer Pittman visible to the world on social media, at least until last month, was familiar to anyone who has lived in a very Christian part of the country. Pittman, on his Instagram account, posted photos of himself in a baseball uniform in high school and college, action shots on the diamond, and off-field photos of more casual moments with captions such as “God is good. Thankful for my teammates.” On X, he chronicled his college career as an outfielder for Coahoma Community College in western Mississippi, posting his game schedules, his personal records in the gym, and videos of his training captioned with scripture passages. With his gym clothes, cross necklace, floppy hair, and singular fixation on linking all of his efforts and successes to his faith, the 19-year-old Pittman looked like the archetype of the Southern Christian sports bro. In a note accompanying one video of batting practice from late 2024, he wrote: “If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. Romans 12:18.”

But last week, Pittman confessed to burning down a synagogue in Jackson, Mississippi. It was an act of calculated and ambitious hate, targeting the Beth Israel Synagogue, Jackson’s oldest synagogue and a building that had been firebombed by the Ku Klux Klan back in 1967. Pittman, who was arrested Saturday night after his father contacted the FBI, told investigators he had targeted the “Synagogue of Satan” for its “Jewish ties.” Authorities also say he laughed when his father confronted him and bragged that he “finally got them.” (No one was hurt in the arson.)

The question of how Spencer Pittman was radicalized is, so far, a slightly confounding one. He does not look to be an isolated internet obsessive with overt ties to white nationalists. He appeared to have friends—or at least teammates. He seemed to be from a comfortable suburban background. His life appeared to be a largely offline one, with community in his world of athletics.

There are gaps in our understanding of how Pittman went from a baseball-obsessed teenager to a fanatical antisemite. But he left enough of his digital world visible to the public for us to piece together some clues. Pittman, it seems, had found himself highly active in a strange community on the internet—one of those bizarre new digital spaces where toxic forms of masculinity culture merge with fundamentalist Christianity. This Christian-bro gym culture offers many young men an intoxicating sense of purpose, one in which the pursuit of conventional masculinity is given a kind of divine backing. Depending on who you ask, this culture is part of the manosphere, right-wing purity culture, or reactionary religious politics. But however you categorize this subculture, it may provide some clues to understanding how a gym rat could encounter militant new ideas.

The clearest insight into Pittman’s version of this world came in early January, when he posted a link to a website for a lifestyle brand called “One Purpose.” The site, which according to Mississippi Today was registered to Pittman in December, advertised a kind of wellness subscription service with a mishmash of Gen Z buzzwords and Christian self-help: looksmaxxing (including mewing and “facial aesthetics”), testosterone optimization, scripture memorization, divine schedule optimization, A.I. food scanning, financial tracking, and Bible-based workouts. The brand appeared to take the Bible very literally in its inspiration, scattering Hebrew throughout and promising a diet based on biblical foods (as in those specifically mentioned in scripture, such as figs, olives, and barley) and a health plan that enabled the biblical patriarchs to live for centuries. (“Their secret? Biblical eating patterns, fasting, and walking with God.”) The latter was advertised as a “life-expectancy maxxing protocol.”

If you spend some time on the website, you’ll see signs of how Pittman saw this world—or at least how he was trying to sell it to others. One section of the website explains “Why the World’s Way Has Failed You,” noting that secular diet and workout plans will fail young men because they aren’t pushing them to be disciplined enough. (The site is geared exclusively toward men.) “God’s solution,” on the other hand, asks these men to “build their temple”—their bodies—“for His glory,” giving them proper motivation to hit the gym.

While it may seem baffling to many Christians and non-Christians alike, this kind of exercise-based faith expression is not uncommon among a certain category of young men, experts say. According to Mariel Barnes, a professor who researches gender and public affairs at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, it offers the same appeal as other factions of the “manosphere”—incels, pickup artists, and male separatists, for example—by emphasizing the power of men and the importance of traditional gender roles.

According to the Rev. Angela Denker, a Lutheran pastor and the author of Disciples of White Jesus: The Radicalization of American Boyhood, that hyperfixation on masculinity is a common element of extreme right-wing Christianity. The vision of a kind of premodern, brutish masculinity provides a comfortingly simple guide for how a young man should act in a complex world—and the religious backing makes him feel more righteous in his belief.

The question of how he got from there to extreme antisemitism is murky. But experts in masculinity and right-wing Christianity noted that the different ideas that fed into this subculture encourage rigid ideology and bold action.

Take, for example, the website’s offer of a “Biblical longevity protocol based on Noah, Moses, and Caleb’s lifespans”—a prominent feature on the page. It sounds like nonsense, but it’s new internet framing of an older idea. The term “life-expectancy maxxing” appears to be original, but some Christians have occasionally claimed that the Bible offers a kind of code to the ideal form of bodily existence. According to Heidi Campbell, a Texas A&M University professor who researches technology, religion, and digital culture, in the 1990s, the era of fad dieting, the country saw a revival in biblical dieting, in which people looked through Levitical laws for instruction on nutrition and fasting.

But it’s internet culture that allowed Pittman to package this as a kind of Christian answer to Silicon Valley’s anti-aging movement, in which you can hack your way to a long life with the right interactive tech tool, plus God. There’s nothing hate-oriented about that. Still, it calls on young men to cast off their old interests and influences and remake their lives by embracing a collection of extreme worldviews—in this case, tech’s optimization culture, fundamentalist Christianity, and the manosphere’s aesthetic self-improvement culture. When that level of single-minded intensity is brought to reforming the physical body, Campbell said, it can set the conditions for other kinds of extremism.

“There can be a lot of overlap with different people who tend toward more extremist ideas and behaviors,” Campbell said. “That jump in an extreme in how you treat bodies to an extreme in how you treat culture—that idea of purification—can be twisted to justify certain logic.”

“It’s not just being healthy but resisting anything ‘polluting’ to your body, to your mind, to the culture,” she added.

Pittman clearly saw these things—body, mind, culture—as connected. On Instagram, Pittman posted about what he perceived as the true threats to the world: “How to destroy society: Make discipline cringe. Make truth offensive. Make masculinity shameful.”

These ideas are often articulated in conservative Christian spaces as about being a “warrior” for Christ. The Christian warrior defends society against secular, feminist groups that want to eradicate family values and spread moral confusion. He is not afraid to be strong and fight for what he knows to be Biblical truth.

Usually, pastors advocating for young men to be warriors for Christ don’t mention Judaism. But on the internet, it doesn’t take a lot of searching to find men proclaiming themselves to be devoted Christians who will argue that Jews are behind society’s adoption of feminist and secular values. Pittman was clearly immersed in internet culture. And he appears to have bought into the idea, spread by so many on the Christian right, that it was his duty to stand up against Christianity’s “enemies.”

“It’s a theology of power, of power and dominance, and that does lend itself to antisemitism,” Denker said.

It’s possible that Pittman had become, in some way, confused. We don’t know his mental state before the crime. In December, after years of anodyne baseball photos, he started posting about money and cars. He posted selfies meant to show off his physique, a photo of bloodied knuckles, and videos of him driving at 160 miles per hour. He blasted money as the source of all evil while simultaneously bragging about his sports car and “escaping modern slavery” through stock trading. Finally, the night of the crime, he posted a clip from the Comedy Central show Drawn Together in which an antisemitic character panics about “a Jew in my backyard,” confronting an ugly, yellow-skinned cartoon character with a large nose and money bags. This was a hard swerve from Pittman’s inoffensive baseball posting from just a few weeks before.

It will remain hard to piece together Pittman’s path there because he, like every young man on the internet, could have constructed it from any number of sources. He didn’t need a single pastor or priest or denomination to tell him his views; he could have turned to podcasters, influencers, meme pages, YouTube pastors, and any other number of figures for inspiration. Some observers have been quick to point out that Candace Owens and Nick Fuentes have used the phrase “Synagogue of Satan.” But Pittman just as easily could have picked it up from any antisemite: The phrase, used in the Bible to refer to persecutors, has a long history of misuse, including by the KKK, Louis Farrakhan’s Nation of Islam, the televangelist Billy Graham, and various modern Christian white supremacist groups. Until he tells us where he learned it, we can’t know what his inspiration was.

But what we do know is that for young men like Pittman, the internet is awash in groups ready to prey on their confusion and insecurities and tell them that if they only remake themselves to be strong enough, masculine enough, driven enough, powerful enough, they’ll get the approval they want—whether it’s from women, society, or God.

In this member-exclusive episode, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discuss the Supreme Court’s fact-free foray into Trump v. Cook, a case that economists warn could crater the economy. President Donald Trump spent the first weeks of his second stint in the White House firing a lot of people from government agencies. For the most part, the High Court’s conservative justices let it slide, in line with their general “he’s the President, let him do it” posture. But Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook was different. In August, Trump fired off a post on Truth Social, then sacked Cook a few days later, leaving a huge question mark hanging over the independence of the Fed. Turns out, that’s a very big deal for anyone who wants to avoid hyperinflation and economic disaster. During Wednesday’s arguments, it was clear that even Trump’s hand-picked justices felt as though they would like to avoid such catastrophes. What ensued was more about feelings, fear, and frustration than law, but that may be the best we can hope for.

The Supreme Court heard arguments on Wednesday in Trump v. Cook, a monumental case testing Donald Trump’s ability to fire members of the Federal Reserve. In August, the president sought to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook, a Democrat, over dubious allegations of mortgage fraud. The lower courts reinstated Cook after she sued, which prompted the administration to seek emergency relief from the Supreme Court in September. Instead of acting immediately, the justices scheduled the case for oral argument, letting Cook keep her job in the meantime. Now a majority seems prepared to rule in her favor, though it is not clear exactly how it will do so.

In a special bonus episode of Amicus for Slate Plus members, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed the twists and turns of Wednesday’s two-hour showdown between Solicitor General John Sauer and Cook’s attorney, Paul Clement (who is usually an advocate for conservative causes). A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: This is the part that’s going to be painful for both of us, but we have to praise Brett Kavanaugh. He laid out very clearly what he was worried about, and what comes next if Trump wins. He told Solicitor General Sauer: “If this were set as a precedent, it seems to me, just thinking big picture, what goes around comes around. All of the current president’s appointees would likely be removed for cause on Jan. 20, 2029, if there’s a Democratic president. … Once these tools are unleashed, they are used by both sides and usually more the second time around.” And he mentioned the dangers of the government deciding: “Let’s find something, anything, about this person” to accuse them of a crime.

Justice Kavanaugh is essentially saying: Wait a minute, we’re going to give the president unbridled power to go after anyone on the basis of any fishing expedition with the lowest standards? Let’s cop to the fact that it is weird for both of us to laud Kavanaugh being the calm, prescient voice of reason.

Mark Joseph Stern: It is weird, but it’s not surprising, because this has been something of a passion project for Kavanaugh since well before he joined the Supreme Court. He has long tried to craft a theory that the president could purge every other independent agency of holdovers from his predecessors—but that the Federal Reserve was special, so the president cannot fire its members willy-nilly. He acknowledged that this was partly because the Federal Reserve needs independence to perform its duties as a central bank that fights inflation and seeks full employment. And he was almost as honest about that on Wednesday as he had been earlier in his career. He hasn’t changed his tune. I guess he gets points for consistency here.

It was interesting how Kavanaugh didn’t bother all that much with the finer points of law. Instead, he kept asking the solicitor general: Do you want to destroy the Federal Reserve? What do you think is going to happen if you do? He pressed Sauer to say why the Fed’s independence was important, but Sauer wouldn’t bite. So Kavanaugh did it for him and laid out this nightmare vision of what happens with the next president, and how this does not stop with Trump. He said, in very stark terms: This is how you destabilize the Fed and ensure that we no longer have stable monetary policy. And that leads to inflation and recessions in endless cycles.

I was really surprised by one particular thing that he said: “What goes around comes around.” I thought I’d heard those words from Kavanaugh before, and it turns out I have: That’s what he said during his confirmation hearing when he responded to Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations of sexual abuse. In fact, during that hearing, he spoke in similar terms about the cycle of retribution in politics, about how you sow the wind and reap the whirlwind. I wonder if Kavanaugh empathizes with Lisa Cook, because he thinks that he, too, was the victim of a fishing expedition to smear his character and disqualify him from public office.

I think that’s exactly right. And it goes to this deeper point that we have clocked many a time on this show. Sometimes the justices can’t imagine what it’s like to be hauled out of the car for a traffic stop when you’re brown. But Brett Kavanaugh can certainly imagine what it’s like when some state actor says: Let’s find something bad about this person. It sounded like Kavanaugh thinking: Hey, this could happen to me, because it did happen to me. But this goes beyond Kavanaugh. The justices have had mortgages. They can imagine how one mistake—out of hundreds of pages of a mortgage application—could be turned against them.

We need to talk about these facts for a minute. Sauer led with a very strange opening about Lisa Cook’s Bonnie-and-Clyde-like criminal enterprise, painting her as a danger to humankind because of one accidental misrepresentation on hundreds of pages of forms. Several justices seemed keen to send this case back down for a hearing to determine what Cook actually did, or did not, do. But Chief Justice John Roberts seemed to think there’d be no point. In the end, does it matter what the facts of this case are?

We don’t really know, because there are several ways the court could decide the case in Cook’s favor, and a few of them don’t require resolution of the facts. Some justices, including the liberals, were pushing this idea of notice and a hearing—that Cook needed to be properly informed of this allegation, then given an opportunity to contest it. Kavanaugh also seemed to support the idea that Cook should have a real opportunity to respond, asking Sauer: “What’s the fear of more process here?” There seemed to be a real hunger for some sense of justice for Cook, who did not defraud anyone.

Roberts, by contrast, wanted to set aside this whole question of a hearing because that gets into complicated questions about due process. The chief seemed eager to say: Let’s accept that these are the facts. If they’re true, that’s not sufficient cause to remove Cook from the Fed. He was persistently pushing toward the idea that the facts don’t need “airing” out. We know what they are, and they do not rise to “cause” for Cook’s removal. That’s a clean solution, and the liberal justices will probably sign on if it’s necessary to reach five votes. But it would be a little bit unfortunate to deny Cook a true opportunity to rebut these allegations, because it deprives her of that ability to show, in a formal hearing, that she is not a criminal. And without that, there may be a cloud hanging over her continued service on the Federal Reserve Board. That would be pretty tragic.

How else do they resolve this case against Trump if they don’t want to go down that rabbit hole?

Well, we sense they’re going to rule against Trump, but we truly don’t know how it’ll happen. This is the one-in-a-million case in which it really would have made sense to just deny the emergency application without explanation in an unsigned order on the shadow docket, then let the lower courts hash it out. It’s the rare instance in which I wish they would not explain themselves, but now they may feel obligated to. So maybe we’ll get a majority for something clear and straightforward like Roberts wants, or order a hearing for Cook. Or maybe they’re just going to make a mess of the law and Trump will try to exploit the ambiguities to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell next.

It seemed to me, throughout this argument, the vibe from the court was: Yes, Donald Trump, we gave you this red Batphone. You’ve used it to call us every time you don’t get what you want and say it’s an emergency. And we’ve answered you and said yes. But the vibe today from the court was: Why are you calling us on the Batphone? The justices seemed mad that Trump was following the exact directive they laid out, which was to label everything an emergency, go to them with your hurt feelings, and ask them to fix it. It felt a little bit like the tariffs argument: Why are you bringing this to us? Well, because you taught him to. This felt like a room in which the howling winds of nothing were totally emblematic of where we are in the law right now.

On Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney gave a speech on the need for “middle-sized” countries to now form their own alliances, breaking away from the destructive dominance of great powers, including the United States.

On Wednesday, President Donald Trump gave a speech that unintentionally confirmed Carney’s message and heightened its urgency.

Both speeches were delivered at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, an annual confab of the globe’s political and financial leaders that usually sparks little interest outside its walls. But this year’s session is worth all of our attention—it’s marking the pivot to a whole new world.

Trump’s speech, lasting an hour and 12 minutes, was full of his familiar ramble of lies, ignorance, and insults. The difference was that almost everyone in this audience saw through the nonsense and wasn’t amused. (Laughs were few; applause was tepid.)

The only newsworthy moment came when the president said that he wouldn’t use military force to acquire Greenland, prompting a sigh of relief from Europeans and a halt to Tuesday’s tanking of the stock market. But then he doubled down on his insistence that the U.S. had once owned the icy island (untrue) and needs to reacquire it for national security (also untrue).

Otherwise, it was a litany of false boasts (ending “eight-plus wars,” lowering food and gas prices, opening hundreds of steel plants across America) and baseless grievances. The latter included the “stolen” 2020 election, the ingratitude of everyone he has helped, and a NATO alliance in which the U.S. does everything and Europe does nothing. (He neglected, among other things, that the allies came to our aid after the 9/11 attacks, invoking the treaty’s Article 5 for the first time, and subsequently lost about 900 of their troops during the war in Afghanistan.)

It was a rude speech, maybe the rudest by a national leader in Davos history. Partly for that reason, it was also a remarkably unimportant speech—because it failed to address, in any serious way, the Canadian leader’s speech, which is being widely recognized as setting the agenda for our time. (Trump briefly scoffed at Carney’s address, suggesting that he had heard it.)

The prime minister’s main message was that the “rules-based international order,” which has shaped world politics since the end of World War II, is dead—and not likely to be revived. He noted that it was always a bit of a myth anyway, and that America’s allies pretended to embrace it because, for much of this time but especially during the Cold War, bowing to U.S. dominance was an acceptable cost of enjoying U.S. economic favors and security guarantees.

Now, under Trump, the benefits of this arrangement have been reduced, if not eliminated. Though Carney was careful to not utter Trump’s name or even draw too explicit a contrast with previous presidents, his point was clear:

Over the past two decades, a series of crises in finance, health, energy, and geopolitics have laid bare the risks of extreme global integration. But more recently, great powers have begun using economic integration as weapons, tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion, supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited. You cannot live within the lie of mutual benefit through integration when integration becomes the source of your subordination.

In response to these changes, he said, middle powers, such as Canada, must engage in “principled pragmatism” and band together. He elaborated:

This is not naïve multilateralism. … It’s building coalitions that work issue by issue with partners who share enough common ground to act together … creating a dense web of connections across trade, investment, culture on which we can draw for future challenges and opportunities. Our view is, the middle powers must act together, because if we’re not at the table, we’re on the menu.

Unwittingly, in his speech the next day, Trump confirmed the point, bellowing the many ways that he could eat the middle countries for breakfast, bombing and tariffing them into oblivion if he so chose.

It’s not the first time he’s made such bellicose boasts. In an interview this month with the New York Times, a conversation that Carney and everyone else at Davos no doubt read closely, the president said he feels limited in his actions not by international law but only by “my own morality, my own mind—it’s the only thing that can stop me.” Observing his morality and mind on unvarnished display at Davos, the leaders of middle-sized countries could conclude only that Carney’s was the most plausible path to not just peace and prosperity but, perhaps, survival.

It is a path strewn with risk. Carney noted the need for middle countries to spend more on defense, as Canada and others are already doing to some extent. He sidestepped the fact that, at least presently, neither NATO nor any other alliance can organize, much less mount, an effective defense against a determined aggressor without American leadership. I’ve asked defense experts in Berlin and London how long it would take for, say, the European Union to build a cohesive, truly independent defense force if they started right now with the necessary budgets. They have all answered with the same estimate: about 10 years.

This is the craw that sticks in the throats of mindful Europeans who talk about “strategic autonomy.” This is why they have kowtowed to Trump, praised his wisdom, pretended that their compliments stem from respect and not, as is really the case, from fear of abandonment. The new thing in trans-Atlantic (and trans-Pacific) relations—which this session of Davos has highlighted in the wake of Trump’s vindictive tariffs and imperial threats toward Greenland—is that the pretense can no longer be sustained. As Carney put it, the “bargain,” which the middle countries have observed with their protector all these decades, “no longer works. … We participated in the rituals, and we largely avoided calling out the gaps between rhetoric and reality,” but now, Carney noted, the gaps have grown too large. “We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition.”

It’s clear the prime minister understands that ruptures are harder to navigate than transitions, especially when it comes to national security and defense.

This has been a season of newly prominent leaders quoting great radical thinkers. New York’s new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, began his victory speech by quoting Eugene Debs. Carney’s Davos speech drew a great deal from Vaclav Havel’s writings on the “power of the powerless.” In this spirit, I will close, a bit soberly, with a famous line from the Italian Communist Antonio Gramsci’s Prison Notebooks: “The old world is dying, and the new world struggles to be born; now is the time of monsters.”

Carney laid out a vision of the new world, where “from the fracture we can build something bigger, better, stronger, more just.” But the tense drama of the next few months and years may be in how they—and all of us—deal with the monsters.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Most US workers in jobs exposed to AI are also relatively well placed to adapt if disruption leads to displacement, according to research summarized by the Brookings Institution. However, there are some careers with high percentages of female workers that are in a bad position.

Brookings&#39; analysis of a study for the National Bureau of Economic Research, released this week, argues that while many previous assessments have focused on how &quot;exposed&quot; different occupations are to AI, they often overlook what it calls &quot;a critical dimension: workers&#39; ability to adapt if job loss does occur.&quot;

That ability to adapt was based on more obvious factors, such as age and financial security, as well as other issues such as union membership, geography, and the state of local labor markets.

Once these factors were taken into consideration, the researchers concluded that “Of the 37.1 million U.S. workers in the top quartile of occupational AI exposure, 26.5 million also have above-median adaptive capacity.”

So, lawyers, software developers, and financial managers were all in “exposed” roles, but also had “strong pay, financial buffers, diverse skills, and deep professional networks.” They were well-placed to weather any AI-induced storms.

Other roles had much lower levels of exposure to AI and higher adaptivity. So, you might want to consider a future in dentistry, firefighting, or medicine. Or, if you like uniforms but not sharp objects, being a flight attendant could be an option. Butchers were rated amongst the least adaptable, but also amongst the least exposed to the impact of AI.

But, the researchers found, there are roughly 6.1 million workers who “face both high exposure to LLMs and low adaptive capacity to manage a job transition.”

“Many of these workers occupy administrative and clerical jobs where savings are modest, workers’ skill transferability is limited, and reemployment prospects are narrower.”

This, in turn, means that they are more likely to face longer job searches, less chance of actually finding new employment, and “more significant relative earnings losses compared to other workers.”

And, if you haven’t guessed it, “Of these workers, 86 percent are women.”

Geography also came into play. “The concentration of exposed and vulnerable workers is greatest in smaller metro areas and college towns, particularly in the Mountain West and Midwest—reflecting such areas’ elevated presence of administrative and clerical workers.” ®

            <div id="article-text">Bork!Bork!Bork! Microsoft&#39;s flagship OS can power everything from a mini PC to a giant workstation or even a server. But using it for a grocery-store scale might just be overkill.

Weighing fruit and vegetables has always presented a particular challenge. Register readers of a certain age might remember a cheery greengrocer having a set of scales in their shop, ready to weigh produce. This mechanical marvel succumbed to digitization, and the cheery greengrocer was eventually phased out in favor of self-service devices in sprawling supermarkets, and we are where we are today.

Judging by the image sent in by an eagle-eyed Register reader, Windows appears unable to do the one thing the customer needs: deal with the delights of the fruit and vegetable aisle.

Like many of us after the excesses of the festive period, this device is in recovery. Perhaps one sprout too many? It&#39;s hard to tell, though the error code 0xc0000001 suggests something may have gone wrong with the device&#39;s disk. We&#39;d guess a shutdown was attempted and Windows said &quot;nope,&quot; opting instead for Recovery.

We&#39;re sure that every shopper carries around a handy USB recovery disk and keyboard to plug into the afflicted device. However, something like that would certainly qualify as an unexpected item in the bagging area.

At a guess, we&#39;d reckon this is a Windows 10 device and, although most support for the operating system ended in 2025, some editions remain in Microsoft&#39;s good books. There is also the possibility that the store, in this case a Marks & Spencer in the West Midlands, has Extended Security Updates enabled.

We&#39;re not sure that equipping stores with self-service Point Of Sale devices or self-printing labels for bags of fruit and vegetables is necessarily a good thing. Powering such a machine with Microsoft Windows is really unnecessary for something that needs to do one job really well, instead of a multitude of tasks … less well.

Perhaps today&#39;s bork points more to a need for the human touch, rather than some recovery media to get the scales running once more. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ukraine is getting a little AI help with its war against Russia. The country is giving Palantir a new level of access to critical warfighting data so its interceptor drones can become more autonomous.

Ukrainian Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said in a LinkedIn post this week that Palantir was helping the MoD and the country&#39;s defense tech partnership platform Brave1 build what it&#39;s calling a &quot;Dataroom&quot; that will help equip interceptor drones with AI capabilities.

Interceptor drones, for those unaware, are drones designed to take down other drones, like the Shahed-type drones commonly used by Russian armed forces.

&quot;Interceptor drones have already proven their effectiveness and cost-efficiency in real combat conditions,&quot; Fedorov explained. &quot;But defending against thousands of drones requires autonomy — the ability for an interceptor drone to detect, identify, track, and neutralize targets independently.&quot;

The Dataroom will allow Ukrainian defense companies that apply to join the program to train and validate their AI models for tasks like target detection, classification, and interception, on real-world battlefield data gathered since Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine.

&quot;Dataroom is built on software solutions from the American technology company Palantir and already contains collections of visual and thermal databases of aerial targets, including Shahed drones,&quot; Brave1 said in its own statement.

Both Fedorov and Brave1 said that the type and volume of data available in the Dataroom would be expanded over time, and that the project&#39;s scope would widen to other autonomy and AI-related areas, with autonomizing drones being &quot;the most urgent task,&quot; according to the defense minister.

&quot;No country in the world has faced the kind of aerial threats that Ukraine confronts today. Every night, hundreds of airborne threats are intercepted,&quot; Fedorov added. &quot;Brave1 Dataroom represents a major step toward reliably protecting our people, energy infrastructure, and the country from enemy air attacks.&quot;

Beyond the note that Palantir&#39;s software solutions formed the underpinnings of the Dataroom, it&#39;s not clear what the US company&#39;s input or influence on the Dataroom would be. It&#39;s also not clear whether Palantir would be able to absorb the data fed into the Dataroom for its own AI training purposes, either.

Louis Mosley, executive vice president of Palantir and head of the company&#39;s UK and EU operations, told the Washington Post in a recent interview that Ukraine has a unique opportunity to actualize thousands of hours of war data - with Palantir&#39;s help, of course.

&quot;There is no other country, sadly, that has that data asset,&quot; Mosley said. &quot;They are uniquely positioned to begin exploiting it.&quot;

Mosley explained that Ukraine, via the Dataroom, would be using Palantir software to curate, synthesize, and normalize its data to prepare it for training autonomous drone algorithms.

US tech giants like Palantir have turned Ukraine into a laboratory for AI-enabled warfare, with various experiments and data-driven training initiatives being fueled by the fighting between Ukrainian and Russian forces. Palantir has been there since early in the war, offering its MetaConstellation software to the country mere months after fighting broke out.

Palantir didn&#39;t respond to questions for this story. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A really important window is closing. Jeffrey Snover, chief PowerShell boffin and hero of Windows administrators around the world, has retired.

Snover&#39;s retirement comes after a brief sojourn at Google as a Distinguished Engineer, following a lengthy stint at Microsoft, during which he pulled the company back from imposing a graphical user interface (GUI) on administrators who really just wanted a command line from which to run their scripts.

Snover joined Microsoft as the 20th century drew to a close. The company was all about its Windows operating system and user interface in those days – great for end users, but not so good for administrators managing fleets of servers. Snover correctly predicted a shift to server datacenters, which would require automated management. A powerful shell... a PowerShell, if you will.

In 2002, Snover produced the Monad Manifesto [PDF], a platform for administrative automation with a shell and scripting, and even a management console. Famously, he did not receive plaudits within Microsoft for his pains. He was instead demoted. Years later, he revealed his profound embarrassment at the move. However, he persevered and PowerShell eventually launched in 2006, becoming the essential administrative tool it is today.

Memorably, a number of Microsoft executives quietly told Snover &quot;we were rooting for you&quot; as he seemingly banged his head against the Redmond wall during his time in the wilderness.

&quot;If you ever were rooting for somebody,&quot; said Snover dryly, &quot;please do him a favor and go tell him. It really would have helped.&quot;

As it turned out, Snover&#39;s demotion became a promotion. He went on to become a Distinguished Engineer at Microsoft and Lead Architect for Windows Server, later serving as Chief Architect for the Enterprise Cloud Group and Microsoft Azure Stack, before closing out his time at Microsoft as Chief Technical Officer for Modern Work Transformation (MWT) and AI architect for the Microsoft 365 Substrate.

In 2022, Snover left Microsoft spent a few years at Google. Now retired, it is difficult to imagine Snover sitting back and watching daytime television any time soon – in his bio, he describes himself as &quot;Philosopher-Errant.&quot;

Over the years, Snover has dropped the occasional pearl of wisdom or shared memories from his time getting PowerShell off the ground. A recent favorite concerns the naming of Cmdlets and their original name in Monad: Function Units, or FUs. Snover wrote: &quot;This abbreviation reflected the Unix smart-ass culture I was embracing at the time. Plus I was developing this in a hostile environment, and my sense of diplomacy was not yet fully operational.&quot;

Snover doubtless has many more war stories to share. In the meantime, however, we wish him well. Many admins owe Snover thanks for persuading Microsoft that its GUI obsession did not translate to the datacenter, and for lengthy careers in gluing enterprise systems together with some scripted automation.

Now if only somebody could do the same for the company&#39;s current obsession with Copilot. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A week ago, Cursor CEO Michael Truell celebrated what sounded like a remarkable event.

&quot;We built a browser with GPT-5.2 in Cursor,&quot; he said in a social media post. &quot;It ran uninterrupted for one week.&quot;

This browser, he said, consisted of three million lines of code across thousands of files. &quot;The rendering engine is from-scratch in Rust with HTML parsing, CSS cascade, layout, text shaping, paint, and a custom JS VM.”

An 88 percent job failure rate is indicative of a code base that doesn&#39;t work

&quot;It *kind of* works! It still has issues and is of course very far from WebKit/Chromium parity, but we were astonished that simple websites render quickly and largely correctly,&quot; he added.

Some developers managed to compile the code after some bug fixes. Others reported success after revisions to the build instructions.

But by and large, developers aren’t convinced Cursor has made a breakthrough.

Jason Gorman, managing director of Codemanship, a UK-based software development consultancy, argues it&#39;s proof that agentic AI scales to produce broken software.

Oliver Medhurst, a software engineer and former Mozillan who participates in Ecma International&#39;s TC39 standards group, concurs. Asked whether there&#39;s anything more here than a demonstration that AI agents can produce large projects of not very high quality code, he said that&#39;s a good summary of the project.

&quot;It is impressive that it does somewhat work and that it can (poorly) manage a codebase of that size but I would say that is what is impressive,&quot; Medhurst told The Register in an email. &quot;Cursor said it was just a demonstration and I think it is fair to call it as such, but it is definitely not a good browser engine, objectively. Another point is that it is incredibly bloated. Ladybird and Servo do much more in much less lines of code (Ladybird and Servo repos are both ~1M).&quot;

Writing a web browser is one of the most challenging general-purpose applications a programmer can take on. Chromium, the open source foundation of Google Chrome, has more than 37 million lines of code.

Cursor didn&#39;t quite go that far: Its browser, dubbed FastRender, consists of about three million lines of code, according to Truell.

Software developer Joshua Marinacci back in 2022 wrote about how complicated the web had become, to the point where &quot;only a few companies can implement a browser from scratch.&quot;

The fact that Microsoft stopped developing its own browser engine and moved Edge onto Chromium attests to the enormous engineering resources required to develop and maintain a browser and the underlying rendering technology.

Cursor software engineer Wilson Lin, who worked on the browser code, published a blog post elaborating on the goals for the project: &quot;to understand how far we can push the frontier of agentic coding for projects that typically take human teams months to complete.&quot;

The Register asked Cursor and Lin to comment but we&#39;ve not heard back.

Marinacci&#39;s post, despite warnings about the complexity of browsers, nonetheless concluded by urging developers to try their hand at browser development. One way to do that is to make use of existing components.

Critics accused Cursor of leaning heavily on Servo, the open-source Rust-based rendering engine spun out of Mozilla.

But Lin, in an online discussion, rejected the claim that FastRender was cobbled together from libraries and frameworks. &quot;I&#39;d push back on the idea that all the agents did was wire up dependencies — the JS VM, DOM, paint systems, chrome, text pipeline, are all being developed as part of this project, and there are real complex systems being engineered towards the goal of a browser engine, even if not there yet,&quot; he wrote.

Codemanship’s Gorman remains unimpressed. In his blog post, he points out that the Action performance metrics on FastRender repo&#39;s Insights page show the instability of the underlying code.

&quot;An 88 percent job failure rate is very high,&quot; he wrote. &quot;It&#39;s kind of indicative of a code base that doesn&#39;t work.&quot;

When we asked Gorman about reports of successful builds, he expressed skepticism, noting that the CI build is still failing.

While we&#39;ve noted instances where experienced developers have reported using AI coding tools to good effect, Gorman is unmoved by such tales.

&quot;When we look at the available non-partisan data (e.g., the latest DORA State of AI-Assisted Software Development report or the METR study that found that devs reported significant productivity gains but were found to [be] 19 percent slower on average), the trend is clear that developers greatly misjudge the impact on their own productivity, and that the majority of teams are negatively impacted on outcomes like lead times and release reliability,&quot; he explained.

&quot;The minority who see modest gains had already addressed the bottlenecks in their software development processes like testing, code review and integration. Most teams will never address those bottlenecks, mostly because they&#39;re not actually looking at the outcomes.&quot;

Gorman said that many of the more sensational claims about AI coding success come from developers working on small problems on their own, without a customer, users, or dependencies tied to other teams.

&quot;They got the car up to 200 mph on a straight road with no other cars around and concluded that faster cars equals faster traffic,&quot; he said. &quot;Then they go back to the office and demand those kinds of speed-ups from their teams who are essentially driving in rush-hour traffic.&quot;

When the measurement is output – lines of code, commits, Pull Requests – Gorman says there&#39;s definitely an increase.

&quot;But just because you attach a code-generating firehose to your plumbing, that doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ll get a power shower,&quot; he said. &quot;A lot of teams are measuring the water pressure coming out of the firehose, not out of the shower. That&#39;s what the evidence is showing.&quot;

He went on to point to the absence of evidence that AI tools are leading to the creation of more software, as measured by the quantity of products available in app stores, and to the lack of revenue attributable to these tools.

&quot;Where is all this AI-generated software?&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;ve spent three years looking into this. I feel like James Randi at a spoon-bending convention sometimes.&quot;

Gorman said AI technology is very impressive, but often wrong. &quot;Do I think it&#39;s of no value?&quot; he said. &quot;Absolutely not. I use it every day. As a trainer and mentor, I feel I need to make sure I&#39;ve got a good handle on how to use it, and on what works better.

&quot;Do I think it&#39;s a game-changer? No. The principles and practices that enabled high-performing dev teams before &#39;AI&#39; are the exact same principles and practices that make them effective with it – small steps, tight feedback loops, continuous testing, code review and integration, and highly modular designs. Same game, different dice.&quot;

He added, &quot;If AI agents really could build a working 3 million LOC product in a week, when does the user/customer feedback happen in that design process? That&#39;s where the real value gets discovered.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">FortiGate firewalls are getting quietly reconfigured and stripped down by miscreants who&#39;ve figured out how to sidestep SSO protections and grab sensitive settings right out of the box.

That&#39;s according to a warning from security shop Arctic Wolf, which says it has spotted a wave of automated malicious activity starting January 15 that&#39;s targeting Fortinet&#39;s FortiGate appliances via compromised SSO accounts, flipping firewall settings, creating backdoor admin users, and exfiltrating configuration files.

Arctic Wolf says that the attackers aren&#39;t just poking around: intruders create new admin accounts, adjust VPN and firewall rules, and export the full configuration. Those configs often include sensitive credentials and internal network details, effectively handing attackers a map of what to hit next.

&quot;All of the above events took place within seconds of each other, indicating the possibility of automated activity,&quot; Arctic Wolf said.

What Arctic Wolf hasn&#39;t confirmed is a new vulnerability. Instead, the behavior lines up uncomfortably well with exploitation. This activity stemmed from two critical authentication bypass bugs (CVE-2025-59718 and CVE-2025-59719) that let attackers bypass SSO login checks via specially crafted SAML responses. Patches for those were shipped last December, but Arctic Wolf&#39;s advisory follows a growing wave of reports from administrators who believe attackers are exploiting a patch bypass for CVE-2025-59718 to compromise firewalls that were already thought to be fixed.

On Reddit, affected admins say Fortinet has privately acknowledged that FortiOS 7.4.10 does not fully remediate the SSO authentication bypass, despite the issue being flagged as patched with the release of FortiOS 7.4.9 in early December. Several customers report seeing intrusions on fully updated systems.

Fortinet is now said to be preparing additional releases – FortiOS 7.4.11, 7.6.6, and 8.0.0 – over the coming days to fully address CVE-2025-59718.

Logs shared by affected customers show attackers logging in via SSO from the address cloud-init@mail.io, originating from IP address 104.28.244.114, before creating new admin users. Those indicators match the same activity that Arctic Wolf observed while analyzing the current FortiGate attacks, as well as similar exploitation attempts back in December.

Arctic Wolf is urging organizations to audit FortiGate admin accounts, review recent configuration changes, rotate credentials, and keep a close eye on SSO activity until Fortinet&#39;s next round of fixes lands. ®

It’s set to release on PS5, Xbox, and PC, and we now know a bit more about it.

Xbox showed off new footage of its Fable reboot during its Developer Direct on Thursday and announced that the game is set to launch this autumn for Xbox, PC, and PS5.

The new Fable is an open world action-RPG. In addition to letting you customize your character and your combat skills, you can also do not-heroic things like build a house (or many) and romance and marry a villager (or many). Characters in the game will react to how you’ve treated them or your reputation — if you’ve evicted a villager from one of your houses, they might greet you with disdain.

There is a morality system, but it seems like it will be more nuanced than it was in the older trilogy. “We’ve chosen to anchor this around the actions you do, and specifically the things you do in Albion that are witnessed by at least one other person,” according to director Ralph Fulton. It also seems like it could be pretty funny, and yes, you will be able to kick chickens.

This new Fable has been a long time coming. The first game in the series debuted in 2004, and Xbox and Playground Games announced this new title, referred to as a “new beginning,” during the Microsoft’s 2020 Xbox Games Showcase. While Microsoft did show new trailers for the game in 2023 and 2024, it was delayed from its planned 2025 release to this year.

The best laptops for you, from ultraportables to gaming machines, MacBooks to Chromebooks.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

Buying the right laptop can be stressful. It’s likely one of the pricier tech purchases you’ll make, and there are a ludicrous number of models, sizes, form factors, and configurations to pick from. We review a wide swath of them here at The Verge, and we’re constantly considering what’s best and who it’s best for. And, given how much cool, new gear was announced at CES 2026, we’ve got a busy few months of testing ahead of us.

If you’re shopping now, our overall pick for most people continues to be the MacBook Air — particularly the M4 model. Unless you need to use Windows for specific software needs or you fancy yourself a gamer, the MacBook Air remains the best option for the average user who wants something portable with excellent battery life and great performance for productivity tasks.

Though the MacBook Air is the easy recommendation for most people, that doesn’t make it the go-to answer for everyone. What if you need more power for video or photo editing, or for crunching large datasets? What if you prefer to run Windows? What if you play lots of games and want to take them with you? Or what if you just want something unique — or even repairable? We’ve got some recommendations, including a Chromebook or two, a laptop with two screens, the 16-inch MacBook Pro, and the Microsoft Surface Laptop with a Snapdragon X Elite chip.

Just like everything The Verge reviews, our laptop testing is primarily based on real-world use. We do run synthetic benchmarks like Geekbench, Cinebench, and 3DMark to get quantifiable comparisons between CPUs and GPUs. But, ultimately, the number-crunching is only part of it. The rest comes from actually using a laptop in our day-to-day routine, which can involve everything from Chrome tabs and Google Docs to photo and video editing and graphically-intense games — both on battery and plugged in.

All manufacturers offer configurations that cost a small fortune, but the best laptops are usually worthwhile even at their base level. Sometimes, we’ll recommend going beyond the base configuration for a little RAM, more storage, or a graphics card upgrade, but at a certain point the value proposition typically nosedives. Our goal is to find those sweet spots.If you’re buying new and spending $1,000 or more, you should be getting a machine with performance that meets your needs, and components like a trackpad, keyboard, screen, and speakers that are good to great. Remember, you’re likely to be using this device for many hours every day. And if any of a laptop’s core features are lacking, then something else — like a great price or excellence in another area — should make up for it.

How much performance you really need may be subjective, but the more headroom you have, the more a laptop can adapt to your evolving needs and the longer it can last before things feel sluggish. At the baseline, your laptop should be fast enough to do the things you use a laptop for, without feeling like it’s struggling on a daily basis. Any productivity laptop should be able to multitask with a bunch of browser tabs open while editing some spreadsheets or other documents. A content creation machine should be able to quickly churn through Photoshop files with lots of layers or a Premiere Pro timeline with plenty of post-processing. And a gaming laptop should be able to play the latest games with nice looking visuals and good frame rates (at least 60 fps, but ideally more on less graphically intensive games).

The keyboard and trackpad are the main interfaces you use with any laptop, and they should be good, even in a desktop replacement you mostly use with an external mouse and keyboard. The whole point of a laptop is you can bring your work and play with you, so you’re relying on these built-in components at some point. A laptop with a bad keyboard and trackpad might as well be a penalty box.What makes a good keyboard and trackpad? It’s slightly subjective, but a quality keyboard should have a logical and efficient layout, enough key travel to make typing feel good and lower the risk of double-presses, and ideally be backlit for easier use in the dark. Any worthwhile laptop should have a good trackpad that easily delivers accurate clicks and swipes, with gestures for better multitasking. Trackpads often come in two styles: hinged at the top (like a piano key) or haptic (where it doesn’t actually move, and the haptic vibration you feel emulates a physical click). Either can be great when well executed.

In a perfect world, every laptop would have a large and bright OLED screen capable of displaying true blacks, with a resolution of 2560 x 1600 or higher and refresh rate of 120Hz (or greater). But a panel like that comes with heavy costs, both in money and often in battery life. Not every laptop can have that ideal setup, but any good one should be sharp with accurate colors, enough brightness for some outdoor use (typically that means 400 nits or greater), and free of annoying anomalies like ghosting or bad off-angle viewing. Aside from OLED, Mini LEDs also make a great laptop panel that can be a big step up from the more typical IPS display, and an even bigger step up from the dim TN panels on truly cheap laptops.Unless a touchscreen is essential to a laptop’s design (like one that converts into a tablet), they’re usually a nice bonus, rather than a requirement. Ideally they’d work with a stylus for more flexibility. MacOS laptops never have touchscreens, but they’re fairly common on Windows machines, Chromebooks, and some Linux laptops.

Laptops are meant to be thrown in bags and taken out into the world, and they should be able to withstand some wear-and-tear. We expect a solid build that doesn’t feel creaky, cheap, or have lots of flex when picked up and handled. It should have a sturdy hinge that opens easily. A less refined design can be slightly forgiven if it’s made up for by a lower price or better-than-expected performance, but these should be devices that look and feel like they’re worth the money spent.We also take into account what a laptop is designed for, and if it meets those goals: an 18-inch desktop replacement is going to be heavy and less mobile; a 13-inch thin-and-light should be, well, thin and light.

We expect most laptops we test to last at least eight hours of web browsing and office work. The harder a laptop works, the more power it uses, so we don’t expect to play games all day without plugging in, or render video for eight hours straight. But if a laptop can’t last a standard work day there’d better be a good reason. We use a battery rundown test that cycles through a large number of Chrome tabs with the screen set to 200 nits that gives us a 1:1 comparison to take into account. More importantly, we record how long the battery lasts over multiple days of regular real-world use — complete with the occasional video call and some music / podcast listening. Even if your machine is tethered to an outlet most of the time, great battery life and standby times makes life with a laptop much more flexible.

We expect all laptops to have at least two USB4 / Thunderbolt 4 ports, preferably on separate sides for a little added convenience. They should be able to charge over USB-C, even if they also have a proprietary charge port capable of higher wattage. And while USB-A ports are a bit more nice-to-have than necessity, there’s absolutely no good reason not to have a 3.5mm headphone jack.More powerful, more expensive laptops (picture something over $1,000 and 14 inches or larger) should probably have an HDMI 2.1 port and card reader, or a good reason for not having them.

CPU: M4 (10-core) / GPU: M4 (8- or 10-core) / RAM: 16GB, 24GB, 32GB / Storage: 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, 2TB / Display: 13.6-inch or 15.3-inch Liquid Retina display, 2560 x 1664 or 2880 x 1864 , 60Hz, no touch option / Dimensions: 11.97 x 8.46 x 0.44 inches (13-inch) or 13.40 x 9.35 x 0.45 inches (15-inch) / Weight: 2.7 pounds (13-inch) or 3.3 pounds (15-inch)

Apple’s M4 MacBook Air is the best laptop for most people — Mac users, of course, but also the platform-agnostic or anyone who wants a no-fuss, straightforward machine that doesn’t bombard them with advertisements or bloatware. It’s a productivity laptop that can do a bit of everything. The 13-inch model starts with 16GB of RAM at $999 (it’s often cheaper than this), and it also comes in a 15-inch version for $1,199, for those who like their laptops a little larger. It’s hard to find another laptop that offers this kind of combination of performance and battery life in a thin and light chassis, especially at these prices.

Despite losing its way around the mid-2010s, Apple has a particularly stellar track record with its MacBooks for the past five or so years, and this includes the Air M4. A smooth, almost ethereal trackpad, check. A chiclet-style keyboard that makes typing feel like a dance, check. Fast Wi-Fi adapter, color-rich display, and MagSafe charging, check. Those were also true on the previous models, but now with the M4 generation it also features the same 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam of the MacBook Pros, it can use two external monitors with its lid open, and it comes in a sky blue color (though it still looks silver in some light). And again, you get all this for less money than the last-generation model sold for.

The M4 Air is a great option for just about anyone who doesn’t need intensive video editing, who doesn’t do heavy gaming, or who doesn’t need more than two USB-C ports. For those who do, look to the 14-inch MacBook Pro M5 — a great bang-for-your-buck laptop in its own right at $1,599 (often a little less than this), complete with the latest, fastest processor that Apple makes. Opting for a Pro over an Air is best for students in creative fields and content creators needing more performance headroom, not to mention features like a third USB-C port, a full-size SD card slot, and an even better screen.

Now that the M4 Air is here, Apple has fully discontinued the M3 and M2 models. You might still be able to find them at retailers like Best Buy, but they’re not worth it over the M4 unless substantially discounted. If you can afford an additional $200 on top of either the 13- or 15-inch M4 Air’s starting prices, that’ll net you 512GB of storage instead of 256GB — as well as the 10-core GPU on the 13-inch. The paltry base storage is the only remaining weak point of the MacBook Air. It’s definitely worth getting more storage if you can, as the roomier SSD will make your life a little easier on a laptop that should otherwise easily last you at least five years.

CPU: MediaTek Kompanio Ultra 910 / GPU: Immortalis G925 / RAM: 16GB LPDDR5X / Storage: 256GB UFS 4.0 / Display: Touch 14-inch FHD 1920 x 1200, 60Hz OLED, 400 nits / Dimensions: 12.37 x 8.63 x 0.62 inches / Weight: 2.78 pounds

Lenovo’s Chromebook Plus 14 is the best Chromebook we tested last year thanks to its impressive tech specs and long software support. It has a 14-inch FHD (1920 x 1200) 60Hz OLED touchscreen display that has excellent color and contrast, as well as 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. Its 8-core MediaTek Kompanio Ultra 910 processor was powerful enough that we could jump between Chrome tabs and Android apps spread across two desktops while uploading documents to NotebookLM to generate audio overviews without any problems.

Lenovo equipped this laptop with two USB-C ports, which can drive a couple of monitors simultaneously, and a USB-A port that’s convenient for connecting accessories without the need for a dongle. All three ports top out at 5Gbps each though, which might be slower than you need. We were impressed by the laptop’s speakers, which sounded great when listening to music or audiobooks, even at a high volume. Its keyboard was comfortable to type on, but the mechanical trackpad makes an annoying, loud click when pressed.

The Chromebook Plus 14 can run Android, Linux, plus web apps. You should be able to easily find the right software across those platforms, but we still ran into trouble during testing with Zoom, which ran poorly both as a web app and as an Android app. Similarly, we had to run Slack in a browser window because the Linux app wasn’t compiled for Arm processors. The types of apps you use will also heavily impact battery life. We were able to run the laptop for around nine hours and only drained its battery by around 50 percent. We suspect you could use it for a couple of days without charging if your needs aren’t incredibly demanding.

Software support is an understandable concern when getting a new laptop, but Google has guaranteed Chromebooks released after 2021 will receive 10 years of automatic updates. The Lenovo Chromebook 14’s solid hardware and extended software support means you may be able to keep it running for a decade, even if later becomes a secondary machine or hand-me-down.

CPU: Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus X1P-64-100, Snapdragon X Elite X1E-80-100 / GPU: Qualcomm Adreno / RAM: 16GB, 32GB, 64GB LPDDR5X (soldered) / Storage: 256GB, 512GB, 1TB / Display: 13.8-inch touchscreen LCD, 2304 x 1536 120Hz, 600 nits / Dimensions: 11.85 x 8.67 x 0.69 inches / Weight: 2.96 pounds

Out of all the Snapdragon Copilot Plus PCs we’ve tested so far, the 13.8- and 15-inch Microsoft Surface Laptop 7th edition stood out for their balance of performance, exceptional battery life and standby time, and quality components (120Hz refresh rate screen, keyboard, webcam, trackpad, etc.). Microsoft was obviously gunning for Apple’s MacBook Air, and the Surface Laptop mostly delivers that level of hardware experience for a Windows machine. It’s the full package if you want a thin-and-light productivity machine running Windows that easily lasts all day and into the night. And if your budget is slightly tighter, there’s a 13-inch model with pared-down features starting at $899 that’s still really good.

The greater concern with Snapdragon X-equipped laptops is whether Windows on Arm supports all the apps you need to get your work done. Most everyday apps work fine, via native Arm versions or emulation, but there can still be some outliers, especially in content creation apps. Also, if you like the idea of your productivity machine being able to pull light gaming duties (one of Windows’ advantages over Mac) then you’re likely better off with a laptop using Intel’s Lunar Lake or AMD’s Ryzen AI chips. Snapdragon X laptops can only run a fraction of the games you find on Steam, and just last summer Microsoft rolled out the ability to install ARM64-compatible games from the Xbox app. In many cases, you’ll only be able to stream games available in the PC Game Pass library, as opposed to playing them directly off the internal storage.

Earlier in 2025, Microsoft launched Intel Lunar Lake-based versions of the Surface Laptop 7, but they’re a ridiculous $500 more expensive and aimed solely at businesses. It’s a shame, because having this hardware with Lunar Lake’s compatibility might have been an appealing prospect.

The 16-inch Asus Zenbook S 16 is the best-looking, best-performing Windows laptop we tested in 2024, and it’s still a charming device; it’s also so thin and lightweight you wouldn’t know it just by holding it. It can handle a little bit of everything, from emails to graphic design work, and it tackles gaming surprisingly well for a laptop without a dedicated graphics card. It’s a lovely, catch-all device.

There are only two Zenbook S 16 models as of now. The $1,800 one comes in gray with AMD’s flagship Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 chip and 32GB of memory, and the $1,400 model comes in white with the lower-tier AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 and 24GB of memory. Otherwise, they are identical. Both feature OLED touch displays with a native 2880 x 1800 (3K) resolution and 120Hz refresh rate, stylus support, 1TB of storage, and the same ports / Wi-Fi adapter. Everything but the Windows version. (The more expensive model gets Home; the cheaper one gets Pro.)

At just 11 hours, its battery life doesn’t last as long as similar laptops we’ve tested, such as the Samsung Galaxy Book4 Edge and Dell XPS 14, but it’s a small tradeoff. There’s still no other Windows laptop that offers as much performance and versatility in a 16-inch chassis for the price.

The Asus ROG Strix Scar 16 is a seriously powerful gaming laptop. It has an RTX 5080 GPU, which is still the sweet spot for high-end gaming laptops. This ROG Strix Scar is within earshot of the RTX 5090 performance I saw in the Razer Blade 16, and it’s $1,200 cheaper. Sure, the Asus is chunky and heavy compared to Razer’s svelte Blade, but that gives its GPU the space it needs to stay cool. Thinner laptops often thermally constrain a high-end chip like the 5090, anyway.

The ROG Strix Scar doesn’t have an OLED display like its direct competitors, which is indeed a bummer, but its 2560 x 1600 240Hz Mini LED panel is still sharp and bright, with some punchy colors. The 16-inch version of the Strix Scar eschews a number pad, giving its large keycaps plenty of space so typing isn’t cramped at all. Its trackpad is massive, and it houses a hidden touch-sensitive numpad you can call up with a long-press in the top corner — though it’s more useful for data entry than gaming needs.

The Strix Scar’s boisterous RGB light show is kind of fun in its garishness. In addition to wraparound underglow, it has a dot-matrix array of LEDs on its lid to display animations — as Asus has done before. A more useful feature is the way you can open the laptop’s bottom plate, like a car’s hood, for easy, tool-free access to its two RAM slots and SSDs.

If you’re looking for an alternative, either because the price is higher than you’d like or the design doesn’t align with your taste, we recommend checking out the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10. I can vouch for this model, and the RTX 5080 version is currently on sale for $2,549.99 at B&H Photo. The RTX 5070 Ti model, meanwhile, is available for $2,179.99 at Walmart.

The 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro starts with 24GB of RAM, 512GB SSD, and 14-core CPU / 20-core GPU. The M4 Max version offers 32GB of RAM, 1TB SSD, 14-core CPU / 32-core GPU, and can be configured to ridiculously high prices. Both models have Thunderbolt 5 ports, 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam, and options for anti-glare displays.

CPU: M4 Pro, M4 Max / GPU: M4 Pro, M4 Max / RAM: 24GB or 48GB (M4 Pro), 36GB - 128 GB (M4 Max) / Storage: 512GB, 1TB, 2TB, 4TB, 8TB / Display: 14.2 / 16.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR, 3024 x 1964 / 3456 x 2234, adaptive refresh up to 120Hz, no touch option / Dimensions: 12.31 x 8.71 x 0.61 (14-inch) / 14.01 x 9.77 x 0.66 inches (16-inch) / Weight: 3.5 / 4.7 pounds (M4 Pro), 3.6 / 4.8 pounds (M4 Max)

If you need power for intensive creative work — like 3D rendering and working with ultra-high-resolution photos and video — the MacBook Pro is your best bet. Both the 14- and 16-inch models are available with powerful M4 Pro or M4 Max processors. There’s also a 14-inch Pro with a M5 processor, and while it’s a formidable step up from the MacBook Air as an everyperson’s “pro” laptop, the M4 Pro and Max processors still outclass it in performance.

Processors aside, the MacBook Pro has remained largely unchanged since 2021. It has a bright, beautiful, color-accurate, high-res screen with HDR and an adaptive refresh rate of up to 120Hz; amazing speakers, a comfortable keyboard and trackpad; and a good port loadout: three Thunderbolt 5 / USB-C ports, plus HDMI 2.1 and an SD card slot. The 14-inch MacBook Pro is a few hundred dollars cheaper than the 16-inch, but aside from the very lowest processor options, most configurations are available in either size, so pick whichever works for you.

In our benchmarks, which test a variety of creative tasks including encoding, playback, and export time, the MacBook Pro 16 did better than any laptop we’ve ever used — the only other machines that have come close to matching this thing in some of our benchmarks are high-end desktop PCs. The battery life is also record-shattering. The top-of-the-line 16-inch M4 Max model easily lasted all day in our most recent testing, with no battery-saving features enabled and even keeping the screen on full-time.

Most people who need much more power than a MacBook Air — including all but the most demanding pro photographers — will be fine with an M4 Pro model, which starts at $1,999 for the 14-inch with a 12-core CPU, 16-core GPU, 24GB of memory, and a 512GB SSD. The 16-inch starts at $2,499 for a 14-core CPU, 20-core GPU, 24GB of memory, and 512GB SSD. The M4 Pro chip can be configured with up to 48GB of memory and a 4TB SSD, at the usual absurd Apple markups, and it supports up to two external 6K displays.

If you absolutely need more GPU power — or more than two external monitors — you can step up to the M4 Max. The base M4 Max with 14 CPU cores and 32 GPU cores, plus 36GB of RAM and 1TB SSD, starts at $3,199 in the 14-inch and $3,499 in the 16-inch. There’s also an M4 Max with 16 CPU and 40 GPU cores, which starts at $3,699 and $3,999, respectively. The M4 Max models are configurable with up to 128GB of RAM and 8TB of storage and can support up to four external monitors. The vast majority of people don’t have workloads heavy enough to notice a significant difference between the M4 Pro and M4 Max; if you do, you probably know it.

The 2025 ROG Zephyrus G14 replaced the previous model as our pick for the best 14-inch gaming laptop, though we’ll see if the newest model — announced at CES 2026 with Intel and AMD processor options — can take its place soon enough. Last year’s model retains the sleek design Asus introduced in 2024 and continues to strike a balance between power and portability; it also incorporates a handful of improvements, some of which have allowed it to earn the top spot in our best gaming laptops guide, despite a $100 price bump.

The 2025 Zephyrus G14 has an AMD 9-series processor and Nvidia RTX 50-series graphics chip, which provide modest performance gains. Every configuration features a handsome, high-res OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, so smoother gameplay isn’t locked behind an optional upgrade. Conveniently, the 2025 G14 features USB-C ports on both sides for charging, although you’ll still achieve the maximum wattage by using Asus’ proprietary charger.

The G14 features a backlit, chiclet-style keyboard, and Asus has increased the keycap size by 12.24 percent to make them easier to press. The centered trackpad is also relatively wide, providing ample space for clicks, taps, and swipes without cramping your hand. These features are as useful for typing and productivity work as they are for playing games when you’re not connected to a gaming keyboard and mouse.

Speaking of games, the titles we played ran well, even on high settings, but the laptop felt hot to the touch due to its thin chassis. Its fans were audible under heavy load, and the laptop eventually thermally throttled its GPUs to prevent overheating. The tradeoffs aren’t surprising, though, especially given the G14’s thin, lightweight design.

A dual-screen laptop is exactly what it sounds like: a laptop with a second screen where the keyboard normally goes. The Lenovo Yoga Book 9i has a 360-degree hinge, which lets you use it as a regular laptop, a (large) tablet, and more. You can put it in clamshell mode and write or sketch on the bottom screen with a stylus or fold the keyboard folio into a stand to prop it up and take advantage of both screens. You can set it up at home with an external monitor as a three-screen desktop replacement, or take it on the go with the included Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. Its touchscreen gestures are super responsive but too responsive for the virtual keyboard and trackpad. It’s easy to mistype and accidentally minimize windows.

The Yoga Book’s only real competitor is Asus’ Zenbook Duo. The Duo’s physical keyboard includes a trackpad and makes it look a lot more like a traditional laptop. Its 14-inch OLED screens are a little bigger and brighter, it has a ton of port options, it’s more powerful, and it’s a little easier to fold up and put away. But it’s also heavier (at 3.64 pounds), its top lid doesn’t fold back far enough to use it as a tablet, and its touchscreen gestures aren’t as responsive.

There’s no other laptop offering the kind of nerdy fun today that a Framework can. The Framework Laptop 13 isn’t just the only game in town when it comes to a notebook that’s fully repairable and upgradeable, it’s also a great productivity machine for everyday use and has been for several years now. For 2025, the Laptop 13 got a processor upgrade with AMD’s “Strix Point” Ryzen AI chips, giving it higher performance than the last-gen Intel and AMD offerings with serviceable battery life. Otherwise, it’s much the same chassis as the prior generation — they’re indistinguishable from one another.

But that’s part of what’s so cool about a Framework: a new model means a new chip you can even put into the old model, if you want an upgrade and don’t mind opening up the chassis yourself. It’s actually much easier to do than you may fear it is, as Framework designs its laptops to give you full access to everything inside with just a simple screwdriver; including its mainboard, storage, RAM, battery, and some fun see-through bezels for a touch of customization.

If you opt for one of Framework’s DIY Editions it only comes partially built, but this allows you to choose from many more configuration options than its pre-builts. Personally, I think the DIY route is the way to go if you’re up for it, because experiencing the assembly (which took me less than 30 minutes) gives you a better awareness of what’s in your laptop and how to change something if you ever need to repair or upgrade it. But even if you choose a pre-built, you can pick from a wide array of modular ports to outfit it with.

The Laptop 13 isn’t as sleek as a similarly priced MacBook or Surface, which offer no upgradeability or modularity (aside from the SSD on some Surface Laptops), but the Framework by no means feels cheap. It’s thin enough and light enough to be very portable, and it’s got a great keyboard with a fine trackpad. Its screen has a 3:2 aspect ratio that’s ideal for productivity since you can see a bit more than the more typical 16:10.

You probably have to be really into the whole repairability and modularity concept to spend the same or more on a Framework Laptop 13 compared to other options out there, but anyone can appreciate picking your ports and being able to swap them around whenever you want.

There’s a lot that’s new in the world of laptops, depending on where you look. Almost every manufacturer that isn’t Apple announced something at CES 2026, be it a new laptop or a new series of processors. As for what’s not new, Nvidia didn’t pack a new generation of GPUs into this year’s models, so the gaming laptop scene may not be in for as much of a shake in early 2026 as it was last year around this time. We’ll be methodically selecting laptop models to test as soon as they become available, and then we’ll update this post if any are fit to dethrone previous picks.

It’s time to see what the judge thinks of Epic and Google’s sudden settlement.

Today, I am sitting in the courtroom that may decide the fate of Android. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney is here. Google Android boss Sameer Samat is here. Together, they’ll try to convince Judge James Donato that they’re no longer enemies — that Google’s illegal monopoly on Android app stores can be resolved with a mutual settlement instead of the consequences the judge had ordered. And I’ll be posting anything interesting I hear live in this Verge StoryStream.

Epic sued Google over five years ago in August 2020, and in December 2023 a jury unanimously handed it the win. An appeals court upheld that verdict, and the US Supreme Court didn’t step in to save Google from the immediate consequences. Judge Donato ordered Google to crack open Android in the United States, forcing Google to eventually host rival app stores inside its own store, among many other punishments.

Now, Epic and Google are giving Judge Donato two different options. If he approves the settlement as-is, Google will agree to reduce its app store fees globally, not just in the United States, making app development a better job prospect around the world, and create a Registered App Stores program where rival app stores could make it onto Android without gobs of friction — but where those stores might still be under Google’s thumb and have to pay complicated fees.

If Donato doesn’t, Google seems to be threatening an alternative that app makers and the court may like a whole lot less: if developers want to avoid Google’s payment systems, they must immediately enroll in rigid new Google programs where they pay Google multiple dollars per app download in exchange for only slightly lower app store fees.

Epic and Google are already acting like the settlement is a done deal, bringing Epic’s game Fortnite back to Android and publicly declaring their support of each other.

But Donato was publicly skeptical of the settlement, and that Google and Epic are “suddenly BFFs,” Law360’s Bonnie Eslinger reported in November. So now, he’s hauled the “lead negotiators” of the settlement into court to explain further. That’s Epic CEO Tim Sweeney himself, Google’s Android boss Sameer Samat, Epic’s expert witness in economics (and Stanford professor) Doug Bernheim, and Google regulatory affairs director Lara Kollios.

Don’t watch this specific post for updates: instead, click through to our StoryStream. It’s not likely the judge will approve the settlement today, but who knows!

Disclosure: Vox Media, The Verge’s parent company, has filed a lawsuit against Google, seeking damages from its illegal ad tech monopoly.

            <div id="article-text">Game Freak’s ambitious action game is launching this summer.

Game Freak’s ambitious action game is launching this summer.

It’s been a bit of a wait, but a big new game from Pokémon developer Game Freak is almost here. During the Xbox Developer Direct showcase, the studio showed off more gameplay for its action RPG Beast of Incarnation, and confirmed that it will be launching in the summer of 2026 on the PS5, Xbox, and PC.

Here’s the overview that aired during the event:

Beast of Reincarnation is set in a post-apocalyptic Japan in the year 4026, and it’s described as a “one-person one-dog action RPG,” with a world and gameplay designed to evoke the feelings of “warmth, trust, and loneliness.” In practice, it looks a little like a cross between Dark Souls and Monster Hunter, which means lots of cool monster designs and what looks to be very intense combat that blends elements of real-time action and turn-based RPGs. And, yes, it definitely seems like you can pet the dog.

In development for six years, the game was first revealed back in 2023 under the codename Project Bloom, and has since undergone a publishing shift. It was originally under the label Private Division, which was previously part of Take-Two Interactive. But the label has since been sold off and is now operating under the name Fictions.

And while Game Freak is best-known as the primary developer behind the Pokémon series, the studio has dabbled in outside projects from time-to-time, though these tend to be smaller-scale titles like Pocket Card Jockey or Tembo the Badass Elephant. Beast of Incarnation represents the studio’s biggest non-Pokémon project to date.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a now-annual tradition, Microsoft is kicking off the year with a showcase of some of its biggest upcoming games.

Last year’s edition of the Xbox Developer Direct had some big names, like Doom: The Dark Ages and a little game called Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. And we already know the three main titles that will be showcased in the 2026 version. They include Forza Horizon 6 (which looks like it’ll be launching in May), the oft-delayed fantasy RPG Fable, and Beast of Reincarnation, the action RPG from Pokémon developer Game Freak. Microsoft says that the event will include “news, new gameplay, and insights directly from the incredible teams working on titles coming this year.”

Of course, there’s always a chance that there will be a surprise or two, and you can stay tuned here for all the latest developments. You can also watch the showcase live on YouTube when it starts streaming on January 22nd at 1PM ET.

Xbox showed off new footage of its Fable reboot during its Developer Direct on Thursday and announced that the game is set to launch this autumn for Xbox, PC, and PS5.

The new Fable is an open world action-RPG. In addition to letting you customize your character and your combat skills, you can also do not-heroic things like build a house (or many) and romance and marry a villager (or many). Characters in the game will react to how you’ve treated them or your reputation — if you’ve evicted a villager from one of your houses, they might greet you with disdain.

It’s been a bit of a wait, but a big new game from Pokémon developer Game Freak is almost here. During the Xbox Developer Direct showcase, the studio showed off more gameplay for its action RPG Beast of Incarnation, and confirmed that it will be launching in the summer of 2026 on the PS5, Xbox, and PC.

Here’s the overview that aired during the event:

While it doesn’t have a specific release date, the ambitious action RPG Beast of Reincarnation — which is developed by Pokémon studio Game Freak — will be launching this summer. And yeah, you can pet the dog.

Double Fine just announced a new multiplayer party game called Kiln where you can make and play as pots. It all looks quite silly. Kiln will be available this spring on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC, and there will be a closed beta.

Forza Horizon 6 will launch on Xbox Series X / S and PC on May 19th, Xbox and developer Playground Games announced during Thursday’s Developer Direct showcase. If you preorder the Premium Edition, you can play starting May 15th. The game will come to PS5 later this year.

The game has the largest map in a Forza Horizon game, Playground Games said during the event. In the stream, Playground showed off a bunch of different environments, including dense urban areas and lush natural landscapes. Forza Horizon 6 will have more than 550 cars at launch, more than has ever been available at launch for a Forza Horizon title.

You can catch the show on YouTube starting at 1PM ET. The event will feature the Playground Games’ Fable and Forza Horizon 6 and Beast of Reincarnation from Game Freak. We’ll be watching the livestream and covering what’s announced.

Microsoft’s annual Xbox Developer Direct event is taking place on January 22nd this year. The fourth Developer Direct will provide a closer look at two of Microsoft’s biggest Xbox games this year, Forza Horizon 6 and Fable, as well as a first in-depth look at Beast of Reincarnation from Game Freak.

Playground Games will debut the first gameplay of Forza Horizon 6 during the Developer Direct show, after first revealing that the next installment in the Forza Horizon franchise is set in Japan. Forza Horizon 6 players will be able to experience the neon lights and buildings of Tokyo City, as well as an open world set in various other parts of Japan.

            <h2>“Dr. Google” had its issues. Can ChatGPT Health do better?</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/22/1131692/dr-google-had-its-issues-can-chatgpt-health-do-better/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the past two decades, there’s been a clear first step for anyone who starts experiencing new medical symptoms: Look them up online. The practice was so common that it gained the pejorative moniker “Dr. Google.” But times are changing, and many medical-information seekers are now using LLMs. According to OpenAI, 230 million people ask ChatGPT health-related queries each week.

That’s the context around the launch of OpenAI’s new ChatGPT Health product, which debuted earlier this month. It landed at an inauspicious time: Two days earlier, the news website SFGate had broken the story of Sam Nelson, a teenager who died of an overdose last year after extensive conversations with ChatGPT about how best to combine various drugs. In the wake of both pieces of news, multiple journalists questioned the wisdom of relying for medical advice on a tool that could cause such extreme harm.

Though ChatGPT Health lives in a separate sidebar tab from the rest of ChatGPT, it isn’t a new model. It’s more like a wrapper that provides one of OpenAI’s preexisting models with guidance and tools it can use to provide health advice—including some that allow it to access a user’s electronic medical records and fitness app data, if granted permission. There’s no doubt that ChatGPT and other large language models can make medical mistakes, and OpenAI emphasizes that ChatGPT Health is intended as an additional support, rather than a replacement for one’s doctor. But when doctors are unavailable or unable to help, people will turn to alternatives.

Some doctors see LLMs as a boon for medical literacy. The average patient might struggle to navigate the vast landscape of online medical information—and, in particular, to distinguish high-quality sources from polished but factually dubious websites—but LLMs can do that job for them, at least in theory. Treating patients who had searched for their symptoms on Google required “a lot of attacking patient anxiety [and] reducing misinformation,” says Marc Succi, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and a practicing radiologist. But now, he says, “you see patients with a college education, a high school education, asking questions at the level of something an early med student might ask.”

The release of ChatGPT Health, and Anthropic’s subsequent announcement of new health integrations for Claude, indicate that the AI giants are increasingly willing to acknowledge and encourage health-related uses of their models. Such uses certainly come with risks, given LLMs’ well-documented tendencies to agree with users and make up information rather than admit ignorance.

But those risks also have to be weighed against potential benefits. There’s an analogy here to autonomous vehicles: When policymakers consider whether to allow Waymo in their city, the key metric is not whether its cars are ever involved in accidents but whether they cause less harm than the status quo of relying on human drivers. If Dr. ChatGPT is an improvement over Dr. Google—and early evidence suggests it may be—it could potentially lessen the enormous burden of medical misinformation and unnecessary health anxiety that the internet has created.

Pinning down the effectiveness of a chatbot such as ChatGPT or Claude for consumer health, however, is tricky. “It’s exceedingly difficult to evaluate an open-ended chatbot,” says Danielle Bitterman, the clinical lead for data science and AI at the Mass General Brigham health-care system. Large language models score well on medical licensing examinations, but those exams use multiple-choice questions that don’t reflect how people use chatbots to look up medical information.

Sirisha Rambhatla, an assistant professor of management science and engineering at the University of Waterloo, attempted to close that gap by evaluating how GPT-4o responded to licensing exam questions when it did not have access to a list of possible answers. Medical experts who evaluated the responses scored only about half of them as entirely correct. But multiple-choice exam questions are designed to be tricky enough that the answer options don’t give them entirely away, and they’re still a pretty distant approximation for the sort of thing that a user would type into ChatGPT.

A different study, which tested GPT-4o on more realistic prompts submitted by human volunteers, found that it answered medical questions correctly about 85% of the time. When I spoke with Amulya Yadav, an associate professor at Pennsylvania State University who runs the Responsible AI for Social Emancipation Lab and led the study, he made it clear that he wasn’t personally a fan of patient-facing medical LLMs. But he freely admits that, technically speaking, they seem up to the task—after all, he says, human doctors misdiagnose patients 10% to 15% of the time. “If I look at it dispassionately, it seems that the world is gonna change, whether I like it or not,” he says.

For people seeking medical information online, Yadav says, LLMs do seem to be a better choice than Google. Succi, the radiologist, also concluded that LLMs can be a better alternative to web search when he compared GPT-4’s responses to questions about common chronic medical conditions with the information presented in Google’s knowledge panel, the information box that sometimes appears on the right side of the search results.

Since Yadav’s and Succi’s studies appeared online, in the first half of 2025, OpenAI has released multiple new versions of GPT, and it’s reasonable to expect that GPT-5.2 would perform even better than its predecessors. But the studies do have important limitations: They focus on straightforward, factual questions, and they examine only brief interactions between users and chatbots or web search tools. Some of the weaknesses of LLMs—most notably their sycophancy and tendency to hallucinate—might be more likely to rear their heads in more extensive conversations and with people who are dealing with more complex problems. Reeva Lederman, a professor at the University of Melbourne who studies technology and health, notes that patients who don’t like the diagnosis or treatment recommendations that they receive from a doctor might seek out another opinion from an LLM—and the LLM, if it’s sycophantic, might encourage them to reject their doctor’s advice.

Some studies have found that LLMs will hallucinate and exhibit sycophancy in response to health-related prompts. For example, one study showed that GPT-4 and GPT-4o will happily accept and run with incorrect drug information included in a user’s question. In another, GPT-4o frequently concocted definitions for fake syndromes and lab tests mentioned in the user’s prompt. Given the abundance of medically dubious diagnoses and treatments floating around the internet, these patterns of LLM behavior could contribute to the spread of medical misinformation, particularly if people see LLMs as trustworthy.

OpenAI has reported that the GPT-5 series of models is markedly less sycophantic and prone to hallucination than their predecessors, so the results of these studies might not apply to ChatGPT Health. The company also evaluated the model that powers ChatGPT Health on its responses to health-specific questions, using their publicly available HeathBench benchmark. HealthBench rewards models that express uncertainty when appropriate, recommend that users seek medical attention when necessary, and refrain from causing users unnecessary stress by telling them their condition is more serious that it truly is. It’s reasonable to assume that the model underlying ChatGPT Health exhibited those behaviors in testing, though Bitterman notes that some of the prompts in HealthBench were generated by LLMs, not users, which could limit how well the benchmark translates into the real world.

An LLM that avoids alarmism seems like a clear improvement over systems that have people convincing themselves they have cancer after a few minutes of browsing. And as large language models, and the products built around them, continue to develop, whatever advantage Dr. ChatGPT has over Dr. Google will likely grow. The introduction of ChatGPT Health is certainly a move in that direction: By looking through your medical records, ChatGPT can potentially gain far more context about your specific health situation than could be included in any Google search, although numerous experts have cautioned against giving ChatGPT that access for privacy reasons.

Even if ChatGPT Health and other new tools do represent a meaningful improvement over Google searches, they could still conceivably have a negative effect on health overall. Much as automated vehicles, even if they are safer than human-driven cars, might still prove a net negative if they encourage people to use public transit less, LLMs could undermine users’ health if they induce people to rely on the internet instead of human doctors, even if they do increase the quality of health information available online.

Lederman says that this outcome is plausible. In her research, she has found that members of online communities centered on health tend to put their trust in users who express themselves well, regardless of the validity of the information they are sharing. Because ChatGPT communicates like an articulate person, some people might trust it too much, potentially to the exclusion of their doctor. But LLMs are certainly no replacement for a human doctor—at least not yet.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

It’s supposed to be frigid in Davos this time of year. Part of the charm is seeing the world’s elite tromp through the streets in respectable suits and snow boots. But this year it’s positively balmy, with highs in the mid 30s, or a little over 1°C. The current conditions when I flew out of New York were colder, and definitely snowier. I’m told this is due to something called a föhn, a dry warm wind that’s been blowing across the Alps.

I’m no meteorologist, but it’s true that there is a lot of hot air here.

On Wednesday, President Donald Trump arrived in Davos to address the assembly, and held forth for more than 90 minutes, weaving his way through remarks about the economy, Greenland, windmills, Switzerland, Rolexes, Venezuela, and drug prices. It was a talk lousy with gripes, grievances and outright falsehoods.

One small example: Trump made a big deal of claiming that China, despite being the world leader in manufacturing windmill componentry, doesn’t actually use them for energy generation itself. In fact, it is the world leader in generation, as well.

I did not get to watch this spectacle from the room itself. Sad!

By the time I got to the Congress Hall where the address was taking place, there was already a massive scrum of people jostling to get in.

I had just wrapped up moderating a panel on “the intelligent co-worker,” ie: AI agents in the workplace. I was really excited for this one as the speakers represented a diverse cross-section of the AI ecosystem. Christoph Schweizer, CEO of BCG had the macro strategic view; Enrique Lores, HP CEO, could speak to both hardware and large enterprises, Workera CEO Kian Katanforoosh has the inside view on workforce training and transformation, Manjul Shah CEO of Hippocratic AI addressed working in the high stakes field of healthcare, and Kate Kallot CEO of Amini AI gave perspective on the global south and Africa in particular.

Interestingly, most of the panel shied away from using the term co-worker, and some even rejected the term agent. But the view they painted was definitely one of humans working alongside AI and augmenting what’s possible. Shah, for example, talked about having agents call 16,000 people in Texas during a heat wave to perform a health and safety check. It was a great discussion. You can watch the whole thing here.

But by the time it let out, the push of people outside the Congress Hall was already too thick for me to get in. In fact I couldn’t even get into a nearby overflow room. I did make it into a third overflow room, but getting in meant navigating my way through a mass of people, so jammed in tight together that it reminded me of being at a Turnstile concert.

The speech blew way past its allotted time, and I had to step out early to get to yet another discussion. Walking through the halls while Trump spoke was a truly surreal experience. He had truly captured the attention of the gathered global elite. I don’t think I saw a single person not starting at a laptop, or phone or iPad, all watching the same video.

Trump is speaking again on Thursday in a previously unscheduled address to announce his Board of Peace. As is (I heard) Elon Musk. So it’s shaping up to be another big day for elite attention capture.

I should say, though, there are elites, and then there are elites. And there are all sorts of ways of sorting out who is who. Your badge color is one of them. I have a white participant badge, because I was moderating panels. This gets you in pretty much anywhere and therefore is its own sort of status symbol. Where you are staying is another. I’m in Klosters, a neighboring town that’s a 40 minute train ride away from the Congress Centre. Not so elite.

There are more subtle ways of status sorting, too. Yesterday I learned that when people ask if this is your first time at Davos, it’s sometimes meant as a way of trying to figure out how important you are. If you’re any kind of big deal, you’ve probably been coming for years.

But the best one I’ve yet encountered happened when I made small talk with the woman sitting next to me as I changed back into my snow boots. It turned out that, like me, she lived in California–at least part time. “But I don’t think I’ll stay there much longer,” she said, “due to the new tax law.” This was just an ice cold flex.

Because California’s newly proposed tax legislation? It only targets billionaires.

Here are our picks for the advances to watch in the years ahead—and why we think they matter right now.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

Yann LeCun is a Turing Award recipient and a top AI researcher, but he has long been a contrarian figure in the tech world. He believes that the industry’s current obsession with large language models is wrong-headed and will ultimately fail to solve many pressing problems.

Instead, he thinks we should be betting on world models—a different type of AI that accurately reflects the dynamics of the real world. Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that he recently left Meta, where he had served as chief scientist for FAIR (Fundamental AI Research), the company&#39;s influential research lab that he founded.

LeCun sat down with MIT Technology Review in an exclusive online interview from his Paris apartment to discuss his new venture, life after Meta, the future of artificial intelligence, and why he thinks the industry is chasing the wrong ideas. Read the full interview.

In 2026, I’m going to be closely watching the price of lithium.

If you’re not in the habit of obsessively tracking commodity markets, I certainly don’t blame you. (Though the news lately definitely makes the case that minerals can have major implications for global politics and the economy.)

But lithium is worthy of a close look right now. The metal is crucial for lithium-ion batteries used in phones and laptops, electric vehicles, and large-scale energy storage arrays on the grid.

Prices have been on quite the roller coaster over the last few years, and they’re ticking up again.

Cement hides in plain sight—it’s used to build everything from roads and buildings to dams and basement floors. But it’s also a climate threat. Cement production accounts for more than 7% of global carbon dioxide emissions—more than sectors like aviation, shipping, or landfills.

One solution to this climate catastrophe might be coursing through the pipes at Sublime Systems. The startup is developing an entirely new way to make cement. Instead of heating crushed-up rocks in lava-hot kilns, Sublime’s technology zaps them in water with electricity, kicking off chemical reactions that form the main ingredients in its cement.

But it faces huge challenges: competing with established industry players, and persuading builders to use its materials in the first place. Read the full story.

If you’re not in the habit of obsessively tracking commodity markets, I certainly don’t blame you. (Though the news lately definitely makes the case that minerals can have major implications for global politics and the economy.)

But lithium is worthy of a close look right now.

The metal is crucial for lithium-ion batteries used in phones and laptops, electric vehicles, and large-scale energy storage arrays on the grid. Prices have been on quite the roller coaster over the last few years, and they’re ticking up again after a low period. What happens next could have big implications for mining and battery technology.

Before we look ahead, let’s take a quick trip down memory lane. In 2020, global EV sales started to really take off, driving up demand for the lithium used in their batteries. Because of that growing demand and a limited supply, prices shot up dramatically, with lithium carbonate going from under $10 per kilogram to a high of roughly $70 per kilogram in just two years.

And the tech world took notice. During those high points, there was a ton of interest in developing alternative batteries that didn’t rely on lithium. I was writing about sodium-based batteries, iron-air batteries, and even experimental ones that were made with plastic.

Researchers and startups were also hunting for alternative ways to get lithium, including battery recycling and processing methods like direct lithium extraction (more on this in a moment).

But soon, prices crashed back down to earth. We saw lower-than-expected demand for EVs in the US, and developers ramped up mining and processing to meet demand. Through late 2024 and 2025, lithium carbonate was back around $10 a kilogram again. Avoiding lithium or finding new ways to get it suddenly looked a lot less crucial.

That brings us to today: lithium prices are ticking up again. So far, it’s nowhere close to the dramatic rise we saw a few years ago, but analysts are watching closely. Strong EV growth in China is playing a major role—EVs still make up about 75% of battery demand today. But growth in stationary storage, batteries for the grid, is also contributing to rising demand for lithium in both China and the US.

Higher prices could create new opportunities. The possibilities include alternative battery chemistries, specifically sodium-ion batteries, says Evelina Stoikou, head of battery technologies and supply chains at BloombergNEF. (I’ll note here that we recently named sodium-ion batteries to our 2026 list of 10 Breakthrough Technologies.)

It’s not just batteries, though. Another industry that could see big changes from a lithium price swing: extraction.

Today, most lithium is mined from rocks, largely in Australia, before being shipped to China for processing. There’s a growing effort to process the mineral in other places, though, as countries try to create their own lithium supply chains. Tesla recently confirmed that it’s started production at its lithium refinery in Texas, which broke ground in 2023. We could see more investment in processing plants outside China if prices continue to climb.

This could also be a key year for direct lithium extraction, as Katie Brigham wrote in a recent story for Heatmap. That technology uses chemical or electrochemical processes to extract lithium from brine (salty water that’s usually sourced from salt lakes or underground reservoirs), quickly and cheaply. Companies including Lilac Solutions, Standard Lithium, and Rio Tinto are all making plans or starting construction on commercial facilities this year in the US and Argentina.

If there’s anything I’ve learned about following batteries and minerals over the past few years, it’s that predicting the future is impossible. But if you’re looking for tea leaves to read, lithium prices deserve a look.

He believes that the industry’s current obsession with large language models is wrong-headed and will ultimately fail to solve many pressing problems.

Instead, he thinks we should be betting on world models—a different type of AI that accurately reflects the dynamics of the real world. He is also a staunch advocate for open-source AI and criticizes the closed approach of frontier labs like OpenAI and Anthropic.

Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that he recently left Meta, where he had served as chief scientist for FAIR (Fundamental AI Research), the company&#39;s influential research lab that he founded. Meta has struggled to gain much traction with its open-source AI model Llama and has seen internal shake-ups, including the controversial acquisition of ScaleAI.

LeCun sat down with MIT Technology Review in an exclusive online interview from his Paris apartment to discuss his new venture, life after Meta, the future of artificial intelligence, and why he thinks the industry is chasing the wrong ideas.

Both the questions and answers below have been edited for clarity and brevity.

You’ve just announced a new company, Advanced Machine Intelligence (AMI).  Tell me about the big ideas behind it.

It is going to be a global company, but headquartered in Paris. You pronounce it “ami”—it means “friend” in French. I am excited. There is a very high concentration of talent in Europe, but it is not always given a proper environment to flourish. And there is certainly a huge demand from the industry and governments for a credible frontier AI company that is neither Chinese nor American. I think that is going to be to our advantage.

So an ambitious alternative to the US-China binary we currently have. What made you want to pursue that third path?

Well, there are sovereignty issues for a lot of countries, and they want some control over AI. What I’m advocating is that AI is going to become a platform, and most platforms tend to become open-source. Unfortunately, that’s not really the direction the American industry is taking. Right? As the competition increases, they feel like they have to be secretive. I think that is a strategic mistake.

It’s certainly true for OpenAI, which went from very open to very closed, and Anthropic has always been closed. Google was sort of a little open. And then Meta, we’ll see. My sense is that it’s not going in a positive direction at this moment.

Simultaneously, China has completely embraced this open approach. So all leading open-source AI platforms are Chinese, and the result is that academia and startups, outside of the US, have basically embraced Chinese models. There’s nothing wrong with that—you know, Chinese models are good. Chinese engineers and scientists are great. But you know, if there is a future in which all of our information diet is being mediated by AI assistance, and the choice is either English-speaking models produced by proprietary companies always close to the US or Chinese models which may be open-source but need to be fine-tuned so that they answer questions about Tiananmen Square in 1989—you know, it’s not a very pleasant and engaging future.

They [the future models] should be able to be fine-tuned by anyone and produce a very high diversity of AI assistance, with different linguistic abilities and value systems and political biases and centers of interests. You need high diversity of assistance for the same reason that you need high diversity of press.

That is certainly a compelling pitch. How are investors buying that idea so far?

They really like it. A lot of venture capitalists are very much in favor of this idea of open-source, because they know for a lot of small startups, they really rely on open-source models. They don’t have the means to train their own model, and it’s kind of dangerous for them strategically to embrace a proprietary model.

You recently left Meta. What’s your view on the company and Mark Zuckerberg’s leadership? There’s a perception that Meta has fumbled its AI advantage.

I think FAIR [LeCun’s lab at Meta] was extremely successful in the research part. Where Meta was less successful is in picking up on that research and pushing it into practical technology and products. Mark made some choices that he thought were the best for the company. I may not have agreed with all of them. For example, the robotics group at FAIR was let go, which I think was a strategic mistake. But I’m not the director of FAIR. People make decisions rationally, and there’s no reason to be upset.

So, no bad blood? Could Meta be a future client for AMI?

Meta might be our first client! We’ll see. The work we are doing is not in direct competition. Our focus on world models for the physical world is very different from their focus on generative AI and LLMs.

You were working on AI long before LLMs became a mainstream approach. But since ChatGPT broke out, LLMs have become almost synonymous with AI.

Yes, and we are going to change that. The public face of AI, perhaps, is mostly LLMs and chatbots of various types. But the latest ones of those are not pure LLMs. They are LLM plus a lot of things, like perception systems and code that solves particular problems. So we are going to see LLMs as kind of the orchestrator in systems, a little bit.

Beyond LLMs, there is a lot of AI that is behind the scenes that runs a big chunk of our society. There are assistance driving programs in a car, quick-turn MRI images, algorithms that drive social media—that’s all AI.

You have been vocal in arguing that LLMs can only get us so far. Do you think LLMs are overhyped these days? Can you summarize to our readers why you believe that LLMs are not enough?

There is a sense in which they have not been overhyped, which is that they are extremely useful to a lot of people, particularly if you write text, do research, or write code. LLMs manipulate language really well. But people have had this illusion, or delusion, that it is a matter of time until we can scale them up to having human-level intelligence, and that is simply false.

The truly difficult part is understanding the real world. This is the Moravec Paradox (a phenomenon observed by the computer scientist Hans Moravec in 1988): What’s easy for us, like perception and navigation, is hard for computers, and vice versa. LLMs are limited to the discrete world of text. They can’t truly reason or plan, because they lack a model of the world. They can’t predict the consequences of their actions. This is why we don’t have a domestic robot that is as agile as a house cat, or a truly autonomous car.

We are going to have AI systems that have humanlike and human-level intelligence, but they’re  not going to be built on LLMs, and it’s not going to happen next year or two years from now. It’s going to take a while. There are major conceptual breakthroughs that have to happen before we have AI systems that have human-level intelligence. And that is what I’ve been working on. And this company, AMI Labs, is focusing on the next generation.

And your solution is world models and JEPA architecture (JEPA, or “joint embedding predictive architecture,” is a learning framework that trains AI models to understand the world, created by LeCun while he was at Meta). What’s the elevator pitch?

The world is unpredictable. If you try to build a generative model that predicts every detail of the future, it will fail.  JEPA is not generative AI. It is a system that learns to represent videos really well. The key is to learn an abstract representation of the world and make predictions in that abstract space, ignoring the details you can’t predict. That’s what JEPA does. It learns the underlying rules of the world from observation, like a baby learning about gravity. This is the foundation for common sense, and it’s the key to building truly intelligent systems that can reason and plan in the real world. The most exciting work so far on this is coming from academia, not the big industrial labs stuck in the LLM world.

The lack of non-text data has been a problem in taking AI systems further in understanding the physical world. JEPA is trained on videos. What other kinds of data will you be using?

Our systems will be trained on video, audio, and sensor data of all kinds—not just text. We are working with various modalities, from the position of a robot arm to lidar data to audio. I’m also involved in a project using JEPA to model complex physical and clinical phenomena.

What are some of the concrete, real-world applications you envision for world models?

The applications are vast. Think about complex industrial processes where you have thousands of sensors, like in a jet engine, a steel mill, or a chemical factory. There is no technique right now to build a complete, holistic model of these systems. A world model could learn this from the sensor data and predict how the system will behave. Or think of smart glasses that can watch what you’re doing, identify your actions, and then predict what you’re going to do next to assist you. This is what will finally make agentic systems reliable. An agentic system that is supposed to take actions in the world cannot work reliably unless it has a world model to predict the consequences of its actions. Without it, the system will inevitably make mistakes. This is the key to unlocking everything from truly useful domestic robots to Level 5 autonomous driving.

Humanoid robots are all the rage recently, especially ones built by companies from China. What’s your take?

There are all these brute-force ways to get around the limitations of learning systems, which require inordinate amounts of training data to do anything. So the secret of all the companies getting robots to do kung fu or dance is they are all planned in advance. But frankly, nobody—absolutely nobody—knows how to make those robots smart enough to be useful. Take my word for it.

You need an enormous amount of tele-operation training data for every single task, and when the environment changes a little bit, it doesn’t generalize very well. What this tells us is we are missing something very big. The reason why a 17-year-old can learn to drive in 20 hours is because they already know a lot about how the world behaves. If we want a generally useful domestic robot, we need systems to have a kind of good understanding of the physical world. That’s not going to happen until we have good world models and planning.

There’s a growing sentiment that it’s becoming harder to do foundational AI research in academia because of the massive computing resources required. Do you think the most important innovations will now come from industry?

No. LLMs are now technology development, not research. It’s true that it’s very difficult for academics to play an important role there because of the requirements for computation, data access, and engineering support. But it’s a product now. It’s not something academia should even be interested in. It’s like speech recognition in the early 2010s—it was a solved problem, and the progress was in the hands of industry.

What academia should be working on is long-term objectives that go beyond the capabilities of current systems. That’s why I tell people in universities: Don’t work on LLMs. There is no point. You’re not going to be able to rival what’s going on in industry. Work on something else. Invent new techniques. The breakthroughs are not going to come from scaling up LLMs. The most exciting work on world models is coming from academia, not the big industrial labs. The whole idea of using attention circuits in neural nets came out of the University of Montreal. That research paper started the whole revolution. Now that the big companies are closing up, the breakthroughs are going to slow down. Academia needs access to computing resources, but they should be focused on the next big thing, not on refining the last one.

You wear many hats: professor, researcher, educator, public thinker … Now you just took on a new one. What is that going to look like for you?

I am going to be the executive chairman of the company, and Alex LeBrun [a former colleague from Meta AI] will be the CEO. It’s going to be LeCun and LeBrun—it’s nice if you pronounce it the French way.

I am going to keep my position at NYU. I teach one class per year, I have PhD students and postdocs, so I am going to be kept based in New York. But I go to Paris pretty often because of my lab.

Does that mean that you won’t be very hands-on?

Well, there&#39;s two ways to be hands-on. One is to manage people day to day, and another is to actually get your hands dirty in research projects, right?

I can do management, but I don&#39;t like doing it. This is not my mission in life. It’s really to make science and technology progress as far as we can, inspire other people to work on things that are interesting, and then contribute to those things. So that has been my role at Meta for the last seven years. I founded FAIR and led it for four to five years. I kind of hated being a director. I am not good at this career management thing. I&#39;m much more visionary and a scientist.

Alex is a serial entrepreneur; he’s built three successful AI companies. The first he sold to Microsoft; the second to Facebook, where he was head of the engineering division of FAIR in Paris. He then left to create Nabla, a very successful company in the health-care space. When I offered him the chance to join me in this effort, he accepted almost immediately. He has the experience to build the company, allowing me to focus on science and technology.

You’re headquartered in Paris. Where else do you plan to have offices?

We are a global company. There’s going to be an office in North America.

New York is great. That’s where I am, right? And it’s not Silicon Valley. Silicon Valley is a bit of a monoculture.

What about Asia? I’m guessing Singapore, too?

We don’t have any issue recruiting. There are a lot of people in the AI research community who think the future of AI is in world models. Those people, regardless of pay package, will be motivated to come work for us because they believe in the technological future we are building. We’ve already recruited people from places like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and xAI.

I heard that Saining Xie, a prominent researcher from NYU and Google DeepMind, might be joining you as chief scientist. Any comments?

Saining is a brilliant researcher. I have a lot of admiration for him. I hired him twice already. I hired him at FAIR, and I convinced my colleagues at NYU that we should hire him there. Let’s just say I have a lot of respect for him.

When will you be ready to share more details about AMI Labs, like financial backing or other core members?

Soon—in February, maybe. I’ll let you know.

            <h2>Rethinking AI’s future in an augmented workplace</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/21/1131366/rethinking-ais-future-in-an-augmented-workplace/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There are many paths AI evolution could take. On one end of the spectrum, AI is dismissed as a marginal fad, another bubble fueled by notoriety and misallocated capital. On the other end, it’s cast as a dystopian force, destined to eliminate jobs on a large scale and destabilize economies. Markets oscillate between skepticism and the fear of missing out, while the technology itself evolves quickly and investment dollars flow at a rate not seen in decades.

All the while, many of today’s financial and economic thought leaders hold to the consensus that the financial landscape will stay the same as it has been for the last several years. Two years ago, Joseph Davis, global chief economist at Vanguard, and his team felt the same but wanted to develop their perspective on AI technology with a deeper foundation built on history and data. Based on a proprietary data set covering the last 130 years, Davis and his team developed a new framework, The Vanguard Megatrends Model, from research that suggested a more nuanced path than hype extremes: that AI has the potential to be a general purpose technology that lifts productivity, reshapes industries, and augments human work rather than displaces it. In short, AI will be neither marginal nor dystopian.

“Our findings suggest that the continuation of the status quo, the basic expectation of most economists, is actually the least likely outcome,” Davis says. “We project that AI will have an even greater effect on productivity than the personal computer did. And we project that a scenario where AI transforms the economy is far more likely than one where AI disappoints and fiscal deficits dominate. The latter would likely lead to slower economic growth, higher inflation, and increased interest rates.”

Davis does not sugar-coat it, however. Although AI promises economic growth and productivity, it will be disruptive, especially for business leaders and workers in knowledge sectors. “AI is likely to be the most disruptive technology to alter the nature of our work since the personal computer,” says Davis. “Those of a certain age might recall how the broad availability of PCs remade many jobs. It didn’t eliminate jobs as much as it allowed people to focus on higher value activities.”

The team’s framework allowed them to examine AI automation risks to over 800 different occupations. The research indicated that while the potential for job loss exists in upwards of 20% of occupations as a result of AI-driven automation, the majority of jobs—likely four out of five—will result in a mixture of innovation and automation. Workers’ time will increasingly shift to higher value and uniquely human tasks.

This introduces the idea that AI could serve as a copilot to various roles, performing repetitive tasks and generally assisting with responsibilities. Davis argues that traditional economic models often underestimate the potential of AI because they fail to examine the deeper structural effects of technological change. “Most approaches for thinking about future growth, such as GDP, don’t adequately account for AI,” he explains. “They fail to link short-term variations in productivity with the three dimensions of technological change: automation, augmentation, and the emergence of new industries.” Automation enhances worker productivity by handling routine tasks; augmentation allows technology to act as a copilot, amplifying human skills; and the creation of new industries creates new sources of growth.

Ironically, Davis’s research suggests that a reason for the relatively low productivity growth in recent years may be a lack of automation. Despite a decade of rapid innovation in digital and automation technologies, productivity growth has lagged since the 2008 financial crisis, hitting 50-year lows. This appears to support the view that AI’s impact will be marginal. But Davis believes that automation has been adopted in the wrong places. “What surprised me most was how little automation there has been in services like finance, health care, and education,” he says. “Outside of manufacturing, automation has been very limited. That’s been holding back growth for at least two decades.” The services sector accounts for more than 60% of US GDP and 80% of the workforce and has experienced some of the lowest productivity growth. It is here, Davis argues, that AI will make the biggest difference.

One of the biggest challenges facing the economy is demographics, as the Baby Boomer generation retires, immigration slows, and birth rates decline. These demographic headwinds reinforce the need for technological acceleration. “There are concerns about AI being dystopian and causing massive job loss, but we’ll soon have too few workers, not too many,” Davis says. “Economies like the US, Japan, China, and those across Europe will need to step up function in automation as their populations age.”

For example, consider nursing, a profession in which empathy and human presence are irreplaceable. AI has already shown the potential to augment rather than automate in this field, streamlining data entry in electronic health records and helping nurses reclaim time for patient care. Davis estimates that these tools could increase nursing productivity by as much as 20% by 2035, a crucial gain as health-care systems adapt to ageing populations and rising demand. “In our most likely scenario, AI will offset demographic pressures. Within five to seven years, AI’s ability to automate portions of work will be roughly equivalent to adding 16 million to 17 million workers to the US labor force,” Davis says. “That’s essentially the same as if everyone turning 65 over the next five years decided not to retire.” He projects that more than 60% of occupations, including nurses, family physicians, high school teachers, pharmacists, human resource managers, and insurance sales agents, will benefit from AI as an augmentation tool.

As AI technology spreads, the strongest performers in the stock market won’t be its producers, but its users. “That makes sense, because general-purpose technologies enhance productivity, efficiency, and profitability across entire sectors,” says Davis. This adoption of AI is creating flexibility for investment options, which means diversifying beyond technology stocks might be appropriate as reflected in Vanguard’s Economic and Market Outlook for 2026. “As that happens, the benefits move beyond places like Silicon Valley or Boston and into industries that apply the technology in transformative ways.” And history shows that early adopters of new technologies reap the greatest productivity rewards. “We’re clearly in the experimentation phase of learning by doing,” says Davis. “Those companies that encourage and reward experimentation will capture the most value from AI.”

Looking globally, Davis sees the United States and China as significantly ahead in the AI race. “It’s a virtual dead heat,” he says. “That tells me the competition between the two will remain intense.” But other economies, especially those with low automation rates and large service sectors, like Japan, Europe, and Canada, could also see significant benefits. “If AI is truly going to be transformative, three sectors stand out: health care, education, and finance,” says Davis. “For AI to live up to its potential, it must fundamentally reshape these industries, which face high costs and rising demand for better, faster, more personalized services.”

However, Davis says Vanguard is more bullish on AI’s potential to transform the economy than it was just a year ago. Especially since that transformation requires application beyond Silicon Valley. “When I speak to business leaders, I remind them that this transformation hasn’t happened yet,” says Davis. “It’s their investment and innovation that will determine whether it does.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As Europe races into the AI era, its policymakers are laying new pipes for the continent’s digital future. The European Commission’s proposed Digital Networks Act (DNA) promises to rewire the EU’s telecom landscape, with big implications for artificial intelligence infrastructure, connectivity equity, and the startup ecosystem.

Exposed as part of a broader push to make Europe “fit for the Digital Age,” the draft law aims to modernize how networks are built and regulated, from 5G towers in rural villages to fiber links between data centers.

I have to say it’s a bold vision of a more connected, innovative Europe, but one that must navigate a thicket of competing interests and unanswered questions.

For years, EU leaders have urged the creation of a true single market for digital services. The DNA is a centerpiece of that strategy, aligning with Europe’s Digital Decade goals for universal high-speed internet by 2030.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

How can we translate this? Well, I think Brussels wants to turn the patchwork of 27 national telecom systems into one seamless network. The Act’s core objective is to “harmonise the EU connectivity sector by addressing delays, inconsistencies, and fragmentation”, removing barriers to cross-border operations and stimulating investment in very high-capacity networks.

This mirrors the logic behind earlier EU tech regulations;  just as the Digital Markets Act tackled Big Tech gatekeepers, the Digital Networks Act targets the digital plumbing beneath them.

This reform doesn’t come out of the blue.

A Commission white paper in 2024 warned that without cutting-edge digital infrastructure, Europe’s digital economy would stall. It painted vivid scenarios: doctors unable to perform remote surgery, smart farms and self-driving cars hamstrung by slow connections.

Secure and sustainable networks are one of the “cardinal points” of the EU’s 2030 digital agenda.

The DNA is Brussels’ attempt to meet those needs by boosting investment, standardizing rules, and making sure that every corner of Europe can plug into the opportunities of the digital age.

At its core, the Act hands telecom operators some long-sought gifts. One headline measure would grant carriers unlimited radio-spectrum licenses, ending the era of auctions that force telcos to periodically renew their rights.

For Europe’s big mobile providers, this change offers certainty: they can invest in 5G and future 6G networks without fearing their spectrum will expire.

Regulators argue this will “increase investment predictability” and accelerate network roll-out.

In theory, more cell towers could now reach remote areas, and companies might more freely trade or lease unused frequencies to new players.

The DNA couples permanent licenses with “use-it-or-share-it” obligations to prevent hoarding. If an incumbent isn’t using its spectrum in, say, a rural region, it could be forced to share it or lose it,  allowing a competitor or community network to serve that area.

It’s a nod to connectivity equity: Europe doesn’t want scarce wireless spectrum lying fallow while some communities remain underserved.

Broadband for all is the mantra, and long license tenures will come with accountability to deliver on coverage.

Another provision tightens the oversight of dominant firms. Under current plans, if a telecom operator holds significant market power (SMP) in one market (for example, fixed broadband), regulators could extend that designation to a closely related market (like mobile services).

In practice, this means big incumbents might face extra obligations, from transparency to price controls, across their range of services. The idea is to prevent giants from leveraging their dominance in one domain to squelch competition in another.

That could open space for smaller internet providers or innovative ISPs to compete, a boon for consumer choice and startup entrants.

A cohort of six member states,  including France, Germany and Italy, has pushed back, urging Brussels not to centralize control over frequencies and mergers.

Spectrum auctions have long been jealously guarded as national turf (they can fill state coffers, after all), and capitals are wary of one-size-fits-all rules emanating from the EU.

These governments also worry that encouraging pan-European telecom mergers (another idea floated in the reform) could reduce competition at home. In their joint memo, they caution that while a level playing field between telecoms and tech firms is a laudable goal, “this does not necessarily imply the same regulations should apply”to both sectors.

It’s a reminder that the DNA, for all its single-market ideals, must reckon with political realities: Europe’s telecom revolution won’t happen without consensus among very different national markets.

Perhaps the most contentious debate surrounding the Digital Networks Act has been over who pays for the next-generation networks. Telecom giants have spent years lobbying for a “fair share” contribution from Big Tech, arguing that bandwidth-hungry services like Netflix, YouTube, and cloud platforms should chip in to finance the infrastructure that carries their content.

The draft Act steers clear of any direct “network usage fee” on content providers. Instead, it reaffirms Europe’s commitment to net neutrality, the principle that all internet traffic must be treated equally by providers.

Any cooperation with Big Tech will rely on voluntary “best practice” discussions moderated by EU regulators, not on legally mandated payments.

This decision followed intense pushback from many sides. Over the summer, consumer groups and tech industry alliances publicly warned against reviving the “fair share” idea under any guise, noting it had been “clearly rejected in previous consultations” for threatening consumers, competition and innovation.

Even a U.S.–EU trade agreement in late 2025 extracted a pledge from Brussels “not [to] adopt or maintain network usage fees”, highlighting the geopolitical stakes of singling out mostly American tech firms.

On the other hand, startups and digital rights advocates breathed a sigh of relief at the Commission’s stance. Allied for Startups, a coalition of European entrepreneurs, argued that net neutrality is essential for startup growth, preventing a two-tier internet that would “favour dominant players” and raise barriers for newcomers.

In their view, a “traffic tax” isn’t just about Google or Amazon’s bottom line, it would set a harmful precedent that could box out the little guys who rely on affordable, equal-access bandwidth to innovate.

By keeping the DNA free of explicit network fees, Europe is signaling that the open internet won’t be collateral damage in the drive for better infrastructure.

Beyond telecom boardrooms and Silicon Valley balance sheets, the Digital Networks Act is ultimately about the kind of digital society Europe wants to build.

A major motivation is preparing for a future where artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and IoT devices are ubiquitous, and will demand unprecedented bandwidth and low latency.

The Commission’s own analysis stresses that only with the “highest performance” networks will transformative technologies like AI, autonomous vehicles, remote health care, and smart grids reach their potential.

In simple terms: if data is the new oil, Europe needs better pipes to pump it.

The Digital Networks Act sits alongside Europe’s broader tech push by focusing on the infrastructure AI needs to scale. Beyond regulating AI, the EU is investing in next-generation networks, from fiber to 5G and 6G, through initiatives such as the Smart Networks and Services Joint Undertaking.

Faster rollout of these networks would underpin everything from AI-driven industry to cloud services, all of which depend on high-capacity, cross-border connectivity.

The Act also addresses connectivity equity. While Europe’s digital goals assume universal gigabit access and widespread 5G, large parts of the continent still lag behind.

The proposal combines simpler deployment rules with tougher coverage obligations, while allowing flexibility where older networks cannot yet be switched off. The aim is to expand access without letting rigid deadlines slow progress.

Whether this works will depend on execution. Investment still favors dense urban markets, and rural coverage remains a challenge. If the Act can meaningfully lift fiber and 5G reach across Europe, it could help ensure the AI economy extends beyond major tech hubs to the rest of the continent.

From the perspective of Europe’s startups and innovators, the DNA is a double-edged sword that tilts promisingly toward opportunity. On one side, the Act’s push to harmonize telecom rules could tear down barriers that have long frustrated young companies.

Today, a cloud services startup or an IoT device maker in Europe must navigate a maze of national regulations when scaling up, from differing network standards to separate certification hoops in each country.

By creating a more unified framework (for instance, common rules on spectrum and infrastructure access), the DNA could make it easier for a startup in Portugal to expand its services to Poland or Finland without running into 27 different regulatory roadblocks.

Startups rely on an open and predictable internet, and on this front the Commission’s approach offers some reassurance. By preserving net neutrality and rejecting new network tolls, the Act allows young companies to reach users on equal terms, without the risk that deeper-pocketed rivals can buy preferential treatment.

For small fintech or AI startups, avoiding additional network costs matters, and under the current proposal they won’t be asked to shoulder them.

At the same time, founders are reading the fine print carefully. Proposals around a “level playing field” raise concerns that telecom-style regulation could spill over onto digital services, including smaller platforms.

The balance remains fragile: regulate too little and dominant players squeeze out challengers; regulate too broadly and compliance costs can smother the next generation of European tech companies.

As an ambitious blueprint for Europe’s digital infrastructure, the Digital Networks Act embodies a careful balancing act. It must entice telecom operators to spend the billions needed to upgrade networks for an AI-driven future, yet not at the expense of the open internet or new challengers.

It seeks to unify Europe’s connectivity market while respecting that one size may not fit all in a Union of 27. In the coming months, EU lawmakers and member states will debate and tweak the proposal, and the stakes are high.

The outcome will shape not just who foots the bill for Europe’s next-gen networks, but also who can innovate on those networks in the years ahead.

There will be bumps on this road, resistance from powerful telecom lobbies, wrangling between capitals and Brussels, and possibly even transatlantic frictions.

In the end, the Digital Networks Act is about Europe’s place in the digital world. A continent that pioneered GSM mobile standards and championed data privacy now wants to set the standard for equitable, innovation-friendly networks.

Striking a balance between investment and fairness, between scale and competition, won’t be easy. But it’s essential. If the EU succeeds, the reward could be a resilient digital backbone capable of supporting AI breakthroughs and economic growth across all its regions, without leaving its core values behind.

If it stumbles, Europe risks buffering on the sidelines while others surge ahead.

The coming debate will reveal whether Europe can indeed reshape its digital DNA for the better, or if old divides will slow down this grand connectivity project.

Either way, the world will be watching the EU’s next move in this high-stakes telecom reboot.

            <div id="article-text">Berlin’s energy transition sector got a defining boost today as Cloover, a climate fintech based in Berlin, announced it has secured more than $1.2 billion in total capital commitments, combining Series A equity and a substantial debt facility to accelerate the rollout of its software and financing platform across Europe.

The financing package includes €18.8 million (approximately $22 million) in Series A equity, led by MMC Ventures and QED Investors, with participation from Lowercarbon Capital, BNVT Capital, Bosch Ventures, Centrotec, and Earthshot Ventures.

Alongside that, a €1.02 billion debt facility provided by a major European bank will be deployed directly as customer and installer financing through Cloover’s platform, backed by a €300 million guarantee from the European Investment Fund to support scalable, low-cost lending for clean energy projects.

For a company that only a few years ago was in seed-stage fundraising, the scale of these commitments marks a striking shift. The debt element is operational capital designed to help manufacturers, installers, and homeowners finance solar panels, batteries, heat pumps, and other distributed energy technologies under a single unified system.

Cloover was founded in 2023 by Jodok Betschart, Peder Broms, and Valentin Gönczy, who arrived at the idea after interviewing hundreds of installers across Europe and hearing the same frustrations: fragmented software stacks, manual processes, and limited access to project financing. They saw a structural gap in the energy transition; demand for decentralised power had surged, but the financing and platform infrastructure to scale it weren’t keeping pace.

That gap is what Cloover’s platform intends to close. At its core is an integrated operating system that combines workflow management, procurement, financing, energy optimisation, and risk analytics into one environment that serves all parts of the distributed energy value chain. Installers can offer financing at the point of sale, streamline operations, and reduce administrative drag.

Homeowners, in turn, gain access to installations with lower upfront costs and financing terms linked to projected energy savings rather than traditional credit scoring.

Some investors now call Cloover the “Shopify for energy”, a digital backbone that supports the entire process of deploying distributed energy systems at scale. The model is built around scalable capital deployment combined with end-to-end software automation, including AI-driven tools for underwriting and operations.
The timing of this financing is noteworthy.

Across Europe, demand for residential solar and decentralised energy solutions is accelerating as regulatory pressure, rising electricity prices, and broader electrification trends push households and businesses toward clean alternatives. Yet installers often struggle with financing bottlenecks. Cloover’s platform embeds capital directly into the sales workflow, turning financing from a hurdle into a built-in feature.

In a statement, CEO Jodok Betschart framed the new financing as a way to enable energy independence without the friction of upfront costs or complex loan applications, noting that the company’s AI operating system connects stakeholders across the value chain.

For European climate tech and energy markets, the scale of Cloover’s backing is remarkable. Few startups in this space have bridged software infrastructure and finance at this magnitude, and the size of the debt commitment signals deep lender confidence in distributed energy as a growth asset class.

It sets a potential precedent for how renewable energy projects can be financed and adopted more quickly across the region, something both policymakers and industry leaders have identified as essential to meeting the EU’s climate goals.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">To many readers, this may sound like a paradox: how can knowledge ever become invaluable?

In this article, I want to explore how corporate knowledge, when poorly structured and rigidly transferred, can slowly transform from an asset into a disadvantage. Not only for companies, but especially for employees. And over time, that disadvantage compounds.

The journey usually looks familiar. You apply for a job, speak with a recruiter, send your CV, go through interviews, and eventually receive the green-light email: “Congratulations, you’re hired.”

This moment takes us directly to the real turning point: the onboarding process.

Those first one, two, sometimes even three months when you are introduced to the people, the tools, the workflows, the strategies, and the “way things are done.” On paper, onboarding exists to accelerate integration and performance. In reality, in many corporations, it quietly becomes an indoctrination phase.

Relatable to anyone who has worked in large organizations, onboarding often shifts from enabling understanding to enforcing conformity. New hires are not only taught what the company knows, but also what the company no longer questions.

This is where corporate knowledge starts becoming invaluable.

Because instead of acting as a foundation to build on, it becomes a ceiling.

It tells you what to do, how to do it, and more importantly, what not to rethink. Over time, this “do according to the manual” culture doesn’t just standardize execution. It standardizes thinking. And standardized thinking is the natural enemy of innovation.

History shows us a consistent pattern: breakthroughs rarely come from the center of an industry. They come from the edges.

Elon Musk was not an automotive executive. He treated cars as computers on wheels and energy systems. The result? An entire industry forced to reset its assumptions.

Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp were not transportation insiders. They were technologists. They saw GPS-enabled phones, invisible payments, and drivers that didn’t need to be owned. They reframed taxis not as a fleet problem, but as a software and trust problem. And the taxi industry, as it existed, effectively ended.

These examples point to a simple truth: transformative ideas usually emerge from new mental models, not from perfected manuals.

Yet most onboarding processes are designed to remove new mental models as quickly as possible.

They don’t ask: “What do you see that we no longer notice?”
 They ask: “How fast can you adapt to how we already work?”

Most programs teach tools, not systems. New hires learn where to click, not how to think. They are trained on CRMs, scripts, workflows, and reporting routines, but not on AI-assisted decision-making, signal-based prospecting, or how to design work alongside automated agents.

As a result, organizations scale activity instead of intelligence.

Even worse, onboarding still assumes that humans should work like software: following rigid processes, filling manual reports, executing predefined sequences. Instead of being taught how to orchestrate software, delegate to AI, and concentrate on judgment, creativity, and relationships.

Over time, this creates a paradoxical outcome: the more “knowledge” an organization accumulates, the harder it becomes for new ideas to survive inside it.

And when knowledge can no longer be challenged, recombined, or re-imagined, it stops being knowledge.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a Davos dominated by talk of tariffs, subsidies, and geopolitical risk, Europe used the stage to question its own economic limits. At the World Economic Forum, Ursula von der Leyen put forward one of the clearest signals yet that the European Union is preparing a structural shift in how it treats business, competitiveness, and economic power.

The phrase that stuck, “Europe Inc”, is not the name of a regulation, nor a new Brussels invention ready to roll out. It is a political framing for a shift that the European Commission wants to accelerate.

What Europe Inc actually refers to is an idea long discussed in EU policy circles and now pushed into the spotlight: the so-called 28th regime. An optional, EU-wide corporate framework that would sit alongside national systems and allow companies to operate across the bloc under a single legal structure.

The problem it is meant to solve is real and well-documented. Europe has a single market in theory, but in practice, companies still face 27 different company laws, registration processes, capital requirements, and administrative timelines. Startups incorporate in one country, then struggle to expand. Scaleups hit legal friction. Many leave.

The Commission’s answer is simplification through centralisation. Under the proposed 28th regime, entrepreneurs would be able to set up a company digitally, once and use that structure across the EU. One registration, one legal form, one set of rules. The ambition presented at Davos goes further: company creation within 48 hours, fully online.

That figure matters. It is also where political ambition risks being read as immediate reality.

The 48-hour setup is not in force. It is a target attached to a proposal that still needs to be formally drafted, negotiated, and approved by both the European Parliament and member states. Nothing in current EU law allows this yet. What exists is intent, not implementation.

Von der Leyen was explicit about why this push is happening now. Global conditions have hardened. Trade is increasingly weaponised. Industrial policy has returned, unapologetically, in the US and China.

Supply chain shocks and energy crises exposed Europe’s vulnerabilities. In that environment, regulatory fragmentation stops being a technical issue and becomes a strategic one.

Europe Inc is Brussels admitting that rules alone do not build power. Scale does. There is also a political recalibration underway. The EU has traditionally defined itself as a regulator first, a market shaper second.

The message from Davos suggests a change in emphasis: competitiveness, capital mobilisation, and strategic autonomy are moving closer to the centre of EU policymaking.

Still, limits remain. The 28th regime, as currently described, would be optional. It would not harmonise taxation overnight. Labour law, insolvency rules, and social policy remain largely national domains. Europe Inc would coexist with national systems, not replace them.

That coexistence is both its strength and its risk. Optional frameworks can attract fast-growing companies, but they can also deepen a two-speed Europe if not carefully designed. This tension is not resolved yet.

What Davos revealed is not a finished Europe Inc, but a Commission willing to say openly that Europe’s economic model, as it stands, is too slow for the world it operates in. Whether Europe Inc becomes a meaningful tool or another unrealised promise will depend less on slogans and more on legislation, compromise, and political courage across 27 capitals.

For now, Europe Inc is best understood as a warning shot. Europe intends to compete as a bloc, not as a collection of administrative borders. The clock, as von der Leyen implied, is already running.

            <h2>Odoo tops €7 billion valuation as General Atlantic increases stake</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/odoo-tops-7-billion-valuation">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Belgian business software company Odoo, also a unicorn, has reached a fresh milestone. Growth investor General Atlantic has increased its stake in the firm, buying additional shares from regional backer Wallonie Entreprendre and pushing Odoo’s valuation to roughly €7 billion.

This move isn’t a typical funding round where a company raises new capital. Instead, it’s a secondary transaction: General Atlantic bought existing shares that were previously held by Wallonie Entreprendre, the investment arm of Belgium’s Walloon region. After the deal, Wallonie Entreprendre still holds about 3 % of the company.

Odoo was founded in 2002 in Belgium and has grown steadily from a small project into a global software platform. It offers an integrated suite of business applications used by small and medium-sized enterprises for everything from finance and sales to HR and marketing.

The software is built on an open-core model that encourages developers around the world to build add-on apps, creating a vast ecosystem of nearly 40,000 extensions.

Today, Odoo counts more than 170,000 paying customers in around 180 countries. That global footprint and the steady revenue growth it has delivered helped convince General Atlantic to deepen its involvement.

Since first investing in the company in 2023, the firm has supported Odoo’s expansion into new markets and helped refine its commercial strategy.

Part of what makes this update noteworthy is how Odoo has expanded its product offerings. Its newest versions include AI-infused features and automation tools that make the suite more attractive to businesses looking to replace outdated, fragmented systems with a single, unified digital platform.

For the European tech scene, this development highlights a shift in how successful software companies grow and attract capital. Rather than chasing quick exits or IPOs, some founders are choosing secondary share deals to let early investors realise gains while keeping strategic control.

That path can make it easier for companies to stay private longer and focus on building value over time.

I don’t know what is happening in Belgium or what they are having for breakfast, but the country itself has quietly become a place where software businesses can scale internationally.

Odoo is one of its standout success stories, showing that strong product focus, community-driven development, and global reach can win serious backing from major growth investors.

            <div id="article-text">For a long time, tech events were built around scale. The bigger the crowd, the stronger the perception of success. Attendance numbers became a proxy for impact, and festivals grew year after year because that was what the industry expected.

That model no longer fits how tech leaders work today.

Over the past years, I have spent time in conversations with founders, executives, and operators who carry real responsibility inside their organizations. As a community builder, I often speak with them before they commit to attending events. Their questions are direct. They want to know who will be in the room, how discussions are structured, and whether the environment allows honest exchange.

Almost none of them ask how many people will attend.

This is a meaningful signal. Leaders who run companies do not optimize for visibility. They already have it. They want rooms where time leads to insight, clarity, and decisions.

As CEO of Tekpon AI Summit, I have had a front row seat to how decision makers actually want to engage today. I have watched what happens on large stages. I have also watched what happens when ten relevant people sit around one table with no audience and no agenda beyond honest discussion.

The difference in outcome is hard to ignore. In small rooms, people speak openly. They share challenges they would never publish. They explore partnerships without formalities. They make decisions faster because trust forms naturally when everyone present has earned their place in the conversation.

In larger settings, the dynamic changes. Conversations stay cautious. Stories become polished. The real questions are postponed, usually for later. Later often disappears into busy schedules.

Large conferences still play a role. They introduce new voices to the ecosystem. They create energy. They give exposure to early-stage founders. That contribution remains valuable.

But they are no longer where serious business gets done.

The work that shapes companies happens in environments where attention is protected and trust forms quickly. Where people can speak without performing. Where context is shared. Where participants know that what is said in the room stays in the room. These conditions are difficult to build at a mass scale and natural in small, curated settings.

This has already changed how senior decision makers allocate their time. Many are reducing their presence at large events. They are choosing closed discussions, private dinners, and carefully selected gatherings where every participant has a reason to be there. They are not rejecting conferences. They are rejecting formats that do not respect their attention.

The industry is slow to react to this shift. Event strategies still chase attendance growth, sponsorship volume, and social media reach. Meanwhile, the people shaping companies are quietly changing their behavior. They are voting with their calendars.

This gap will continue to widen. Events that optimize for volume will struggle to attract senior leaders. Once you see this up close, it becomes hard to unsee. The criteria for choosing where to meet have changed. Not loudly, not publicly, but consistently.

Some will still chase scale. Others will keep building large festivals and broad platforms. There is nothing wrong with that. But the people shaping companies are already making different choices. They are selecting rooms where conversations move faster, trust forms naturally, and time feels respected.

That is where tech leaders now choose to meet.
