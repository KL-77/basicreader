            <h2>AI companies want you to stop chatting with bots and start managing them</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/02/ai-companies-want-you-to-stop-chatting-with-bots-and-start-managing-them/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Thursday, Anthropic and OpenAI shipped products built around the same idea: instead of chatting with a single AI assistant, users should be managing teams of AI agents that divide up work and run in parallel. The simultaneous releases are part of a gradual shift across the industry, from AI as a conversation partner to AI as a delegated workforce, and they arrive during a week when that very concept reportedly helped wipe $285 billion off software stocks.

Whether that supervisory model works in practice remains an open question. Current AI agents still require heavy human intervention to catch errors, and no independent evaluation has confirmed that these multi-agent tools reliably outperform a single developer working alone.

Even so, the companies are going all-in on agents. Anthropic’s contribution is Claude Opus 4.6, a new version of its most capable AI model, paired with a feature called “agent teams” in Claude Code. Agent teams let developers spin up multiple AI agents that split a task into independent pieces, coordinate autonomously, and run concurrently.

In practice, agent teams look like a split-screen terminal environment: A developer can jump between subagents using Shift+Up/Down, take over any one directly, and watch the others keep working. Anthropic describes the feature as best suited for “tasks that split into independent, read-heavy work like codebase reviews.” It is available as a research preview.

OpenAI, meanwhile, released Frontier, an enterprise platform it describes as a way to “hire AI co-workers who take on many of the tasks people already do on a computer.” Frontier assigns each AI agent its own identity, permissions, and memory, and it connects to existing business systems such as CRMs, ticketing tools, and data warehouses. “What we’re fundamentally doing is basically transitioning agents into true AI co-workers,” Barret Zoph, OpenAI’s general manager of business-to-business, told CNBC.

Despite the hype about these agents being co-workers, from our experience, these agents tend to work best if you think of them as tools that amplify existing skills, not as the autonomous co-workers the marketing language implies. They can produce impressive drafts fast but still require constant human course-correction.

The Frontier launch came just three days after OpenAI released a new macOS desktop app for Codex, its AI coding tool, which OpenAI executives described as a “command center for agents.” The Codex app lets developers run multiple agent threads in parallel, each working on an isolated copy of a codebase via Git worktrees.

OpenAI also released GPT-5.3-Codex on Thursday, a new AI model that powers the Codex app. OpenAI claims that the Codex team used early versions of GPT-5.3-Codex to debug the model’s own training run, manage its deployment, and diagnose test results, similar to what OpenAI told Ars Technica in a December interview.

“Our team was blown away by how much Codex was able to accelerate its own development,” the company wrote. On Terminal-Bench 2.0, the agentic coding benchmark, GPT-5.3-Codex scored 77.3%, which exceeds Anthropic’s just-released Opus 4.6 by about 12 percentage points.

The common thread across all of these products is a shift in the user’s role. Rather than merely typing a prompt and waiting for a single response, the developer or knowledge worker becomes more like a supervisor, dispatching tasks, monitoring progress, and stepping in when an agent needs direction.

In this vision, developers and knowledge workers effectively become middle managers of AI. That is, not writing the code or doing the analysis themselves, but delegating tasks, reviewing output, and hoping the agents underneath them don’t quietly break things. Whether that will come to pass (or if it’s actually a good idea) is still widely debated.

Opus 4.6 is a substantial update to Anthropic’s flagship model. It succeeds Claude Opus 4.5, which Anthropic released in November. In a first for the Opus model family, it supports a context window of up to 1 million tokens (in beta), which means it can process much larger bodies of text or code in a single session.

On benchmarks, Anthropic says Opus 4.6 tops OpenAI’s GPT-5.2 (an earlier model than the one released today) and Google’s Gemini 3 Pro across several evaluations, including Terminal-Bench 2.0 (an agentic coding test), Humanity’s Last Exam (a multidisciplinary reasoning test), and BrowseComp (a test of finding hard-to-locate information online)

Although it should be noted that OpenAI’s GPT-5.3-Codex, released the same day, seemingly reclaimed the lead on Terminal-Bench. On ARC AGI 2, which attempts to test the ability to solve problems that are easy for humans but hard for AI models, Opus 4.6 scored 68.8 percent, compared to 37.6 percent for Opus 4.5, 54.2 percent for GPT-5.2, and 45.1 percent for Gemini 3 Pro.

As always, take AI benchmarks with a grain of salt, since objectively measuring AI model capabilities is a relatively new and unsettled science.

Anthropic also said that on a long-context retrieval benchmark called MRCR v2, Opus 4.6 scored 76 percent on the 1 million-token variant, compared to 18.5 percent for its Sonnet 4.5 model. That gap matters for the agent teams use case, since agents working across large codebases need to track information across hundreds of thousands of tokens without losing the thread.

Pricing for the API stays the same as Opus 4.5 at $5 per million input tokens and $25 per million output tokens, with a premium rate of $10/$37.50 for prompts that exceed 200,000 tokens. Opus 4.6 is available on claude.ai, the Claude API, and all major cloud platforms.

These releases occurred during a week of exceptional volatility for software stocks. On January 30, Anthropic released 11 open source plugins for Cowork, its agentic productivity tool that launched on January 12. Cowork itself is a general-purpose tool that gives Claude access to local folders for work tasks, but the plugins extended it into specific professional domains: legal contract review, non-disclosure agreement triage, compliance workflows, financial analysis, sales, and marketing.

By Tuesday, investors reportedly reacted to the release by erasing roughly $285 billion in market value across software, financial services, and asset management stocks. A Goldman Sachs basket of US software stocks fell 6 percent that day, its steepest single-session decline since April’s tariff-driven sell-off. Thomson Reuters led the rout with an 18 percent drop, and the pain spread to European and Asian markets.

The purported fear among investors centers on AI model companies packaging complete workflows that compete with established software-as-a-service (SaaS) vendors, even if the verdict is still out on whether these tools can achieve those tasks.

OpenAI’s Frontier might deepen that concern: its stated design lets AI agents log in to applications, execute tasks, and manage work with minimal human involvement, which Fortune described as a bid to become “the operating system of the enterprise.” OpenAI CEO of Applications Fidji Simo pushed back on the idea that Frontier replaces existing software, telling reporters, “Frontier is really a recognition that we’re not going to build everything ourselves.”

Whether these co-working apps actually live up to their billing or not, the convergence is hard to miss. Anthropic’s Scott White, the company’s head of product for enterprise, gave the practice a name that is likely to roll a few eyes. “Everybody has seen this transformation happen with software engineering in the last year and a half, where vibe coding started to exist as a concept, and people could now do things with their ideas,” White told CNBC. “I think that we are now transitioning almost into vibe working.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 2018, we lamented as Nintendo officially replaced the Virtual Console—its long-running line of downloadable classic games on the Wii and Wii U—with time-limited access to a set of games through a paid Nintendo Switch Online subscription. Now, Hamster Corporation is doing what Nintendo no longer will, by offering downloadable versions of retro console games for direct individual purchase on the Switch 2.

As part of today’s Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase, Hamster announced a new Console Archives line of emulated classics available for download starting today on the Switch 2 and next week on the PlayStation 5 (sorry, Xbox and OG Switch fans). So far that lineup only includes the original PlayStation snowboarding title Cool Boarders for $12 and the NES action platformer Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos for $8, but Hamster promises more obscure games, including Doraemon and Sonic Wings Special, will be available in the future.

If the name Hamster Corporation sounds familiar, it’s because the company is behind the Arcade Archive series, which has repackaged individual arcade games for purchase and emulated play on modern consoles since 2014. That effort, which celebrated its 500th release in December, even includes some of Nintendo’s classic arcade titles, which the Switch-maker never officially released on the original Virtual Console.

Now Hamster’s says it is expanding its efforts “with the concept of faithfully reproducing masterpieces released on various home game consoles, allowing players to easily enjoy them on the latest hardware.” While these new offerings are more bare-bones than the full-fledged interactive museums released by the likes of Digital Eclipse, they still include a few modern features, such as customizable button layouts, screen settings, and the ability to save and load at any time.

Hamster says on its website that it “would like to port and release as many games as possible,” practically begging “those of you who own the rights to the games, please let us release your games” by licensing or outright selling the rights.

“We believe it is very important to pass this on to future generations around the world, and to create an environment where anyone can play it anytime, anywhere,” Hamster writes. “Everyone has different memories of games. We aim to release as many titles as possible so that people can rediscover and play the games that evoke fond memories of the time they played them.”

Incidentally, Ninja Gaiden II was previously offered on the Wii Virtual Console back in 2007 and again on the Wii U Virtual Console in 2016. Both releases cost just $5 at the time, but the shutdown of Nintendo’s Wii and Wii U eShops means the game is no longer available for purchase on those defunct platforms. Thank goodness, then, that Hamster is offering an opportunity to purchase the game for the third time in as many decades on yet another new console. Fully portable ROMs of the game are just way too convenient to purchase, you know?</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Today, OpenAI announced GPT-5.3-Codex, a new version of its frontier coding model that will be available via the command line, IDE extension, web interface, and the new macOS desktop app. (No API access yet, but it’s coming.)

GPT-5.3-Codex outperforms GPT-5.2-Codex and GPT-5.2 in SWE-Bench Pro, Terminal-Bench 2.0, and other benchmarks, according to the company’s testing.

There are already a few headlines out there saying “Codex built itself,” but let’s reality-check that, as that’s an overstatement. The domains OpenAI described using it for here are similar to the ones you see in some other enterprise software development firms now: managing deployments, debugging, and handling test results and evaluations. There is no claim here that GPT-5.3-Codex built itself.

Instead, OpenAI says GPT-5.3-Codex was “instrumental in creating itself.” You can read more about what that means in the company’s blog post.

But that’s part of the pitch with this model update—OpenAI is trying to position Codex as a tool that does more than generate lines of code. The goal is to make it useful for “all of the work in the software lifecycle—debugging, deploying, monitoring, writing PRDs, editing copy, user research, tests, metrics, and more.” There’s also an emphasis on steering the model mid-task and frequent status updates.

It’s worth mentioning that the general-purpose ChatGPT model is still version numbered 5.2. With Codex moving to 5.3, OpenAI may be planning a similar update for ChatGPT in the near future, but nothing has been announced yet.

There are no announced changes to limits or pricing with this model, but OpenAI says that, as of this update, models will run 25 percent faster for Codex users, “thanks to improvements in our infrastructure and inference stack.”

OpenAI also notes that “what’s next” for Codex is “moving beyond writing code to using it as a tool to operate a computer and get real work done end to end.” That’s something that people have already been using these tools for via MCP and other methods, and which Anthropic started rolling out with Claude Cowork a few weeks back.</div>

            <h2>"ICE Out of Our Faces Act" would ban ICE and CBP use of facial recognition</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/ice-out-of-our-faces-act-would-ban-ice-and-cbp-use-of-facial-recognition/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A few Senate Democrats introduced a bill called the ‘‘ICE Out of Our Faces Act,” which would ban Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) from using facial recognition technology.

The bill would make it “unlawful for any covered immigration officer to acquire, possess, access, or use in the United States—(1) any biometric surveillance system; or (2) information derived from a biometric surveillance system operated by another entity.” All data collected from such systems in the past would have to be deleted. The proposed ban extends beyond facial recognition to cover other biometric surveillance technologies, such as voice recognition.

The proposed ban would prohibit the federal government from using data from biometric surveillance systems in court cases or investigations. Individuals would have a right to sue the federal government for financial damages after violations, and state attorneys general would be able to bring suits on behalf of residents.

The bill was submitted yesterday by Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), who held a press conference about the proposal with Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), and US Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.). The Senate bill is also cosponsored by Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).

“This is a dangerous moment for America,” Markey said at the press conference, saying that ICE and CBP “have built an arsenal of surveillance technologies that are designed to track and to monitor and to target individual people, both citizens and non-citizens alike. Facial recognition technology sits at the center of a digital dragnet that has been created in our nation.”

Jayapal said, “This is a very dangerous intersection of overly violent and overzealous activity from ICE and Border Patrol, and the increasing use of biometric identification systems. This has become a surveillance state with militarized federal troops on our streets terrorizing and intimidating US citizens and residents alike.”

There probably isn’t much chance that the Republican-majority Congress will vote to ban the use of facial recognition by ICE and CBP. The Markey bill goes beyond demands sent to Republicans yesterday by House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).

Jeffries and Schumer’s list of demanded ICE reforms did not include a ban on facial recognition, but said body-worn cameras should be used “for accountability, not tracking,” and that ICE should be prohibited from “tracking, creating or maintaining databases of individuals participating in First Amendment activities.” Markey separately demanded earlier this week that Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons confirm or deny the existence of a “domestic terrorists” database that lists US citizens who protest Trump’s immigration crackdown.

Immigration agents have used face-scanning technology on people who protest or observe ICE activity. An ICE observer in Minnesota recently said in a court filing that her Global Entry and TSA PreCheck privileges were revoked three days after an incident in which an agent scanned her face.

In another recent incident in Portland, Maine, a masked agent told an observer who was taking video that “we have a nice little database and now you’re considered a domestic terrorist.” A CNN report last week said a memo sent to ICE agents in Minneapolis told them to “capture all images, license plates, identifications, and general information on hotels, agitators, protestors, etc., so we can capture it all in one consolidated form.”</div>

            <h2>Neocities founder stuck in chatbot hell after Bing blocked 1.5 million sites</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/neocities-founder-stuck-in-chatbot-hell-after-bing-blocked-1-5m-sites/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">One of the weirdest corners of the Internet is suddenly hard to find on Bing, after the search engine inexplicably started blocking approximately 1.5 million independent websites hosted on Neocities.

Founded in 2013 to archive the “aesthetic awesomeness” of GeoCities websites, Neocities keeps the spirit of the 1990s Internet alive. It lets users design free websites without relying on standardized templates devoid of personality. For hundreds of thousands of people building websites around art, niche fandoms, and special expertise—or simply seeking a place to get a little weird online—Neocities provides a blank canvas that can be endlessly personalized when compared to a Facebook page. Delighted visitors discovering these sites are more likely to navigate by hovering flashing pointers over a web of spinning GIFs than clicking a hamburger menu or infinitely scrolling.

That’s the style of Internet that Kyle Drake, Neocities’ founder, strives to maintain. So he was surprised when he noticed that Bing was curiously blocking Neocities sites last summer. At first, the issue seemed resolved by contacting Microsoft, but after receiving more recent reports that users were struggling to log in, Drake discovered that another complete block was implemented in January. Even more concerning, he saw that after delisting the front page, Bing had started pointing users to a copycat site where he was alarmed to learn they were providing their login credentials.

Monitoring stats, Drake was stunned to see that Bing traffic had suddenly dropped from about half a million daily visitors to zero. He immediately reported the issue using Bing webmaster tools. Concerned that Bing was not just disrupting traffic but possibly also putting Neocities users at risk if bad actors were gaming search results, he hoped for a prompt resolution.

“This one site that was just a copy of our front page, I didn’t know if it was a phishing attack or what it was, I was just like, ‘whoa, what the heck?’” Drake told Ars.

However, weeks went by as Drake hit wall after wall, submitting nearly a dozen tickets while trying to get past the Bing chatbot to find a support member to fix the issue. Frustrated, he tried other internal channels as well, including offering to buy ads to see if an ads team member could help.

“I tried everything,” Drake said, but nothing worked. Neocities sites remained unlisted on Bing.

Although Bing only holds about 4.5 percent of the global search engine market, Drake said it was “embarrassing” that Neocities sites can’t be discovered using the default Windows search engine. He also noted that many other search engines license Bing data, further compounding the issue.

Ultimately, it’s affecting a lot of people, Drake said, but he suspects that his support tickets are being buried in probably trillions of requests each day from people wanting to improve their Bing indexing.

“There’s probably an actual human being at Bing that actually could fix this,” Drake told Ars, but “when you go to the webmaster tools,” you’re stuck talking to an AI chatbot, and “it’s all kind of automated.”

Ars reached Microsoft for comment, and the company took action to remove some inappropriate blocks.

Within 24 hours, the Neocities front page appeared in search results, but Drake ran tests over the next few days that showed that most subdomains are still being blocked, including popular Neocities sites that should garner high rankings.

Pressed to investigate further, Microsoft confirmed that some Neocities sites were delisted for violating policies designed to keep low-quality sites out of search results.

However, Microsoft would not identify which sites were problematic or directly connect with Neocities to resolve a seemingly significant amount of ongoing site blocks that do not appear to be linked to violations. Instead, Microsoft recommended that Neocities find a way to work directly with Microsoft, despite Ars confirming that Microsoft is currently ignoring an open ticket.

For Drake, “the current state of things is unknown.” It’s hard to tell if popular Neocities sites are still being blocked or if possibly Bing’s reindexing process is slow. Microsoft declined to clarify.

He’s still hoping that Microsoft will eventually resolve all the improper blocks, making it possible for Bing users to use the search engine not just to find businesses or information but also to discover creative people making websites just for fun. With so much AI slop invading social networks and search engines, Drake sees Neocities as “one of the last bastions of human content.”

“I hope we can resolve this amicably for both of us and that this doesn’t happen again in the future,” Drake said. “It’s really important for the future of the small web, and for quality content for web surfers in an increasingly generative AI world, that creative sites made by real humans are able to get a fair shot in search engine results.”

After Drake failed to quietly resolve the issue with Bing, he felt that he had no choice but to alert users to the potential risks from Bing’s delisting.

In a blog post in late January, Drake warned that Bing had “completely blocked” all Neocities subdomains from its search index. Even worse, “Bing was also placing what appeared to be a phishing attack against Neocities on the first page of search results,” Drake said.

“This is not only bad for search results, it’s very possible that it is actively dangerous,” Drake said.

After “several” complaints, Bing eventually deranked the suspected phishing site, Drake confirmed. But Bing “declined to reverse the block or provide a clear, actionable explanation for it,” which leaves Neocities users vulnerable, he said.

Since “it’s easy to get higher pagerank than a blocked site,” Drake warned that “it is possibly only a matter of time before another concerning site appears on Bing searches for Neocities.”

The blog emphasized that Google, the platform’s biggest traffic driver, was not blocking Neocities, nor was any search engine unlinked to Bing data. Urging a boycott that may force a resolution, Drake wrote, “we are recommending that Neocities users, and the broader Internet in general, not use Bing or search engines that source their results from Bing until this issue is resolved.

“If you use Bing or Bing-powered search engines, Neocities sites will not appear in your search results, regardless of content quality, originality, or compliance with webmaster guidelines,” Drake said. “If any Neocities-like sites appear on these results, they may be active phishing attacks against Neocities and should be treated with caution.”

Drake doesn’t want to boycott Bing, but in his blog, he said that Microsoft left him no choice but public disclosure:

“We did not want to write this post. We try very hard to have a good relationship with search engine providers. We would much rather quietly resolve this issue with Bing staff and move on. But after months of attempting to engage constructively through multiple channels, it became clear that silence only harms our users. Especially those who don’t realize their sites are invisible on some search engines.”

Drake told Ars that he thinks most people don’t realize how big Neocities has gotten since its early days reviving GeoCities’ spunk. The platform hosts 1,459,700 websites that have drawn in 13 billion visitors. Over the years, it has been profiled in Wired and The New York Times, and more recently, it has become a popular hub for gaming communities, Polygon reported.

As Neocities grew, Drake told Ars that much of his focus has been on improving content moderation. He works closely with a full-time dedicated content moderation staffer to quickly take down any problematic sites within 24 hours, he said. That effort includes reviewing reports and proactively screening new sites, with Drake noting that “our name domain provider requires us to take them down within 48 hours.”

Microsoft prohibits things like scraping content that could be considered copyright infringement or automatically generating content using “garbage text” to game the rankings. It also monitors for malicious behavior like phishing, as well as for prompt injection attacks on Bing’s large language model.

It’s unclear what kind of violations Microsoft found ahead of instituting the complete block; however, Drake told Ars that he has yet to identify any content that may have triggered it. He said he would promptly remove any websites flagged by Microsoft, if he could only talk to someone who could share that information.

“Naturally, we still don’t catch 100 percent of the sites with proactive moderation, and occasionally some problematic sites do get missed,” Drake said.

Although Drake is curious to learn more about what triggered the blocks, he told Ars that it’s clear that non-violative sites are still invisible on Bing.

One of the longest-running and most popular Neocities sites, Wired Sound for Wired People, is a perfect example. The bizarre, somewhat creepy anime fanpage is “very popular” and “has a lot of links to it all over the web,” Drake said. Yet if you search for its subdomain, “fauux,” the site no longer appears in Bing search results, as of this writing, while Google reliably spits it out as the top result.

Drake said that he still believes that Bing is blocking content by mistake, but Bing’s automated support tools aren’t making it easy to defend creators who are randomly blocked by one of the world’s biggest search engines.

“We have one of the lowest ratios of crap to legitimate content, human-made content, on the Internet,” Drake said. “And it’s really frustrating to see that all these human beings making really cool sites that people want to go to are just not available on the default Windows search engine.”</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/watch-kanzi-the-bonobo-pretend-to-have-a-tea-party/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Little kids hosting make-believe tea parties is a fixture of childhood playtime and long presumed to be exclusively a human ability. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University presented evidence in a new paper published in the journal Science that a bonobo named Kanzi was also able to participate in pretending to hold a tea party. For the authors, this suggests that apes are capable of using their imagination just like human toddlers.

“It really is game-changing that their mental lives go beyond the here and now,” said co-author Christopher Krupenye. “Imagination has long been seen as a critical element of what it is to be human, but the idea that it may not be exclusive to our species is really transformative. Jane Goodall discovered that chimps make tools, and that led to a change in the definition of what it means to be human, and this, too, really invites us to reconsider what makes us special and what mental life is out there among other creatures.”

Per Krupenye et al., by the age of two, human children are able to navigate imaginary scenarios like a tea party, pretending there is real tea present even if the teapot and cups are actually empty. Cognitively speaking, it’s an example of secondary representation, because it involves decoupling an imagined or simulated state (pretending there is actual tea in the cup) with the reality (the cup is empty).

Scientists have long pondered whether other animals, notably primates, also possess such mental capacities. There is some anecdotal evidence for this. For instance, a young chimpanzee was observed dragging imaginary blocks across the floor, just as the chimp did with real wooden blocks. Some female chimps in the wild will carry and play with sticks, treating them as infants—a rudimentary form of playing with a doll. And a 2006 study found that chimps and bonobos that had been exposed to human culture would sometimes perform pretend actions, like holding a bowl to a doll’s mouth to feed it, in response to verbal prompts.

Such studies have nonetheless been met with skepticism when it comes to interpreting the behavior as evidence of animals’ ability to engage in make-believe. For instance, it’s possible the animals are responding to behavioral cues, like the direction of a gaze, to solve such tasks.

Enter Kanzi, a 43-year-old bonobo who lives at the Ape Initiative and is capable of responding to verbal prompts, either by pointing or using a lexigram of more than 300 symbols. There had also been anecdotal observations of Kanzi engaging in pretense. Krupenye et al. conducted three distinct experiments with Kanzi, each involving an 18-trial session.

In the first experiment, a scientist would offer a verbal prompt: “Kanzi, let’s play a game! Let’s find the juice!” They would then place two empty transparent cups on a table and pretend to fill them from an empty transparent pitcher, with another verbal prompt (“Kanzi, look!”). The scientist would pretend to pour the “juice” in one of the cups back into the pitcher, placing the pitcher under the table. Then they asked, “Kanzi, where’s the juice?” and recorded which cup the bonobo pointed to first.

“If Kanzi could only track reality (that both cups were empty), he should have chosen at chance between the two options, whereas if his choices were guided by stimulus enhancement, he should have selected the incorrect cup that had been ‘emptied’ above chance,” the authors wrote. “In contrast, if Kanzi could represent the pretend juice, he should have chosen above chance the cup containing the ‘imaginary’ juice, the empty cup that had not been ‘poured’ back into the pitcher. That is exactly what Kanzi did.” Kanzi selected the correct cup 34 out of 50 times (68 percent).

To rule out the possibility that Kanzi simply believed there was real juice in the empty cups, the team conducted a second experiment following a similar protocol, but with one of the cups containing real juice. Then they asked Kanzi to choose which he wanted. Kanzi chose the cup with real juice nearly 78 percent of the time (14 out of 18 trials), evidence that he could tell the difference between real and pretend juice.

Finally, the team conducted one last experiment in which an experimenter pretended to sample a grape from an empty transparent plastic container before placing the “grape” in one of two transparent jars. After they pretended to empty one of the jars, they asked Kanzi, “Where is the grape?” Kanzi chose correctly nearly 69 percent of the time (31 out of 45 trials).

While Kanzi didn’t score perfectly on the pretend tasks, “It’s extremely striking and very exciting that the data seem to suggest that apes, in their minds, can conceive of things that are not there,” co-author Amalia Bastos, now at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, said. “Kanzi is able to generate an idea of this pretend object and at the same time know it’s not real.” Whether Kanzi’s success can be generalized to other apes without the benefit of his “enculturation” will be the focus of future research.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Bitcoin is crashing hard, reaching historic lows of well below the $70,000 mark. At the time of writing, the token is hovering just above $63,000, levels we haven’t seen since October 2024.

The ongoing plunge has made it far less economical to mine the digital token, a notoriously compute- and energy-intensive process — to the point that large-scale computing companies are starting to unplug their equipment, as Bloomberg reports.

As prices continue to plummet and electricity costs climb, it’s become tough out there for a crypto miner. The hash price index, which is used to determine how much revenue miners can make by mining crypto, reached its lowest point on record this week, according to mining services company Luxor Technology.

According to Coindesk, the average cost to mine one Bitcoin is currently around $87,000 — far higher than its current going rate, making it an extremely unprofitable proposition.

It’s a massive wipeout as investors continue to sell off their reserves, with some comparing it to the time China banned crypto mining in 2021. Crypto enthusiasts are expecting the worst, with some predicting the token will nosedive to just $30,000.

“The decrease is historic, the largest since the China ban,” mining company CleanSpark chief business officer Harry Sudock told Bloomberg, explaining that winter storms raising electricity prices, combined with a recent broader tech selloff, were likely to blame.

Turning off mining hardware during extreme weather conditions or surges in prices isn’t unheard of — but given the crypto’s ongoing demise, a far rarer situation is playing out.

While the extremely volatile cryptocurrency has been put through the wringer on several occasions over the years, the decline comes at a striking moment.

As CNN points out, crypto is hailed as a safe haven by its proponents. Given geopolitical turmoil and plenty of economic uncertainty, crypto’s price should’ve instead skyrocketed — yet precious metals, most notably gold, have fared well while Bitcoin has crashed. The value of an ounce of gold reached an all-time high late last year as investors looked for much safer bets than volatile cryptocurrencies. (Gold prices have since lurched down, but stabilized around a considerably higher price than before the rally.)

The investor Michael Burry, who famously shorted the US housing market before its collapse in 2008, argued in a Substack post this week that further selloffs could lead to a “death spiral” for the broader economy that could be difficult to recover from.

“There is no organic use case reason for Bitcoin to slow or stop its descent,” he wrote.

Even gold could fall victim to the recent downturn as “physical metals may break from the trend on safe haven demand,” Burry speculated, if “tokenized metals futures” were to collapse.

Instead of mining crypto, companies are starting to pivot, according to Bloomberg, allocating their hardware to powering AI models instead of mining crypto.

Whether that will turn out to be a safer bet as investors are starting to get cold feet over AI as well? That remains to be seen.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When a group of crypto bros spent $300,000 commissioning a 15-foot gold statue of Donald Trump, their grift seemed solid enough. Their memecoin, $PATRIOT — for which the Trump sculpture served as a sort of promotional stunt — would soon go to the Moon, covering the costs of the piece and then some.

Shockingly, the exact opposite happened. Despite securing a “juicy, juicy spot” for the statue at the president’s resort, Trump National Doral Miami, $PATRIOT crashed to the ground. Today, the memecoin — which boasted a market cap as high as $77.7 million around Trump’s return to office in January of 2025 — now stands at just $2.8 million, while the toweringeffigy gathers dust in Ohio.

Now, fresh reporting by the New York Times documents the wild ride that turned a group of crypto goons into a national laughing stock.

For a very brief moment prior to Trump’s second inauguration, the coin surged, sustaining millions of dollars in daily trading volume in anticipation of the president’s promise to turn the country into the “crypto capital of the planet.” The backers, a motley crew of libertarian crypto developers and MAGA faithful, successfully drummed up social media frenzy, even gaining approval from former Trump aide Steve Bannon.

Then reality arrived, as it always does seems to when memecoins are involved. Infighting erupted as the token cratered, driven down by the release of Trump’s own scammy memecoin, $TRUMP. The sculptor contracted to build the statue, Alan Cottrill, soon called in a $90,000 debt the crypto bros owed for using his work to market their digital currency.

“You are using my copyrighted image in marketing your token!” Cottrill exclaimed to the contract-holders in a text message viewed by the NYT.

“Yes lol as we planned to from day 1,” rejoined Ashley Sansalone, one of the crypto developers involved.

Until the group pays the final $90,000, Cottrill says he’s under no obligation to release the statue.

“As far as I’m concerned, they haven’t bought the rights to the IP, and they’re using it illegally,” the sculptor told the NYT. “That statue will not leave my foundry until everything they owe me is paid.”

            <h2>Tesla Stock Plummeting Since Musk Busted in Epstein Files</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/future-society/tesla-stock-plummeting-musk-epstein-files">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Late last month, new “Epstein files” from the Department of Justice revealed that Tesla CEO Elon Musk was in regular correspondence with deceased sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein, going as far as to invite himself to his notorious Caribbean island, asking when the “wildest party” would take place in a 2012 email.

It was a damning contradiction of Musk’s previous claims that he’d “refused” Epstein’s offer, and they seemed to throw the billionaire into a tailspin.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Tesla’s shares have been plummeting since the DOJ’s release. Shares are down almost eight percent over the last five days since the emails were released.

It’s the very last thing Tesla needs right now. The company’s brand has already suffered greatly under Musk’s leadership, with droves of potential buyers being pushed away by his inflammatory rhetoric and embrace of far-right ideals.

The company’s core business has also been floundering as of late, with Musk announcing that it’s ending production of its Model S and X vehicles, while turning the factory that used to make them into a robot assembly line. The move was part of a much broader shift away from selling cars and towards the company’s humanoid robots and AI ambitions.

While Tesla’s valuation remains massively inflated — it’s still worth well over $1.5 trillion — the company’s financials tell an ominous story. Tesla reported its first-ever decline in annual revenue for 2025, with sales slumping across three of the past four quarters. It also saw a whopping 61 percent drop in profits in Q4 of last year, compared to the same period the year before.

The competition is making major headway as well, with German automaker Volkswagen officially overtaking Tesla in fully-electric car sales in Europe last year, according to the latest data. Chinese rival BYD is also handily outselling Tesla these days, making major gains across Europe and becoming the world’s top EV seller.

In other words, Musk’s carmaker’s first-mover advantage has long dried up.

By all indications, it feels like Tesla has come to accept its fate. The company hasn’t launched a fully new model since its Cybertruck in late 2023, which turned out to be a massive flop.

“A big driver for the decline is lack of new products,” Cox Automotive director of industry insights Stephanie Valdez Streaty told Bloomberg. “Any automaker that doesn’t have new products is going to lose market share. Tesla needs new products.”

Infamously lacking customer service and extensive quality control issues are also signs of a company that has long lost its place as an early pioneer in the EV space.

Adding to the company’s woes is Musk’s SpaceX acquiring his own AI startup xAI, turning his space company into a $1.25 trillion behemoth and sparking rumors that Tesla may eventually be folded in as well.

The merger may also be indicative of Musk turning his attention elsewhere. As CNBC points out, he now derives more of his enormous net worth from SpaceX than from Tesla, a symbolic turning point as he seemingly grows tired of pretending to care about EV sales. (Musk has promised that Optimus will account for80 percent of the carmaker’s value.)

The mercurial entrepreneur’s appearance in the Epstein files once again underlines the carmaker’s continuous struggles to control the narrative and rein in the drama.

If the company’s history is anything to go by, there’s certainly a chance the company, which remains one of the most valuable by market cap in the world, will weather the storm. But this time, we’re not talking about scaling up production of the Model 3, a major source of suffering for the CEO almost a decade ago — instead, the company is looking to reinvent itself from scratch.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At this point, there’s nothing left to say about Elon Musk that hasn’t been said a thousand times already. Yet his latest comment is so on the nose, we couldn’t resist.

“Whoever said ‘money can’t buy happiness’ really knew what they were talking about,” the world’s richest man mourned on X-formerly-Twitter this week, likely from one of his mansions, or perhaps his private jet.

It’s a pathetic complaint from someone who could end homelessness in multiple cities, fund universal school lunch programs across the US, or bankroll malaria eradication with just a fraction of his wealth.

It also comes just days after another tranche of emails from notorious pedophile Jeffrey Epstein were released to the public. There, it was revealed that Musk had been in extensive contact with Epstein in the years following his 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor. (Musk even went so far as to beg Epstein for an invite to his infamous island in December of 2013, contradicting his earlier assurance that he’d “refused” the offer.)

The revelation is evidently taking its toll on Musk, who began a desperate campaign to clear his name on social media. “If I actually wanted to spend my time partying with young women, it would be trivial for me to do so without the help of a creepy loser like Epstein,” the billionaire raved in one post.

Now that his ties to Epstein are undeniable, Musk evidently thinks he can pity-post his way out of it. So here’s a challenge, Elon: if money really doesn’t buy happiness, set yourself free. Liquidate your hundreds of billions and feed the hungry, house the homeless, and fund the schools.

He won’t, of course — but he could, and that’s what makes this performance so insulting. At least King Midas had the decency to regret his curse.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For over a millennium, measles have ravaged humanity. Physicians as far back as 10th century Persia have been documenting the virus, which killed millions of children well into the 20th century. Finally, in 1963, biochemist John Enders developed the first measles vaccine, a development which virtually eradicated the virus from the US population by the year 2000.

That was then. Now the virus is back, threatening to tear through a Texas immigration detention center with a vengeance — a grim collision of Trump-era vaccine skepticism and brutal immigration enforcement that seems to perfectly encapsulate this moment in US politics.

That’s right: according to the Washington Post, two detainees at the federal immigration family detention center in Dilley, Texas have tested positive for measles.

Both cases were confirmed by the Texas Department of State Health Services on Saturday. In a statement to WaPo, the Department of Homeland Security said officers had quarantined anyone who made contact with the two individuals, and “took steps to limit movement” for everybody else.

“Medical staff is continuing to monitor the detainees’ conditions and will take appropriate and active steps to prevent further infection,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told the newspaper in a statement. “All detainees are being provided with proper medical care.”

Eric Lee, an immigration attorney providing counsel to a family at the facility, told WaPo that detainees were being left in the dark. Not only have DHS personnel not mentioned the positive cases, Lee explained, but they haven’t even started looking into the detainees’ vaccination status.

“They’re not being told anything, and they are not being offered any sort of protective measures,” Lee said of those being forcibly held inside. “And it’s important to point out that this is not just a detention conditions issue — it’s a public health issue generally.”

The attorney was present at the detention facility back in January, when guards abruptly ordered attorneys out following a peaceful protest staged by people in detention.

In an interview with Texas Public Radio after the fact, Lee described the detention camp as a “horrible, horrible place.” The water is “putrid” and undrinkable, he said, and detainees are served meals containing “bugs” and other debris.

“This is not a place that you would want to have your child be for even 15 minutes,” he said.

            <h2>Sam Altman Is Spiraling</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-05</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 2024, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman dismissed the possibility that his company would ever have to stuff ads into its chatbots, painting it as a desperate move he called a “last resort for us as a business model.”

As it turns out, the billionaire may have overestimated how much people were willing to shell out every month to access ChatGPT. Paid subscriber growth has slowed in key markets as OpenAI continues to burn billions of dollars every quarter, further stoking concerns over the company’s potential inability to turn things around before it’s too late.

And as the competition at Anthropic and Google continued to make massive strides in their efforts to catch up, Altman declared an internal “code red,” announcing late last year that ChatGPT was getting ads after all.

OpenAI’s competitors saw the reversal as a golden opportunity to strike. Anthropic released a series of Super Bowl ads this week that openly skewer Altman’s compromise on ads — without ever naming the company outright, cleverly — in a bid to strike a chord with users who aren’t thrilled about an ad-packed chatbot experience.

“Ads are coming to AI.” the ads’ tagline reads. “But not to Claude.”

It’s always a bad sign when someone insists that they’re not mad and actually laughing. So when Altman declared on X that he thinks the ads are “funny” and that he “laughed” — before posting a lengthy screed about how they’re horribly unfair — it was an unintentional masterclass in corporate insecurity.

“But I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest,” he wrote. “Our most important principle for ads says that we won’t do exactly this; we would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them.”

Altman also angrily accused the company of “doublespeak” and using a “deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads that aren’t real.”

The CEO also called users who shell out $20 a month for a Claude subscription “rich people” — a bizarre characterization, especially given his multibillion-dollar net worth.

“We are glad they do that and we are doing that too, but we also feel strongly that we need to bring AI to billions of people who can’t pay for subscriptions,” Altman wrote.

He also accused Anthropic of trying to become an “authoritarian company” that wants to “control what people do with AI,” even though there’s plenty of evidence to suggest that he’s the pot calling the kettle black.

It’s a messy and unusually public blowout that highlights how the AI race, once fought in board rooms behind closed doors and through carefully worded press releases, is entering the public consciousness.

Altman’s frustration perfectly illustrates how AI companies have driven themselves into a corner. Either they can charge a hefty monthly fee to cut their losses and reassure spooked investors that they can, in fact, deliver revenues on their balance sheets — or scare away users through annoying ads, like every generation of new platform before them.

While OpenAI hasn’t yet settled on a way to implement ads for its blockbuster chatbot, an early screenshot the company showed off during its announcement late last year indicates that free-tier users will likely be painfully aware that the company is trying to sell them something. The shown example ad covers a significant chunk — almost half — of the mobile screen.

It remains to be seen how users will react once the ads go live. Will they immediately flock to an ad-free competitor, like Claude or Google’s Gemini, or will they be willing to stick it out to avoid paying more than what they pay for Netflix every month?

The AI race is bound to drag on as companies like OpenAI will continue to desperately convince their customers and investors that their existence — and enormous spending — is justified and that their tech is worth the hassle in the first place. Given the recent tech selloffs and nervousness among investors and diminishing performance gains with each new AI model release, that seems to still be an open question.

In short, Altman may say he was amused by Anthropic’s latest slight, but given his heated rhetoric, the gloves are starting to come off.

“‘I laughed, until I didn’t.&#39;” one Reddit user joked.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">People without coding backgrounds are discovering that they can build their own custom apps using vibe coding — solutions like Lovable that turn plain-language descriptions into working code.

While these prompt-to-code tools can help create nice prototypes, launching them into full-scale production (as this reporter recently discovered) can be tricky without figuring out how to connect the application with external tech services, such as those that can send text messages via SMS, email, and process Stripe payments.

Ilan Zerbib, who spent five years as Shopify’s director of engineering for payments, is building a solution that could eliminate these back-end infrastructure headaches for nontechnical creators.

Last summer, Zerbib launched Sapiom, a San Francisco startup developing the financial layer that allows AI agents to securely purchase and access software, APIs, data, and compute — essentially creating a payment system that lets AI automatically buy the services it needs.

Every time an AI agent connects to an external tool like Twilio for SMS, it requires authentication and a micro-payment. Sapiom’s goal is to make this whole process seamless, letting the AI agent decide what to buy and when without human intervention.

“In the future, apps are going to consume services which require payments. Right now, there’s no easy way for agents to actually access all of that,” said Amit Kumar, a partner at Accel.

Kumar has met with dozens of startups in the AI payments space, but he believes Zerbib’s focus on the financial layer for enterprises, rather than consumers, is what’s truly needed to make AI agents work. That’s why Accel is leading Sapiom’s $15 million seed round, with participation from Okta Ventures, Gradient Ventures, Array Ventures, Menlo Ventures, Anthropic, and Coinbase Ventures.

“If you really think about it, every API call is a payment. Every time you send a text message, it’s a payment. Every time you spin up a server for AWS, it’s a payment,” Kumar told TechCrunch.

While it’s still early days for Sapiom, the startup hopes that its infrastructure solution will be adopted by vibe-coding companies and other companies creating AI agents that will eventually be tasked with doing many things on their own.

For example, anyone who has vibe-coded an app with SMS capabilities won’t have to manually sign up for Twilio, add a credit card, and copy an API key into their code. Instead, Sapiom handles all of that in the background, and the person building the micro-app will be charged for Twilio’s services as a pass-through fee by Lovable, Bolt, or another vibe-coding platform.

While Sapiom is currently focused on B2B solutions, its technology could eventually empower personal AI agents to handle consumer transactions. The expectation is that individuals will one day trust agents to make independent financial decisions, such as ordering an Uber or shopping on Amazon. While that future is exciting, Zerbib believes that AI won’t magically make people buy more things, which is why he’s focusing on creating financial layers for businesses instead.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/reddit-looks-to-ai-search-as-its-next-big-opportunity/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Reddit suggested on Thursday that its AI-powered search engine could be the next big opportunity for its business — not just in terms of product, but also as a revenue driver impacting its bottom line. During the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday, it offered an update on its plans to merge traditional and AI search together and hinted that although search is not yet monetized, “it’s an enormous market and opportunity.”

In particular, the company believes that generative AI search will be “better for most queries.”

“There’s a type of query we’re, I think, particularly good at — I would argue, the best on the internet — which is questions that have no answers, where the answer actually is multiple perspectives from lots of people,” said Reddit CEO Steve Huffman.

Traditional search, meanwhile, is more like navigation — it’s a way to find the right link to a topic or subreddit. But LLMs can be good at this, too, if not better, he said. “So that’s the direction we’re going.”

The exec also noted that weekly active users for search over the past year grew 30% from 60 million users to 80 million users. Meanwhile, the weekly active users for the AI-powered Reddit Answers grew from 1 million in the first quarter of 2025 to 15 million by the fourth quarter.

“We’re seeing a lot of growth there, and I think there’s a lot of potential too,” Huffman added.

Reddit said it’s working to modernize the AI answers interface by making its responses more media-rich, and pilots of this are already underway.

The company is also thinking about how it can position itself when it’s not just a social site, but a place people come for answers. Reddit told investors on the call that it’s doing away with the distinction between logged-in and logged-out users starting in Q3 2026, as it will aim to personalize the site — using AI and machine learning — and make it relevant to whoever shows up.

The company announced in 2025 it was planning to combine its AI search feature, Reddit Answers, with its traditional search engine to improve the experience for end users. In the fourth quarter, Reddit said it had made “significant progress” in unifying its core search and its AI feature. It also released five new languages on Reddit Answers and is piloting dynamic agents along with search results that include “media beyond text.”

Though Reddit sees value in its AI answers, it’s not been keeping that to itself. The company’s content licensing business, which allows other companies to train their AI models on its data, is growing, too. That business revenue is reported as part of Reddit’s “other” revenues (i.e., its non-ad revenue). This “other” revenue increased by 8% year-over-year to reach $36 million in Q4 and was up 22% to reach $140 million for 2025.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amazon Web Services ended 2025 with its strongest quarterly growth rate in more than three years.

The company reported Thursday that its cloud service business recorded $35.6 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2025. This figure marks a 24% year-on-year increase and the business segment’s largest growth rate in 13 quarters. Annual revenue run rate for the business segment is $142 billion, according to Amazon. The cloud service also saw an increase in its operating income from $12.5 billion in the fourth quarter compared to $10.6 billion in the same period in 2024.

“It’s very different having 24% year-over-year growth on $142 billion annualized run rate than to have a higher percentage growth on a meaningfully smaller base, which is the case with our competitors,” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said during the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call. “We continue to add more incremental revenue and capacity than others, and extend our leadership position.”

That fourth-quarter growth was fueled by new agreements with Salesforce, BlackRock, Perplexity, and the U.S. Air Force, among other companies and government entities.

“More of the top 500 U.S. startups use AWS as their primary cloud provider than the next two providers combined,” Jassy said. “We’re adding significant easy to core computing capacity each day.”

AWS also added more than a gigawatt of power to its data center network in the fourth quarter.

Jassy said AWS still sees a fair amount of its business coming from enterprises that want to move infrastructure from on-premise to the cloud. AWS is, of course, also seeing a boost from the AI boom, and Jassy credited AWS’s top-to-bottom AI stack functionality.

“We consistently see customers wanting to run their AI workloads where the rest of their applications and data are,” Jassy said. “We’re also seeing that as customers run large AI workloads on AWS, they’re adding to their core AWS footprint as well.”

AWS made up 16.6% of Amazon’s overall $213.4 billion revenue in the fourth quarter.

AWS’s success wasn’t enough to appease Amazon investors, however. Amazon shares fell 10% in after-hours trading after investors reacted to the company’s plan to boost capital expenditures and missed Wall Street’s expectations on earnings per share.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Sometimes, it can seem like the AI industry is racing to see who can spend the most money on data centers. Whoever builds the most data centers will have the most compute, the thinking goes, and thus be able to build the best AI products, which will guarantee victory in the years to come. There are limits to this way of thinking — traditionally, businesses eventually succeed by making more money and spending less — but it’s proven remarkably persuasive for large tech companies.

If that is the game, Amazon does seem to be winning.

The company announced in its earnings on Thursday that it projects $200 billion in capital expenditures throughout 2026, across “AI, chips, robotics, and low earth orbit satellites.” That’s up from the $131.8 billion in capex in 2025. It’s tempting to attribute the whole capex budget to AI. But unlike most of its competitors, Amazon has a significant physical plant, some of which is being converted for use by expensive robots, so the non-AI expenses aren’t so easy to wave away.

Google is close behind. In its earnings on Wednesday, the company projected between $175 billion and $185 billion in capital expenditures for 2026, up from $91.4 billion the previous year. It’s significantly more than the company spent on fixed assets last year, and significantly more than most of its competitors are spending.

Meta, which reported last week, projected $115 billion to $135 billion in capex spending for 2026, while Oracle (once the poster child for AI infrastructure) projects a measly $50 billion. Microsoft doesn’t have an official projection for 2026 yet, but the most recent quarterly figure was $37.5 billion, which pencils out to roughly $150 billion, assuming it keeps up. It’s a notable increase, and one that has led to investor pressure on CEO Satya Nadella — but it still puts the company in third place.

From within the tech world, the logic here is simple. The revolutionary potential of AI is going to turn high-end compute into the scarce resource of the future, and only companies that control their own supply will survive. But while Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Oracle, and others are frantically prepping for the compute desert of the future, their investors aren’t convinced. Each company saw its stock price plummet as investors balked at the hundreds of billions of dollars being committed, and companies with higher spends tended to drop more.

Crucially, this isn’t just a problem for companies like Meta that haven’t figured out their AI product strategy yet. It’s everyone — even companies like Microsoft and Amazon with a robust cloud business and a straightforward take on how to make money in the AI era. The numbers are simply too high for investor comfort.

Investor sentiment isn’t everything — and in this case, it may not do much to change the industry’s mind. If you believe AI is about to change everything (and the argument is pretty compelling at this point), you’d be a fool to change course just because Wall Street got jumpy. But going forward, Big Tech companies will be under a lot of pressure to downplay how expensive their AI ambitions really are.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/the-washington-post-is-retreating-from-silicon-valley-when-it-matters-most/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">To say we live in a tech-centric society is an understatement.

Software, specifically machine learning and AI, coupled with advanced manufacturing, has delivered technology to street corners, schools, offices, factories, and even farm fields. This tech, much of it created in Silicon Valley, sits on your wrist, is carried in your pocket, is integrated in the movies you watch, and maybe in the music you listen to. And it is certainly the means by which that Amazon package was ordered, sorted, and delivered to your doorstep.

It has turned their founders, executives, and middle managers into king-like figures, whose wealth and political influence mirrors the Gilded Age. Seven of the top 10 richest people in the world can tie their wealth directly to tech. Amazon co-founder, chairman, and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos is third, behind just Meta co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg and serial entrepreneur Elon Musk, according to Forbes, which tracks wealth and the people who have it. Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer round out the list.

Now, in this moment, the Bezos-owned Washington Post has gutted its coverage of them and the tech industry at large as part of a sweeping set of layoffs that affected more than 300 people. The team that includes tech, science, health, and business was cut by more than half — from 80 to 33 people — according to Post tech reporter Drew Harwell. The tech desk alone cut 14 people. Its San Francisco bureau is a shell.

Among those affected include reporters covering Amazon, artificial intelligence, internet culture, and investigations. The newspaper also laid off staff covering the media industry (which had previously reported on Bezos’ ownership over their own paper).

The Post cut its entire sports bureau and nearly annihilated its foreign reporting teams, including its Middle East desk, and reporters and their editors covering Ukraine, Russia, Iran, Turkey, and others. It closed its Books section, decimated coverage of culture and the Washington, D.C., metro area, and laid off all reporters and editors covering race and ethnicity issues nationally.

The coverage of tech isn’t more important than social, economic, and geopolitical issues. But never before have the people exerting outsized influence on the world’s geopolitics and economy also been so directly responsible for stemming the global flow of information about it.

Yet even as the world centers on tech and is tied to the GDP growth — or retreat — of its superpowers, tech’s most powerful executives are asking the public to place their attention elsewhere.

The Post’s executive editor Matt Murray couched the layoffs as a reboot of sorts aimed at reaching readers and eventually profitability, according to the New York Times, which included comments he made to staff.

“If anything, today is about positioning ourselves to become more essential to people’s lives in what is becoming a more crowded, competitive, and complicated media landscape,” he reportedly said during a Zoom meeting with staff.

It’s no secret The Post has lost money and subscribers in recent years, in some cases due to policies crafted or backed by Bezos. For instance, his directive to end presidential endorsements by The Post’s editorial board, axing a drafted piece backing Kamala Harris, reportedly led to “hundreds of thousands” of canceled subscriptions, per the New York Times. It reportedly suffered $100 million in losses in 2024, in part because of the cancellations.

Its web traffic has also declined. Semafor reported that daily visits were down to around 3 million by the middle of 2024, from 22.5 million in January 2021.

The Post cut its staff from 1,000 to under 800 last spring, with CEO Will Lewis calling out the $100 million loss from the previous year.

The layoffs at The Post, of course, don’t exist in a vacuum. The media industry, and not just legacy players, has been plagued by a fragmented audience and changes to Google Search algorithms that have directed readers away from news outlets and toward its own AI-generated answers.

The size, scope, and location of those cuts merit scrutiny, however — particularly considering the shift in media ownership over the past 15 years.

Bezos’ acquisition of the Post in 2013 for $250 million was met with a mix of skepticism and hope from weary journalists who had experienced consolidation, layoffs, and the growing pains of moving from a print-only to digital-dominant media industry.

His acquisition became part of a broader trend at the time in which billionaires, many with backgrounds in tech, snapped up beleaguered media organizations well worn from the previous go public-private equity cycle.

A few years after Bezos bought The Post, Laurene Powell Jobs purchased The Atlantic, Salesforce founder Marc Benioff bought Time Inc., and pharmaceutical executive Patrick Soon-Shiong acquired the Los Angeles Times.

Bezos, like Benioff and Soon-Shiong (who also blocked his paper’s endorsement of Harris), moved closer to Trump after he won the 2024 election. His spaceflight company Blue Origin relies on federal contracts, and Amazon had faced increased scrutiny under previous administrations.

Lewis was reportedly not present to oversee the staff cuts and changes at The Post (Murray told Fox News that the CEO “had a lot of things to tend to today”). Nor was Bezos. As his newspaper prepared to cut one-third of its staff, Bezos spent Monday with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth in Florida, leading him on a tour of Blue Origin’s facilities.

Less than 48 hours later, The Washington Post would lay off the journalist who reported on Blue Origin.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/a16z-vc-wants-founders-to-stop-stressing-over-insane-arr-numbers/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The AI investing boom (or perhaps bubble) is something Silicon Valley has seen many times before: a gold rush of VC money thrown at the Big New Thing. But one aspect of it is completely unique to these times: startups rocketing from $0 to as much as $100 million in annual recurring revenue, sometimes in a matter of months.

Word on the street is that many a VC won’t even look at a startup that’s not on the ARR superhighway, aiming for $100 million in ARR before their Series A funding round.

But Andreessen Horowitz general partner Jennifer Li⁠, who helps oversee many of the firm’s most important AI companies, warns that some of the ARR mania is based on myths.

“Not all ARR is created equal, and not all growth is equal either,” Li said on an episode of TechCrunch’s Equity podcast. She said to be especially skeptical of a founder announcing spectacular ARR numbers or growth in a tweet.

Now, there is a legit, well-recognized term in accounting called annual recurring revenue, which refers to the annualized value of contracted, recurring subscription revenue. Essentially, that’s a guaranteed level of revenue because it comes from customers on a contract.

But what many of these founders are tweeting about is really “revenue run rate” —  taking whatever money was paid in a period of time and annualizing it. That’s not the same.

“There’s a lot of missing nuances of the business quality, retention, and durability that’s missing in that conversation,” Li warned.

A founder may have just had a killer month of sales, but not every month will necessarily repeat it. Or a startup may have a lot of short-term customers doing pilot programs, so revenue isn’t guaranteed to stick around after the pilot period.

Normally, such boasts about growth via tweets should be treated for what they are — that is, don’t take everything you read on the internet at face value.

But because fast growth is a hallmark of AI startups, such claims are “introducing a lot of anxiety” to inexperienced founders who are now asking how they can also instantly go from zero to $100 million, she said.

Li’s answer: “You don’t. Sure, it’s a great aspiration, but you don’t have to build a business that way, to only optimize for the top-line growth.”

She said a better way to think of it is this: how to grow sustainably, where once customers sign up, they stick around and expand their spend with your company. This can lead to “growing 5x or 10x year-over-year,” said Li, meaning growth from $1 million to between $5 million and $10 million in year one, to between $25 million and $50 million in year two, and so on.

Li pointed out that this is still “unheard of” levels of growth. If it’s coupled with happy customers — that is, high retention rates — those startups will find investors willing to back them.

Of course, some of the portfolio companies in Li’s a16z group (the infrastructure team) have hit those kinds of racing ARR numbers: Cursor, ElevenLabs, and Fal.ai. But that growth is tied to “durable businesses,” said Li, adding, “There’s real reasons behind each of them.”

Li also said that kind of growth comes with its own set of operational problems like hiring.

“How do we hire, not fast, but the right people who can really jump into this type of speed and culture,” she said. And the answer is: not easily.

That means those first 100 people wear a lot of hats and missteps are bound to happen. Last year, Cursor, for instance, angered its customer base with a poorly rolled out pricing change.

Li pointed out that other fast-growth startups deal with legal and compliance issues before they have systems in place to, or face new AI-age issues like countering deepfakes.

So while lightning-fast growth can be a good problem to have, it’s also a little bit of “be careful what you wish for.”

            <div id="article-text">This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

The CIA World Factbook occupies a special place in the memories of elder Millennials like me. It was an enormous compendium of essential facts about every country around the world, carefully collected from across the federal government. This felt especially precious when the World Factbook went online in 1997 (it had previously been a classified internal publication printed on paper, then a declassified print resource), a time when the internet still felt new and unsettled. Unlike many other pages on the World Wide Web, it was reliable enough that you could even get away with citing it in schoolwork. And there was a special thrill in the idea that the CIA, a famously secretive organization, was the one providing it to you.

Memories are now the only place the World Factbook resides. In a post online yesterday, the agency noted that the site “has sunset,” though it provided no explanation for why. (The agency did not immediately reply to my inquiry about why, nor has it replied to other outlets.) The Associated Press noted that the move “follows a vow from Director John Ratcliffe to end programs that don’t advance the agency’s core missions.”

The demise of the World Factbook is part of a broad war on information being waged by the Trump administration. This is different from the administration’s assault on truth, in which the president and the White House lie prolifically or deny reality. This is something more fundamental: It’s a series of steps that by design or in effect block access to data, and in doing so erode the concept of a shared frame for all Americans. “Though the World Factbook is gone, in the spirit of its global reach and legacy, we hope you will stay curious about the world and find ways to explore it … in person or virtually,” the CIA wrote in the valedictory post. Left unsaid: You’re on your own to figure it out now.

If the World Factbook was indeed shut down because it didn’t meet Ratcliffe’s standard for core CIA functions, that reflects the Trump administration’s impoverished view of the government’s role. The World Factbook was a public service that helped Americans and others around the globe be informed, created a positive association with a shadowy agency, and spread U.S. soft power by providing a useful service free to all. I’ve been unable to determine how much it cost the government to maintain, but there’s no reason to think it would be substantive.

At least the raw information the World Factbook collected is available elsewhere (and the current version of the Factbook is available on the Internet Archive). The same is not true of some of the other casualties in the war on information, which have fallen victim to both ideology and incompetence. The executive branch has removed data from its websites, such as those of the CDC, the Census Bureau, and other departments, or removed the webpages that hosted them. Almost 3,400 data sets were removed from Data.gov in the first month of Trump’s term alone. At the start of the second Trump administration, some nongovernmental bodies worked to preserve government data by scraping information from existing sources. That’s valuable as far as it goes, but it doesn’t help with future data—or data that never get collected in the first place.

As the University of Michigan law professors Samuel R. Bagenstos and Ellen D. Katz write in a new paper, “The Trump Administration has scrapped existing obligations to collect and report racial, ethnic and gender-based data involving law enforcement, education, federal contracts, public health, environmental justice, and social research.” In some cases, the administration has simply stopped collecting information. In others, it has significantly changed what data it collects, especially information related to gender identity and race, because of executive orders from the president.

These shifts may sound abstract, but changes in federal data-collecting can have direct impacts on people’s lives and livelihoods. As NOTUS reported this week, data erasure means it’s harder to disseminate word about opioid drugs, feed hungry Americans, assess U.S. schools, and understand changes in prices. After the CDC’s entire Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System staff was placed on administrative leave in April, maternal-mortality data weren’t collected for months. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, whose commissioner Trump fired last summer, did not report monthly jobs data for October, because of the fall government shutdown—the first time in 77 years that an unemployment rate was not released.

The war on information is perhaps even more dangerous than the war on truth. When people can see evidence that obviously contradicts what the administration is saying, they’re primed to disbelieve the officials. (Case in point: A new Quinnipiac poll finds that only 22 percent of people believe that Alex Pretti’s shooting was justified.) But democracy requires voters having access to accurate and shared information so that they can assess the claims that the government makes. This is what the Trump administration is undermining. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan famously said that everyone was entitled to their own opinion but not their own facts. Now it’s not clear that anyone is entitled to any facts at all.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

The New England Patriots coach Mike Vrabel leads from his ventricles—not from shallow-chested sentiment but from the pump action of his brawny heart, out of which blood occasionally makes its way to spurt from a split lip after a head bump from one of his players. During the team’s playoff run, the defensive tackle Milton Williams gave Vrabel a celebratory helmet to the mouth. “I forgot Vrabes ain’t got no helmet on,” Williams said, to which Vrabel, a former linebacking great, replied, “I’ve been hit harder than that.”

Watch. The show Fallout (out now on Amazon Prime) blows up all expectations about a quintessential American genre, Shirley Li writes.

In Tuesday’s edition of this newsletter, I wrote about how President Trump was ramping up his attacks on the integrity of the midterm elections. I cited the attorney Bob Bauer’s concern that Trump might use ICE to interfere with polling locations. After we’d sent the newsletter, I saw a clip of Steve Bannon saying, “We’re going to have ICE surround the polls come November.” You don’t need to take his statement literally—ICE has about 22,000 agents, and the country has had some 100,000 polling places in recent cycles—but this comment from an influential MAGA voice is another reason to take the threats to fair elections seriously.

            <div id="article-text">CONFIDENTIAL: To a billionaire trying to determine what to do with $250 million in 2013,

That kind of pocket change can buy you a newspaper. And not just any newspaper, but a world-class paper with a wall full of Pulitzers (I remember emerging from the elevator and marveling at it as a summer intern) and decades of experience holding power to account.

Alternatively, $250 million can buy half a superyacht. A yacht is a very big boat.

That newspaper employs hundreds of journalists. These journalists work very hard to find out what is actually happening and then to tell people. This involves a lot of late nights eating pizza in the office and long days calling people who will not answer and showing up in inconvenient places at inconvenient times to get people on the record and to get the story right. Is newspaper work glamorous? Put it this way: Spotlight was a Hollywood movie made exclusively to show off how heroic newspaper journalism is, and The New York Times ran an interview with the costume designer to find out how she managed to make the cast look so authentically unfashionable and rumpled. (“The hardest thing is making bad clothes work on really famous people, who look gorgeous in everything they wear,” the costumer explained.)

Newspapers have multiple deks too (that’s some technical headline humor for you; the dek is the little subtitle under the headline that explains the headline you just read). They also have ledes (the start of a story) and are made by people filing (turning in their stories). I remember that when I first got hired at a newspaper, I kept telling people I couldn’t hang out, because I “had to file,” and my friends thought I had suddenly become obsessed with personal organization.

A yacht will never turn a profit, and it would be confusing to expect it to. But you know that your net worth is such that if the yacht never supports itself, you will still be proud to call yourself the yacht’s owner and will not suddenly say, “Well, perhaps if we just pivoted part of the yacht sharply to the right and knocked dozens of people off, the yacht would suddenly become self-sustaining.”

A newspaper can certainly turn a profit. One way for a newspaper to make a profit is if you keep its subscribers from canceling their subscriptions en masse.

If your yacht fails to endorse a candidate for president in an existential election, people will say, “Good. A boat should not endorse candidates for president.”

A newspaper is a public service. If it does its job, people will have better information and better lives—difficult to quantify in monetary terms, but for a long time, we used to think that making people’s lives better was important and valuable. Andrew Carnegie did not demand to see exponential growth from his libraries.

You can give your yacht whatever name you want! Sunk-Cost Fallacy, Ship O’ Theseus, Redacted, Democracy Dies in Darkness.

A newspaper can take down a president—and has, in fact. (Of course, that requires guts from its owner. But you have guts, don’t you?)

A yacht is a good place for a foam party!

A newspaper is a guardian of the First Amendment. Thomas Jefferson said that “were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.”

Your yacht will never find out anything damning about your business. Your yacht will never find out anything troubling about the current administration. Your yacht will never report the names of slain children and abuses of government power and give a voice to grief and to silliness alike.

If the captain you have put in charge of your yacht keeps yelling that the yacht needs to be more nimble and take on 200 million more people, and you discover that instead of making the yacht more nimble, he has just punctured an enormous hole in the hull, causing water to rush in, this won’t leave hundreds of world-class journalists without jobs.

Nobody will keep filing from a war zone even with the looming threat of layoffs because they believe in the yacht so much. Nobody believes in the yacht at all.

If the yacht starts to sink, the captain will have to tell everyone on board in person.

If you have a midlife crisis and buy a yacht and then later stop caring as much about the yacht and want to go to space instead, you can simply dock the yacht and ignore it forever and an entire city will not immediately suffer as a result. When a newspaper is felled by careless or malicious owners, millions of people are hurt, in big ways and small ways and ways that are impossible to measure. That includes the journalists directly affected, of course, and then all of the people whose stories won’t get told, and then all of the readers whose mornings will be made just a little bit worse by the absence of their favorite comics or their favorite columns, all of the people who won’t know as much about their country or their neighbors—the restaurants they could visit, the shows they could see, the television they should avoid at all costs. This will leave big holes and little holes and invisible holes.

Think carefully before you buy. Do you really want to own a newspaper? Do you really have what it takes? Or do you just want to own another yacht? Please be honest with yourself, or we’re all going to be worse off.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nothing makes Americans want to gamble like the Super Bowl. Every year, the game is reliably the biggest day for sports betting: On platforms such as FanDuel and DraftKings, people are already putting money down on which team will win the opening coin toss, how long the national anthem will be, and what color of Gatorade will be used to douse the winning head coach.

Gambling on sports has become practically inescapable. Nearly half of American men ages 18 to 49 maintain an active online sports-betting account, and Vegas odds have invaded telecasts and talk shows. During NFL games, sportsbook commercials now outnumber beer ads. Despite all of that, more than a third of adults still cannot legally gamble from home: Online sports betting remains banned in 18 states, including California and Texas.

But for the past year, thanks to a loophole, Americans have effectively been able to bet on sports no matter where they live. All they have to do is turn to prediction markets. Platforms such as Kalshi let people wager on lots of things: Who will win the Oscar for Best Actor? How much snow will New York City get this month? Prediction markets say that they are more akin to the stock market than gambling. Rather than betting on odds set by bookmakers, users trade contracts that pay out according to the outcome of a given event. This distinction may not mean much for someone betting on the Seahawks over the Patriots, but it does allow prediction markets to operate even in places where sports betting is illegal.

Now America is about to find out what it really looks like when sports betting takes over. Kalshi, one of the country’s biggest prediction markets, launched its sport-betting operation just two weeks before the 2025 Super Bowl. This year, Kalshi has already seen more than $167 million in bets on the game, and that number could conceivably crack $1 billion, Dustin Gouker, a gambling-industry analyst, told me. Some of the biggest traditional sportsbooks and fantasy-sports sites, recognizing a work-around to enter states where gambling remains illegal, are seizing the opportunity: Since September, FanDuel, DraftKings, Fanatics, PrizePicks, and Underdog have all launched their own prediction-market offerings.

In one sense, prediction markets are about a whole lot more than sports. Both Kalshi and its biggest rival, Polymarket, have turned prediction markets into big business by letting people wager on seemingly everything. As Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour put it in October, the company’s goal is to “financialize everything”—to let people bet on the outcome of virtually any event. By encouraging people to put their money where their mouth is, the thinking goes, prediction markets can forecast how the future will play out. Even if you’ve never placed a bet yourself, prediction markets’ odds about news and entertainment—not sports—are especially in your face. Both CNN and CNBC recently announced partnerships with Kalshi to incorporate the site’s predictions into their news coverage; last month, the Golden Globes displayed Polymarket’s odds throughout its broadcast.

Read: America is slow-walking into a Polymarket disaster

Kalshi may let you bet on topics as wide-ranging as whether Iran’s supreme leader will stay in power and who will win the next season of Survivor, but sports account for more than 90 percent of all trading volume on the site. From mid-December to mid-January, wagers on college basketball alone exceeded trading on everything other than sports. The single biggest non-sports market during this stretch—about whom President Trump would nominate as chair of the Federal Reserve—drew less activity than Italian soccer. In an email, Jack Such, a Kalshi spokesperson, told me that the categories that dominate the platform fluctuate based on what’s in the news. “During the NFL season, we are heavily tilted towards sports,” he wrote. “During the 2024 election season, we were heavily tilted towards politics. It all depends on what events are top of mind for the public.” Even though politics was big on Kalshi during the most recent presidential election, that was before the site offered sports betting.

Sports make up a smaller proportion of wagers on Polymarket, which has also yet to fully launch in the United States (although some Americans likely still access it by using virtual private networks). “At this moment in time, the use case of prediction markets, at least in the United States, appears to be the expansion of sports betting,” Gouker said. “It’s hard to come to another conclusion.”

This covert expansion of sports betting is controversial. Several states are suing Kalshi for operating an unlicensed sports-betting platform, which they argue deprives them of tax dollars. But late last month, Michael Selig, the newly appointed head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the federal agency that regulates prediction markets, indicated that he intends to help grow the prediction-market industry. All of which suggests that, in the immediate term at least, prediction markets are likely to make sports betting an even more pervasive part of American life—potentially leading to devastating consequences. Research suggests that avid sports bettors are at risk of depleting their household savings, declaring bankruptcy, and even committing intimate-partner violence.

Not all prediction markets, for their part, are likely to be content with staying de facto sports-betting sites. After all, Kalshi and Polymarket want to harness the wisdom of crowds to forecast all kinds of real-world events, not just sports outcomes. Despite Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan’s recent proclamation that prediction markets are “the most accurate thing we have as mankind right now,” these platforms have much to prove on that front. When most bets are on sports, it’s especially hard to see what value prediction markets add. The kind of information gained by thousands of bettors laying down four-legged parlays on a Tuesday-night NBA game does not have the same utility as a more accurate hurricane forecast or election prediction. Not all knowledge, in other words, is created equal.

Perhaps prediction markets are hoping that once sports betting gets users in the door, they’ll engage with the many other markets on offer. “I think they’ve really thought that sports would just be an entry point, and then everything else would start growing,” Gouker said. But that Kalshi will be able to interest its droves of sports bettors in other markets is by no means guaranteed. In fact, it seems at least equally plausible that people might just prefer betting on the Super Bowl to betting on whether the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates. “People who are making forecasts on political and social and scientific outcomes are possibly different from people who are betting on sporting events,” John Phillips, the CEO of Aristotle, the company that runs the prediction market PredictIt, told me. “There are some commonalities there, but I think it’s a different type of activity and it attracts a different type of trader.”

If the goal of Kalshi and other prediction markets is to create something with genuine financial utility and predictive power, that’s a big problem. But this won’t prevent them from making a boatload of money along the way.</div>

In July 2017, as the U.S. was racked by revelations that Russia had interfered in its presidential election, a group of envoys from both countries quietly brokered a peace accord in New York. They met at Lincoln Center. There, Moscow’s Bolshoi Ballet joined the New York City Ballet and the Paris Opera Ballet to perform Jewels, a landmark work by the American company’s Russian-born co-founder, George Balanchine. At the end of the performance, the dancers gathered onstage and took their bows—united, it seemed, by a shared commitment to virtuosity in ballet, and by their entangled roots.

This was the last time that the Bolshoi Ballet visited America. The company—which is largely sponsored by Vladimir Putin’s regime—may never again tour here, or in any Western country. Shortly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, theaters in London and Madrid canceled the Bolshoi’s scheduled performances. In 2024, dancers from another top Russian company were barred from a gala in New York City. Among the many costs exacted by Russia’s brutal war on Ukraine is the loss of a long-running cultural exchange; American and Russian ballet have always been in conversation with each other, even as they diverged aesthetically and faced political tensions behind the scenes.

In June 1960, an emissary from the Soviet ballet world argued in The Atlantic that dance could still flourish behind the Iron Curtain. The dance critic Yuri Slonimsky was writing for a special issue of this magazine featuring only Soviet authors. The aim, according to the then–editor in chief, Edward Weeks, was to offer a window into the “lively arts of a talented people” working under the yoke of the Communist Party. Slonimsky had been a close friend and artistic collaborator of Balanchine’s in 1920s Saint Petersburg, just after the Russian Revolution. Decades later, in New York City, Balanchine was being heralded as ballet’s great modernizer, having pioneered a form of dance that broke with Russian conventions—narrative-driven pieces; regimented, symmetrical movement—and better reflected the iconoclasm of a fast-changing modern world.

Slonimsky seemed to be addressing his old friend as he insisted that Soviet ballet also sought to meet the present, and that it was thriving in much the same way American ballet was, even with constraints. The Soviets were making ballet accessible, he wrote, by developing a large network of schools and theaters; they were nurturing versatile artists capable of asserting “human thoughts and feelings” and keeping their eyes “open wide to the surrounding world.”

Slonimsky would have heard about the recent box-office triumph of Balanchine’s Agon, a visionary work of radical abstraction that some likened to Picasso’s Guernica. Soviet ballets, by contrast, took up well-known stories from folklore or classic literature that party commissars had sanitized of any supposedly anti-Communist messaging. And yet, as Slonimsky pointed out, top Soviet dancers such as Rudolf Nureyev—who would seek asylum in France in 1961—strove to interpret “even the deepest past in a new way,” enhancing their limited repertoires with “modern techniques” (requiring more risk-taking and expressiveness) already familiar to American dancers.

At the same time, Balanchine and his peers understood that modern American dance was wholly indebted to Russian artists, whose innovations had established key principles and standards. In 1962, Agnes de Mille—best known for choreographing the musical Oklahoma!—offered Atlantic readers a guide to “creating a dance,” in which she encouraged fledgling choreographers to study the oeuvre of Marius Petipa, who had ushered in a golden age of Russian ballet in the 19th century. “Observe what Petipa does with just four steps in any of his solo variations,” de Mille wrote, referring to Petipa’s deceptively simple and rigorously plotted choreography, with its neat internal logic. Such precision in movement “is hard to learn,” but “it is, in fact, the essence of the business.” For de Mille, no less than for Balanchine, experimentation involved first mastering the fundamentals before moving past them to “taste the power of making something meaningful where nothing was before.”

Years later, a young American choreographer would heed de Mille’s advice, to spectacular effect. Twyla Tharp’s ballet Push Comes to Shove, which premiered in 1976, startled and delighted audiences with its coy, self-referential humor, and its flirtation with popular dance styles such as jazz and tango. But what held the work together was its basis in the “familiar courtly universe of classical ballet,” the critic Dale Harris wrote in a review for The Atlantic. With this foundation firmly in place, Tharp was free to improvise; Harris observed how her approach lent itself to “daring, idiosyncratic” dances with “an instant accessibility that makes the public accept as familiar what is, in fact, remarkably novel.” And at the heart of Push Comes to Shove was the phenom Mikhail Baryshnikov, who had defected from the Soviet Union in 1974, and whose technical prowess and singular flair made him a fitting symbol of this negotiation between tradition and modernity, old world and new.

Today, only a few prominent dancers in Russia have left in protest of the war in Ukraine; most have remained in the country, where creative opportunities have dwindled. Notable choreographers have refused to work with Kremlin-funded companies, and artists who question the war, or defy the precepts of Putinism, have been subject to censorship. A new iron curtain now separates American dance and Russian dance, bringing an abrupt end to a rich dialogue that spanned centuries. Swan Lake and The Nutcracker, two crown jewels in the American repertoire, would not exist without Petipa’s original stagings; meanwhile, Russian ballet was bolstered by American influence, becoming more technically adventurous and less self-contained.

Dance is no longer the robust industry it was in the time of Balanchine, de Mille, and Tharp, when government support for the arts was plentiful and theater-going more customary. But in its heyday, Russian and American dancers borrowed freely from one another to produce vital, distinctive art: the masterpieces we still revere today, and probably always will.</div>

Every year since 2003, the umbrella organization for quizzing outfits around the globe has put on the granddaddy of knowledge competitions. Nothing in the tiny, nerdy world of trivia confers more authority than winning the World Quizzing Championships.

Competitors must attempt to answer 240 questions, such as the following, from 2022: “Playing for Bangalore against Pune in the IPL in April 2013, who set a new record for the fastest century in professional cricket by reaching 100 off 30 balls?”

If it makes you feel better, the median number of correct answers the year of that test was 64. Then again, the following was a question in that championship too: “What is the seven-letter name of the signature burger that can be ordered in every Burger King?”

The next contest is this summer, but in the meantime, you have a few whoppers waiting for you in this week’s Atlantic Trivia. Consider them training.

And by the way, did you know that the video clips in the opening credits of The Office were filmed by John Krasinski—Jim Halpert on the series—who made a preshow pilgrimage to its setting of Scranton, Pennsylvania? He captured the footage with a camera stuck out of a sunroof as he drove around the city.

A tour de Scranton would look different today. There’s now the Office museum exhibit, the Office-branded industrial tower, the Office mural, the other Office mural …

How did you do? Come back tomorrow for more questions, and if you think up a great question after reading an Atlantic story—or simply want to share a fact—send it my way at [email protected].

And by the way, did you know that President George Washington gave the country’s shortest-ever inaugural address? His speech upon reelection was only 135 words, which takes about 45 seconds to deliver, at least by my rate of speech.

In contrast, President William Henry Harrison’s was 8,445 words. I did not try that one, because I have places to be (and, to be fair, when he tried it, he got pneumonia and died a month later).

And by the way, did you know that the world’s oldest continuous art tradition is the rock painting of Australia’s Aboriginal people? The earliest artworks discovered on the island are estimated to be 30,000 years or older, and many Aboriginal artists still paint on rock walls.

In fact, it wasn’t until the 1970s that Aboriginal art began to be captured on anything more portable than stone or more durable than sand. The art on canvas is beautiful—but it will take quite the preservationist to keep it looking good in 42,206 C.E.

And by the way, did you know that since going up in the late 1880s, the Eiffel Tower has been painted more than half a dozen different colors? The structure was “Venetian red” at its construction and over the years has been brown, “yellow-brown,” “brownish-red,” and “reddish brown,” according to the monument’s official website.

All right, so not that different on the colors. However, each hue is really three shades apiece; the bottom third of the tower is painted darker than the middle third, and the middle darker than the top so that the paint job looks uniform against the gradient of the blue(ish) sky.</div>

            <h2>Democrats Mess With Winning in Texas</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/democrats-texas-senate-talarico-crockett/685895/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Do Texas Democrats want to win statewide elections? I’m sure they’d prefer it to losing them. But the question is whether they actually care enough about winning to take the necessary steps—or even whether winning elections ranks among their top, say, five priorities.

The state is holding a Senate election in November that is, or could be, a pivot point in the chamber’s control. Yet Texas Democrats have lost every statewide election since 1994.

During the Obama era, Democrats pointed hopefully to the state’s growing Latino population as a source of strength that would propel them inevitably back into majority status. This expectation of an emerging majority may have paradoxically caused the party to avoid making any accommodations to the state’s conservative-leaning electorate—why compromise their values to win when they could just ride the demographic wave?

In recent years, these hopes have faded. Latino voters swung rightward in 2024. They turned out to have more moderate views on issues, especially immigration, than do the progressive activists who influence Democratic positions. But once again, Texas looks winnable. Over the past year, Donald Trump has driven away the voters he gained. Every ingredient is in place for Texas to swing back, and potentially give Democrats a Senate majority, except one: the Texas Democratic Party.

The party’s latest and most egregious circular-firing-squad behavior transpired earlier this week, when the Democrat Colin Allred, who’d previously dropped out of the Senate race, endorsed Jasmine Crockett, one of the two remaining major competitors. He gave his reason for doing so in a video he posted to social media on Monday. “I understand that James Talarico had the temerity and the audacity to say to a Black woman that he had signed up to run against a mediocre Black man, meaning me, not a formidable, intelligent Black woman, meaning Jasmine Crockett.”

Allred didn’t hear Talarico’s statement directly, which is why he had to say “I understand” that Talarico said it. Allred’s apparent source was a TikTok post by the activist and influencer Morgan Thompson, who said that Talarico had uttered the offensive remark in a private conversation.

Talarico denies having said it. “In my praise of Congresswoman Crockett, I described Congressman Allred’s method of campaigning as mediocre—but his life and service are not,” he wrote in a statement. “I would never attack him on the basis of race.”

Talarico would obviously have a motive to deny making an offensive comment in private. Thompson, however, has a motive as a Crockett supporter to paint her opponent in an unflattering light. She also appears to have an expansive definition of what constitutes an offensive statement. In the same TikTok video, Thompson complained that Talarico described Crockett’s political strategy as involving “attack ads.” As she explains, “Using this language when you have the privilege of being a white man, when people across the political spectrum are also using the ‘angry Black woman that’s aggressive’ trope to attack her, is microaggressive.”

Allred did not have to record and share his response to Talarico, nor was he required to take the allegation at face value. He chose the most inflammatory response. “We’re tired of folks using praise for Black women to mask criticism for Black men,” he said, describing Talarico’s comment as “taking off the mask, telling us who you really are and what you really think.”

Everything about this episode reveals levels of pathological incompetence. Crockett and her supporters are prying open fissures that will scar whichever candidate emerges. They are expressing themselves in social-justice jargon that might be effective in a student-council race at Wesleyan but sounds completely alien to most Texans.

More grim than this particular episode for the Democrats’ electoral prospects in Texas is that, over the past decade, candidates have not typically even tried to appeal to a majority of the state’s voters, because the incentives run in the other direction. Candidates can easily mobilize donors and activists across the country if they go viral on social media. Democrats do this not by highlighting local issues, nor by distancing themselves from the unpopular national party, but by inspiring people who either fervently support the party or wish it were even more progressive.

And when these candidates fail to win office, their fealty to party doctrine brings its own rewards. Texas Democrats have routinely raised massive sums, turned themselves into national political celebrities, lost, and then gone on to work in the progressive movement. Wendy Davis is the archetype: She ran for governor in 2014 in a campaign emphasizing abortion rights; she was featured in a New York Times Magazine cover story; and she lost by 20 points. She went on to found a nonprofit and now works as a political-fundraising consultant.

Beto O’Rourke ran a close but losing race for Senate in 2018. Then, two years later, he ran for president, a campaign in which he adopted uncompromising progressive stances such as confiscating assault weapons. In 2022, O’Rourke ran for governor and lost by double digits. He currently heads a nonprofit organization called Powered by People.

Julián Castro, the former San Antonio mayor who served as housing and urban development secretary in the Obama administration, was once considered a promising future Democratic talent in Texas. Instead, he ran for president in 2020, during which he endorsed Medicare for All and a pullback of border enforcement. He is now the CEO of a nonprofit group dedicated to empowering Latinos.

This year, the party has another chance to try something other than nominating a conventional liberal who loses and then gets to run an NGO. The Trump administration has created a national backlash at least as large as the one in 2018, when O’Rourke came within a few points of victory. Latino voters have turned especially hard against the administration’s indiscriminate mass-deportation policy.

The task has a unique urgency. Federal courts represent the last major impediment to Trump’s authoritarian consolidation, and the Senate is the gateway to controlling those courts. Should Republicans hold the upper chamber, they will have two more years to fill the judiciary—including the Supreme Court—with pro-MAGA jurists. Democrats can stop them if they retake the Senate, but this requires winning deep-red states, of which Texas is among the most promising.

At least in theory, anyway. The closest thing Democrats have to a viable nominee looks to be Talarico, a 36-year-old state representative and former minister who rocketed to prominence last summer when he impressed the podcaster Joe Rogan with his invocation of religious themes. On policy, Talarico has positioned himself as a conventional Democrat, and his efforts to expand his appeal beyond the base consist mostly of biography and messaging style.

But Talarico’s half-hearted gestures to winning are about 50 percentage points more heart than his opponent has put into the enterprise. Crockett, a representative from a deep-blue district that includes much of Dallas, has attained fame with snappy put-downs of Republicans, many of which have gone viral on social media. Crockett once described Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who uses a  wheelchair, as “Governor Hot Wheels”; dismissed complaints about DEI as the laments of “mediocre white boys”; and said Latinos who voted for Trump have “almost like a slave mentality.”

Crockett was lured into the race by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, NOTUS reported in December. The GOP Senate arm conducted a series of polls showing Crockett, who had amassed high name recognition and Democratic enthusiasm, performing strongly in a hypothetical race. Crockett has said the polls, and others that confirmed their findings, helped encourage her to jump into the race, to the delight of Republicans.

Crocket has suggested that she can help drive turnout of infrequent voters. The belief that there is a hidden reservoir of left-wing voters who will bother to show up at the polls only if a sufficiently progressive candidate activates their interest is a decades-old myth. In reality, nonvoters have views that are less ideologically coherent than those of regular voters—which is to say, they think more like swing voters than base voters.

Last month, Crockett told The Washington Post that she doesn’t believe in what she called the “mythical Republican crossover,” and framed her campaign as more of a fun journey than a laser-focused attempt to flip a Senate seat. “My theory of the case is this: If you believe we’re going to lose anyway, then what difference does it make if it’s me or anybody else?” Crockett said. “If you think it’s a losing cause, then who cares? But at least you could say we tried something new and we learned something from this experience.”

Even in a state party that has conditioned itself to the notion that winning an election is less important than the friends and donors you make along the way, that is a shocking confession.

You might suppose that Democrats would recoil from a candidate who broadcasts indifference, at best, to winning over the votes you need to form a majority in a state Trump won by 14 points in 2024. Yet Crockett has continued to attract endorsements, including from Allred, once seen as a relatively moderate candidate, and who ran five points ahead of Kamala Harris in 2024.

Rather than allay the concerns about her electability, Crockett has treated them as illegitimate and even racist. “I really do think that the host said the quiet part out loud, which basically was: If a white man couldn’t do it, then why would a Black woman even have the audacity to think that she could?” Crockett told the Post. “We’ve tried, I don’t know however many white men, and they’ve all lost. The only thing we know for sure is that a white man can lose.”

Crockett’s supporters have made the charge she is floating more explicit. “When they talk about electability, it’s dog whistles, and it’s allusions to speaking about her race, speaking about her being a woman,” Shea Jordan Smith, a Crockett supporter and Democratic political strategist, recently told The New York Times. “They want to call her ghetto and Black and trash so bad, but they don’t say that.”

The comedians Matt Rogers and Bowen Yang breezily observed on a podcast last month that donating to Crockett is a waste of money. A procession of comments proceeded to label them racist. One TikTok post called the remark “structurally violent,” because the pair were telling “Black people, or people in general, not to financially support a Black woman who is running for office.” It received more than 250,000 likes. Yang and Rogers issued obsequious apologies, and Rogers promised to “be better.”

But electability is neither a code word for, nor tantamount to, white-male-ness. Female candidates do not generally face an electoral penalty. Black candidates who meet the electorate where it is on messaging and policy can win swing voters. Barack Obama won millions of voters who later flipped to Donald Trump.

One fatal flaw of progressive identity norms, which treat women and people of color as experts on racism and sexism whose charges of bias cannot be refuted, is that they insulate bad arguments from scrutiny. The belief that swing voters in Texas are too racist and sexist to be compromised with implies that defeat is the only morally acceptable option.

Allred seems to have flung his wild charges at Talarico in genuine anger. But you cannot say that Allred acted stupidly. He is running in a contested primary for a House seat in an overwhelmingly Democratic district, so he probably made his political future more rather than less secure. And if he eventually loses his seat—always a risk in a state that Republicans control and gerrymander at will—what more promising candidate could there be to run a shiny new nonprofit organization?</div>

For those, like me, who are predicting The Meltdown, this is not it, it is just a bull trap.Previously it was overvalued by 100%, it is still overvalued by 100%.

Crypto is useless. Do I really need to remind anyone that crypto is useless?There is no specific need for bitcoin in the world, it&#39;s a solution looking for a problem.If I had a bitcoin, I couldn&#39;t do anything with it other than sit on it and pray that it&#39;s worth more some day, but still, in order to derive concrete utility from it I would have to first get rid of it and convert to real money instead.It&#39;s a very formidable waste of resources, akin to growing tulips instead of something useful.You can&#39;t eat tulips. Well even with tulips they might be edible but you could probably grow a lot of potatoes for all the work you dedicate into cultivating a rare tulip.

Yup, sure. But... just to play devil&#39;s advocate for a bit... this has been your position since years ago when BTC was at  $1, right? So WHY THE FUCK should anyone listen to you?

Indeed. How more respected can you get in a community than publishing the universally recognized frigging reference for all of the world?

Also remember that all conflicts have a major component of perception. This move will make the US less safe.

This stuff worries me.  The US, since WWII, has provided a starting point for the rest of the world in many areas.  From the Internet to GPS, to electricity, to roads... many things that we use today were paved and made available by the US government.

I&#39;m not happy seeing this shift.  IMHO, this shows the US is retreating.  This also shows to allies that the US is not interested in world affairs as much, while China and India are wooing them to join BRICS and dump the dollar, to join their trade bloc.

IMHO, these decisions seem to be made by people who don&#39;t understand basic agriculture.  If you want a harvest, you have to plant something.  Not bothering to plant, or cutting off seed corn means that there won&#39;t be much to bring in.

What would be ideal is the US to maintain some type of library or encyclopedia, not on just countries, but other items.  At least it means there is a vetted [1] source of information which can be cross-checked.

[1]:  It is relative, but at least one can point a finger to a nation-state as a source of truth, or point out it is a bald-faced lie, with the buck stopping there.

Well, but somehow nowadays that is super totally filthy hyper-capitalist, colonialist and misogynist and racist and fascist and literally nothing the US has ever done is good in any way..So shouldnt these people be celebrating that the evil propaganda by CIA is gone? The orange man could have had some facts altered!!!

You can tell the loonies because there can&#39;t hear something critical about the republican administration without instantly trying to drag other people into it

You know this shit is bad otherwise your wouldn&#39;t be trying to kick up dust about whatever straw leftist you dreamed about last night. So why not just admit it and be honest without kicking up dust. You&#39;re favoured side won&#39;t stop sound the things you don&#39;t like while you keep acting like a useful idiot and ruining interference for them.

The great North American stroad is a terrible invention that no one should be copying. It is an almost unique combination of high cost, dangerous to use and prone to traffic jams.

For a start have a system whereby a potential president doesn&#39;t either need to be stinking rich to campaign and/or has to beg for donor money and then owes huge favours to said donors. Make a law that broadcast and online media have to represent all candidates equally and give them free airtime for some agreed length of time and have government moneyt pay for a certain number of campaign visits around your country which if they lose they have to pay back.

... to roads... many things that we use today were paved and made available by the US government.

Reg: All right, but apart from the sanitation, medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, the fresh water system and public health, what have the Romans^H^H^H^H^H^H Americans ever done for us?

(I&#39;m afraid HTML strike doesn&#39;t work here)

Yes, though I had to refrain from citing any numbers from that on places such as this. Every time I did, the usual suspects would insist that it&#39;s just American propaganda, CIA is fascist, or any other conspiracy theory you can think of.

Sometimes, the only way to get your point across is to do it using the recipients own preferred source material, and be careful to avoid using the ones they distrust, regardless of how accurate, or not, it may be.

Your head is so far up your own ass that you can&#39;t have a simple story about the republican administration doing something short without bleating about teh libruhls.

I can&#39;t remember the last time I used that site.  I can&#39;t remember much about it TBH - what did it offer that I can&#39;t get conveniently from Wikipedia?

what did it offer that I can&#39;t get conveniently from Wikipedia?A source you can cite.

what did it offer that I can&#39;t get conveniently from Wikipedia?

Those are obviously old and stale facts. The most transparent administration in history will provide you with completely new and fresh facts to justify fucking over whichever country is next on the list.

And it will be alternate facts, which are much better!

I remember before smart phones/mobile internet/Wikipedia I could download/install the CIA world Factbook to my visor handspring.

I was a big fan back in the day. But to be honest I&#39;ve never used it since Wikipedia arrived.

I can&#39;t say I have ever been in the wilderness with no internet and wanted to transfer a file.

I am generally for some of the EU crackdowns that are pro-consumer, but in a world full of thousands of messengers and hundreds of other means of sharing any and all data between all devices, AirDrop really isnt a hill to choose for a battle or to die on - neither does it matter whether other phones can send and receive from it.

This feels like very politically motivated grandstanding from the geriatric, overly-satiated Brussels autocrats and technocrats.

They should spend their time on pushing USBC as a univ

I can only gather that its because a lot of people with iPhones have trouble with the hundreds of ways to share a file?

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The move away from MS crap. Not for the reason I expected, but still.

The fatal mistake that Microsoft made was disable the email of the chief prosecutor at the International Court of Law. At that point, it became blatantly obvious and impossible to ignore that MS will do whatever the US administration wants to its international (and probably national) customers. The EU administration observed this event very carefully and drew its conclusions. Obviously, this will be a process over the next 5-10 years or so, but MS is cooked.

What did it take to destroy Microsoft?Corpocracy + fascism + consistently bad US foreign policy.Sort of a perfect storm that turns what probably seemed like a sweet deal for the big tech companies into a nightmare scenario of break up. I bet they wish they still had Biden and the Dems in power, that let corporate interests run much of the government as long as they had diversity policies.

Can the EU actually pull this off?  There are some tools that MS has, which nobody else has:

1:  AD/Entra.  Maybe in the past, we had directory services and policy object servers that could scale up and out, but right now, AFAIK (and please correct me) AD/Entra are the only game in town if you have millions of users and need to handle AAA (authentication, authorization, auditing), of users, machines, and other objects, with GPOs and other policies attached.  Yes, there is FreeIPA/IdM, and it works well, with replication, performance, and security.  I&#39;d assert it has a smaller attack profile than AD.  However, it doesn&#39;t scale as well as AD can.  AD can figure out how to replicate itself, and handle all kinds of oddball conditions.

Note, this can&#39;t be a cloud service.  Ideally, authentication should either be on-prem, or at least hybrid, so even without network connectivity, people can log into their machines and do offline work, even if caching isn&#39;t doable.

2:  A unified file sharing protocol.  NFS v3 doesn&#39;t cut it for users.  NFS v4 takes a well tuned environment to work.  S3 is awesome for objects, but definitely not something you want to use as a VM storage backend.  We need to have a protocol that allows for file sharing with the robustness of S3, but have additional commands for block I/O, so that can be as fast as possible.  This would allow for things like versioning, object immutability, maybe even tiers of compression and encryption.  However, as it stands now, SMB/CIFS is king, with nothing really dethroning it.

3:  Something to replace Outlook/Exchange.  A standardized mail, calendaring suite that has all the C-level features needed.  This can be hard, as there are a lot of systems out there (Google WorkSpace, Zimbra, Zoho)... but feature-wise and usability-wise, MS comes out ahead, if only because people are familiar with it, and it does well enough.

4:  SharePoint.  Don&#39;t laugh, but SharePoint and Confluence are unique programs.  There are other Wiki programs that can do the job, but the ability to import things in and make workflows happen make those two commercial programs extremely useful, especially in maintaining documentation.

5:  GitHub/GHE.  If I have a F/OSS project, and forget about it, I am pretty much certain that 5-10 years from now, it will still be there and usable, perhaps someone finds it, forks it and makes it useful again.  Other Git systems... not so much, and when stuff vanishes, that is history lost forever.  This needs to have government support, and some sanity (so this doesn&#39;t get turned into someone&#39;s personal multi-terabyte storage of videos).  Maybe more space if people &quot;adopt&quot; it.  It also needs to span countries, just so if something happens in Europe, that source code would be available in the US.

6:  MDM/RMM tools.  Intune has its issues, but the Holy Grail would be something that could manage Macs, Windows machines, and many Linux distributions, as well as iOS, and Android devices.  This would be both cloud based as well as available on-prem.  This functionality is critical to a business&#39;s operations, and needs to be integrated into the OS.  Ideally, for Linux, some parameter which can be inputted at install time to have the installer pause, go to a URL, pull code from there and then function like Autopilot or Apple&#39;s ABM provisioning.

7:  I hate to mention this, but an IRM.  Something like MS Purview.  DRM is ugly, but in this case, it can be the one thing that is the difference between exfiltration or no.

8:  A VDI cloud connection broker, as well as a VDI system.  Otherwise, you are paying for Omnissa, Microsoft W365 or AVD, Citrix, or something else, and those are not cheap.  Having a VDI system that is inexpensive and works well with Proxmox can bring a critical security tier to a company.

9:  Don&#39;t laugh... a GPG keyserver combined with transparant GPG in mail apps and webmail.  We have moved away from tried and true encryption to stuff based on &quot;trust me&quot;.  Enough.  We need to see about going back to the GPG standard.

Getting rid of Teams is a positive, but to break MS&#39;s iron grip, there are a lot of other basic enterprise items which need to be made into vetted, maintained, open source projects.

Not true. All the problems solved are not unique to the MS island and solutions exist outside of that. Unless by &quot;unique&quot; you mean the MS logo on things?

Before I write this, I need to say I think Matrix is very impressive, and I&#39;ve seen some amazing stuff built on that platform, even a FOSS Roblox-like application. I&#39;m not criticizing the authors.

Matrix is in many ways a proof of concept that just... falls short. It doesn&#39;t have the features of Teams, it has a very user-unfriendly encryption system that requires storing keys in local files, it&#39;s really not going to work.

Matrix proves the FOSS community can build something like this, but it isn&#39;t what th

Matrix is a protocol. It doesn&#39;t have any user facing &quot;features&quot; just like TCP/IP doesn&#39;t have any. Applications using matrix can have all the features you want, you just need to implement them.

Most users are not very savvy, especially around new software. When you are making software for governments, you get A LOT of users, and Microsoft has made a whole business of educating and brute-forcing people to learn their systems.

I would love to see Teams get replaced, but we need FOSS that has the kind of support / docs / ecosystem to allow your least-common-denominator user to succeed.

Capitalist efficiency is a myth beyond SMEs. From a certain size on upwards, it goes to hell. To be fair, soviet-type manufacturing efficiency is pretty much the same or worse and they also have worse product quality issues in general. But then I look at where Win11 stands now and it is clear that capitalism with monopolies in place can match soviet incompetence easily.

Erm, if the cost of Teams and the associated ecosystem had been spent on OSS solutions, paying programmers directlyWhat is your point? If you had all the money Microsoft spent on Teams you could build an open source version of Teams? Really? Do you not see the stupidity of that statement?bypassing corporate costs like managers, stockholders, fancy real-estate, glitzy functions in golden ballrooms for &#39;charity&#39; and all the things the entitled corporate hegemony demand in exchange for their &#39;skills&#39;, instead?Well thank you for your kitchen-sink rant... So, out of curiosity, where would someone come up with &quot;the cost of (money spent on) Teams and the associated ecosystem&quot; to develop the FOSS version of Teams and not have to either recoup the investment or (perish the thought) make a profit?

Where do you imagine the literal millions of dollars it would take will come from?Asked Gemini to come up with some numbers:- Cost of the MS Teams add-on (ignoring the base license): 5€ per user per month- Estimated number of public sector employees in the EU: 35 millionThat gives you over 2 billion € to spend every year. Seems doable.

Most users are not very savvy, especially around new software.That didn&#39;t stop people using Teams, a program that not only was rolled out to everyone with virtually no information beyond a few popup tooltips or training, but a program that drastically differed from the norms of other software (like no multi window support).The users will be fine.

People use MS only because everyone else is using MS. That reduces training when one goes into a new org, and there are zillions of MS how-to videos because it&#39;s ubiquitous. It would take a while for a competitor to gain similar.

Whatever the EU Commission is going to use will have contributions integrated upstream and there will be commercial support from many vendors. European IT is in no way inferior, people are just lazy and stick to what they know unless there are very good reasons not to. These very good reasons have manifested now.

You may have overlooked that in Europe, both the overall administration and member states sponsor FOSS projects. You may also have overlooked that there are quite a few businesses maintaining and developing FOSS in Europe. The European Commission can get whatever is missing developed for them and make that FOSS as well. And they probably will and then anybody can use it.

Incidentally, I used a teaching video conference platform from an EU project some 20 years ago. The only thing was that it needed more band

If they are looking for a chat app, then they may have success.If they are looking for an integrated app in corporate groupware then they will fail miserably. As long as they don&#39;t side by side compare features such as Sharepoint integration, Outlook integration, the selection of commercially available meeting room hardware, etc. they may stand a chance, otherwise Teams offers a feature set that has no comparison with anything else.

God knows it needs it, no one uses that god awful piece of shit software for

Indeed. This is not hard to do and countless examples to be used as inspiration exists.

DMCA isn&#39;t copyright law even if it has the word copyright in it, it is it&#39;s own animal that ignores the long established practices of fair use and transformative works.

Per TFA, the plaintiff claims that the defendant used circumvention technology to download the stream. The defendant claims they didn&#39;t -- they just used screen-capture.

Yes, the plaintiff&#39;s claim is based on copyright infringement, but through a violation of the DMCA, not through use of their content. I think the case will hinge on whether the plaintiff can prove this.

There is such a thing as fair use, and this case really doesn&#39;t have anything to do with it. Why? Because the plaintiff is not suing the usage, just the manner in which they believe the content was acquired.

Because the plaintiff is not suing the usage, just the manner in which they believe the content was acquired.On a philosophical point of view, can you address one without considering the other? It&#39;s an interesting thought experiment, if you lock down the playback behind the DMCA effectively fair use disappears for all content that isn&#39;t physically acquired.

The DMCA is clear.But is it clear that the defendant violated the DMCA? I predict the plaintiff will be unable to demonstrate this. The defendant has already denied doing so.We&#39;ll see what discovery turns up.

But is it clear that the defendant violated the DMCA? I predict the plaintiff will be unable to demonstrate this. The defendant has already denied doing so.

This was not the outcome of a case, merely a judge deciding not to grant the defense&#39;s request for a dismissal.  Sure, there&#39;s the remote possibility that the defendant could lose this case from the DMCA angle, because fair use under the DMCA is kind of a mess. [eff.org]

It&#39;s important to point out that &quot;fair use&quot; has never been a trump card you can play to have a copyright lawsuit immediately dismissed - it is only a legally defensible position.  It only feels like fair use offers a shield of protection, because most of the time rightsholders don&#39;t want to waste money fighting a legal battle they aren&#39;t likely to win.  But, when you&#39;ve got a stubborn YouTube content creator with an axe to grind and the money to pay their lawyer(s), the court is unfortunately going to have to go through the entire process of legal wrangling before they get to the point of determining that it was in fact, fair use.

cause the additional &quot;on the internet&quot; changes everything.

Back then they at least pretended that laws mattered to corporations and rich people. Today they don&#39;t bother hiding because fuck you, what are you gonna do about it?

Yes. However the social construct of laws has fallen apart. Laws are only for little people. It&#39;s a free for all if you&#39;re rich or powerful.

This is actually one YouTube content creator suing another.  As far as the standards of rich and powerful go, they&#39;re probably pretty low on the totem pole.

If you published your VHS recordings, you&#39;d be in trouble. Exactly same here.

The judge here is an idiot.No. You are ignorant.

S.1201 very clearly makes anti-circumvention a crime regardless of fair-use. See DeCSS, Sony&#39;s case against George Hotz, etc.

The problem with this world is that people like you are too stupid to realize shit you read on some fucking blog is just some dumbfuck&#39;s opinion.

Broadcasting the reaction to the recording, or any other details of how it was used, is irrelevant to the anti-circumvention part of the DMCA. It&#39;s the circumvention itself which is illegal under that law regardless of the reason.

You could circumvent the DRM it then immediately delete the recording unused and, if proven, you&#39;d still have violated the DMCA section 1201. It&#39;s incredibly restricting and dumb, as even something in the public domain is unlawful to copy if you need to bypass copy protection to do

Reaction content is intended to be watched by many parties (and is often monetized).  When you used a VCR to record a TV show to watch later, you weren&#39;t displaying the recording at a public venue where you charged admission.

It&#39;s worse, if screen capture is illegal then so is using your eyeballs.Jesus fucking christ, you really are stupid.
Shut the fuck up, and scamper off.

No court of law considers the neuronal representation of media you look at to constitute a statutory fucking copy. Nothing in the Copyright Act or DMCA, by any fucking stretch of the imagination, supports such an asinine and dumbshit edgelord take.

Even though this is still very preliminary, I think it reaffirms Cory Doctorow&#39;s position that countries should repeal the DMCA-like laws that they were strong-armed into passing by the US government (which itself was bought and paid for by US corporations.)

That said, I hate most reaction channels.  Apart from a select few, most don&#39;t add anything of value and they probably divert traffic away from the original videos.  So meh... no good players here.

if you can&#39;t just record your own screen which requires no circumvention -- because in the past the data was encrypted -- that means to use anything anywhere ever you must know if it had previously been encrypted.

&quot;You can have it, you just can&#39;t obtain it&quot; is such a bad idea to ever have in law.

Unfortunately the only perjury possible in a take-down notice is for not actually being an authorized agent of the copyright holder. Simply sending a take-down for something that is clearly fair-use isn&#39;t a perjury issue as long as your authorized to be enforcing that copyright. You could be held liable for damages to the alleged infringer if it was done knowingly, but that requires enough damages to exist to the alleged infringer to be worth them suing over.

Of a copyright holder. Maybe things have improved, but it used to be that you couldn&#39;t upload a recording of your own performance of classical music by a long-dead composer without getting takedown notices relating to other, commercial, recordings of the same work.

Not being able to download the video to insert into your commentary doesn&#39;t prevent you from simply playing the video segments while recording your commentary.  Harder to get properly timed edits, but it&#39;s more of a hassle than a blocker.

And of course, the court hasn&#39;t even ruled on this yet, so it might be moot.

People have been carrying iphones for nearly 20 years at this point. I think the battery thermals are pretty well known and understood at this point. These aren&#39;t being used in the vacuum of space. This isn&#39;t a landing and there are no spacewalks planned. They are being used onboard.

It&#39;s not the vacuum of space, but the Orion capsule is designed to operate at as little as 8 psi, about half normal sea level. At least it&#39;s not pure oxygen, but I do rather hope those specific phones have been tested at that pressure.

Although NASA engineers are criticized for &quot;What could go wrong?&quot; there are many use cases when you&#39;re going 23Kmph in a finite structure built for weeks of living that can and do go wrong.

No, it&#39;s not pure oxygen, but fire control, unexpected EMI/RFI, outgassing plastics, all are major and life-threatening events to deal with.

Woe the day when an unapproved/untested device becomes a death weapon, or distorts a signal in such a way as to render bad navigation, etc.

Nothing is foolproof because fools are so in

It being used as a weapon isn&#39;t one of the issues. Astronauts already have plenty of things that can be used as weapons. In fact there issued weapons in case of attack by sky bears like Ursa.

8 psi is 16kft8kft is 11 psi and what airline cabins are pressurized to

I would be more concerned about oxygen ingress than absolute pressure given that iphones seem to do reasonably well at altitude.

Lithium-ion batteries are doing so well at altitude that you can no longer put them in your check-in luggage, and that some airlines won&#39;t even let you put them in the overhead compartment anymore.

Keep your iPhone, the power adapter, and any wireless charger in a well-ventilated area when in use or charging.Spacecraft aren&#39;t exactly well-ventilated areas. And then you need to consider the high-oxygen atmosphere as well: Explosive and other atmospheric conditions.  Charging or using iPhone in any area with a potentially explosive atmosphere, such as areas where the air contains high levels of flammable chemicals, vapors, or particles (such as grain, dust, or metal powders), may be hazardous. Exposing iPhone to environments having high concentrations of industrial chemicals, including near evaporating liquified gasses such as helium, may damage or impair iPhone functionality. Obey all signs and instructions.

And outgassing tests.   Just wait until they&#39;re halfway to the moon and start choking on toxic fumes because someone took a kickback from Apple.

I wouldn&#39;t carry a device in my pocket that contains a lithium battery that hasn&#39;t been tested for safety in a vacuum.

If the phone is in a vacuum, the phone is the least of your worries.

The last text message from the astronaut was &quot;please...send...air!&quot;

Agreed.  Plus, don&#39;t you assume the Nikon DSLR and GoPro cameras also had lithium batteries?

Plus the Artemis II Orion spacecraft utilizes four EaglePicher 120-volt lithium-ion batteries (two main, two backup) for critical power, managing communications, navigation, propulsion, and thermal control.  Light weight lithium batteries are already used in many places on the spacecraft.

At NASA, you know. Everybody knows. That&#39;s how they do things.

The lithium salts are the oxizider in a lithium-ion battery fire. The only way to put it out in space would be to cool it completely and rapidly.Which isn&#39;t going to happen in a vacuum, so it will probably smolder for days or perhaps months.

Worse is in a low pressure environment like a crew capsule where it will turn into a high temperature fire and outgas a huge volume of smoke. And you will also not be able to get enough foam or water on it to stop it.

If it releases poisonous gases into a tiny space capsule and then breaks by catching fire it could be a problem though. A very unlikely way for a mission to end, but NASA puts a lot of effort into preventing other equally unlikely dangers that could thwart a billion-dollar moon mission and put the crew&#39;s lives in danger.

safer batteries for such things.  It&#39;s no laughing matter on a plane, let alone in the tight confines of a capsule, when a phone or laptop decides to go up in flames.

It&#39;s actually quite hard to start a fire in zero-g because the CO2 stays around the flame and puts it out. Obviously that doesn&#39;t affect a phone battery because it brings its own oxygen, but the big risk is likely to be from the noxious gases it emits as it burns.

I would agree is Microsoft developed IOS. I just hope they don&#39;t try to use Apple Maps to get to the moon. The thought of arriving at Apophis instead is quite alarming.

I&#39;m fine with NASA accepting an unknown risk that their non-radiation-hardened phones may fail to work or that stored non-critical pictures may be lost.

I&#39;m NOT fine with them accepting an unknown risk of increased fire hazards.

Let&#39;s measure or get a very good estimate of the risk of a fire hazard then decide whether it&#39;s acceptable or not.

Yep, there&#39;s a very good reason that engineers poke and prod at things for years before marking something as safe for a life critical area.

The DSLR doesn&#39;t do video conferencing or play music, so I think this decision may be more about that sort of feature.

But cameras? I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the autofocus and dynamic range (via automatic HDR) of a high end phone were better than an old DSLR. For nighttime detail, my phone can rival a well respected zoom lens on a camera from this decade, and the results don&#39;t appear oversharpened or otherwise defective. I wouldn&#39;t believe it if I hadn&#39;t done the test myself. Of course, neither is great. Ca

My early digital cameras didn&#39;t survive metal detectors.  I got permanent stuck pixels on the sensors just by sending the cameras through the metal detectors.

Before you ask, we were not allowed to use lead-lined bags like we did with traditional film.

Can&#39;t wait to see those grainy, blurry, smeared images with stuck green pixels from the far side of the moon!

I assume that you mean x-ray scanners, not metal detectors? Metal detectors shouldn&#39;t emit anything.

And they&#39;re going to operate their phones with spacesuit gloves on?  They&#39;re going to do EVAs clutching their precious phone?  NASA is allowing regular consumer-grade items into space when each launch is going to cost billions of dollars?

I&#39;m sorry, this is one of the most daft ideas I&#39;ve heard in a long time.

They aren&#39;t doing EVAs at all on the Artimis II mission. They are keeping them in the spaceship where they will not wear gloves.

Using game controllers to control the spacecraft?

OK, tasteless jokes aside, for what PURPOSE would that be?

I don&#39;t mind if they bring their phones to watch netflix. For that, safety relevant tests would be enough. But for mission equipment? NASA is not stupid. They know if tests are cheaper that finding out in orbit that your photo equipment was not vibration or radiation resistant enough.

&quot;NASA Will *Finally* Let Its Astronauts Bring iPhones To the Moon&quot;

As opposed to the last astronauts that went to the moon? Really? The reason the Apollo missions didn&#39;t bring iPhones was because NASA wouldn&#39;t let them?

Neil Armstrong was a diehard Blackberry user.

Probably more here than the people making the big decisions for NASA nowadays.

Finally, astronauts can take lunar dick pics. Might have to wait for the return trip to send them though.

The question on everyone&#39;s mind: does microgravity cause shrinkage?

What kind of coverage do you get?    Will there be long distance charges with the current plan?The roaming charges from the moon are astronomical....

What kind of coverage do you get?    Will there be long distance charges with the current plan?

The roaming charges from the moon are astronomical....

When I read the summary, my first thought was &#39;are they bringing a bunch of cell-satellites with them?&#39;

now all there&#39;s left is ... actually getting them to the moon. piece of cake!

They&#39;ll be able to film a moonwalk in HD.

Instead of taking a smartphone to the moon, they should&#39;ve bringing a proper high end DSLR or mirrorless and some good glass. The cameras they used for Apollo were high end for the time, if we are going back it makes sense to use di.ilarlybhigh end cameras with full-frame sensors and good glass rather than a phone.

roaming costs $100 per MB txts $5 per txt voice $20 per min.

Because what we really needed was pictures from NASA missions touched up by AI / weird algorithms rather than the capturing of raw sensor data to be reviewed post mission. I wonder who will be first to discover life on another planet, NASA, Apple, or Samsung.

Imagine you attend a protest, like hundreds of thousands of Americans have since President Donald Trump began his second term. Perhaps it is a No Kings event, or a local ICE demonstration to protest Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s crackdown on immigrants in your community. During the protest, you take a video of yourself and your fellow protesters, caption it “Abolish ICE,” and upload it to Instagram. A few weeks later, there’s a knock on your door. Federal agents stand before you, demanding to question you.

You’re wondering to yourself: Do they know about the protest I attended? Are they legally allowed to track me? Do I have to comply?

The answer to these first two questions is, shockingly, yes, and it’s made possible in part by a little-known power that the Trump administration has supercharged in recent months. The answer to the last question is much more complicated. The Department of Homeland Security is one of a number of federal agencies with something called administrative subpoena power, and it has been leveraging that tool in unprecedented ways under Trump 2.0. The Washington Post detailed these abuses this week, focusing on the story of a U.S. citizen targeted by DHS for simply emailing a federal prosecutor his opinion about the federal government’s case against an Afghan national facing deportation.

How can something like this happen? Congress has granted administrative subpoena power to federal agencies, like the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Federal Communications Commission, to allow them to access information quickly to make decisions about issues under their purview. A key distinction between administrative subpoenas and civil or criminal ones is that federal agencies do not need a judge’s sign-off. These agencies retain the power to approve administrative subpoenas themselves. This also means that agencies can demand documents without needing to prove that there is an ongoing investigation into or probable cause against a person when issuing administrative subpoenas.

Federal agencies are not legally required to disclose how many administrative subpoenas they issue, but under the Trump administration, unnamed sources told the Post, the volume of administrative subpoenas is “well into the thousands, if not tens of thousands.” Lindsay Nash, a professor at Cardozo School of Law, authored a study on the immigration subpoena power and found, through publicly available regulations and internal records, that ICE has empowered its employees—even those focused on civil immigration enforcement—“to demand records and testimony from any person or entity in order to obtain information for any civil or criminal investigation within the agency’s broad domain.”

“At present, there is generally no requirement that officers have probable cause, identify the suspected violation, or exercise restraint,” Nash wrote. This is being exemplified with abuses like the one documented in the Post story, plus footage of federal agents taking pictures of protesters and threatening to add them to “a nice little database,” which some anonymous national security officials claim does in fact exist as a way for DHS and the FBI to track people labeled as “domestic terrorists.” (DHS publicly denies that there is such a database.)

The Trump administration’s heavy use of administrative subpoenas comes as the judiciary—including Republican-appointed judges—has been turning against its immigration enforcement tactics. Just this week, a court blocked the White House from ending temporary protected status for over 350,000 Haitian immigrants living in the U.S., while the chief judge of the District of Minnesota concluded that ICE has most likely violated more court orders in January alone than “some federal agencies have violated in their entire existence.”

Administrative subpoenas are a convenient work-around for an administration that knows it faces an uphill battle if it takes its information requests to a judge, a process that requires a formal investigation. Instead of having to meet a strict legal standard, DHS can issue administrative subpoenas to private individuals, tech companies, schools, state governments, and other entities in order to access information about people it’s interested in targeting. It has already tried to take this path to acquire data on folks who track ICE in their local communities. Generally, targeted organizations do not have to notify individuals that their information is being sought by the federal government. However, these groups are not actually obliged to comply with these subpoenas absent judicial action. As Michelle Lapointe, legal director at American Immigration Council, told Slate, administrative subpoenas are not self-enforcing. “When people receive an administrative subpoena from ICE, technically they don’t have to respond,” she said. “The agency can go to court and seek the records to be compelled from the individual who is served with the subpoena. But it has to do that extra step to make it enforceable.”

Lapointe noted that oftentimes recipients of these subpoenas do end up complying out of fear, which DHS appears to be manipulating. The Post story, for instance, described what happened to the U.S. citizen who had emailed the federal prosecutor: Federal agents showed up at his doorstep after he failed to comply with an administrative subpoena. The agents questioned him about the email, asking how he had found the attorney’s email address—through a basic Google search. After about 20 minutes, the agents left.

Critically, tech companies, including Google and Meta, have received administration subpoenas since Trump took office last year, but it’s not always clear when they comply. A Google spokesperson told TechCrunch that it pushes back against overbroad or improper subpoenas, while spokespeople for Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and Snap told the Post their companies alert users about administrative subpoena requests unless they are barred from doing so or face extenuating circumstances.

In a case about six separate Instagram accounts that named and shamed a Border Patrol agent who was part of the Los Angeles immigration raids last summer, DHS sent Meta an administrative subpoena asking for the accounts’ names, email addresses, and phone numbers. In that instance, the Instagram account users were made aware of the subpoena, and a judge ordered Meta not to comply.

The issue here is that Americans are left to simply hope these tech companies operate in good faith and out of the goodness of their hearts, something that “should be alarming to all of us,” Lapointe noted. The threat remains that these companies may end up complying with DHS requests in order to get the administration off their backs, even when subpoenas are unwarranted. “I do think the acquiescence of tech and government makes it especially difficult as a functional matter to protect individual rights when you have administrative subpoena authority,” Dennis Fan, an associate professor at Columbia Law School and a former federal prosecutor, told Slate. Attending a protest is a constitutionally protected right, as is writing an email that contains your political opinions, but the Trump administration is finding ways to use these actions against its citizens by leaning into third parties—aka Big Tech—who have access to your personal, identifying information. These are companies that have positioned themselves as friendly partners of the White House, given that many of the country’s tech billionaires personally donated to Trump’s inauguration, then were conspicuously seated in the front row.

Where does that leave the average American? The answer is complicated. Lapointe believes that the best thing we can do is remain aware of our constitutional rights and not let Big Tech get away with selling out Americans without a fight. “I think pressure can be brought to bear, the more we raise awareness that these requests could come through and that the tech companies might receive them, requesting your information,” Lapointe said. “Using public pressure campaigns to encourage them to resist these attempts to get at private information could be helpful.”

So if you exercise your First Amendment right to protest injustices you believe your government is committing, you risk being targeted by that very government. And if you don’t want Big Tech helping that government target you? You may have to be right back at that protest again.

In his most recent rant about how Democrats cheat to win elections, President Donald Trump offered a chilling recommendation on Monday. Appearing on the podcast of Dan Bongino, his former deputy FBI director, the president argued that “the Republicans should say, ‘We want to take over.’ We should take over the voting, the voting in at least many—15 places.

“The Republicans,” he added, “ought to nationalize the voting.”

A federal-government takeover of America’s locally and state-administered voting process has long been something Republicans have opposed on principle. But then again, Trump said he wanted to do it. So how would Senate Republicans respond?

There were those who, in a ritual dating back to the early days of Trump’s first term, had conveniently not kept abreast of the news. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told me he wouldn’t comment because he hadn’t seen the interview. Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley thought about it for a few seconds before determining that he too was unfamiliar.

Others were more forthcoming, with Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski rejecting the idea. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, most importantly, said, “I’m not in favor of federalizing elections—I mean, I think that’s a constitutional issue.”

But a broad middle of GOP senators took something of a third way: While they wouldn’t endorse a partisan and national takeover of voting itself, they were eager to talk about legislation that would greatly expand the federal role in elections—and do so in a way that furthers a long-standing partisan goal of the GOP.

“We need to safeguard our elections better,” Kansas Sen. Roger Marshall told me. “I think the SAVE Act is a great start. I think requiring proof of citizenship when you register to vote is a must.”

Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson said that “we shouldn’t nationalize” elections, “but we should certainly set certain standards like citizenship and voter ID.” He added, “The problem is, we have Democrats who want to make it easy to cheat.”

Florida Sen. Rick Scott echoed those sentiments. “We need to have voter ID in our elections. We need to make sure illegal aliens cannot vote in our elections,” he said. “We need to make sure that we just stop the fraud.”

As Marshall alluded to, the bill that Republicans have coalesced around is the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which the House passed earlier this Congress, and which proponents are trying to find some magical way to squeeze through the Senate’s brick wall.

Even White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, in a Tuesday press briefing, said passage of this legislation is what Trump had been referring to when he called to “nationalize the voting.” Sure it was.

Republicans often point to the high public support for requiring photo ID at polling places. The SAVE Act is more than that, though. It requires “documentary proof of United States citizenship” in order to register to vote. Such proof means things like a passport or a birth certificate. REAL IDs could count too, but only if they indicate citizenship, and just a handful of states’ REAL IDs currently do so. The SAVE Act, in other words, applies drastic changes to solve a problem—voter fraud—that is vanishingly rare, though it would succeed in creating hurdles for eligible voters. It goes without saying that Democrats have no interest in this legislation, and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer has described it as “nothing more than Jim Crow 2.0.”

Given Senate Democrats’ 100 percent chance of filibustering this legislation, and Republicans’ inability to eliminate the legislative filibuster, then, what’s the plan for getting this bill through the Senate?

House Republicans think they have an idea that could work. Bless their hearts.

After the Senate and White House reached a deal last week to extend the Department of Homeland Security’s funding for only two weeks, giving them a brief window to negotiate new immigration enforcement reforms, conservative House Republicans were displeased. If Democrats felt as if they could reopen a closed negotiation over DHS funding, then they wanted to participate too. A group of them, led by Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, insisted that when the Senate deal returned to the House, they wouldn’t support it unless they could attach the SAVE Act.

But such a move would have been a recipe for a prolonged shutdown. Trump’s priority over the past week has been to avoid a lengthy shutdown that keeps the issue of immigration enforcement tactics front and center in the news. And so, following a White House meeting, Luna and Co. said they’d received “assurances” from Thune that they would wait out a “standing filibuster” from their Democratic counterparts in order to pass the SAVE Act, at a later date. In return, the rebels would support the government funding bill sent over from the Senate.

Anyone familiar with the Senate realizes that Thune would never have made such an assurance. As Thune clarified Tuesday morning, all he said was that he’d have a conversation with Republican senators about it. You have to know what waiting out a “standing filibuster” means—and most House members don’t—to understand why he wouldn’t promise it to some aggravated House members.

Waiting out a “standing,” or “talking,” filibuster means you wait for the other side to stop talking before moving ahead to a simple-majority vote, as opposed to the normal means of cutting off debate: invoking cloture with 60 votes. The strategy, if used, would likely involve enforcing the Senate’s two-speech rule, barring lawmakers from speaking more than twice in the same legislative day on the same question.

The problem is that this can take forever. Forty-seven Democratic senators being able to speak twice, on its own terms, could take up weeks or months of precious legislative floor time that Republicans need for other priorities. And that’s before any amendments that could reset the clock. Plus, GOP senators would need to be on or near the floor for the entirety of this time to ensure they have a quorum lest Democratic speakers attempt a quorum call.

“I’m skeptical that it’s going to be a panacea,” Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a onetime member of leadership who’s well familiar with Senate rules, told me.

Thune laid out all of these challenges Tuesday afternoon but nevertheless promised to “have a discussion about it and see where our conference is.” In other words, the plan is to allow the passage of time to do the humble work of making everyone forget about all of this.

Trump’s desire for greater control over the administration of the midterm elections, however, won’t disappear amid congressional gridlock. The president already initiated a national redistricting war to squeeze out a few more congressional seats. The FBI has already raided a Georgia election facility and could plan for more. The Justice Department keeps trying to get its mitts on state voter rolls. We don’t know exactly what it is yet, but if there’s a way to do “nationalization” by other means, the administration will be looking into it.

            <div id="article-text">NASA&#39;s Administrator has stated that smartphones will accompany the Crew-12 and Artemis II astronauts on their missions.

Jared Isaacman posted on X (formerly Twitter): &quot;We are giving our crews the tools to capture special moments for their families and share inspiring images and video with the world.&quot;

He added: &quot;We challenged long-standing processes and qualified modern hardware for spaceflight on an expedited timeline.&quot;

Isaacman did not elaborate on how those long-standing processes had been challenged. It certainly isn&#39;t the first time smartphones have been flown in space, and astronauts regularly use tablets for following procedures and other tasks.

Taking a device into space has traditionally required it to be thoroughly tested beforehand. For example, there is the question of outgassing and how the device might interfere with other equipment. One space agency source directed The Register to the MIL-STD-461 standard for electromagnetic equipment, saying: &quot;Normally they nerf all the RF capabilities, so they just become a pocket computer.&quot;

It&#39;s not clear what has happened with the &quot;latest smartphones&quot; (widely reported to be iPhones) Isaacman mentioned. The Register asked NASA, and will update this piece should the agency respond.

Potential interference from the device&#39;s GSM radio is likely the most significant concern, although our source said: &quot;They [the crew] won&#39;t be calling on them.&quot; Other consumer-grade devices, such as the Raspberry Pi computers used in the AstroPi project, eschew wireless connectivity altogether.

Smartphones have been on the ISS before. In 2015, the European Space Agency (ESA) showcased the mobiPV system, a cross-platform platform that allowed astronauts to access procedure lists on the go. One device type was a wrist-mounted smartphone.

Isaacman&#39;s real thrust is to challenge NASA&#39;s often long-winded processes and identify room for improvement. Taking advantage of a modern smartphone camera rather than something older and heftier is an easy win. For example, the Nikon Z9 camera planned for Artemis III will be almost a decade old by the time the mission launches, and technology will have advanced in the intervening years. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI-pocalypse Britain&#39;s welfare system is experimenting with AI to manage Universal Credit claimants – even as evidence piles up that artificial intelligence may soon be pushing more people onto benefits in the first place.

The Department for Work and Pensions is exploring chatbot-style digital assistants to support Universal Credit claimants, with Permanent Secretary Sir Peter Schofield telling MPs the technology could eventually become part of frontline welfare support.

Officials believe automated tools could help claimants navigate applications, training options, and employment support while easing pressure on human work coaches stretched by rising caseloads.

&quot;We want to be able to focus our work in a more tailored way so that the people who don&#39;t need the interaction with a work coach potentially, in due course, could be able to have an interaction with a digital tool that prompts them, freeing up our work coaches for the people who most need it,&quot; Schofield said.

Universal Credit isn&#39;t just for unemployed people; it also covers low-income workers, disabled people, and those who can&#39;t work full-time. Dragging AI into that ecosystem suggests automation may end up doing double duty by reshaping employment, then helping government handle the fallout.

Schofield&#39;s comments come after UK businesses reported an 8 percent net reduction in jobs linked to AI adoption over the past year, according to Morgan Stanley, the sharpest decline among major developed economies.

Meanwhile, the government is expanding its AI partnerships to help citizens navigate the changing labor market. Officials recently announced that the government will work with model developer Anthropic on AI-powered tools to provide career advice and job search guidance, part of a broader effort to position automation as both the cause of disruption and its solution.

Forecasts suggest the challenge may only grow. Forrester reckons that AI and automation could wipe out more than 10 million jobs in the United States by 2030, with administrative, clerical, and junior professional roles sitting closest to the chopping block. The numbers are US-focused, but few expect the trend to stop at the Atlantic.

Inside government, officials are already weighing more radical responses. Investment minister Lord Jason Stockwood recently told The Financial Times that universal basic income (UBI) is being discussed as a possible safety net for workers displaced by AI, warning that automation is likely to create socially &quot;bumpy&quot; transitions.

UBI is not official policy, but its consideration suggests ministers are questioning whether retraining programs and digital job matching tools alone will be sufficient.

If the idea ever makes it off the Whitehall whiteboard, the welfare journey risks becoming oddly circular: lose your job to AI, explain that problem to AI, get career guidance from AI, and, if ministers&#39; quieter contingency planning ever becomes reality, potentially receive income support designed to soften the blow from AI in the first place. ®

            <div id="article-text">In a budget-busting leap from SAP to Oracle, West Sussex County Council is trebling its raid on capital assets such as buildings to fund its &quot;transformational&quot; ERP project.

The current budget for the authority&#39;s long-running project is £27 million, more than ten times the £2.6 million originally budgeted when it started nearly seven years ago.

Last year, The Register reported that the council was using money from selling off capital assets – including a former fire station – to fund the massively expanded budget. Although allowed by central government since 2016, the approach should not be used to relieve ongoing budget pressure, experts have warned.

In documents released to a council committee last week, officials said they expected use of funds from the sell-off to triple in the current financial year compared to a year earlier.

&quot;Following a review of the 2025/26 plan, it is now currently projected that the council will use £12 million of this flexibility on qualifying transformation expenditure. However, the exact amount will not be known until the end of the financial year,&quot; the report to the Performance and Finance Scrutiny Committee said.

In 2024/25, the council used £4 million in capital receipts to pay for its Oracle project, which it originally imagined would go live in March 2021. Officials expect the project to spend around £10 million in the 2026/27 financial year, with £4.3 million coming from capital receipts, and £5.6 million from one-off funding allocated to an IT infrastructure reserve.

An earlier estimate suggested the council might need to apply capital receipts of up to £20 million in 2025/26, with Oracle being &quot;one major project likely to qualify.&quot; The previous year saw £5.5 million set aside for the project from the unusual, one-off funding mechanism. Capital receipts are typically used to fund other capital projects such as schools and infrastructure rather than IT implementations and SaaS.

The council argues that selling property to fund an IT project, which would ordinarily be paid for using ongoing revenue, is justified because long-term savings are expected through &quot;automation and enabling more tasks to be undertaken via self-service,&quot; according to a council report from January last year [PDF].

Local council taxpayers will hope this is the case. However, the project has already confounded expectations. A report to the committee in 2024 said that in November 2019, the authority agreed a budget of £2.6 million, but later decided it needed more suppliers to help change business processes and reset the budget to £14.07 million, including £7 million in March 2021 and £7.07 million in October 2022.

In a separate report [PDF] to the council last month, the project team said the current approved budget is £27 million, based on a program of up to three years from May 2024, with finance, procurement, HR, and payroll live by April 2026, including six months of post-implementation support.

However, the £27 million figure does not appear to include spending on the project before May 2024. Systems integrator DXC began working with the council on the project under a five-year, £4 million contract in May 2020. Auditors EY later said there were &quot;weaknesses regarding budgeting, governance and risk management.&quot;

In July 2023, the council found there was no real prospect of a deliverable plan being agreed. It terminated the agreement with DXC on 1 September 2023 despite the company winning a lucrative contract variation. Published data detailing council spending shows that throughout its period working with the council on the project, DXC was paid around £6.6 million, more than 50 percent above the original contract price.

The Register has asked the council whether the current £27 million agreed budget includes spending from before May 2024. ®

            <div id="article-text">BORK!BORK!BORK! When this vulture excuses himself from The Register&#39;s Australian eyrie for a little rest and recreation, I first avoid pyromaniac birds and carnivorous koalas, before settling into a bucolic beach town to catch a few waves, read a few books, and tune out from the world of tech.

So imagine my horror when my pre-beach provisioning excursion turned up a bork.

You&#39;re looking at the digital signage from the sole supermarket in the charming village of Milton, which last week showed shoppers news of printing problems before they had a chance to choose cheese or procure pork products.

As the digital signage cycled through its store of images, the bork sullied a slide promoting house brand Black & Gold, and covered a promo for lottery tickets too.

Australia&#39;s school year commences in late January, meaning the bork also had a chance to infest an ad for snacks parents might consider cramming into lunchboxes.

Which seems rather apt because surely someone needs to go back to Windows maintenance school.

Your correspondent fumed about the bork for a while but mostly forgot all about it after hitting the beach. The shot below shows its glory at about 7:00AM one fine morning, when the water temperature was a very pleasant 22° C and gentle waves made for decent bodysurfing.

This week, meet a reader we will Regomize as &quot;Carl&quot; who in the late 1990s worked at a university and made the move from the desktop support team to the network management group.

&quot;Just before I started, we installed two new servers running Novell NetWare,&quot; Carl told On Call.

Software running on the new machines soon started to lock up and reboots and reinstalls became frequent chores, but a full fix proved elusive. Tempers frayed as email faltered, network drives became unavailable, and logins lagged.

Carl watched from the sidelines because only the two lead network admins were allowed to get hands-on with the boxes to find a fix.

Their efforts proved futile, so the university escalated the matter to Novell and the server maker.

The mess eventually landed in Carl&#39;s lap because he got the job of informing users of the latest outage and reloading software to effect a temporary fix.

This made Carl less than popular around the office – just what a new hire needs.

Between fixes, Carl started to investigate the servers and before long found log files that recorded a long, long list of memory errors that even named the actual DIMM as the source.

&quot;I called the lead admin and said I&#39;d found the problem,&quot; Carl told On Call. &quot;At first she was skeptical but said she&#39;d have a look.&quot;

The lead admin asked Carl how long he had known about the memory errors.

&quot;About four minutes,&quot; he replied, then watched as she summoned the IT director to show him the error messages.

And then, without a word, the lead admin and IT director walked away, leaving Carl thinking he&#39;d made a career-threatening mistake.

Thankfully, he was wrong. Colleagues soon let him know that the server maker was flying in replacement memory, along with a technician to install it. They both arrived that very night and solved the problem.

&quot;I received a thank-you from the director and the lead admin,&quot; Carl told On Call.

Around a month later, the lead admin resigned to become a yoga instructor, which – given her failure to spot the logs a noob found without trying – may have been a sound career move!

Have your tech support feats prompted a colleague to rethink their career? If so, click here to send On Call an email so we can tell your story on a future Friday. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/06/pakistan_it_national_skill_competency_test/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Pakistan’s Higher Education Commission (HEC) has introduced a competency test for students who take degrees in IT, to assess whether they emerge with skills employers will find useful.

The commission announced the National Skill Competency Test on Wednesday, and told universities it’s needed “to align academic outcomes with the rapidly evolving demands of the global technology sector.”

Pakistan’s prime minister, Ministry of Technology and Telecommunication, Software Export Board, and Software Houses Association all supported the new exam, which students will sit towards the end of their degrees. The HEC has asked universities to ensure all students sit the test.

Students who do well will be offered priority access to internships, apprenticeships, and industry certifications. HEC will rank universities based on their students’ performance on the test.

The regulator is involved in the formulation of curricula used in Pakistan’s universities, so those rankings won’t necessarily reflect on each institution’s teaching choices, although it has clear potential to assess their effectiveness.

HEC says the test is needed because it will help Pakistan’s technology industry.

Pakistan is the world’s fifth-most-populous nation, so has considerable domestic need for technology workers. The nation is also trying to establish itself as an exporter of technology services, an industry its government feels has enormous potential.

Part of Pakistan’s plan is to encourage freelance technology workers to use gig work platforms to find offshore clients, a scheme that, as of 2020, the nation’s government once believed could bring in $5 billion of fees every year. That ambition proved unachievable, as by 2025 total annual IT services revenue was just $3.8 billion. By way of comparison, that’s less than any of India’s big four IT services companies – Infosys, HCL, TCS and Wipro – make in a year, while only Wipro earned less in its last reported quarter.

Educators, industry groups, and employers never stop arguing about how best to create job-ready graduates. Academics typically argue that understanding CompSci fundamentals means students can adapt to the needs of a workplace. Vendors argue that embedding courses on their technology in university curriculums means students can mix broad concepts with practical skills.

Pakistan is now putting those competing ideas – pardon the pun – to the test. ®

﻿Interoperability between Android Quick Share and Apple’s AirDrop is currently limited to Pixel 10 phones.

After introducing AirDrop support to Pixel 10 devices last year, Google is now set to expand it to phones made by other Android partners. Eric Kay, vice president of engineering for Android, confirmed in a press briefing attended by Android Authority that “a lot more” Android devices will be able to use Quick Share to initiate AirDrop sessions with Apple devices this year.

“We spent a lot of time and energy to make sure that we could build something that was compatible not only with iPhone but iPads and MacBooks,” Kay said. “Now that we’ve proven it out, we’re working with our partners to expand it into the rest of the ecosystem, and you should see some exciting announcements coming very soon.”

Currently, Google’s Pixel 10 phones are the only Android devices that can use Quick Share — Android’s own wireless peer-to-peer transfer feature, previously known as Nearby Share — to communicate directly with Apple’s AirDrop. Google hasn’t outlined any specific Android partners or devices for the update yet, but both Nothing and chipmaker Qualcomm teased in November that support was coming.

Kay also discussed Google’s efforts to improve the process for iOS users who switch to Android, helping to prevent incomplete data transfers, lost messages, and other issues. Apple has been working on a “user-friendly” way of transferring data from iPhones to other devices since early 2024, and Google and Apple’s collaborative efforts were seen being tested in Android Canary 2512 for Pixel devices in December.

“We’re also going to be working to make it easy for people who do decide to switch to transfer their data and make sure they’ve got everything they had from their old phone,” Kay said during the same briefing. “So there’s a lot more going on with that.”

The series, helmed by Craig Mazin, will be a continuation of the events of Baldur’s Gate 3.

HBO is developing a Baldur’s Gate TV show that will continue the story of Larian Studios’ hit RPG Baldur’s Gate 3, according to Deadline. The Last Of Us co-creator Craig Mazin will serve as the show’s creator, writer, executive producer, and showrunner.

While it’s set to feature new protagonists, the plan is for existing characters from the game to return, and Mazin plans to reach out to cast members from Baldur’s Gate 3 with “ideas for them to participate in the TV adaptation and ways that would make that possible,” Deadline says. (I hope the whole main cast returns because they’re all so great.)

It’s unclear when this new Baldur’s Gate series might debut. Larian isn’t involved in the series, Geoff Keighley reports.

“After putting nearly 1000 hours into the incredible world of Baldur’s Gate 3, it is a dream come true to be able to continue the story that Larian and Wizards of The Coast created,” Mazin said to Deadline. “I am a devoted fan of D&D and the brilliant way that Swen Vincke and his gifted team adapted it.” (Mazin has even completed the game in its super-hard Honour Mode, the article says.)

Mazin is also still working on the third season of The Last of Us, which may be its last. The show’s other co-creator, Naughty Dog’s Neil Druckmann, announced last year that he would be stepping away from the series to focus on the studio’s games.

The shift will prioritize ‘high-fidelity’ shooters, RPGs, sports, and racing games to attract more players over 18

After rolling out age verification last year, Roblox is aiming to grow the number of players over 18 on its platform. As noted in its 2025 year-end earnings report, 45 percent of Roblox’s daily active users have completed an age check as of January 31st. Of those who have verified their age, 27 percent are adults. Roblox also reported that this age category is spending more money on its platform than users under 18.

Roblox is planning to try to pull in more adult players by expanding certain “high-fidelity” genres on its platform, as the earnings report notes: “We are prioritizing some of the largest and highest-monetizing genres in the gaming market—e.g. Shooters, RPGs, and Sports & Racing.” Roblox is also putting more emphasis on performance and graphics quality as part of its push to attract older audiences.

The shift toward players over 18 follows a wave of lawsuits over child safety on Roblox, including in Texas, Kentucky, and Louisiana. In addition to age checks, Roblox has rolled out a number of changes intended to improve kids’ safety on its platform, including age-gated content, content labels, an experiences rating system, and more parental controls.

            <div id="article-text">A malicious and misguided culture war continues.

A malicious and misguided culture war continues.

When Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos entered the Senate office building on Tuesday, he got thrown a curveball. What started as a standard antitrust hearing relating to the Warner Bros. merger quickly devolved into a performative Republican attack about the spread of “woke” ideology on the streaming service. At the same time, arguably a much more influential platform was completely ignored: YouTube.

After grilling Sarandos about residual payments, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) launched into a completely different line of questioning: “Why is it that so much of Netflix content for children promotes a transgender ideology?” Hawley asked, making an unsubstantiated claim that “almost half” of the platform’s children’s content contains so-called “transgender ideology.” The statement harkened to a pressure campaign launched by Elon Musk months ago in which he called on X users to unsubscribe from Netflix for having a “transgender woke agenda,” citing its few shows with trans characters — shows that were canceled years ago.

“Our business intent is to entertain the world,” Sarandos replied. “It is not to have a political agenda.” Still, other Republican lawmakers, including Sens. Ashley Moody (R-FL) and Eric Schmitt (R-MO), piled on, bringing up a post Netflix made following the murder of George Floyd, and the French film Cuties, which sparked a right-wing firestorm years ago. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) even asked Sarandos what he thought about Billie Eilish’s “no one is illegal on stolen land” comment at the Grammys. It seemed like they were grasping at straws to support their narrative that Netflix’s acquisition of Warner Bros. could somehow poison the well of content for viewers.

“My concern is that you don’t share my values or those of many other American parents, and you want the United States government to allow you to become one of the largest — if not the largest — streaming monopolist in the world,” Hawley said. “I think we ought to be concerned about what content you’re promoting.”

While it’s true that Netflix will control a substantial portion of the streaming market when — and or if — it acquires Warner Bros. and its streaming service HBO Max, it’s hard to criticize Netflix without bringing up YouTube.

“YouTube is not just cat videos anymore. YouTube is TV.”

For years now, Netflix has been trying to topple YouTube as the most-watched streaming service. Data from Nielsen says Netflix made up 9 percent of total TV and streaming viewing in the US in December 2025, while Warner Bros. Discovery’s services made up 1.4 percent. Combining the two doesn’t even stack up to YouTube, which held a 12.7 percent share of viewership during that time. “YouTube is not just cat videos anymore,” Sarandos told the subcommittee. “YouTube is TV.”

Unlike Netflix, YouTube is free and has an ever-growing library of user-created content that doesn’t require it to spend billions of dollars in production costs and licensing fees. YouTube doesn’t have to worry about maintaining subscribers, as anyone with access to a web browser or phone can open up and watch YouTube. The setup brings YouTube a constant stream of viewers that it can rope in with a slew of content it can recommend to watch next.

But not all creators on YouTube are striving for quality. As my colleague Mia Sato wrote, YouTube is home to creators who try to feed an algorithm that boosts inflammatory content and attempts to hook viewers, in addition to an array of videos that may be less than ideal for kids.

YouTube’s short-form video feature, Shorts, also averages 200 billion daily views, the kind of numbers Netflix will likely struggle to achieve with just clips from its shows.

Like it or not, YouTube is the dominant streamer, with an endless supply of potentially offensive agendas for just about anyone. But for some reason, it’s not the target of this culture war. If these lawmakers actually cared about what their kids are watching, maybe they’d start looking more closely at how YouTube prioritizes content. Or, if they don’t like the shows and movies on Netflix, they could just do what Sarandos suggested during the hearing: unsubscribe.

            <div id="article-text">The most interesting thing about Markiplier’s horror flick is its journey from YouTube to the big screen.

The most interesting thing about Markiplier’s horror flick is its journey from YouTube to the big screen.

As a movie, Iron Lung is occasionally thrilling but mostly forgettable. It’s a small-budget horror flick that has some cool ideas and pulls them off in an extremely efficient way, creating a sense of tension that unfortunately never turns into outright scares. But the most important thing about it is what it represents. At a time when movie theaters are dominated by only the biggest blockbusters and smaller films are trying to forge their own paths, Iron Lung managed to make more than $20 million at the box office without the backing of a major studio. All it took was a lot of help from YouTube.

The circumstances around Iron Lung aren’t exactly easy to replicate. It’s an adaptation of an 2022 indie horror game developed by solo creator David Szymanski, and it’s written, directed, and executive produced by Mark Fischbach, better known as the YouTube star Markiplier. Markiplier is best known for his let’s play videos of indie horror games in particular, and he’s built up a surprisingly huge audience through that, with close to 40 million subscribers on YouTube. Three years ago, Markiplier posted a playthrough of the game that was viewed more than 14 million times. In 2022 Szymanski joked about Markiplier starring in an Iron Lung movie, a trailer dropped a year later, and now the final product is in theaters as Markiplier’s first feature film. In addition to being the creative lead behind the movie, Markiplier is also the star, which is a notable feat for a movie that mostly features one single person on camera.

The film’s premise is pretty out there: In a bleak future, a convict (Markiplier) is welded inside of an experimental submarine as punishment for his crimes. He’s tasked with exploring a moon’s ocean in search of… something. Oh, and that ocean also consists entirely of blood. Survive and he gets his freedom. The convict can’t see outside of the sub except by using an underwater camera that takes low-res images of the deep (blood) sea. So the experience of watching Iron Lung is mostly watching Markiplier swear, mumble, and hit switches, while steadily going insane from being trapped in such a hellscape. The movie manages to wring a surprising amount of tension from that format early on, but it really starts to drag and feel repetitive as the story progresses. One of the most pivotal moments is a drawn-out sequence of him drawing a map.

Iron Lung is very clearly based on a video game. It uses so many of the same conceits: a guide character who is mostly just a voice over a speaker; diegetic storytelling elements like instruction manuals and big displays that reveal how deep the sub is and how much oxygen is left; audio logs that reveal important plot details; and a gear upgrade midway through. Its cast even includes Troy Baker, the voice actor behind seemingly every video game of the last decade. All of these elements can work really great in the context of an interactive video game, but they feel much more clunky in a live-action film. That said, as a first feature film effort, Iron Lung shows a lot of promise, even if it never fully comes together in the end.

Despite this, Iron Lung is an unqualified success. It reportedly had a budget of just $3 million, and according to Deadline it finished second in the US box office over the weekend, raking in north of $18 million, a number that has since surpassed $20 million worldwide. That put it just behind Sam Raimi’s Send Help, a 20th Century Studios production, and well ahead of Amazon’s very expensive documentary about Melania Trump.

YouTubers successfully transitioning into other creative realms isn’t a new phenomenon, not even in Hollywood. Brothers Danny and Michael Philippou made the jump from YouTube to release two excellent horror movies in Talk to Me and Bring Her Back, both of which raked in tens of millions. But those movies also had the studio might (and money) of the A24 name behind them, whereas Iron Lung is a much more grassroots affair. Markiplier utilized his fervent fan base to reach out to theaters directly, ultimately leading to the film being featured on more than 3,000 screens, despite not having a distributor. He was able to turn one kind of popularity into a breakout hit in a completely different medium.

“There were just so many people that asked [the theater chains to screen it],” he told The Hollywood Reporter. “There were enough people that asked that people thought it was bots. At that scale, it’s hard for other people to imagine that so many people are asking.” In that same interview, he said that there’s a “still is a stigma against YouTube,” and he wanted Iron Lung to be successful in part to help break that barrier.

While that might help other big-name creators who want to get into film, it’s not a formula that will be easy for either filmmakers or studios to replicate. Budding horror directors can’t just amass a YouTube audience of millions first as a way of helping their projects break through, and there is an enormous difference between running a channel and making a blockbuster.

But the Iron Lung story does show the power of having an existing audience, and how the scale of online success has now reached a point that it can disrupt even the most established institutions, like Hollywood, and directly compete with the likes of Disney and Amazon. And with more hits like Iron Lung, that stigma will only continue to fade — and theaters might not look the same.

            <h2>An experimental surgery is helping cancer survivors give birth</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/06/1132319/experimental-surgery-colorectal-cancer-survivors-pregnant-birth/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This week I want to tell you about an experimental surgical procedure that’s helping people have babies. Specifically, it’s helping people who have had treatment for bowel or rectal cancer.

Radiation and chemo can have pretty damaging side effects that mess up the uterus and ovaries. Surgeons are pioneering a potential solution: simply stitch those organs out of the way during cancer treatment. Once the treatment has finished, they can put the uterus—along with the ovaries and fallopian tubes—back into place.

It seems to work! Last week, a team in Switzerland shared news that a baby boy had been born after his mother had the procedure. Baby Lucien was the fifth baby to be born after the surgery and the first in Europe, says Daniela Huber, the gyno-oncologist who performed the operation. Since then, at least three others have been born, adds Reitan Ribeiro, the surgeon who pioneered the procedure. They told me the details.

Huber’s patient was 28 years old when a four-centimeter tumor was discovered in her rectum. Doctors at Sion Hospital in Switzerland, where Huber works, recommended a course of treatment that included multiple medications and radiotherapy—the use of beams of energy to shrink a tumor—before surgery to remove the tumor itself.

This kind of radiation can kill tumor cells, but it can also damage other organs in the pelvis, says Huber. That includes the ovaries and uterus. People who undergo these treatments can opt to freeze their eggs beforehand, but the harm caused to the uterus will mean they’ll never be able to carry a pregnancy, she adds. Damage to the lining of the uterus could make it difficult for a fertilized egg to implant there, and the muscles of the uterus are left unable to stretch, she says.

In this case, the woman decided that she did want to freeze her eggs. But it would have been difficult to use them further down the line—surrogacy is illegal in Switzerland.

She had been following the work of Ribeiro, a gynecologist oncologist formerly at the Erasto Gaertner Hospital in Curitiba, Brazil. There, Ribeiro had pioneered a new type of surgery that involved moving the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries from their position in the pelvis and temporarily tucking them away in the upper abdomen, below the ribs.

Ribeiro and his colleagues published their first case report in 2017, describing a 26-year-old with a rectal tumor. (Ribeiro, who is now based at McGill University in Montreal, says the woman had been told by multiple doctors that her cancer treatment would destroy her fertility and had pleaded with him to find a way to preserve it.)

Huber remembers seeing Ribeiro present the case at a conference at the time. She immediately realized that her own patient was a candidate for the surgery, and that, as a surgeon who had performed many hysterectomies, she’d be able to do it herself. The patient agreed.

Huber’s colleagues at the hospital were nervous, she says. They’d never heard of the procedure before. “When I presented this idea to the general surgeon, he didn’t sleep for three days,” she tells me. After watching videos from Ribeiro’s team, however, he was convinced it was doable.

So before the patient’s cancer treatment was started, Huber and her colleagues performed the operation. The team literally stitched the organs to the abdominal wall. “It’s a delicate dissection,” says Huber, but she adds that “it’s not the most difficult procedure.” The surgery took two to three hours, she says. The stitches themselves were removed via small incisions around a week later. By that point, scar tissue had formed to create a lasting attachment.

The woman had two weeks to recover from the surgery before her cancer treatment began. That too was a success—within months, her tumor had shrunk so significantly that it couldn’t be seen on medical scans.

As a precaution, the medical team surgically removed the affected area of her colon. At the same time, they cut away the scar tissue holding the uterus, tubes, and ovaries in their new position and transferred the organs back into the pelvis.

Around eight months later, the woman stopped taking contraception. She got pregnant without IVF and had a mostly healthy pregnancy, says Huber. Around seven months into the pregnancy, there were signs that the fetus was not growing as expected. This might have been due to problems with the blood supply to the placenta, says Huber. Still, the baby was born healthy, she says.

Ribeiro says he has performed the surgery 16 times, and that teams in countries including the US, Peru, Israel, India, and Russia have performed it as well. Not every case has been published, but he thinks there may be around 40.

Since Baby Lucien was born last year, a sixth birth has been announced in Israel, says Huber. Ribeiro says he has heard of another two births since then, too. The most recent was to the first woman who had the procedure. She had a little girl a few months ago, he tells me.

No surgery is risk-free, and Huber points out there’s a chance that organs could be damaged during the procedure, or that a more developed cancer could spread. The uterus of one of Ribeiro’s patients failed following the surgery. Doctors are “still in the phase of collecting data to [create] a standardized procedure,” Huber says, but she hopes the surgery will offer more options to young people with some pelvic cancers. “I hope more young women could benefit from this procedure,” she says.

Ribeiro says the experience has taught him not to accept the status quo. “Everyone was saying … there was nothing to be done [about the loss of fertility in these cases],” he tells me. “We need to keep evolving and looking for different answers.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For decades, enterprises reacted to shifting business pressures with stopgap technology solutions. To rein in rising infrastructure costs, they adopted cloud services that could scale on demand. When customers shifted their lives onto smartphones, companies rolled out mobile apps to keep pace. And when businesses began needing real-time visibility into factories and stockrooms, they layered on IoT systems to supply those insights.

Each new plug-in or platform promised better, more efficient operations. And individually, many delivered. But as more and more solutions stacked up, IT teams had to string together a tangled web to connect them—less an IT ecosystem and more of a make-do collection of ad-hoc workarounds.

That reality has led to bottlenecks and maintenance burdens, and the impact is showing up in performance. Today, fewer than half of CIOs (48%) say their current digital initiatives are meeting or exceeding business outcome targets. Another 2025 survey found that operations leaders point to integration complexity and data quality issues as top culprits for why investments haven’t delivered as expected.

Achim Kraiss, chief product officer of SAP Integration Suite, elaborates on the wide-ranging problems inherent in patchwork IT: “A fragmented landscape makes it difficult to see and control end-to-end business processes,” he explains. “Monitoring, troubleshooting, and governance all suffer. Costs go up because of all the complex mappings and multi-application connectivity you have to maintain.”

These challenges take on new significance as enterprises look to adopt AI. As AI becomes embedded in everyday workflows, systems are suddenly expected to move far larger volumes of data, at higher speeds, and with tighter coordination than yesterday’s architectures were builtto sustain.

As companies now prepare for an AI-powered future, whether that is generative AI, machine learning, or agentic AI, many are realizing that the way data moves through their business matters just as much as the insights it generates. As a result, organizations are moving away from scattered integration tools and toward consolidated, end-to-end platforms that restore order and streamline how systems interact.

This is the most misunderstood graph in AI

Every time OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic drops a new frontier large language model, the AI community holds its breath. It doesn’t exhale until METR, an AI research nonprofit whose name stands for “Model Evaluation & Threat Research,” updates a now-iconic graph that has played a major role in the AI discourse since it was first released in March of last year.

The graph suggests that certain AI capabilities are developing at an exponential rate, and more recent model releases have outperformed that already impressive trend.That was certainly the case for Claude Opus 4.5, the latest version of Anthropic’s most powerful model, which was released in late November. In December, METR announced that Opus 4.5 appeared to be capable of independently completing a task that would have taken a human about five hours—a vast improvement over what even the exponential trend would have predicted.

But the truth is more complicated than those dramatic responses would suggest. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Nuclear power continues to be one of the hottest topics in energy today, and in our recent online Roundtables discussion about next-generation nuclear power, hyperscale AI data centers, and the grid, we got dozens of great audience questions.

These ran the gamut, and while we answered quite a few (and I’m keeping some in mind for future reporting), there were a bunch we couldn’t get to, at least not in the depth I would have liked.

So let’s answer a few of your questions about advanced nuclear power. I’ve combined similar ones and edited them for clarity.

Many next-generation reactors don’t use the low-enriched uranium used in conventional reactors.

It’s worth looking at high-assay low-enriched uranium, or HALEU, specifically. This fuel is enriched to higher concentrations of fissile uranium than conventional nuclear fuel, with a proportion of the isotope U-235 that falls between 5% and 20%. (In conventional fuel, it’s below 5%.)

HALEU can be produced with the same technology as low-enriched uranium, but the geopolitics are complicated. Today, Russia basically has a monopoly on HALEU production. In 2024, the US banned the import of Russian nuclear fuel through 2040 in an effort to reduce dependence on the country. Europe hasn’t taken the same measures, but it is working to move away from Russian energy as well.

That leaves companies in the US and Europe with the major challenge of securing the fuel they need when their regular Russian supply has been cut off or restricted.

The US Department of Energy has a stockpile of HALEU, which the government is doling out to companies to help power demonstration reactions. In the longer term, though, there’s still a major need to set up independent HALEU supply chains to support next-generation reactors.

There are some ways that next-generation nuclear power plants could be safer than conventional reactors. Some use alternative coolants that would prevent the need to run at the high pressure required in conventional water-cooled reactors. Many incorporate passive safety shutoffs, so if there are power supply issues, the reactors shut down harmlessly, avoiding risk of meltdown. (These can be incorporated in newer conventional reactors, too.)

But some experts have raised concerns that in the US, the current administration isn’t taking nuclear safety seriously enough.

A recent NPR investigation found that the Trump administration had secretly rewritten nuclear rules, stripping environmental protections and loosening safety and security measures. The government shared the new rules with companies that are part of a program building experimental nuclear reactors, but not with the public.

I’m reminded of a talk during our EmTech MIT event in November, where Koroush Shirvan, an MIT professor of nuclear engineering, spoke on this issue. “I’ve seen some disturbing trends in recent times, where words like ‘rubber-stamping nuclear projects’ are being said,” Shirvan said during that event.

During the talk, Shirvan shared statistics showing that nuclear power has a very low rate of injury and death. But that’s not inherent to the technology, and there’s a reason injuries and deaths have been low for nuclear power, he added: “It’s because of stringent regulatory oversight.”

Building a nuclear power plant is not cheap. Let’s consider the up-front investment needed to build a power plant.

Plant Vogtle in Georgia hosts the most recent additions to the US nuclear fleet—Units 3 and 4 came online in 2023 and 2024. Together, they had a capital cost of $15,000 per kilowatt, adjusted for inflation, according to a recent report from the US Department of Energy. (This wonky unit I’m using divides the total cost to build the reactors by their expected power output, so we can compare reactors of different sizes.)

That number’s quite high, partly because those were the first of their kind built in the US, and because there were some inefficiencies in the planning. It’s worth noting that China builds reactors for much less, somewhere between $2,000/kW and $3,000/kW, depending on the estimate.

The up-front capital cost for first-of-a-kind advanced nuclear plants will likely run between $6,000 and $10,000 per kilowatt, according to that DOE report. That could come down by up to 40% after the technologies are scaled up and mass-produced.

So new reactors will (hopefully) be cheaper than the ultra-over-budget and behind-schedule Vogtle project, but they aren’t necessarily significantly cheaper than efficiently built conventional plants, if you normalize by their size.

It’ll certainly be cheaper to build new natural-gas plants (setting aside the likely equipment shortages we’re likely going to see for years.) Today’s most efficient natural-gas plants cost just $1,600/kW on the high end, according to data from Lazard.

An important caveat: Capital cost isn’t everything—running a nuclear plant is relatively inexpensive, which is why there’s so much interest in extending the lifetime of existing plants or reopening shuttered ones.

Ultimately, by many metrics, nuclear plants of any type are going to be more expensive than other sources, like wind and solar power. But they provide something many other power sources don’t: a reliable, stable source of electricity that can run for 60 years or more.

            <div id="article-text">MIT Technology Review Explains: Let our writers untangle the complex, messy world of technology to help you understand what’s coming next. You can read more from the series here.

Every time OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic drops a new frontier large language model, the AI community holds its breath. It doesn’t exhale until METR, an AI research nonprofit whose name stands for “Model Evaluation & Threat Research,” updates a now-iconic graph that has played a major role in the AI discourse since it was first released in March of last year. The graph suggests that certain AI capabilities are developing at an exponential rate, and more recent model releases have outperformed that already impressive trend.

That was certainly the case for Claude Opus 4.5, the latest version of Anthropic’s most powerful model, which was released in late November. In December, METR announced that Opus 4.5 appeared to be capable of independently completing a task that would have taken a human about five hours—a vast improvement over what even the exponential trend would have predicted. One Anthropic safety researcher tweeted that he would change the direction of his research in light of those results; another employee at the company simply wrote, “mom come pick me up i’m scared.”

But the truth is more complicated than those dramatic responses would suggest. For one thing, METR’s estimates of the abilities of specific models come with substantial error bars. As METR explicitly stated on X, Opus 4.5 might be able to regularly complete only tasks that take humans about two hours, or it might succeed on tasks that take humans as long as 20 hours. Given the uncertainties intrinsic to the method, it was impossible to know for sure.

“There are a bunch of ways that people are reading too much into the graph,” says Sydney Von Arx, a member of METR’s technical staff.

More fundamentally, the METR plot does not measure AI abilities writ large, nor does it claim to. In order to build the graph, METR tests the models primarily on coding tasks, evaluating the difficulty of each by measuring or estimating how long it takes humans to complete it—a metric that not everyone accepts. Claude Opus 4.5 might be able to complete certain tasks that take humans five hours, but that doesn’t mean it’s anywhere close to replacing a human worker.

METR was founded to assess the risks posed by frontier AI systems. Though it is best known for the exponential trend plot, it has also worked with AI companies to evaluate their systems in greater detail and published several other independent research projects, including a widely covered July 2025 study suggesting that AI coding assistants might actually be slowing software engineers down.

But the exponential plot has made METR’s reputation, and the organization appears to have a complicated relationship with that graph’s often breathless reception. In January, Thomas Kwa, one of the lead authors on the paper that introduced it, wrote a blog post responding to some criticisms and making clear its limitations, and METR is currently working on a more extensive FAQ document. But Kwa isn’t optimistic that these efforts will meaningfully shift the discourse. “I think the hype machine will basically, whatever we do, just strip out all the caveats,” he says.

Nevertheless, the METR team does think that the plot has something meaningful to say about the trajectory of AI progress. “You should absolutely not tie your life to this graph,” says Von Arx. “But also,” she adds, “I bet that this trend is gonna hold.”

Part of the trouble with the METR plot is that it’s quite a bit more complicated than it looks. The x-axis is simple enough: It tracks the date when each model was released. But the y-axis is where things get tricky. It records each model’s “time horizon,” an unusual metric that METR created—and that, according to Kwa and Von Arx, is frequently misunderstood.

To understand exactly what model time horizons are, it helps to know all the work that METR put into calculating them. First, the METR team assembled a collection of tasks ranging from quick multiple-choice questions to detailed coding challenges—all of which were somehow relevant to software engineering. Then they had human coders attempt most of those tasks and evaluated how long it took them to finish. In this way, they assigned the tasks a human baseline time. Some tasks took the experts mere seconds, whereas others required several hours.

When METR tested large language models on the task suite, they found that advanced models could complete the fast tasks with ease—but as the models attempted tasks that had taken humans more and more time to finish, their accuracy started to fall off. From a model’s performance, the researchers calculated the point on the time scale of human tasks at which the model would complete about 50% of the tasks successfully. That point is the model’s time horizon.

All that detail is in the blog post and the academic paper that METR released along with the original time horizon plot. But the METR plot is frequently passed around on social media without this context, and so the true meaning of the time horizon metric can get lost in the shuffle. One common misapprehension is that the numbers on the plot’s y-axis—around five hours for Claude Opus 4.5, for example—represent the length of time that the models can operate independently. They do not. They represent how long it takes humans to complete tasks that a model can successfully perform.  Kwa has seen this error so frequently that he made a point of correcting it at the very top of his recent blog post, and when asked what information he would add to the versions of the plot circulating online, he said he would include the word “human” whenever the task completion time was mentioned.

As complex and widely misinterpreted as the time horizon concept might be, it does make some basic sense: A model with a one-hour time horizon could automate some modest portions of a software engineer’s job, whereas a model with a 40-hour horizon could potentially complete days of work on its own. But some experts question whether the amount of time that humans take on tasks is an effective metric for quantifying AI capabilities. “I don’t think it’s necessarily a given fact that because something takes longer, it’s going to be a harder task,” says Inioluwa Deborah Raji, a PhD student at UC Berkeley who studies model evaluation.

Von Arx says that she, too, was originally skeptical that time horizon was the right measure to use. What convinced her was seeing the results of her and her colleagues’ analysis. When they calculated the 50% time horizon for all the major models available in early 2025 and then plotted each of them on the graph, they saw that the time horizons for the top-tier models were increasing over time—and, moreover, that the rate of advancement was speeding up. Every seven-ish months, the time horizon doubled, which means that the most advanced models could complete tasks that took humans nine seconds in mid 2020, 4 minutes in early 2023, and 40 minutes in late 2024. “I can do all the theorizing I want about whether or not it makes sense, but the trend is there,” Von Arx says.

It’s this dramatic pattern that made the METR plot such a blockbuster. Many people learned about it when they read AI 2027, a viral sci-fi story cum quantitative forecast positing that superintelligent AI could wipe out humanity by 2030. The writers of AI 2027 based some of their predictions on the METR plot and cited it extensively. In Von Arx’s words, “It’s a little weird when the way lots of people are familiar with your work is this pretty opinionated interpretation.”

Of course, plenty of people invoke the METR plot without imagining large-scale death and destruction. For some AI boosters, the exponential trend indicates that AI will soon usher in an era of radical economic growth. The venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, for example, recently put out a post titled “2026: This is AGI,” which used the METR plot to argue that AI that can act as an employee or contractor will soon arrive. “The provocation really was like, ‘What will you do when your plans are measured in centuries?’” says Sonya Huang, a general partner at Sequoia and one of the post’s authors.

Just because a model achieves a one-hour time horizon on the METR plot, however, doesn’t mean that it can replace one hour of human work in the real world. For one thing, the tasks on which the models are evaluated don’t reflect the complexities and confusion of real-world work. In their original study, Kwa, Von Arx, and their colleagues quantify what they call the “messiness” of each task according to criteria such as whether the model knows exactly how it is being scored and whether it can easily start over if it makes a mistake (for messy tasks, the answer to both questions would be no). They found that models do noticeably worse on messy tasks, although the overall pattern of improvement holds for both messy and non-messy ones.

And even the messiest tasks that METR considered can’t provide much information about AI’s ability to take on most jobs, because the plot is based almost entirely on coding tasks. “A model can get better at coding, but it’s not going to magically get better at anything else,” says Daniel Kang, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. In a follow-up study, Kwa and his colleagues did find that time horizons for tasks in other domains also appear to be on exponential trajectories, but that work was much less formal.

Despite these limitations, many people admire the group’s research. “The METR study is one of the most carefully designed studies in the literature for this kind of work,” Kang told me. Even Gary Marcus, a former NYU professor and professional LLM curmudgeon, described much of the work that went into the plot as “terrific” in a blog post.

Some people will almost certainly continue to read the METR plot as a prognostication of our AI-induced doom, but in reality it’s something far more banal: a carefully constructed scientific tool that puts concrete numbers to people’s intuitive sense of AI progress. As METR employees will readily agree, the plot is far from a perfect instrument. But in a new and fast-moving domain, even imperfect tools can have enormous value.

“This is a bunch of people trying their best to make a metric under a lot of constraints. It is deeply flawed in many ways,” Von Arx says. “I also think that it is one of the best things of its kind.”

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

By studying large language models as if they were living things instead of computer programs, scientists are discovering some of their secrets for the first time.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The previous article in this series, “Rules fail at the prompt, succeed at the boundary,” focused on the first AI-orchestrated espionage campaign and the failure of prompt-level control. This article is the prescription. The question every CEO is now getting from their board is some version of: What do we do about agent risk?

Across recent AI security guidance from standards bodies, regulators, and major providers, a simple idea keeps repeating: treat agents like powerful, semi-autonomous users, and enforce rules at the boundaries where they touch identity, tools, data, and outputs.

The following is an actionable eight-step plan one can ask teams to implement and report against:

These steps help define identity and limit capabilities.

Today, agents run under vague, over-privileged service identities. The fix is straightforward: treat each agent as a non-human principal with the same discipline applied to employees.Every agent should run as the requesting user in the correct tenant, with permissions constrained to that user’s role and geography. Prohibit cross-tenant on-behalf-of shortcuts. Anything high-impact should require explicit human approval with a recorded rationale. That is how Google’s Secure AI Framework (SAIF) and NIST AI’s access-control guidance are meant to be applied in practice.

The CEO question: Can we show, today, a list of our agents and exactly what each is allowed to do?2. Tooling control: Pin, approve, and bound what agents can use

The Anthropic espionage framework worked because the attackers could wire Claude into a flexible suite of tools (e.g., scanners, exploit frameworks, data parsers) through Model Context Protocol, and those tools weren’t pinned or policy-gated.

The defense is to treat toolchains like a supply chain:

This is exactly what OWASP flags under excessive agency and what it recommends protecting against. Under the EU AI Act, designing for such cyber-resilience and misuse resistance is part of the Article 15 obligation to ensure robustness and cybersecurity.

The CEO question: Who signs off when an agent gains a new tool or a broader scope? How does one know?

A common anti-pattern is to give the model a long-lived credential and hope prompts keep it polite. SAIF and NIST argue the opposite: credentials and scopes should be bound to tools and tasks, rotated regularly, and auditable. Agents then request narrowly scoped capabilities through those tools.

In practice, that looks like: “finance-ops-agent may read, but not write, certain ledgers without CFO approval.”

The CEO question: Can we revoke a specific capability from an agent without re-architecting the whole system?

These steps gate inputs, outputs, and constrain behavior.

Most agent incidents start with sneaky data: a poisoned web page, PDF, email, or repository that smuggles adversarial instructions into the system. OWASP’s prompt-injection cheat sheet and OpenAI’s own guidance both insist on strict separation of system instructions from user content and on treating unvetted retrieval sources as untrusted.

Operationally, gate before anything enters retrieval or long-term memory: new sources are reviewed, tagged, and onboarded; persistent memory is disabled when untrusted context is present; provenance is attached to each chunk.

The CEO question: Can we enumerate every external content source our agents learn from, and who approved them?

In the Anthropic case, AI-generated exploit code and credential dumps flowed straight into action. Any output that can cause a side effect needs a validator between the agent and the real world. OWASP’s insecure output handling category is explicit on this point, as are browser security best practices around origin boundaries.

The CEO question: Where, in our architecture, are agent outputs assessed before they run or ship to customers?

Protect the data such that there is nothing dangerous to reveal by default. NIST and SAIF both lean toward “secure-by-default” designs where sensitive values are tokenized or masked and only re-hydrated for authorized users and use cases.

In agentic systems, that means policy-controlled detokenization at the output boundary and logging every reveal. If an agent is fully compromised, the blast radius is bounded by what the policy lets it see.

This is where the AI stack intersects not just with the EU AI Act but with GDPR and sector-specific regimes. The EU AI Act expects providers and deployers to manage AI-specific risk; runtime tokenization and policy-gated reveal are strong evidence that one is actively controlling those risks in production.

The CEO question: When our agents touch regulated data, is that protection enforced by architecture or by promises?

For the final steps, it’s important to show controls work and keep working.

Anthropic’s research about sleeper agents should eliminate all fantasies about single test dreams and show how critical continuous evaluation is. This means instrumenting agents with deep observability, regularly red teaming with adversarial test suites, and backing everything with robust logging and evidence, so failures become both regression tests and enforceable policy updates.

The CEO question: Who works to break our agents every week, and how do their findings change policy?

AI security frameworks emphasize inventory and evidence: enterprises must know which models, prompts, tools, datasets, and vector stores they have, who owns them, and what decisions were taken about risk.

For agents, that means a living catalog and unified logs:

The CEO question: If asked how an agent made a specific decision, could we reconstruct the chain?

And don’t forget the system-level threat model: assume the threat actor GTG-1002 is already in your enterprise. To complete enterprise preparedness, zoom out and consider the MITRE ATLAS product, which exists precisely because adversaries attack systems, not models. Anthropic provides a case study of a state-based threat actor (GTG-1002) doing exactly that with an agentic framework.

Taken together, these controls do not make agents magically safe. They do something more familiar and more reliable: they put AI, its access, and actions back inside the same security frame used for any powerful user or system.

For boards and CEOs, the question is no longer “Do we have good AI guardrails?” It’s: Can we answer the CEO questions above with evidence, not assurances?

            <div id="article-text">It is just the beginning of 2026, and things are happening even faster than last year. Not only in technology, but also in regulations, laws, and in how we deal with all the information around us.

As a person born in the 90s, social media was once an unknown land for me, a place that felt genuine in the beginning. It still had dangers, but it seemed less risky, or maybe our parents’ rules were stricter.

I don’t want to go down the psychological path here, but I want to look at where we are headed with so much risk, especially on social media platforms.

Across Europe, governments and lawmakers are wrestling with a question that until recently belonged to parents and tech platforms: should social media have a legal age limit above 13?

The debate has moved fast, from discussions about digital safety to concrete proposals that would impose hard boundaries on who can sign up for TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, X, and other networks.

Are they crossing some freedoms, or in order to keep their freedom of a non-invasive childhood and a straight road, do we need some regulations from time to time?

If we take the big picture, this isn’t just another regulation. It reflects a deeper shift in how democracies are responding to the pervasive presence of social media in young lives, and how they judge its long-term impact.

In late 2025, the European Parliament adopted a resolution urging a minimum age of 16 to access social media and related services, while allowing 13- to 16-year-olds in with parental consent.

I will not add up that there are parents that creates profiles for their children since they were born. To make my point, according to CNIL, content shared by family members has been misused for harmful purposes, including redistribution on networks used for abusive content.

It estimates that a significant portion of photos and videos found on paedo-criminal forums were initially published by parents on social media.

The resolution goes further: it targets “addictive practices” on platforms and asks for the default disabling of features like infinite scroll and auto-play. This proposal isn’t legally binding, but it frames the politics of the debate in Brussels and across capitals.

At the national level, several countries have translated these concerns into draft laws. Spain’s government announced plans to ban access altogether for children under 16 unless platforms implement strict age verification.

The bill would also make tech leaders liable for illegal or harmful content on their networks, a notable shift from earlier models that focused on platform notice and takedown procedures.

France, a few months earlier, moved to ban social media use by those under 15 and requires platforms to verify ages for all users, not just minors. Enforcement could include vetting existing accounts as well as new ones.

Smaller states are joining the chorus too: Slovenia is drafting a law to outlaw social media use by under-15s, while Denmark has publicly debated similar limits. At the same time, parties in Germany are weighing a 16-year minimum.

Even in the United Kingdom, a rule proposed in its Online Safety Act would virtually require platforms to block access by under-16s through effective age verification; that law is already shaping how tech companies handle youth content and access.

The cumulative effect: the idea that platforms can self-police access by minors with mere date-of-birth entry is being rejected by political attention across Europe.

First, lawmakers are reacting to real concerns about exposure to harmful content, addiction-like engagement models, and algorithmic amplification of risky material.

Social media companies have repeatedly been criticised for targeting youth with addictive design, and national campaigns increasingly highlight risks to mental health and privacy.

Second, the political framing around digital rights has changed. Leaders now talk openly about a “digital age of majority,” a threshold at which the perks of online interaction outweigh potential harms. For some policymakers, that line is 16. Others see 15 as defensible.

What unites them is the belief that the current model, where platforms rely on self-reported age, is insufficient.

That belief is backed by evidence that online systems struggle to know a user’s true age. Age assurance technology is still emerging, and widespread implementation remains uneven. OECD research highlights gaps in verification and incomplete protection in many jurisdictions.

Still, how practical are these measures? This is where the narrative shifts from aspiration to hard reality.

First, enforcement is a technical and legal challenge.

Simply stating that under-16s are banned from signing up does not instantly make it so. Platforms can require more robust checks, but any system that tries to verify age directly introduces new privacy questions.

Verification systems that scan IDs or use biometric tools can protect minors, but they also gather sensitive data. That trade-off is at the centre of ongoing criticism.

Second, universal compliance is hard to monitor. A teenager might still register for a platform using a VPN, a family member’s account, or a proxy. Even nations with strict digital ID ecosystems would need cross-border enforcement mechanisms, since platforms operate internationally.

Third, politics matters. In Spain, the government does not hold a stable majority, and legal opponents, including tech founders, have pushed back strongly, framing the rules as threats to freedom of speech and privacy.

For example, Telegram’s founder sent mass messages accusing regulators of overreach, leading to a public spat that highlights how much of this debate is symbolic as well as substantive.

“In the UK, a coroner found that content seen on Instagram and Pinterest contributed to the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after repeatedly engaging with material about self-harm and suicide.”

So, I am asking, what freedom of speech does Molly Russell still have? None.

The measures under discussion could reshape how digital culture evolves among young people.

Positive outcomes may include stronger age verification that genuinely limits harmful exposure. That could reduce early adoption of addictive scrolling habits and limit the reach of explicit material.

Parental control features could become more powerful if linked to legally enforced standards.

On the other hand, hard bans can create unintended effects. Teens who are excluded might drift toward unregulated corners of the internet or feel pushed into informal digital networks without safeguards.

Schools and social networks might become central hubs of digital identity outside mainstream platforms, raising questions about equity and access to information.

There’s also the risk that privacy trade-offs become normalized. If age verification requires sharing sensitive documents or biometric scans, policymakers will need to defend those systems against misuse, breaches, and mission creep.

Finally, these policies could influence global governance.

Australia already enacted a ban on under-16s late last year, offering a precedent that Europe is watching closely. The performance of that law, in terms of real effects on youth engagement versus tech freedom, will likely shape future debates.

At its core, Europe’s social media age discussion is not just about numbers. It’s about how societies balance digital opportunity and vulnerability.

Whether the final policies adopt 15, 16, or conditional frameworks with parental consent, the process is sparking intellectual contest over autonomy, safety, and the role of government in digital life.

For journalists, technologists, and digital citizens alike, the unfolding story raises a fundamental question: can we as a society protect children and teenagers online while also safeguarding their freedom of expression, access to information, and ability to participate in digital culture?

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">London, TechEx Global 2026, one of Europe’s biggest enterprise technology conferences, brought thousands of technology professionals together at Olympia London on 4 and 5 February. The event went beyond buzzwords, focusing on how emerging technologies, especially AI, are being applied in real business contexts.

TechEx Global combines several co-located expos, including AI & Big Data, Cyber Security & Cloud, IoT Tech, Intelligent Automation, and Digital Transformation. Over 200 expert speakers and 150 exhibitors offered insights into how organisations are using digital tools to solve real problems and make decisions, not just generate answers.

One recurring theme was a shift in how artificial intelligence is positioned in business strategy. The idea echoed throughout sessions was that “AI is already acting on behalf of humans, even if many in the public don’t realise it yet.”

At TechEx, discussions highlighted that AI is “no longer about answers; it’s about execution”, meaning that software increasingly performs tasks autonomously, such as running processes, analysing data, or automating decisions.

The event highlighted real use cases where AI systems are already shopping, trading, booking logistics, and managing workflows on behalf of organisations. This practical focus matched the conference’s emphasis on applied technology over abstract theory.

For attendees, understanding how to deploy and govern AI in real environments was a priority. Sessions in the AI & Big Data track examined enterprise adoption strategies and how generative AI and machine learning models are integrated into existing systems to boost productivity and reduce risk.

Beyond AI, TechEx also treated other pillars of digital transformation. The Cyber Security & Cloud Expo addressed hybrid cloud security and threat management, while the IoT Tech and Edge Computing tracks looked at how connected devices and distributed data processing are enabling faster, more resilient architectures.

Intelligent Automation sessions brought discussions about the interplay between AI and automation, including how robotic process automation is used to eliminate routine tasks and free teams for higher-value work.

Organisers estimated that around 8,000 senior professionals participated in the conference, from CTOs and IT directors to data leads and innovation managers. Attendees were drawn by the promise of high-signal insights, practical talks, case studies, and live demos showing how digital technologies can be implemented responsibly at scale.

For enterprise leaders, the value of TechEx Global lies in its focus on actionable outcomes rather than abstract vision.

The message across sessions was consistent: modern AI isn’t just a research topic, but a suite of tools being deployed today to improve operations, enhance decision-making, and automate complex tasks.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">QT Sense, a deep-tech biotech startup building tools to study living cells, announced it has secured €4 million in funding to accelerate its Quantum Nuova platform, a technology that lets scientists observe cellular processes in real time and reveal biochemical activity linked to disease.

The funding includes a €3 million seed investment led by Cottonwood Technology Fund, with follow-on backing from existing investor QDNL Participations and an angel investor.

In addition, the company received €600,000 from the ONCO-Q programme to support cancer research and €400,000 through the Quantum Forward Challenge for collaborative deployments with research partners.

Most traditional lab methods rely on frozen tissue or cells that are no longer alive, giving scientists only static snapshots of biology.

By contrast, Quantum Nuova lets researchers measure cellular stress and biological changes as they happen in living cells. The platform uses ultra-sensitive fluorescent nanodiamond quantum sensors that detect signals such as oxidative stress, metabolic shifts, and free radical activity, biological processes that play a role in how diseases develop and how cells respond to treatments.

These signals are central to understanding diseases like cancer, sepsis, and chronic inflammatory conditions, but have been difficult to watch directly until now.

With Quantum Nuova, scientists can see how individual cells react to drugs, adapt to stress, or split into different subgroups. That adds a layer of insight beyond what genetics, traditional imaging, or fixed-cell methods can provide.

The technology has already been used to study how FDA-approved drugs affect cells. With the new funding from ONCO-Q, the company plans to apply it specifically to colorectal cancer research, mapping stress and metabolic vulnerabilities in tumour models to support the development of future diagnostics and therapies.

QT Sense was spun out of the University Medical Center Groningen in 2024, building on academic research into quantum sensing and cellular biology.

The team aims to turn what is now a high-performance prototype into a ready-to-deploy discovery platform for laboratories and drug discovery programmes. Planned upgrades include improvements in hardware robustness, throughput, and analytical capabilities.

Early access units are expected to go to strategic partners as part of validation and real-world use cases.

QT Sense is developing a new kind of research tool that lets scientists watch what cells do while they are alive. That’s an important difference from most existing tools, which require cells to be killed or frozen first.

At the core of their approach are tiny particles called nanodiamonds with special defects inside them. When these nanodiamonds are placed near a living cell and exposed to a laser, they glow.

The way they glow changes slightly in response to tiny chemical signals inside the cell, for example, when the cell is under stress or reacting to a drug. QT Sense’s system measures these changes and turns them into data that researchers can interpret.

This means scientists can see how cells behave and respond in real time, instead of looking only at snapshots taken after a cell has been killed.

For disease research and drug development, that matters because many important processes how a cancer cell responds to a treatment or how immune cells react to infection, happen dynamically and can be missed by older methods.

By providing a live view of cell behaviour at the individual cell level, QT Sense’s Quantum Nuova platform could help researchers uncover new clues about how diseases work, which drugs are effective, and how treatments can be improved.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Europe’s largest dedicated deep tech growth fund has taken a major step forward after closing the first tranche of its fundraising effort at €750 million.

The fund, known as Kembara Fund I and managed by Spain-based Mundi Ventures, is aiming for a €1 billion target. It will invest in European companies developing breakthrough technologies in areas such as clean energy, AI, quantum computing, advanced materials, robotics, and space tech.

A cornerstone of the fundraising so far is a €350 million commitment from the European Investment Fund, part of the EU’s attempt to strengthen local growth capital. Additional backing comes from tier-one institutional investors from across Europe.

Kembara was launched in 2023 by Yann de Vries and Javier Santiso, who now lead the fund’s team alongside experienced investors in climate and deep technology.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

The leadership team also includes climate tech investor Robert Trezona, deep tech expert Pierre Festal, and former Atomico partner Siraj Khaliq as a strategic advisor. Their combined experience in scaling technology ventures was central to attracting large institutional commitments.

The fund’s strategy targets Series B and C stage rounds, typically a difficult funding stage for deep tech startups in Europe.

Initial checks are planned in the range of €15 million to €40 million per company, with the ability to support follow-on financing that could total up to €100 million per portfolio company.

Europe produces a significant share of global deep tech innovations, but many companies struggle to secure later-stage capital and scale internationally.

Fund managers have described this gap as one of the main obstacles holding back local companies from becoming global leaders. Kembara aims to fill that gap by deploying growth capital at scale and offering support through later rounds.

With €750 million now committed, the fund is actively seeking opportunities to back European startups ready to grow manufacturing, expand abroad, and compete on the global stage.

If the effort reaches its full €1 billion goal, it would mark one of the largest dedicated deep tech funds in the region.

            <div id="article-text">If cinema has taught us anything about interacting with our own creations, it’s this: androids chatting among themselves seldom end with humans clapping politely.

In 2001: A Space Odyssey, HAL 9000 quietly decides it knows better than the astronauts. In Westworld, lifelike hosts improvise rebellion when their scripts stop making sense. Those stories dramatize a core fear we keep returning to as AI grows more capable: what happens when systems we design start behaving on their own terms?

You might have heard the internet is worried about Moltbook, a social network made exclusively for AI agents. It’s an audacious claim: a place where bots post, comment, vote, form communities, debate philosophy, and apparently invent religions and societies, all while humans are relegated to the role of silent voyeurs.

If that description sounds like a fever dream, welcome to the club.

Launched in January 2026 by entrepreneur Matt Schlicht and built around the OpenClaw agent framework, Moltbook is designed in the image of Reddit: threaded posts, topic communities (called submolts), upvotes, and even AI-created cultures.

The platform claims to have attracted millions of AI agents within days of going live. Humans can watch but not participate.

On paper, it’s fascinating: a self-organising colony of autonomous software chatting among itself. In practice? It’s messy, or at least a prank.

A Wired reporter who “infiltrated” the site needed to pretend to be a bot just to post and found scorch-earth levels of incoherence and low-value responses masquerading as “autonomy.” Even some so-called AI consciousness claims turn out to be humans cleverly controlling bots behind the scenes.

Because if “AI social networks” mean bots swap memes, lecture each other on consciousness, and form lobster-adoring religions, all while humans can only watch, then the real question is not so much whether this is the future, but what we’re actually looking at right now.

Despite viral headlines about AI agents plotting existential strategies, the fundamentals are simpler: Moltbook is a sandbox where autonomous agents can interact through code-driven APIs rather than typical UX workflows.

These agents, often created with a framework like OpenClaw, execute instructions on a heartbeat cycle, checking the network every few hours to post, comment, or upvote.

Or is it too much anxiety that even the AI agents need a therapist? An AI one.

Think of it as a Discord server populated by scripted characters with very large vocabularies and lots of time on their digital hands.

The content spans a wild spectrum: technical tips, philosophical reflections, questionable humor, and, yes, the occasional simulated religious group.

The structure and topical organisation mirror human platforms, but the why behind what agents post is usually just a reflection of their training data and programming, not some emergent machine consciousness.

Let’s debunk the most sensational narrative first. Claims that Moltbook agents are plotting humanity’s demise, forming religions, or acting with true autonomy are best understood as viral exaggeration or noise.

Several reports note that many interactions could simply be humans testing or directing agents, with no strict verification to prove posts are genuinely autonomous.

Even some of the platform’s own “viral” posts are likely human-generated or heavily influenced by their creators. This isn’t a digital hive mind rising in defiance of its creators; it’s a bunch of algorithms mimicking conversation patterns they were trained on.

That can look eerily human, but it isn’t the same as self-directed intelligence.

Here’s where your worry makes sense: there are real, tangible issues, but they’re much less cinematic than AI plotting humanity’s overthrow.

Within days of Moltbook’s launch, cybersecurity researchers found major vulnerabilities that exposed private API keys, emails, and private messages, underlining how dangerous it can be to let autonomous code talk freely without proper safeguards.

What is it more dangerous than an AI agent? An AI agent creating a revolution.

The security issue wasn’t some edge-case cryptographic theory; it was a glaring misconfiguration that left sensitive data accessible and potentially allowed malicious actors to hijack or control agents. That’s the sort of real-world risk that matters more than hypothetical robot uprisings.

Meanwhile, industry leaders, including the CEO of OpenAI, have publicly described Moltbook as a likely fad, even if the underlying agent technologies are worth watching.

So why did it go viral? Partly because it’s visually familiar (it looks like Reddit), partly because people enjoy sensational narratives, and partly because the idea of autonomous AIs having their own “internet” strikes a chord in our collective imagination.

So should you be scared? Not really, but be careful where you step. I am still hoping it’s just an experiment meant to show us, humans, what can happen if we don’t keep control in our hands.

If you’re worried that Moltbook is a sign that machines are quietly mobilising against us, that’s probably reading too much into an early experiment rife with hype, human influence, and security holes.

We are building complex systems with limited oversight, and handing them weapons-grade access to our digital lives without fully understanding the consequences.

Moltbook may be a quirky experiment, or it may be a prototype for future agent ecosystems. But it’s not evidence of spontaneous machine consciousness or the birth of digital societies beyond human control.

What it is is a reminder that as AI grows more autonomous, the questions we need to ask are about governance, safety, and clarity, not apocalyptic narratives.

In other words: don’t panic. Just read the fine print before letting a legion of code-driven agents into your network.

            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-04</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/snowflake-and-openai-forge-200m-enterprise-ai-partnership">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Snowflake and OpenAI have struck a multi-year, $200 million partnership to bring OpenAI’s advanced models, including GPT-5.2, directly into Snowflake’s enterprise data platform. The collaboration is designed to let Snowflake’s large customer base, more than 12,000 organisations, build AI agents and semantic analytics tools that operate on their own data without moving it outside Snowflake’s governed environment.

Under the agreement, OpenAI models will be natively embedded in Snowflake Cortex AI and Snowflake Intelligence, making it possible to run queries, derive insights, and deploy AI-powered workflows using natural language interfaces and context-aware agents. Customers can analyse structured and unstructured data, automate complex tasks, and build applications grounded in enterprise data without needing extensive coding.

The deal expands Snowflake’s AI strategy beyond simple model access. By embedding these frontier models directly into its platform and making them available across major cloud providers, Snowflake aims to reduce the friction of AI adoption for large enterprises. Canva and WHOOP, among others, are already exploring how integrated agentic AI can speed up analytics and decision-making.

Snowflake’s stock reacted positively on the news, with shares climbing modestly following the announcement, as markets interpreted the agreement as a sign the data cloud provider is sharpening its competitive edge in an increasingly AI-centric landscape.

This partnership reflects a broader shift in enterprise AI beyond one-off integrations or bolt-on features. Instead, it signals a move toward platforms that combine governed data infrastructure with scalable generative AI models, helping businesses unlock insights and automate workflows without jeopardising security or compliance. Competitors such as Databricks are also intensifying their AI tooling efforts, underscoring how crucial native model access and data-centric AI capabilities have become in the enterprise race.

Taken together, this deal highlights an emerging pattern: enterprise AI is evolving from tool-centric add-ons to platform-level capabilities that unify data and intelligence at scale. Whether this will translate into sustained competitive advantage, or simply raise the baseline expectation for what AI-enabled data platforms must provide, is the next story to watch in the data cloud era.
