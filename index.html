            <h2>How Europe’s new carbon tax on imported goods will change global trade</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/how-europes-new-carbon-tax-on-imported-goods-will-change-global-trade/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For people living in the European Union, the price of their next car, home renovation, and even local produce may soon reflect a climate policy that many have never even heard of. This new regulation, which comes fully into force on New Year’s Day, does not just target heavy industry—it affects everyday goods which now face an added carbon cost when they enter Europe.

The carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) puts a carbon price on many imported goods—meaning that EU-based importers will pay for the greenhouse gases emitted during the production of certain carbon-intensive materials.

If goods come from countries with weaker climate rules, then the charge will be higher. To sell to the EU, producers will effectively need to show their goods aren’t too carbon-intensive.

The goal is to prevent companies from relocating their production to places with looser regulations, ensuring fair competition between EU and non-EU companies, while incentivising global decarbonisation.

After a trial phase, full payment obligations begin on January 1 2026, when importers will need to buy CBAM certificates to cover the embedded emissions in goods such as iron and steel, aluminium, cement, fertilisers, hydrogen and (eventually) electricity.

Although it is an EU climate policy, CBAM looks set to be a game-changer for global trade. Countries that rely on EU exports may need to make costly investments in cleaner technologies and better emissions tracking, or risk losing market share. The UK government plans to introduce its own version of CBAM in 2027—although how this links to the EU’s is yet to be decided.

A positive shift is already underway: more and more companies are now measuring and reporting their emissions accurately, responding to the growing demand for reliable carbon data. At the same time, an increasing number of countries are introducing their own carbon pricing systems to stay aligned with the EU and protect the competitiveness of their exports.

Morocco is a prominent example: its 2025 finance law gradually introduces a carbon tax from January 2026. As Moroccan firms will already pay a carbon price domestically, their exports are likely to avoid additional CBAM charges at the EU border, helping them remain competitive.

In many countries, CBAM is also accelerating interest in renewable energy and greener industrial processes. Some see it not as a threat, but an opportunity to attract investment and position themselves as low-carbon manufacturing hubs.

However, this mechanism is still controversial. For businesses, CBAM is complex and administratively heavy. Firms need robust systems to measure embedded emissions, collect data from suppliers, and produce environmental product declarations. Many will also need new renewable energy contracts to cut their carbon footprint.

Around the world, CBAM has faced strong criticism. India and China describe it as “green protectionism,” arguing that it puts unfair pressure on developing economies. At the same time, the EU has not yet created dedicated funding to help exporters in lower-income countries adapt. Without this support, the mechanism may not achieve the desired results.

Although CBAM is mainly aimed at industry, its ripple effects will reach consumers in the EU. Importers are unlikely to absorb the full additional cost, meaning prices are likely to rise—particularly for goods that rely heavily on steel, aluminium, or cement. This could mean Europe sees higher costs for cars, home appliances, electronics, building materials, and, indirectly, food production (through fertilizers).

At the same time, CBAM may bring more transparency. Because importers must report the emissions embedded in their goods, consumers may eventually have clearer information about the climate impact of what they buy.

The mechanism will also generate EU revenues from certificate sales. These are expected to support vulnerable households in many European countries, as well as funding clean technologies and improving energy efficiency. How the funds are used will be crucial to public acceptance of Europe’s new carbon tax.

Even before full implementation, CBAM is already reshaping supply chains and influencing government policies far beyond Europe’s borders. It may trigger trade disputes, push exporters to adopt carbon pricing, and highlight the need for more climate finance to support developing countries undergoing green industrial transitions.

For many European consumers, it’s likely to mean gradual price increases—and potentially, more climate-conscious purchasing decisions. Behind the scenes, it marks a significant shift in how global trade accounts for carbon—and how climate policy reaches into people’s everyday lives.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/12/google-lobs-lawsuit-at-search-result-scraping-firm-serpapi/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google has filed a lawsuit to protect its search results, targeting a firm called SerpApi that has turned Google’s 10 blue links into a business. According to Google, SerpApi ignores established law and Google’s terms to scrape and resell its search engine results pages (SERPs). This is not the first action against SerpApi, but Google’s decision to go after a scraper could signal a new, more aggressive stance on protecting its search data.

SerpApi and similar firms do fulfill a need, but they sit in a legal gray area. Google does not provide an API for its search results, which are based on the world’s largest and most comprehensive web index. That makes Google’s SERPs especially valuable in the age of AI. A chatbot can’t summarize web links if it can’t find them, which has led companies like Perplexity to pay for SerpApi’s second-hand Google data. That prompted Reddit to file a lawsuit against SerpApi and Perplexity for grabbing its data from Google results.

Google is echoing many of the things Reddit said when it publicized its lawsuit earlier this year. The search giant claims it’s not just doing this to protect itself—it’s also about protecting the websites it indexes. In Google’s blog post on the legal action, it says SerpApi “violates the choices of websites and rightsholders about who should have access to their content.”

It’s worth noting that Google has a partnership with Reddit that pipes data directly into Gemini. As a result, you’ll often see Reddit pages cited in the chatbot’s outputs. As Google points out, it abides by “industry-standard crawling protocols” to collect the data that appears on its SERPs, but those sites didn’t agree to let SerpApi scrape their data from Google. So while you could reasonably argue that Google’s lawsuit helps protect the rights of web publishers, it also explicitly protects Google’s business interests.

The kind of data scraping that SerpApi uses is not new—Google has simply put up with it until now. However, the company claims that SerpApi’s deceptive behavior, like spoofing user agents and hammering sites with armies of bots, has increased significantly over the past year. That may have something to do with the ever-growing hunger for search data in the AI era.

Google is coming out of its antitrust cases relatively unscathed so far, which affects the availability of its data. It has avoided the harshest remedies, like the government’s demand that Google offer search data to competitors. That might have turned businesses like SerpApi legit, but with that no longer an option, Google may feel emboldened to unleash the lawyers.

While Google paints this as a benevolent action, it stands to benefit by stopping SERP scrapers. However, this may make some of Google’s competitors happy, too. Since the search giant doesn’t offer an official API for search (and the courts declined to force the issue), SERP scraping provides a way for companies to get Google’s search data on the down-low. This reduces demand for the handful of other web indexes that do have APIs, including Brave and Bing. Without illicit search APIs, chatbots may have to lean on official data sources.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The trade-off between quality and quantity is a fundamental economic dilemma. Now, a team of British, American, and Japanese researchers describes how it applies to biology, as well. They have discovered that this dilemma most likely shaped the evolutionary trajectory of ants, one of Earth’s most successful groups of organisms.

Their study reveals that, as ant societies grew in complexity and numbers, they didn’t just make their workers smaller—they also made them cheaper.

In the insect world, the exoskeleton known as the cuticle serves as a protective barrier against predators, pathogens, and desiccation, while providing the structural framework for muscle attachment. But this protection comes at a price. Building a robust cuticle requires significant amounts of nitrogen and rare minerals like zinc and manganese. While skimping on armor for an individual insect may be a death sentence, the evolution of ants apparently found a way around it.

“There’s this question in biology of what happens to individuals as societies they are in get more complex?” said Evan Economo, an entomologist at the University of Maryland and co-author of the study. “For example, the individuals may themselves become simpler because tasks that a solitary organism would need to complete can be handled by a collective.”

Economo’s team hypothesized that the metabolic balance behind investing in cuticles in social insects like ants could favor the collective over the individual. The idea was that a colony of 10,000 workers could lose a few individuals to a predator without much consequence, so investing heavily in each worker’s defenses would seem like a waste of precious nutrients. To test this hypothesis, they examined whether ant lineages that maintain massive, specialized workforces reduce the investment in their individual workers’ exoskeletons.

To test this idea, the researchers needed to pull off a comparative study on the anatomy of ants at an unprecedented scale. “We worked with scans of ant specimens and species from all over the world to capture the global diversity of ants,” Economo says. The team used a massive database called Antscan, which contains three-dimensional X-ray microtomography imaging of ants from around the globe.

Microtomography works similarly to medical CT scans, but at a vastly higher resolution. Still, on its own, the technique could only generate lots of precise data—it still had to be interpreted. Parsing through 3D imagery of over 880 specimens, including workers, queens, and males belonging to over 500 different species, was another challenge. “The 3D scanning itself is a very advanced technology,” says Arthur Matte, a researcher at the University of Cambridge and lead author of the study. “But once you have the ants in three dimensions, it’s still very hard to segment manually every tissue you’re interested in.”

To solve this, Matte developed a computer vision algorithm for “unsupervised segmentation.” Because the cuticle is always the outermost tissue of an arthropod, the algorithm could automatically identify and measure the volume of the exoskeleton across all ants in the dataset.

The first thing scientists noticed when the results poured in was that cuticle investment varied wildly, ranging from 6 percent to 35 percent of an ant’s total body volume. So, the next thing they focused on was figuring out the reasons behind these variations.

The team started checking how factors like diet, temperature, humidity, and foraging style correlated with the size of the cuticle. To get a handle on this, segmented 3D scans were fed into evolutionary models. “One of the most insightful things we did was to individually remove such variables from the models to estimate their contributions to the final cuticle investment,” Matte explains. This way, scientists learned that temperature was responsible for just 12 percent of variation in cuticle size and diet—especially its nitrogen content—explained another 37 percent. But the factor that had the strongest impact on the model was the colony size.

Ants that invested less in their cuticle tended to have significantly larger colony sizes. More surprisingly, this reduction in cuticle investment and the resulting increase in colony size appeared to be associated with higher diversification rates. In biological terms, squishier ants could evolve to occupy new niches much faster than their heavily armored cousins. “Requiring less nitrogen could make these ants more versatile and able to conquer new environments,” Matte suggests. This efficiency may have allowed ants to transition from a diet of high-protein prey to more abundant but less nutritious liquid sugar sources, like honeydew or floral nectar.

“Ants reduce per-worker investment in one of the most nutritionally expensive tissues for the good of the collective,” Matte explains. “They’re shifting from self-investment toward a distributed workforce.”

The researchers think the pattern they observed in ants reflects a more universal trend in the evolution of societal complexity. The transition from solitary life to complex societies echoes the transition from single-celled organisms to multicellular ones.

In a single-celled organism, a cell must be a “jack-of-all-trades,” performing every function necessary for survival. In a multicellular animal, however, individual cells often become simpler and more specialized, relying on the collective for protection and resources.

“It’s a pattern that echoes the evolution of multicellularity, where cooperative units can be individually simpler than a solitary cell, yet collectively capable of far greater complexity,” says Matte. Still, the question of whether underinvesting in individuals to boost the collective makes sense for creatures other than ants remains open, and it most likely isn’t as much about nutritional economics as it is about sex.

The study focused on ants that already have a reproductive division of labor, one where workers do not reproduce. This social structure is likely the key prerequisite for the cheap worker strategy. For the team, this is the reason we haven’t, at least so far, found similar evolutionary patterns in more complex social organisms like wolves, which live in packs—or humans with their amazingly complex societies. Wolves and people are both social, but maintain a high degree of individual self-interest regarding reproduction. Ant workers could be made expendable because they don’t pass their own genes—they are essentially extensions of the queen’s reproductive strategy.

Before looking for signs of ant-like approaches to quality versus quantity dilemmas in other species, the team wants to take an even closer look at ants. Economo, Matte, and their colleagues seek to expand their analysis to other ant tissues, such as the nervous system and muscles, to see if the cheapening of individuals extends beyond the exoskeleton. They are also looking at ant genomes to see what genetic innovations allowed for the shift from quality to quantity.  “We still need a lot of work to understand ants’ evolution,” Matte says.

            <div id="article-text">It’s the holidays. The soft spice of holly and evergreen cling to the air, and a carefully curated playlist hums at just the right volume. The only thing that could make the atmosphere more inviting is the warm glow of a fire — so you load up the first one you see on the App Store and cast it to the family TV.

Everything is going well, until you turn and notice a popup on your yule log imploring you to upgrade to premium.

That’s the situation facing users of “Winter Fireplace,” a digital yule log on the Apple App Store. Drowning in a sea of similar vibey kitsch, Winter Fireplace starts off a free download, but soon begins begging users to sign up for premium with irritating popups that blot out all the warmth of the fire.

“Experience Winter Fireplace at its best,” the popup — viewed by Futurism at a holiday party — merrily declares. “Upgrade for a clean, distraction-free picture, cozy soundscapes, and the full scene library.”

This kept popping up on the fireplace channel every 15 minutes without fail

Users are then invited to “Upgrade to Premium,” which can cost either $0.99 or $2.99, apparently, according to the app’s listing on the App Store. We chose “not right now,” in order to close the popup and get back to the high-octane holiday action. But 15 minutes later, the popup returned, offering the exact same deal.

A closer look at the store’s in-app purchases shows this isn’t your grandma’s yule log app. It’s jampacked with features like immersive soundscapes and iCloud integration, and boasts over 80 “premium” fire loops “showcasing fireplace, fireside, candle, campfire and bonfire scenes.” And though the base app is free, those extras are gonna cost you.

For example, users can purchase various themed packs for different holidays, like Christmas and Halloween for $5.99 apiece. There’s a “Mega Bundle” for $12.99, which includes numerous firescapes, but not all. For that, users need to shell out a whopping $19.99 to “unlock” the entire app, though we don’t know why anybody would.

(Thriftier holiday enjoyers can find many free — and ad-free — fireplace videos online.)

The developer of Winter Fireplace, Henry Glendening, has found himself in the news before, though not for anything related to his app. Back in 2015, Glendening became the subject of a feel-good lifestyle story, after St Louis Today reported on his betrothal to Kasey Bergh, whom the developer met thanks to a text to a wrong-number.

But the story didn’t really pick up pace until a while later, when Bergh — thirty years Glendening’s senior — needed a new kidney, according to local outlet KSDK. As it turns out, Glendening was a “perfect immunological match” for his wife.

Glendening’s story, then, is a modern parable. As the popup fades and the digital fire resumes its loop, we’re left with a perfect encapsulation of this moment in time, where human connection and the logic of monetization not only coexist, but emerge from the very same device.

We reached out to the developer for comment.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">With NASA’s operations under existential threat from the Trump administration, maybe it’s not surprising that the agency will be taking a much needed moment to zone out and gaze into a void or two — albeit in a billion-light-year stare that’ll plumb the mysteries of the abyss.

On Monday, the agency described how a survey will use its upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope to inspect puzzling regions of the universe called cosmic voids where few, if any, galaxies are found.

Though they appear empty, the voids could contain insights into the universe’s evolution — and illuminate the mysterious forces that govern it, dark matter and dark energy.

“Roman’s ability to observe wide areas of the sky to great depths, spotting an abundance of faint and distant galaxies, will revolutionize the study of cosmic voids,” said Giovanni Verza of the Flatiron Institute and New York University, lead author of a new study published in The Astrophysical Journal demonstrating how Roman could examine voids, in a NASA statement.

Cosmic voids potentially challenge a key notion in astrophysics known as the Copernican or cosmological principle. An extension of Copernicus’ insight that the Earth does not occupy a special place in the universe, the principle holds that on the largest scales, the universe should appear largely homogenous with matter evenly and randomly distributed.

But astronomers have been spotting cosmic voids tens of millions — and sometimes even hundreds of millions — of light years across, which poke formidable holes in the idea that the cosmos should look basically the same in every direction, from any position. The voids form the center of “bubbles” on the surface of which galaxies cluster together, sort of like dust clinging to a balloon — a sign that galaxies aren’t randomly distributed but themselves constitute even larger structures. Some of these structures span billions of light years across.

Astronomers believe the voids provide a portal for examining dark energy, a mysterious and invisible force that’s hypothesized to account for nearly 70 percent of all “stuff” in the universe. The ordinary matter that everything from our planet to stars are made of, meanwhile, barely cracks five percent. If dark energy exists, it would explain why the cosmos is expanding at an accelerating rate, essentially pushing against the boundaries of reality and overpowering the gravity of all the matter inside it that tries to bring it crashing down.

“Since they’re relatively empty of matter, voids are regions of space that are dominated by dark energy. By studying voids, we should be able to put powerful constraints on the nature of dark energy,” said co-author Alice Pisani of the French National Centre for Scientific Research, in the NASA statement.

One of the surveys Roman will be conducting after its slated launch next October is the Roman High-Latitude Wide-Area Survey, in which it will examine the night sky away from the plane of our galaxy. In the study, the astronomers predict that the infrared telescope should detect and measure tens of thousands of cosmic voids as small as 20 million light-years across. Their focus is to investigate the shape of the voids, which would be influenced by dark energy and other cosmic forces. If on average the voids don’t appear spherical, then there’s something wrong with our assumptions of dark energy.

There’s considerable debate over whether voids defy or disprove the cosmological principle. Perhaps on a large enough scale, they form a piece of the universe’s homogenous puzzle like everything else. Or perhaps they’re a consequence of our flawed observations. Whatever the answer may be, Roman will help us get closer to finding one.

“Voids are defined by the fact that they contain so few galaxies. So to detect voids, you have to be able to observe galaxies that are quite sparse and faint, explained co-author Giulia Degni of Roma Tre University in the statement. “With Roman, we can better look at the galaxies that populate voids, which ultimately will give us greater understanding of the cosmological parameters like dark energy that are sculpting voids.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Rhine is the second-longest river in Western Europe, discharging about 100,000 cubic feet of water a second into the North Sea.

It snakes through the Swiss Alps and makes up large sections of Germany’s western border with France, spreading out across a major delta in the Netherlands before emptying into the ocean.

It’s also an enormous, largely untapped resource for clean power. As the BBC reports, a German energy company called MVV Environment is building two enormous heat pumps that draw water from the Rhine to provide an appreciable 40,000 homes with heat.

The pumps, which could be the most powerful in existence once completed, work in more or less the same way as heat pumps currently being used by single homes. They draw in heat from outside air in winter, or move heat out to act like an air conditioner in summer, through a system that consists of a compressor, refrigerants, coils, and fans.

The advantages are evident. Heat pumps are generally speaking significantly more energy efficient and therefore more environmentally friendly than alternative methods used to heat and cool homes, like gas boilers or electric elements.

The idea is to spread the generated heat to thousands of homes via large hot water or steam heating networks. According to the International Energy Agency, “district heating could cover up to 50 percent of the heating demand in Europe, and heat pumps could deliver around 25 percent of the energy transported by the district heating grid.”

Fittingly, the enormous pumps being built by MVV are taking over the site of a coal power plant in Mannheim, Germany, a symbolic shift towards renewable and less polluting technologies.  Conveniently, MVV officials noted that the site is already hooked up to the grid and even the local district heating network.

Best of all, the necessary compressor technology has already been largely developed by the oil and gas industry, giving the transition to enormous centralized heat pumps a considerable leg up.

The company is hoping to kick off construction next year and be completed two to three years later.

It’s one of several heat pump-based solutions in the works across Europe. A similar system is already in the works in the town of Aalborg, Denmark. Heat pumps are also being used to extract heat from water in unused mines in the UK.

Other places, like Helsinki, Finland, are already harvesting the heat from the surrounding air for the local district heating system.

However, cost remains a considerable drawback as heat pumps remain extremely expensive to produce. The Mannheim heat pumps are expected to cost an eye-watering $235 million — making it a costly, but ultimately worthwhile, solution.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-20</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Sequoia Capital partner Shaun Maguire is once again drawing unwanted attention to the prominent venture firm after falsely accusing a Palestinian student of being behind the December 13 Brown University mass shooting and the subsequent murder of an MIT professor.

In since-deleted posts on X, Maguire speculated that “it seems very likely” the student was the perpetrator, pointing to Brown “actively scrubbing his online presence.” In reality, authorities identified the shooter as Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, a 48-year-old Portuguese national who was later found dead in a New Hampshire storage facility. Brown officials said they removed the student’s digital footprint as a protective measure against dangerous speculation.

Fast Company republished two of Maguire’s deleted posts on Friday (he has previously left inflammatory content online and did not delete comments he made proposing that the MIT professor was targeted for being Jewish). The incident follows months of controversial posts targeting Muslims and pro-Palestine activists, including calling New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani an “Islamist” in July. That post led to a swift online backlash, with nearly 1,200 founders and tech industry professionals signing an open letter urging Sequoia to take action. An open letter later surfaced supporting Maguire.

The newest episode raises questions about whether Sequoia’s new leadership — managing partners Alfred Lin and Pat Grady, who took over last month — can or will rein in Maguire’s social media activity. Chief operating officer Sumaiya Balbale left the firm in August over Sequoia’s inaction on Maguire’s anti-Muslim comments, according to earlier reporting by the Financial Times. Former managing partner Roelof Botha, who stepped down in November, defended Maguire’s behavior during an interview at TechCrunch Disrupt in October, calling Sequoia a believer in its partners’ right to “free speech.”

“Internally, we celebrate diversity of opinions, and we need ‘spiky’ people inside Sequoia,” Botha said, referring to Maguire. He offered that Maguire had a “specific profile” that appeals to certain founders. Maguire has led investments in numerous defense tech and AI startups, and reportedly has deep connections with Elon Musk’s companies, managing Sequoia’s investments in Neuralink, SpaceX, The Boring Company, X, and xAI.

However, Botha acknowledged trade-offs to Maguire’s outspokenness. “Does it come with trade-offs? Yes, it does,” he said.

Lin and Grady have not publicly addressed Maguire’s conduct since taking over leadership.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations has called for Maguire’s firing, telling Fast Company that his accusations are “deeply irresponsible and incredibly dangerous.”

            <div id="article-text">Resolve AI, a startup developing an autonomous site reliability engineer (SRE), a tool that automatically maintains software systems, has raised a Series A led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, according to three people familiar with the deal.

The headline valuation for the fresh round is $1 billion, sources said. However, the company’s actual blended valuation was lower because of a multi-tranched structure. In this setup, investors purchased some equity at a $1 billion valuation but acquired the remainder — likely a larger percentage of the round — at a lower price. This novel investment approach has recently become popular for the most sought-after AI startups, investors say.

The startup’s annual recurring revenue (ARR) is approximately $4 million, two of the people said. The size of the funding round couldn’t be learned.

Resolve AI and Lightspeed didn’t respond to our request for comment.

Founded less than two years ago, the startup is led by former Splunk executive Spiros Xanthos and Mayank Agarwal, Splunk’s former chief architect for observability. The duo’s partnership dates back 20 years to their graduate studies at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. This isn’t their first collaboration; they previously co-founded Omnition, a startup that was acquired by Splunk in 2019.

While human SREs are traditionally responsible for manually troubleshooting and resolving system failures, Resolve AI automates this process by autonomously identifying, diagnosing, and resolving production issues in real time.

The automation addresses a growing challenge for companies. As software systems become more complex and distributed across cloud infrastructure, outfits often struggle to find and retain enough skilled SREs to keep systems running smoothly. Automating these tasks can reduce downtime, lower operational costs, and free up engineering teams to focus on building new features rather than trying to constantly stomp out production issues.

Last October, Resolve AI raised a $35 million seed round led by Greylock with participation from World Labs founder Fei-Fei Li and Google DeepMind scientist Jeff Dean.

Resolve AI competes with Traversal, an AI SRE startup that raised a $48 million Series A led by Kleiner Perkins, with participation from Sequoia.

            <div id="article-text">Rocket Lab has won an $816 million contract — its largest to date — with the U.S. Space Development Agency as the company continues to diversify beyond its “rocket company” label.

The company said Friday that its subsidiary, Rocket Lab USA, was awarded a prime contract by the Space Development Agency (SDA) to design and manufacture 18 satellites. The satellites will be equipped with advanced missile warning, tracking, and defense sensors for the agency’s Tracking Layer Tranche 3 program.

This contract is separate from an existing $515 million award to deliver satellites for the SDA’s Transport Layer-Beta Tranche 2 program. That program aims to provide a satellite communications network in low Earth orbit that sends encrypted, low-latency data to the military.

Together, Rocket Lab has SDA contracts valued at more than $1.3 billion.

Rocket Lab has expanded into defense and has more recently said it would bid for multibillion-dollar Department of Defense initiatives like Golden Dome.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Recent presidents have not been shy about claiming broad powers, but President Donald Trump has taken this trend into a crucial new area: federal spending.

In just the past 11 months, his administration has canceled billions of dollars in foreign aid, frozen billions of dollars in research grants, imposed new conditions on other grants and contracts, slashed agency staffs, and even sought to claw back certain prior grant payments. At the same time, it has employed military resources to assist immigration enforcement, offered civil-service buyouts without statutory authority, and reportedly used a private donation to help pay military salaries during this fall’s government shutdown.

These precedents might well establish a new normal. Presidents tend not to cede powers claimed by their predecessors, so reversing presidential control over spending will require pushback from Congress. And whereas Congress did put up a fight when earlier presidents such as Richard Nixon attempted similar maneuvers, Congress today is a more divided and less effective body. So far, its response to Trump has been weak.

If this pattern holds, the result will be less responsive governance, more wild swings in policy across administrations, and a less restrained and accountable executive branch. America is dangerously close to a world in which all federal policy hinges on the outcomes of presidential elections, no matter how narrow the margin of victory.

Under the U.S. Constitution, Congress holds the “power of the purse,” meaning the authority to direct federal spending. Because the Constitution forbids any withdrawal of Treasury funds “but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law,” Congress needs to enact special statutes (“appropriations”) allowing any expenditure. That means no benefits can go out, no weapons can get bought, and no government salaries can get paid unless Congress specifically provides the necessary funds.

Although it sometimes authorizes spending on a permanent basis, Congress often does so instead in limited amounts and for limited periods of time, typically one year. That is why the government “shuts down” without new appropriations: If the fiscal year ends before Congress provides new money, agencies are left without the funds to operate.

The British Parliament invented this practice of time-limited appropriations to keep their kings and queens in check, and today it serves much the same purpose. Because presidents need new legislation from Congress each year just to keep the lights on, let alone advance their priorities, Congress has an ongoing say in what the government is doing. If it doesn’t like a new program or regulation, it can deny funds to implement it—or threaten to do so unless the president makes changes.

This congressional check on executive policy is particularly important today. Over time, Congress has conferred broad authorities on federal agencies, and presidents have claimed broad powers in areas including foreign affairs and the use of military force.

As a result, presidents can and often do launch major initiatives on their own, and they have real incentives to do so. These days, America’s two main parties have very different policy ideas, but neither commands majority support in the electorate. So presidents come into office with grand ambitions but no strong mandate to accomplish them. And without significant majorities in Congress, getting major legislation through the House and Senate is nearly impossible. That means presidents end up looking for ways to advance their agenda on their own—but often they still need Congress to provide the necessary funding.

In his second term, Trump has sought to upend this structure.

Starting on his first day back in office, Trump undertook a concerted campaign to wrest control over spending from Congress.

This campaign extended to all stages of the spending process and many areas of policy. The administration has sought to pause or terminate billions of dollars in foreign aid, government contracts, and research grants. It has aimed to shut down agencies, fire staff, and withhold funds from disfavored programs. In one well-known example, it fed USAID—the agency responsible for dispensing foreign aid—“into the wood chipper.” In another, it set about drastically shrinking the Department of Education, putting in doubt the department’s capacity to perform its statutory functions.

Based on purported concerns about anti-Semitism and other civil-rights violations (but without following required procedures for proving them), it suspended billions of dollars in research funding for top universities. Through this tactic, it succeeded in extracting a $221 million payment and other concessions from Columbia University.

The administration even applied a 1974 law limiting unilateral executive spending cuts in a manner that allowed it to accomplish just such cuts: By proposing late in the fiscal year that Congress cancel some $4 billion in foreign aid, it ran out the clock on the underlying appropriation without ever spending the money.

In addition to its cuts, the administration has sought spending flexibility. In its effort to reduce staff, the administration offered de facto buyouts to civil servants even though no appropriation or other statute clearly authorized them. It has shifted resources toward favored goals, employing the military to aid border enforcement and reportedly tasking FBI agents with aiding immigration enforcement. Amid the shutdown, it took this flexibility even further. It attempted to move money creatively among accounts and accepted a private donation for military salaries, while at the same time threatening further staff cuts, suspending payments for certain infrastructure projects, and seeking to halt nutrition assistance, all in an apparent effort to pressure Democrats in Congress.

Aggrieved parties have gone to court to challenge many of these actions, and sometimes they have succeeded in halting the administration’s plans, at least temporarily. But judicial remedies can do only so much in this area. Courts are good at blocking discrete unlawful actions such as illegal regulations and the detention of particular people. They are less adept at getting recalcitrant officials to do things they should be doing anyway, such as prudently dispensing billions of dollars for research or foreign aid in accordance with statutory policies.

Historically Congress, rather than the courts, has been the main check on this sort of spending abuse. Fifty years ago, President Nixon also tried “impounding,” or refusing to spend, large sums for housing assistance, environmental improvements, and other social programs. His administration claimed that the president’s “executive power” under the Constitution included the authority to withhold spending.

But Congress stood up for itself, enacting changes to the budget process including restrictions on impoundments. The 1974 Impoundment Control Act limited presidential authority even for spending “deferrals” (that is, delays). It also made clear that to “rescind” or cancel spending requires new legislation from Congress.

A few years later, President Ronald Reagan came to Washington promising to limit federal spending. But Congress protected much of the funding that his administration sought to cut. As one Texas Representative told Reagan’s budget director, David Stockman, members of Congress were unwilling “to tear up [their] voting cards and become White House robots.”

In one incident, Stockman delayed certain spending in anticipation of proposed cuts, but Howard Baker, the Republican Senate majority leader, told him “this dog ain’t gonna hunt.” Baker then exploded in rage when Stockman pushed back. Recalling the discipline he received as a child, Stockman wrote that Baker’s outburst “stung as much as my father’s leather strap.” The administration backed down.

Today, the Trump administration is singing from Nixon’s hymnal—and succeeding in ways Nixon and Reagan could not. Echoing Nixon’s claims, Trump pledged during last year’s campaign that, if reelected, he would revive a presidential impoundment power as a way “to cut waste, stop inflation, and crush the Deep State.” In 2022, Russell Vought, who has since taken on Stockman’s role as Trump’s budget director, criticized the influence of “congressional appropriations committees” over federal agencies and advocated a “Radical Constitutionalism” including stronger presidential power over the executive branch.

Trump and Vought have acted on these views in office, and Congress so far has given them little effective resistance. As is so often the case in this time of all-out partisanship, Republican majorities in Congress have seemed more interested in protecting their party’s president than in defending their branch of government. Meanwhile, Democrats have done the reverse and resisted the president however they can, voting nearly in lockstep against administration proposals.

The Democrats even triggered the government shutdown by failing to vote for new spending. Yet in doing so, they focused their objections on a policy disagreement over health-care subsidies rather than on Congress’s institutional interest in preserving its power of the purse. Each side has focused on the interests of its political party rather than its branch of government.

J. Michael Luttig: The end of rule of law

The practical effect has been to give the executive branch more latitude to do what it wants. Trump does not have stronger political support than Nixon or Reagan. Quite the opposite: Whereas both of those presidents won reelection in historic landslides, Trump lost the popular vote in 2016 and squeaked by with a plurality in 2024. But Congress today is more partisan and divided and therefore less able to defend its constitutional authorities. Vought is not likely to feel “stung” by anything Congress does.

What does all of this mean for the future? In principle, presidents will still need Congress to provide new funding each year. But if they can impound funds, cancel past grants, move money between accounts, and impose new conditions as Trump has, then Congress will have much less leverage over how those funds are spent.

And while Republicans are riding high right now, it is not hard to imagine a Democratic president acting just as unilaterally. Much as Trump has canceled foreign aid, gutted the Education Department, and required universities to abandon diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, a Democratic president might impound local police funding, limit immigration enforcement, and require universities to resume DEI.

Presidential defiance of Congress seems likely to become self-reinforcing. If legislators can get what they want out of the president, why take tough votes or make compromises with the other side? And if legislators opposed to the president know he can cancel items they like, why help him out with votes for an overall package? Unilateral presidential control over spending may compound Congress’s partisan gridlock, giving presidents still more freedom to defy Congress in the future.

Elections, of course, have consequences, and presidents should advance the preferences of their voters. But the United States is a big, complicated place. In designing the Constitution, the Framers made a bet that negotiation between competing interests in Congress, and between Congress and the executive branch, would generally produce better and more durable policy than hinging everything on nationwide elections every four years. Given recent presidents’ flip-flopping between polarized, unpopular policies, the Framers’ bet looks better than ever—if only the system they designed can deliver on it.</div>

            <h2>Trump’s Favorite Number Is…</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">President Donald Trump likes to use a big number to anchor his point, especially when he wanders off on a tangent. Often it seems that a specific figure is on the tip of his tongue.

At this year’s ceremonial turkey pardon, Trump praised a farmer from Wayne County, North Carolina, for raising two “record-setting” birds, but then pivoted to his own electoral margin of victory: “I won that county by 92 percent.” (In fact, he won it by 16 percentage points.) At a McDonald’s corporate event last month, Trump claimed that the United States controls 92 percent of the shoreline of the Gulf of Mexico (the Gulf of America, as he calls it). It’s really about 46 percent. Trump won the veterans’ vote, he said on Veterans Day, with “about 92 percent or something,” and in July, he said he won farmers—well, “by 92 percent.” (More accurate estimates of the portion of the electorate he won would be 65 percent of veterans and 78 percent of voters in farming counties, according to exit polls and election data.)

His fixation on the number between 91 and 93 has been a feature for a while. In April, Trump claimed that egg prices had fallen by 92 percent. (The Bureau of Labor Statistics said 12.7 percent.) And at a rally shortly before last November’s election, while railing against journalists and the media, he allowed that “not all of them” are “sick people.” Just “about 92 percent.” That one, admittedly, is difficult to fact-check.

I came upon this curious pattern in the course of tracking down the basis for a far more serious claim the president has made repeatedly as part of his justification for the U.S. military buildup near Venezuela. More than two dozen strikes on small boats allegedly carrying drugs in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific have killed more than 100 people since September. The strikes have formed the core of the administration’s ongoing campaign to treat President Nicolás Maduro as a “narco-terrorist,” which many view as a veneer for wanting to see the Venezuelan strongman ousted from power and work with a new government to secure access to the country’s oil and rare earth minerals.

“The drugs coming in through the sea are down to—they’re down by 92 percent,” Trump told Politico on December 8. At a roundtable later the same day, he went with “92 or 94 percent.” Three days later: “Drug traffic by sea is down 92 percent,” Trump said in the Oval Office. A day after that brought a new estimate: “We knocked out 96 percent of the drugs coming in by water,” he told reporters.

More often than not, the president links the 92 (or more) percent claim to another: “Every one of those boats you see get shot down, you just saved 25,000 American lives.” In December alone, he has cited that figure—25,000 American lives saved per boat strike—on at least six different occasions.

I asked the Coast Guard—the lead federal agency for maritime drug interdiction—for any underlying data or information to support both of those figures. The Coast Guard referred me to the Pentagon. The Pentagon referred me to the White House. The Department of Homeland Security referred me to the Pentagon and the White House, which repeated Trump’s remarks without elaboration.

“President Trump is right. It is widely known that one small dose of these drugs is deadly, fentanyl is the number one killer of adults between the ages of 18 and 45, and any boat bringing this poison to our shores has the potential to kill 25,000 Americans or more,” Anna Kelly, a White House spokesperson, told me in a statement. “Rather than try to poke holes in these facts, The Atlantic should join President Trump in elevating the voices of families who have lost loved ones to the scourge of narcoterrorism.”

The president’s claims, however, are so porous that I hardly found anywhere to poke. Although Trump and other officials have repeatedly said that the goal of the strikes is to combat the trafficking of illicit fentanyl—the synthetic opioid chiefly responsible for an epidemic of fatal overdoses over the past decade—the drug does not come from South America. It enters America primarily across the border with Mexico and is produced using precursor chemicals from China. Venezuela, however, is primarily a transit country for cocaine bound for Europe.

In a briefing with lawmakers early last month, top officials acknowledged that they believed it was cocaine, not fentanyl, on the boats. A former senior Coast Guard official told me that in his more than three decades in the service, he has not been aware of a single instance of an intercepted load in the Caribbean or eastern Pacific containing fentanyl. In sum, the boats being struck aren’t carrying the drug that is the leading cause of overdose deaths in the U.S.—and what drugs they may be carrying aren’t coming to America. So it is hard to see how each strike saves 25,000 American lives.

Read: Trump’s boat strikes could make the cartel problem worse

Bill Baumgartner, a retired Coast Guard rear admiral who directed the agency’s operations in the Caribbean, told me that number “is just complete and pure fantasy.” The only way to arrive at that total of saved lives is if you would have rounded up 25,000 people and forced them to consume lethal doses of cocaine—a claim “just as stupid as saying that there’s a box of ammunition; if you confiscate a box of ammunition, you have saved 100 lives because there were 100 bullets there,” Baumgartner said.

It is even unclear how many of the destroyed vessels were actually carrying narcotics. The administration has not specified or released evidence of the types or quantities of drugs on them. When identifying boats ferrying drugs, “the intelligence isn’t foolproof,” and destroying a vessel with a strike—unlike boarding it during an interdiction—leaves no room to correct faulty intelligence, Baumgartner said. In the 13 months leading up to early October, 21 percent of the boats interdicted off the coast of Venezuela turned out not to be carrying any contraband, according to data shared by Coast Guard Acting Commandant Admiral Kevin Lunday in a letter to Senator Rand Paul, a Republican.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that in the 12-month period ending in April, there were about 73,690 total drug overdose deaths in the United States (although that number is likely to increase when final data are tallied). If it were the case that each strike since September has saved 25,000 American lives, and given that 28 boats have been destroyed to date, the operation would have saved 700,000 lives—more than nine times the total U.S. drug overdose deaths in a year. “That makes no sense,” Adam Isacson, an expert on drug trafficking in Latin America at WOLA, an NGO based in Washington, D.C., told me.

The majority of overdose fatalities stem from opioids, not stimulants such as cocaine. In 2023, the most recent year for which such data are available, the CDC tracked 29,449 cocaine-linked deaths. (About 1.2 grams of cocaine can constitute a fatal dose. That amount is 600 times greater than the 2 milligrams of fentanyl that can cause a deadly overdose.) But notably, nearly 70 percent of cocaine- and other stimulant-related deaths that year also involved fentanyl.

As for the basis for the president’s claim of a 92 percent decline in maritime drug traffic: “We’ve only seen that in Trump’s remarks. No sourcing, no other data,” according to Isacson. (The White House did not specifically respond to my inquiry about it.) But the numbers the government does release give ample reason to doubt the statistic. Last month, the Coast Guard touted a record-setting year of drug interdiction; the agency seized more than 510,000 pounds of cocaine, primarily in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, compared with the 167,000 pounds it seized on average in prior years. This month, as part of its ongoing maritime-law-enforcement operations separate from the strikes, the Coast Guard seized 20,000 pounds of cocaine in a single interdiction. But global cocaine supply and demand continue to reach new heights, according to a June report from the United Nations. And counternarcotics-enforcement veterans told me that even if drug traffic by sea has seen a sharp drop, that does not signal an overall decline in cocaine traffic, because traffickers adapt and reroute shipments.

Perhaps the president has divined these numbers through a mathematically rigorous process beyond the reaches of my imagination. After all, Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, told Vanity Fair that her boss is a “statistical savant.” More likely, his affinity for 92 percent and extravagantly large round numbers is what in a game of poker might be called a tell. In 2019, Bloomberg noticed 10,000 cropping up whenever Trump made big claims, in topics such as the stock market and ISIS fighters. It was the number Trump cited for known or suspected gang members whom ICE removed in 2018 (though the agency put that number at 5,872). And it’s the number of points he said the Dow Jones would have been up in 2019 had the Federal Reserve not raised interest rates the previous year.

Not every time the president cites a 92 percent is off base. His August boast of a “92 percent” approval rating for the Department of Veterans Affairs, for instance, was actually slightly less than the 92.8 percent of veterans who reported trusting the VA for their health care in the agency’s survey that month. That was up from—wait for it—92 percent under the Biden administration the previous year. But more often than not, the number seems to serve as a clue that the commander in chief might be reaching for a number he can easily remember, caring little whether it is accurate.

At three different rallies in the fall of 2024 leading up to Election Day, Trump bragged about his nearly decade-long campaign to denigrate the press. “The fake news back there—they were at 92 percent approval rating when we started this journey in 2015. And now they’re less than Congress,” he said on November 2. “I’m very proud of that.” In fact, the year the president descended his golden escalator and upended the country’s political life, Americans’ trust in the media was not at 92 percent. It stood at a then-historic low of 40 percent. In the years since, it has dropped to a new historic low of 28 percent. Congress’s approval, for the record, stands at 15 percent.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Updated at 12:40 a.m. on December 20, 2025

Late on the Friday afternoon before Christmas, and just hours before a deadline mandated by Congress, the Department of Justice released part of the trove of documents known, colloquially, as the Epstein files. The contents, most of which I’ve reviewed, are, at different times, unnerving, enraging, banal, even absurd (in the case of a photo of Jeffrey Epstein posing with a giant Winnie the Pooh mascot). More than anything, they are ████, which is to say, unknown, as many of the files are heavily redacted.

The majority of this tranche of files consists of thousands of documents containing more than 3,000 photos of Epstein’s homes, in New York City and in the U.S. Virgin Islands, filled with art and photographs of nude and half-clothed women. One photograph in the files appears to be a framed mirror selfie of Epstein and Steve Bannon, Donald Trump’s former chief strategist. There are photos of Epstein’s jet-setting lifestyle, a number of which depict either Epstein or his associate Ghislaine Maxwell with former President Bill Clinton. (Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison term for sex trafficking.) The photos appear to show Clinton reclining in a hot tub with a person whose face is redacted, at a table with the actor Kevin Spacey, with his arm around Michael Jackson, sitting at a table with the Rolling Stones front man Mick Jagger, and on what appears to be an airplane with a woman sitting in his lap (her face is redacted).

Representatives for Spacey, Jagger, and the Jackson estate did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In a statement on X this evening, a spokesperson for Clinton said, “There are two types of people here. The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light. The second group continued relationships with him after. We’re in the first.”

A couple images of President Trump appear to be in the files—one shows what appears to be his face among a series of photos on a desk, posing next to unidentified women. The files also include a legal complaint that alleges a verbal interaction between Trump, Epstein, and a 14-year-old girl. (In response to a request for comment, the White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson did not address questions about Trump’s appearances, and instead said that the Trump administration is “the most transparent in history” and “has done more for the victims than Democrats ever have.”)

Many of the images inside the files show Epstein and Maxwell having fun in exotic locations—private planes, helicopters, beachside villas, yachts, unidentified mansions. Many of the unredacted image files are banal or not explicit. But a number of the redacted ones are, or at least are unnerving: scantily clad women in various poses, with much of their nude bodies and faces blurred out; a framed image of an unidentifiable person in pajamas on their knees in front of a photographer; entire scanned sheets of redacted image thumbnails labeled: St. Trop/Clinton Morocco. Nude ████.

Much of what’s released in this batch of photos adds to what previously released emails and victim testimony have alleged—that Jeffrey Epstein lived opulently and kept company with presidents, and that his lascivious nature around young women was essentially an open secret among people who knew him. Out of the gate, the files seem to contain only a few genuine revelations, including a complaint about child-sexual-abuse material dated from 1996, which alleges that Epstein stole photos of two girls and threatened the photographer. According to Maria Farmer, an employee of Epstein who filed the report, the FBI did not contact her for a decade.

The files do contain numerous sordid bits of evidence: a handwritten phone-call or voicemail summary from November 8, 2004, that reads, “I have a Female for him”; an Amazon receipt from 2005 for three books, including one titled Slavecraft: Roadmaps for Erotic Servitude—Principles, Skills and Tools. Even the redactions reveal the scale of Epstein’s actions—a list of “masseuses” is completely redacted but contains 254 entries.

Despite the gigabytes of information, this phase of the Epstein files seems unlikely to put the Epstein conspiracy theorizing to bed. Likely, it will do the opposite—fuel speculation that plenty is missing or has been obscured. In a press release related to the release of the files, Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote that the administration was “following through on President Trump’s commitment to transparency and lifting the veil on the disgusting actions of Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators.” But the extent of the redactions seems to undermine at least part of Bondi’s statement. While there is every reason to protect the privacy of Epstein’s victims, many bystanders in the file photographs have their faces obscured by large black squares. (This afternoon, Fox News reported that “the same redaction standards were applied to politically exposed individuals and government officials” as to victims; Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told Fox that the Justice Department is “not redacting the names of any politicians” and that “there are no redactions of famous people.”)

There is also the matter of what the DOJ chose to release. Bill Clinton, for instance, is one of Trump’s political enemies. Trump, who reportedly knew and spent time in social circles with Epstein for years, and whose name appeared in previously released Epstein material from the House Oversight Committee, hardly shows up. In his statement, Clinton’s spokesperson, Angel Ureña, accused the administration of playing politics, claiming that the timing of the file release was “about shielding themselves from what comes next, or from what they’ll try and hide forever.”

It is difficult to know if the information in this phase of the files is simply the first in a series that will implicate people across the political spectrum or if this was the tranche that was easiest for DOJ lawyers to redact and clear for release. What is clear is that the administration, which dragged its feet releasing the files—Bondi first indicated that the files were “on her desk” in February, nearly a year ago—has lost the benefit of the doubt. As my colleague Sarah Fitzpatrick reports, in the lead-up to the release of the files, Bondi and the Justice Department kept Epstein’s victims in the dark about the release and, today, canceled a meeting between Bondi and victims at the last minute. (The victims were told that Bondi had a medical appointment.)

On X, the White House is using information from the files to score political points. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reposted the photo that appears to show Clinton in the hot tub, with the caption: “Oh my!” As reported by Politico, Chad Gilmartin, a DOJ spokesperson, posted from his personal X account: “I wonder why the Biden DOJ refused to release the files …” (The post has since been deleted.)

So far, the conclusion from the immediate release of the files is that it has satisfied very few people. For Epstein’s victims—for whom this is not a conspiracy theory or bit of online drama—the files, and their redactions, bring little added transparency or accountability. For those looking for more evidence of Donald Trump’s personal relationship with Epstein or information about current administration officials, the files contain very little to go on. Aside from the taunting from the White House, the reaction on the right has been mostly quiet. Online, some (mostly anonymous) Trump voters or self-proclaimed patriots appear frustrated by the redactions in the current release.

In July, when the pressure truly began to mount to release the files, I wrote that the Epstein case was, in many ways, the perfect conspiracy theory because it mixes documented crimes with the tantalizing promise of uncovering some larger, elusive network of evil. What we know about Epstein—his celebrity and elite friends and associates who cozied up to him long after he became a sex offender, his proudly creepy public behavior, the wealth and power—makes what we don’t know seem that much more plausible and awful. It suggests that the QAnon-style fantasies of cabals of elite child trafficking ought may not be so far-fetched.

In recent months, though, the Epstein files have evolved into something more akin to a cultural and political pain sponge. Every new disclosure only fans the flames, either feeding the public’s righteous anger over elite impunity or stoking suspicion that the public is being misled or not told the whole truth. The partial, obscured release of these files has been billed by the Trump administration as an act of bold transparency. But what it actually reveals is how, in an environment of broken trust, in an age when conspiracy theorizing has become the lingua franca of American politics, no amount of information may ever be universally satisfactory. The little black redaction squares that blanket the documents are ostensibly there to protect. But for many who’ve waited for this disclosure, they may also represent hope that on the other side of the square there might be justice, truth, and accountability. As long as those little black squares are there, that hope will be misguided.</div>

Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., and Rep. Joe Neguse, a Democrat whose district includesBoulder, have suggested that the proposed NCAR closure amounts to political brinkmanship bythe White House in response to Colorado&#39;s refusal to release Tina Peters. Peters, a formerMesa County clerk, is serving a nine-year prison sentence for illegally accessing votingmachines after the 2020 election. A Republican, Peters was recently pardoned by Trump,largely symbolic action since she has neither been charged nor convicted in federal court.

Yes, the trump party is disgusting and corrupt. But what should the world think of the country that allows it to operate without a hint of opposition?

The billionaires behind Trump know he&#39;s at best a useful idiot - they saw in his first term how quickly he can veer off course if he doesn&#39;t have a reliable minder nearby.

Guys like Vought see entities like NCAR as an impediment to what they want to do, it&#39;s simple as that. They don&#39;t want the commoners to feel like the government owes them anything or is gonna do anything to improve the commoners&#39; lives. They want the commoners to be happy spending long, tedious days screwing tiny screws into iPhones for a pittance, then quietly stepping aside and dying when they&#39;re no longer able to improve the billionaire&#39;s profit margins.

Considering how many of these followers consider cheeto benito their saint, I would say that they will get what they deserve.

You know, you weren&#39;t suppose to drink the entire vat of Kool-Aid, what will the other Maggots drink?

I forget where he&#39;s from, but it sure reminds me of the result of Reagan&#39;s education plan

I&#39;m amused by those who imagine that the laws of physics can be defied merely by looking the other way. It makes me ponder how unbelievably moronic humanity is, how pathetic, and how deserving of what it is come.

&quot;nothing useful from that has resulted in decades.&quot;

There are millions of people along the gulf coast and southeastern U.S. that rely on hurricane prediction models to know whether they&#39;re in danger as tropical storms are evolving across the Atlantic into hurricanes. Hurricane prediction models, constrained by NCAR hurricane flight data and research, are crucial to saving lives and property.

What&#39;s sad is that so many people in the southeastern US who are cheering for this dismantling are also benefiting the most from NCAR hurricane research.

so we can unfuck all the things he&#39;s fucked.

But the reality is, Trump is a symptom, not a disease. He was elected by the people. Those who voted Trump once were either Nazi sympathizers or fools. Those who voted Trump the second time around were definitely Nazi sympathizers, or definitely fools.

Impeaching Trump won&#39;t do anything. The next Nazi in line is JD Vance and he&#39;s ten times worse because, unlike Trump, he&#39;s not an idiot with a case of fronto-temporal dementia.

And even if Vance and the rest of the Nazi goons are out, the people will vote another fascist in the next time around because the people has proven twice now that they&#39;re fucking fascists or fucking morons.

In short, America is fucked because Americans are hopeless.

People didn&#39;t vote *FOR* Trump. They voted *AGAINST* Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris. How funny. I didn&#39;t vote for them because I wanted them. I just didn&#39;t want the worst person ever alive to be president, which comes back to what Rosco said above. People who voted for Trump did it specifically because they wanted Trump to do terrible things, which was because they are terrible people.

I&#39;m an atmospheric and soil scientist returning right now from the annual American Geophysical Union meeting in New Orleans, where atmospheric science is one of the largest sections of the 25,000-person conference and >60,000-member Union.

There was an emergency town hall at the meeting after the NCAR announcement on Wednesday. One of the largest ballrooms in the convention center (New Orleans) was packed for the town hall. At one point, a (non-NCAR) scientist asked anyone to stand up if they have collaborated with or used NCAR data in the past few years. At least 90% of the people in the room stood up. It was quite moving in person.

NCAR is a resource that has spent decades performing world-leading research. They are notably non-political, they don&#39;t advocate policy, they perform research, acquire data, and report it. They do a very wide range of research that is important for defense, air travel, aeronautics, meteorology, hurricane and tornado prediction, climatology, and air pollution. Note that I tucked climatology in that list - it&#39;s a fraction of the research they do.

An important point: the proposed &quot;break up&quot; is enormously inefficient and expensive. These NCAR scientists are in the same place because their research all overlaps enough that there is benefit to them being together. If they split into different sections, people will have to be relocated, laboratories will have to be moved (short term costs) and new support staff will be required at every new site (long term costs).  So not only is this a bad idea in terms of science, it&#39;s costly.

If you&#39;re interested in contacting your senators and representatives to advocate for saving NCAR, here&#39;s a link to do so provided by AGU.

Maybe it can&#39;t go through your mind but DEI is what world-class institutions do *in order to achieve scientific excellence*. Maybe you can discuss an excess here or there in the USA, but the concept is now accepted by both left and right in the world.

People don&#39;t care unless it slaps them in the face. Trump is running amok all over the constitution and people applaud. SCOTUS wants a king or dictator and the Epstein files are garnering the most attention just for the gossip. The senators and representatives are letting all this happen. They don&#39;t care because it doesn&#39;t affect them... now.

NCAR provides information such that policymakers can make decisions that can reduce pollution or better plan for bad weather or a changing climate.

The USA are fucked because their electoral system occasionally allows for a losing candidate to be elected, as it happened with W Bush and Trump (who then proceeded earn a reputation for f up a lot of things). We can&#39;t redo history but assuming the 2016 election got the result the popular vote should have given it, you&#39;d be now in a Trump first term, or in a pause in between two terms, and Trump would probably be too mentally impaired to show up for a second term after that.

Actually I intended to reply to Rosco P. Coltrane who wrote &quot;America is fucked because Americans are hopeless&quot; and I disagreed. But now at I am here and we&#39;re discussing on potential improvements, the simplest single change that would make the largest impact would be to move away from the winner-takes-all method for the Electoral College. That would allow more parties to join on a regular basis, therefore promoting more debates, and reducing polarisation. It isn&#39;t a panacea, but a necessary step. Also from

The end of the article says that if Google wins their lawsuit then serp data will be harder to obtain.

What is serp data and what would we want it for?

&quot;A juxtaposition of what, on the surface, appears to be the case with what is actually the case&quot;, as the Wikipedia tells us.

google, which built its empire on bypassing security protections to scrape data, which it then showed to the users, is angry that someone shrewder is using the same approach - despite the many cases in court where the same google argued the exactly opposite point.

I&#39;ve wondered how they hadn&#39;t been sued before.

Yuep. The TLDR for existing US case law is basically that anything publicly available on the open web

Yes and Google probably benefits from this precedent more than any other company..  They&#39;re running a frickin search engine.  They hardly ever Ask or Get proper permission for scraping anything.  Companies who publish News in particular could have massive claims against sites like google News for pulling their articles and displaying it on Google&#39;s site.   Not only unauthorized scraping, but appropriation.

What if engineers were freed from working for &quot;be evil&quot; finance guys so they could develop software they wanted to use and share it because they got a generous, inflation-proofed basic income?

I&#39;m sure the highest-paid engineers have no desire to be freed.Generous basic income is an oxymoron. Basic income is supposed to be basic, not generous. Basic income still needs to be funded through taxes, and requires a productive economy that generates tax revenue, and produces goods and services that are worth buying.

Basic does not mean &quot;little&quot; but it means &quot;No strings attached&quot;.

Il really trying ting to understand whatâ(TM) theyâ(TM)re alleging that hasnâ(TM)t been standard practice (even by Google) for literally as long as the web has existed.

Honestly, this sounds like textbook monopoly behavior.

To quote the Princess Bride: You are trying to kidnap what I have rightfully stolen!

First I doubt that the search page contains much that is Google&#39;s copyright and second they are currently not in the position to complain about others scraping content.

And this is probably not about search competition, but about AI. Everyone can (and many do) run a LLM-Service cheaply. What comes one expensive very fast is integrating search, because you cannot just scrape Google without tricks so you need to pay them for an API key to get the same results SerpApi is scraping (and also selling to API consumers).

API prices (Openrouter):Small LLM: $0.03 per Million tokensSearch: $4/1000 requests

When you run your own &quot;ChatGPT@home&quot; using API-Providers, search integration qui

In mid-March of 2025, ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt and his colleagues started hearing that the Trump administration might attempt a flagrantly lawless publicity stunt, involving migrant men, secret flights to El Salvador, a notorious gulag, and a total disregard for due process. Despite getting word that something was about to happen, and rushing into a Saturday night hearing, and then securing a TRO from DC judge James Boasberg, Lee and his colleagues were unable to prevent more than 250 men from being renditioned from Texas to the CECOT torture prison in El Salvador. The legal cases spawned by the dramatic events of March 15th 2025 haven’t gone away, indeed they are reaching crucial milestones in the courts, raising foundational questions about the abuse of statutes and what it means to defy court orders. On this week’s Amicus, Dahlia Lithwick is joined by the ACLU’s Lee Gelernt who is litigating these cases, to discuss the very high stakes of a set of cases that may have fallen off your radar in the shuffle.

How these cases play out will dictate much of what happens for the rest of Trump’s term in office by answering democracy-defining questions such as whether the antiquated and radical wartime powers of the Alien Enemies Act can be unleashed on people the government deems enemies domestically, whether court orders are actually directives the Trump DoJ is bound  to follow, whether the district courts can require Pam Bondi’s justice department to assist in the finding of fact, and whether the ancient legal concepts protecting liberty of due process and habeas corpus have the force of law in Trump’s America.

A Wisconsin jury found state court Judge Hannah Dugan guilty of obstructing federal immigration enforcement on Thursday, delivering a victory to the Trump administration’s crusade against anyone—even judicial officers—who attempt to impede its mass deportation campaign. Dugan, a Milwaukee County Circuit Judge, helped a noncitizen evade ICE agents at the state courthouse by instructing him to exit the courtroom through a specific door. Agents apprehended him anyway, and prosecutors promptly charged Dugan with obstruction, a felony punishable by up to five years’ imprisonment.

On this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed the jury’s verdict, and the dissonance of a legal regime in which the president can break the law with impunity while a judge faces prison for impeding an immigration arrest inside her own courtroom. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: Judge Dugan allegedly pointed an undocumented immigrant to a side door in her courtroom to evade ICE agents. And now she has been found guilty of a felony offense. This verdict is so depressing in so many ways. Can we count them?

Mark Joseph Stern: We are living in a world in which the Supreme Court has granted sweeping criminal immunity to presidents—specifically, to Donald Trump—for actions that they take that fall anywhere within the “outer perimeter” of their “official responsibilities.” SCOTUS simply made that rule up in Trump v. United States. Yet there is a real doctrine of judicial immunity that has deep roots in American law. It provides an absolute shield against prosecution of judges for all actions taken in their official capacity. That has long been understood to include how judges direct activities within their courtrooms. Now, remember what Dugan allegedly did: She directed a criminal defendant in her courtroom to leave through a certain door so ICE would not arrest him, thereby preventing her from continuing to adjudicate his case. The Trump administration argued that Dugan should not receive judicial immunity for this act. And U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman agreed, paving the way for Thursday’s guilty verdict.

The idea that a judge can’t claim judicial immunity for the act of telling someone to leave through a certain door in her courtroom strikes me as absurd. Set aside professional penalties. How in the world can a judge face criminal prosecution for this conduct after Trump v. United States? The Supreme Court has now granted the president absolute immunity for ordering a sham investigation into a free and fair election in order to nullify valid votes and overturn the results. But Dugan can be prosecuted for this? I just can’t square those things.

I’m not saying that what Dugan did was unquestionably right or good. I am saying that when a judge in her robes, in her own courtroom, tells someone who is going to appear at her hearing to leave through a particular door, she is surely acting within the outer perimeter of her official duties. Certainly much more so than Trump was acting within the outer perimeter of his official duties when he attempted to secure himself another term by overturning the results of an election.

I think you’re making a subtle argument and it’s worth landing on it really squarely. It’s one thing to confer maximalist, seemingly boundless authority on the executive branch and on the president that, by definition, circumscribes the judicial role. But to aggressively chip away, cut away, minimize, and cabin the powers of the judiciary at the same time? That’s really salt in the wound, and a threat to an independent judiciary.

Let’s be clear: This is an effort to chill the conduct of judges, especially state court judges, who believe they should decide the case before them without worrying that ICE agents are going to ambush plaintiffs or defendants or witnesses and thwart their effort to carry out justice. That is what happened here. That is what is happening in many states around the country. Some, like New York, have tried to block ICE agents from going into state courthouses. This was Judge Dugan doing much the same thing; trying to contend with the fact that ICE was about to arrest someone who was due to appear before her.

I think the verdict shows a real failure of the jury to understand how vindictive and partisan this prosecution was, and to see the deeper issues lurking here. It’s awful that the U.S. attorney brought this case in the first place. I think the prosecutors who worked on this case should be ashamed of themselves. I guess my one consolation is that Judge Adelman is known to be a very lenient sentencer. If Dugan’s conviction is upheld on appeal, I think it’s unlikely that he’ll give her any term of confinement behind bars. She has no criminal record and there are no other factors that would call for a higher sentence. Adelman might impose house arrest, but probation seems more likely.

            <div id="article-text">If you were hoping for some relief from stratospheric memory pricing, don&#39;t hold your breath. DRAM prices aren&#39;t expected to peak until at least 2026, TechInsights analyst James Sanders tells El Reg.

DRAM is an incredibly broad category and includes everything from the DDR5 found in desktops and servers to the GDDR7 and HBM used by graphics cards and AI accelerators.

The market is also notoriously volatile and prone to wild swings in pricing, spiking as inventories are drawn down and cratering as new capacity is brought online, Sanders explains.

As chip markets go, DRAM is about as volatile as they get. - Click to enlarge

According to TechInsights, memory pricing was already on the rise in 2024, growing 88 percent from a rather steep valley the year prior. Based on previous DRAM booms, one might expect it to grow at a slower pace in 2025, before contracting in 2026 or 2027.

However, Sanders tells us that&#39;s unlikely to happen this time around. &quot;I think we&#39;re looking at the peak in 2026,&quot; he said, adding that even then he only expects DRAM prices to settle in 2027 before rising again in 2028.

So what&#39;s to blame for the sky-high memory prices? Well, as you might have already guessed, it&#39;s AI. But it&#39;s not the full story. Timing is also a factor.

According to Sanders, the AI boom kicked off at what was very possibly the worst time for memory vendors. &quot;This demand started in the Valley for the DRAM industry. That makes financially trying to build additional capacity really challenging,&quot; he said. &quot;If you&#39;re rushing, the time to bring additional capacity online is about three years. It&#39;s a quirk of bad timing that&#39;s led to the circumstances that we&#39;re in now.&quot;

More realistically, DRAM vendors, like Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron, are looking at four or five years to ramp production at a new fab, at which time the market conditions could have changed considerably.

Timing is also why the DRAM shortage is hitting some harder than others. &quot;The consumer market is in the stratosphere, whereas OEMs are about a year out, and they&#39;re not getting heartburn quite yet,&quot; he explained.

In other words, giant hardware vendors like Dell and HP aren&#39;t suffering nearly as much because they tend to lock in their orders early, while smaller vendors are at the mercy of spot pricing. In fact, ahead of the Christmas holiday, G.Skill, a supplier of memory for gamers, issued a statement pinning the blame for jacking the price of its products on AI.

&quot;DRAM prices are experiencing significant industry-wide volatility, due to severe global supply constraints and shortages, driven by unprecedented high demand from the AI industry,&quot; the company wrote. &quot;As a result, G.Skill procurement and sourcing costs have substantially increased. G.Skill pricing reflects industry-wide component cost increases from IC suppliers and is subject to change without notice based on market conditions.&quot;

What&#39;s more, AI is driving demand for a different class of memory that, unlike traditional DRAM, isn&#39;t much use in most consumer applications.

&quot;This is a little bit different from previous boom-bust cycles, in that wafers are being redirected toward HBM and away from consumer-grade memory,&quot; Sanders said.

High-bandwidth memory consists of multiple layers of DRAM, which as the name implies, enables it to achieve much higher bandwidth than a typical DRAM module you might find in a notebook or RDIMM. With HBM3e, it&#39;s not uncommon to see a single 36 GB chip deliver 1 TB/s of bandwidth. By comparison, a single 8 GB LPDDR5x module might be able to achieve 140 GB/s.

HBM is used almost exclusively in high-end datacenter GPUs and AI accelerators, like Nvidia&#39;s B300, AMD&#39;s MI355X, or Amazon&#39;s Trainium3. Because of this, Sanders says, the memory market is rapidly diverging.

&quot;Because there&#39;s no consumer demand for HBM — the consumer market can&#39;t bear that price at all — it is really becoming two markets that are detached from each other,&quot; he said.

Memory vendors are currently in the midst of a memory transition as they prepare to ramp production of HBM4 modules, which will power chips like Nvidia&#39;s Vera Rubin and AMD&#39;s MI400s starting next year. Initially, Sanders says these chips will command a price premium.

And while TechInsights does expect the memory market to settle in 2027, it won&#39;t last. As you may recall, Nvidia plans to cram 576 Rubin-Ultra GPUs each equipped with a terabyte of HBM4e memory into a single rack starting in, that&#39;s right, 2027.

This might explain why Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra recently told investors that due to strong AI datacenter demand, &quot;aggregate industry supply will remain substantially short of the demand for the foreseeable future.&quot;

Not that he&#39;s really complaining. While end customers are grappling with memory prices that have gone up 3x in just a few months, the memory fabs are raking in the cash. In Micron&#39;s Q1 2026 earnings call this month, the company saw revenues rise 56 percent while net income more than doubled from $1.87 billion this time last year to $5.24 billion.

And while memory vendors may now have the capital necessary to finance additional fabs, it&#39;ll be at least three more years before they enter production. And even when they do, the bulk of capacity is likely to be allocated toward HBM and other enterprise products.

One wildcard in all of this is China&#39;s CXMT, Sanders explains.

&quot;CXMT doesn&#39;t necessarily play by the same set of rules that everyone else does,&quot; he explained.

For one, they don&#39;t have any meaningful HBM output at this time. Second, many had expected the company to focus heavily on DDR4, but instead, Sanders says the company now appears to be transitioning to DDR5.

Today, CXMT isn&#39;t a very large player in the DRAM business. It certainly doesn&#39;t help that the company is subject to United States export controls. Despite this, TechInsights expects the company to grow considerably by the end of the decade from five to 10 percent of the market, which should in theory help grow the supply of DDR5 overall. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">hands on Infinite Machine, a New York-based electric vehicle startup, began with a stolen Vespa.

Eddie Cohen, president and co-founder of the company, told The Register that he and his brother Joseph were living together during the COVID outbreak.

&quot;His Vespa had gotten stolen and we just kinda had this crazy idea … if we were to design one for the future that was all-electric, had the best technology, what would it look like? What would it feel like?&quot; Cohen explained.

As I stood beside P1, a $10,000 electric seated scooter, and Olto, a $3,495 bike-lane legal class 2 e-bike, that question had been answered. The brothers&#39; company started shipping the P1 to customers in October and expects to deliver Olto in early 2026.

&quot;We just started dabbling and we came up with P1, you know, just a sketch,&quot; said Cohen, who had a background in product design. &quot;And then, over the subsequent two or three years, we just continued to noodle on it. Nights and weekends, we both had other jobs.&quot;

In January, 2024, he said, Infinite Machines became their full-time job. He and his brother assembled a team and began moving from sketch to actual product.

&quot;So P1 is a plated, M-class vehicle,&quot; said Cohen, meaning drivers should be licensed for motorcycles unless they only use it in Mode 1, where speed is capped at 30 mph.

&quot;It goes 65 miles an hour, 60-mile range. The battery is in the floor. It fits two people. It has a full touchscreen – 8.5&quot; display – that has what we call Phone Connect. So it connects to your iPhone, you get Maps. Music, etc. It has whisper-quiet acceleration. It&#39;s kind of like riding a Tesla for the first time, but it&#39;s even more surreal because it&#39;s silent.&quot;

The P1, said Cohen, was designed from scratch. &quot;All of the componentry is custom-toolled and developed. That&#39;s not a trivial thing.&quot;

He pointed to the fender for example. It&#39;s not off the shelf.

&quot;We designed it,&quot; he said. &quot;We made the tooling. We made the molds, and made it so that the engineering works just because we actually care about the details.&quot;

It&#39;s an opinionated design. The use of anodized aluminum and steel makes comparisons with the Tesla Cybertruck unavoidable. But the DMC DeLorean is an equally apt comparison, perhaps more so given the challenging nature of startup vehicle companies.

&quot;We were inspired by the Cybertruck,&quot; said Cohen, &quot;but we didn&#39;t set out to design the Cybertruck of scooters. We used it as one reference point in a lineage of vehicles, like Marcelo Gandini and the Lancias back in the day. The Diablo, the Countach, the DeLorean, like these are all references that we love.&quot;

Cohen added that the plan is to explore future colors, and variants for specific markets like police and other first responders.

Your correspondent had the opportunity to take the P1 for a spin in San Francisco and it was a thrill – it&#39;s fun, fast, and handles well. I&#39;m not by nature a rider of scooters or motorcycles, though I&#39;ve enjoyed the lazy ease of electric bikes. Were I a younger man, more willing to mix it up among motorists without the protection of an automotive frame, airbags, and a seatbelt, I&#39;d be looking seriously at the P1 or the more modest Olto for urban transportation.

The P1 includes just the right number of physical buttons, with well-conceived software and hardware. It features secure storage, front and rear cameras, phone-based keyless access, and GPS location tracking, among other niceties. It relies on a Linux fork called IMOS, Infinite Machine OS.

Presently, there&#39;s no AI on-board – which this reporter considers a selling point. Cohen recounted how someone had asked the company&#39;s head of systems what AI is being explored. &quot;He kind of was like, &#39;Look, they&#39;re expensive, right? You put a Nvidia chip on here and you put a camera and it&#39;s expensive. It adds to the [bill-of-materials] cost. And it&#39;s not obvious that there is value there.&quot;

He added however that the company has ideas for ways AI might be useful to improve the safety of two-wheeled vehicles.

Software applications for the vehicles will be developed in time. Cohen said that Infinite Machine does gather data to understand how people are using its vehicles, but does so in a way that respects privacy.

&quot;So we don&#39;t know anything about the individual rider and we have anonymized everything,&quot; he said. &quot;We care about rider privacy. We also care about, like, you buy this vehicle, it&#39;s just gonna work. Like you don&#39;t have to pay a subscription ever. It&#39;s just gonna work all the time and it&#39;s your vehicle. But we do anonymize and track usage.&quot;

Cohen said he expects the target market in the US will be those who appreciate technology and design. &quot;They want something that&#39;s new and they want the best,&quot; he said.

&quot;In 2025, the ultimate luxury is really time and freedom to do what you want. And P1 saves you time. It&#39;s the fastest and best way to get around any city like in San Francisco, this thing is liberating. It&#39;s amazing. It handles the hills totally well. You can park it anywhere. You don&#39;t have to spend 30 minutes looking for a spot. You get to live life on your own terms.&quot;

Cohen expects the Olto will have broader appeal.

&quot;For Olto, I think it&#39;s for everyone,&quot; he said &quot;I think it&#39;s the mom in Brooklyn dropping her kids to school. I think it&#39;s the person that is single and wants to commute to work. I think it&#39;s the SoCal kid that&#39;s going to school. This is an accessible vehicle. It&#39;s very easy to ride, very approachable, and affordable.&quot; ®

            <h2>ATM jackpotting gang accused of unleashing Ploutus malware across US</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/19/tren_de_aragua_atm/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A Venezuelan gang described by US officials as &quot;a ruthless terrorist organization&quot; faces charges over alleged deployment of malware on ATMs across the country, illegally siphoning millions of dollars.

Two indictments were returned in Nebraska, collectively charging 54 alleged members of the Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang in connection with a spate of ATM jackpotting attacks.

The gang allegedly deployed a variant of Ploutus malware on ATMs across the US. Court documents assert that TdA members would travel in groups and compromise ATMs managed by certain banks and credit unions.

The alleged gang members would inspect each ATM for external security features before opening the machine&#39;s door, checking for alarms being triggered or law enforcement rushing to the scene.

Once they confirmed a machine could be safely tampered with, the suspects would either remove the ATM&#39;s hard drive and install the Ploutus variant before reinstalling it, or in some cases simply replace the hard drive with one that already had Ploutus installed. Other instances saw the malware deployed using external thumb drives.

Thought to be first observed in Mexico back in 2013, Ploutus malware targets the cash-dispensing module of ATMs, allowing attackers to issue commands that force the machine to spurt out bills.

According to data shared by the Justice Department, ATM jackpotting attacks have seen more than $40 million stolen via physical device tampering and malware deployment since 2020. It did not share specific figures about how much of that could be attributed to TdA.

&quot;Tren de Aragua is not just a criminal gang; they are a ruthless terrorist organization that preys on communities, spreads fear, and bankrolls violence across borders,&quot; said Mark Zito, special agent in charge at HSI Kansas City.

&quot;HSI and our law enforcement partners will track you down, break up your networks, and ensure you never find safe harbor in the United States. Our mission is to protect American families from predators who think they can operate with impunity. We will not tolerate foreign terrorists stealing from our citizens and threatening our homeland. Our communities are safer today because of the relentless work of this team, and we are just getting started.&quot;

Across the various indictments against alleged TdA members in Nebraska over the past year are additional charges related to assault, money laundering, and sex trafficking of minors.

The announcement comes as the US announces a broader crackdown on the Venezuelan gang, with a slew of indictments across various states charging hundreds of alleged members since January.

The DOJ in Washington also unsealed indictments on Thursday related to other violent crimes committed by more than 70 alleged members, including murder, kidnapping, and drug trafficking.

Two of the group&#39;s suspected leaders were indicted in Colorado on various charges, including RICO offenses, while the alleged mastermind and co-leader of TdA, Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores, was charged in New York.

Flores remains at large, although there is a $5 million bounty on his head. The co-leader of TdA escaped from Venezuela&#39;s Tocorón prison in 2012, allegedly with the help of Jimena Romina Araya Navarro – another TdA leader – before being sent back in 2013.

Tocorón was notoriously lawless for years, but during the early 2000s, TdA began to assemble, and by the following decade, it assumed total control of the prison, infamously building amenities such as the Tokio nightclub, a zoo, a swimming pool, and more.

In 2023, Venezuelan authorities regained control of the facility in an operation that saw 11,000 officers storm the grounds, but Flores and his associates reportedly escaped days before.

In other states, New Mexico charged 11 alleged members over violent and armed crimes, and in Texas, more suspected high-ranking members and those in leadership roles were charged with cocaine trafficking, murder, and extortion.

The renewed focus on tackling TdA began in February when Attorney General Pamela Bondi expanded the remit of Joint Task Force Vulcan. Created in 2019, it was originally tasked with bringing down MS-13 gang members, but is now also responsible for handling TdA.

&quot;Immediately upon taking office, I directed the Department of Justice to fiercely pursue the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations,&quot; said Bondi.

&quot;This latest multi-state series of charges underscores the Trump Administration&#39;s unwavering commitment to restoring public safety, dismantling violent trafficking networks, and ridding our country of Tren de Aragua terrorists.&quot; ®

﻿The EV maker was known for its outdoor-themed off-roaders. Why is it now chasing Elon Musk down an AI rabbit hole?

RJ Scaringe is sitting in Rivian’s Palo Alto offices, explaining why the adventure-themed EV company suddenly decided to build its own self-driving cars, when an unexpected guest glides by the window outside: Waymo.

A robotaxi from the Alphabet-owned company pulls up outside the office. The passenger, an analyst from Goldman Sachs, briefly takes a selfie before climbing inside. The Rivian founder and CEO chuckles at the scene.

“That’s amazing,” he laughs. “So perfect.”

The arrival of the Waymo helps clarify the challenge that lies ahead for Rivian. A few hours earlier, Scaringe was onstage in front of an audience of hundreds of investors, reporters, and influencers gathered for the company’s announcement of a huge, expensive, and undeniably risky bet on autonomy and AI. The goal, he said, is for Rivian to design its own AI chips that can help power higher levels of autonomy, eventually leading to Level 4 — no human supervision required within certain limits. Could Rivian achieve what has taken Waymo decades to accomplish, but on a much shorter timeline?

More importantly, can it do it safer and more effectively than Tesla, the other EV-only company that is attempting its own messy transformation into an AI and robotics company? Rivian was founded as the outdoor lover’s answer to Elon Musk’s company: rugged, off-road worthy, and fully electric. Now it seems like it’s trying to chase the mercurial billionaire down an AI rabbit hole.

Scaringe insists this isn’t anything motivated by Tesla, but a recognition that the auto industry is staring up its own cliff. Advances in transformer-based encoding and large-parameter models prompted a fundamental shift in Rivian’s thinking of the “physical AI” of autonomous driving, he says. As such, Rivian began a clean-sheet redesign of its autonomy platform in early 2022. With the introduction of its Gen 2 platform, the company began building a “data flywheel” to train a large driving model (sort of like an LLM, but for driving) using real-world driving data from its fleet. And because the model is trained end-to-end, Rivian says that improvements in sensors or compute directly enhance its capabilities, allowing the system to continuously improve as hardware advances.

Either Rivian pursues its own self-produced, vertically integrated autonomy strategy, or it risks being left in the dust by Waymo, Tesla, and others. Several times during the presentation, Scaringe notes that this isn’t some bandwagon chasing, but rather a move born out of years of hard work and thoughtful design.

“I spent some time last night with the team talking about this right before we’re about to show it today,” Scaringe says onstage. “And one of the lead engineers looked at me and said, ‘Boy, we’ve been working on this for years, and I haven’t been able to talk about it. It’s so cool. Tomorrow I can start to talk about what I do every day, all day long.’”

Rivian certainly isn’t shy about sharing details now. The company’s “AI and Autonomy Day” is set up like a Silicon Valley high school science fair. Tours take us throughout the Rivian office to see various projects: the new chip that will help power its AI ambitions, complete with microscopes to inspect the silicon in extreme close-up; its new in-car, AI-powered voice assistant that can navigate you to your favorite winery or pick the right song by Jelly Roll; and the lidar sensor that will help its vehicles drive themselves by creating a 3D picture of the world around it. There’s even an R2 wrapped to look like R2-D2 from Star Wars.

The most notable thing I get to experience is a test drive with an early preview of Rivian’s new hands-free point-to-point capability. A software update, released soon after the event, allows Rivian owners to operate “hands-free” on 3.5 million miles of road in the US and Canada. The point-to-point capability will come at a later date and will unlock even more partial autonomous driving. Think of it as Rivian’s answer to Tesla’s Full Self-Driving feature.

Rivian says that starting next year, if a road has clear, painted lane lines, drivers will be able to use hands-free driving. It’ll be part of a paid package called Autonomy Plus, offered either as a one-time purchase of $2,900 or a monthly $49.99 subscription. (By comparison, Tesla offers its premium FSD option for $8,000 upfront or a $99-per-month fee.) Rivian’s Autonomy Plus package will be available free to all customers until March 2026.

The most notable thing I get to experience is a test drive with an early preview of Rivian’s new hands-free point-to-point capability.

I get to experience about 45 minutes of this feature from the passenger seat of an R1S as it drives through a series of tricky scenarios around Palo Alto. A Rivian engineer sits in the driver’s seat, ready to take control if anything goes wrong, but he mostly keeps his hands in his lap and his feet off the pedals as the R1S navigates intersections, traffic signals, and a bevy of pedestrians, cyclists, and other vulnerable road users.

The car seems to handle itself just fine, with the engineer only once taking control of the vehicle to avoid getting stuck at a red light. At one point, we thread a narrow path between a passing truck on one side and a cyclist in a bike lane on the other — and while I think we come a little too close to the cyclist, the car didn’t slow down or wobble in the lane. Days after the event, I learn of other test rides with more disengagements than mine.

There’s none of the jerkiness or hesitancy that I typically associate with a first-gen driver-assist system. Maybe that’s because in addition to 11 cameras, the system is also receiving data from five radar sensors, helping it form a more complete view of the world around it. Tesla’s FSD system, by comparison, is camera-only.

With more cars equipped with partial automation hitting the road, safety researchers are growing increasingly worried about driver attention and the potential for these systems to cause crashes. But Rivian subscribes to the theory that drivers should work with the hands-free system by adjusting the steering or pushing the accelerator without disengaging it. Rivian can switch between two different types of steering controllers that allow the driver to input their own steering when they want, Nick Nguyen, director of product and programs for autonomy, tells me.

“We’re big believers in collaboration,” he says. “We want you to interact with it as much or as little as you want.”

The real test is still to come. Rivian’s Gen 3 system will include the company’s proprietary silicon chip and the same sensor stack as Gen 2, with one crucial addition: lidar. The laser sensor is not typically found in privately owned vehicles, featuring more prominently in robotaxis like Waymo. Rivian is planning to add it to the upcoming more affordable model, the R2 — and taking a huge risk in the process.

Lidar is pricey, but those costs are coming down. Rivian wouldn’t disclose its lidar supplier, but the difference between a camera-only system like Tesla’s and one with multiple sensors is stark. During the presentation, James Philbin, Rivian’s vice president for autonomy and AI, shows a side-by-side visual comparison of Rivian’s autonomy software identifying and interpreting objects ahead using only its cameras; cameras and radar; and the trifecta of cameras, radar, and lidar. The latter setup is the clear victor, spotting several hidden objects and even pedestrians that the camera-only or camera-plus-radar approaches could not.

In our interview, Scaringe clarifies that the R2 will begin production next year without lidar or the Gen 3 autonomy computer, both of which won’t be added until the end of 2026. On Reddit, Rivian fans are upset that the company couldn’t better time the rollout so that early adopters wouldn’t be left to choose between a less powerful R2 right away or a more powerful one later. But Scaringe insists that demand for R2 is already so high that Rivian doesn’t expect a significant sales impact.

What could impact sales is a janky, unreliable system. But Scaringe assures me that Gen 3 is anything but. The AI computer will feature a dual-chip setup capable of 1,600 trillion operations a second (TOPS), a figure that he claims would have been unimaginable a few years ago.

But what actually matters is how fast the computer processes information, like pixels for camera-based robotics. Rivian says its Gen 3 system will be able to process 5 billion pixels a second, which is not a common specification you hear tossed around in the AI world, but one Scaringe believes should impress people even more than the TOPS measure.

Scaringe insists that demand for R2 is already so high that Rivian doesn’t expect a significant sales impact.

“Tesla recently talked about theirs,” he says. “I’ll let you Google it, but it’s a lot less.” (It’s 1 million pixels per milisecond.)

The next major milestone is “eyes-off” driving, where users no longer need to watch the road and, according to Scaringe, can fully reclaim their time to read, use their phone, or relax. Beyond that lies personal Level 4 capability, where the vehicle operates entirely on its own on certain roads, no human supervision required.

Whether Rivian ultimately gets there will depend on whether the company can create trust around its products. And that will require a transparent approach to legal liability that most automakers, Rivian included, have yet to fully embrace.

Scaringe notes that as autonomy improves, human driving will shrink from roughly 80–90 percent of miles today to 10–20 percent within a few years, and eventually to zero. At that point, a driver’s personal skill level becomes irrelevant to risk assessment, and insurance must shift accordingly, he says. Rivian has a partnership with Nationwide for its insurance claims, but has yet to work out how it will accept liability for crashes that occur in its autonomous vehicles.

“This is like the ticky-tacky of the real work streams to make this all real,” Scaringe says. “Beyond the technology, but actually, like, the business systems that need to be designed.”

In Palo Alto, the reactions to Rivian’s announcements are enthusiastic. All the influencers and analysts I talk to are impressed with what they’re being shown. But despite this, the company’s stock falls 6 percent the day of the event to close at $16.43 per share. Tesla, meanwhile, continues to trade at over $460 per share. Rivian’s stock has since bounced back slightly, and while the company has eked out a gross profit in the past, it’s still facing a very tough road ahead with the elimination of the EV tax credit and the enormous capital costs that will be needed to realize its AI dreams.

And there’s still the issue of why Rivian is doing this in the first place. While fans may be left scratching their heads over why their favorite outdoor brand is chasing after Tesla with its AI strategy, the company is doing the necessary work to keep itself relevant in a new era, says mobility investor Reilly Brennan.

“Having an AI strategy is growing into a necessary component for public auto companies in this era — at least the ones that want public market comps on the high end of the continuum, a la Tesla,” Brennan tells me. “Consider it like those overachieving high school students trying to get into Harvard: It’s not a requirement that they both started a charity and play the contrabassoon, but it sure seems like everyone else who gets in is doing it.”

There’s peer pressure, and then there’s the necessity of finding new ways to earn money off your customers. A $50-a-month autonomy subscription could be a lucrative new revenue stream for Rivian, which needs to become profitable to survive.

Scaringe sounds like a true convert. He thinks that we’re rapidly approaching a time in which AI will become as accessible as “running water and electricity,” he says during the presentation. No mention is made of how much running water and electricity is consumed by AI, which, for a company that purports to care about the environment, could quickly become a problem.

And Rivian is not fully committed to following Musk’s ceaseless, clout-chasing pursuit of robotaxis and humanoid robots — though Scaringe admits that both remain a possibility. The company spun off its own robotics division as Mind Robotics earlier this year, after all.

“The part of the problem that’s not solved is the Level 4,” he tells me, standing up because he has several more interviews ahead, and my time is up. “And so that’s our focus, on the tech.”

            <h2>The sold-out Nex Playground made my kids laugh and cry</h2>
            <p><strong>The Verge | 2025-12-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/games/848449/nex-playground-review-nintendo-wii-microsoft-kinect-motion-tracking-camera">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you told me last year the Nex Playground would outsell Microsoft’s Xbox, even for two weeks, I would have laughed my way out of the room.

It’s a three-inch cube of a game console that’s likely less powerful than your phone, one which uses a single camera to track your body. It only plays curated, certified kid-safe games. Though frequently compared to the Nintendo Wii and Microsoft Kinect, the Nex Playground is worse than either at tracking motion.

Nor is it cheap: $250 upfront plus $89-a-year or $49-a-quarter annual subscription to get more than a basic sampler. If you like a game, you can’t buy it separately. Many are little better than shovelware and most are graphically ugly; I haven’t tried a single game with the charm or polish of Nintendo or the best of Apple Arcade.

And yet, lying sick in bed with a 99-degree fever, my five-year-old begged me to let her play.

When we started a game of virtual bowling, even Grandpa wanted in. (Grandpa never wants in.)

“I want to try again!” said my nine-year-old, after she sent her low-rent airplane plummeting to its doom.

They didn’t care that the games were bad. They cared that they were dead simple to pick up and play, no controller and no experience necessary, on a big screen. They cared that the games made them dance and jump and swing their arms, and that their dad looked pretty funny doing the same.

I just wish the games didn’t make them cry, too.

Nearly 20 years ago, the Nintendo Wii put an infrared camera and an accelerometer in your hand to tell if you moved your arm fast, slow, closer or further, and track basic orientation. A few years later, Microsoft’s Kinect captured your whole body with no controller at all: it painted your room with a structured pattern of infrared light to estimate your skeletal position in 3D space.

The Playground is different: a single wide-angle camera up front and HDMI and USB-C power around back, nothing else to plug in. But it also doesn’t “see” 3D depth. It has to estimate your body pose from flat images.

Sometimes, it’s impressive: by identifying just six joints — shoulders, elbows, hands — you can throw a bowling ball straight down the lane or veer it left and right. But with no real depth perception, it can easily get confused: my nine-year-old couldn’t sit on the couch while my five-year-old was bowling several feet ahead, because the Playground assumed all their limbs belonged to the same person. My youngest cried for several minutes when the eldest raised a hand and accidentally stole her turn.

Soon it was the eldest’s turn to cry, too, when the Playground lost her hand mid-swing and sent her ball careening into the gutter. She got mad when it happened again.

There are so many things that can confuse single-camera tracking, and Nex knows it. Warnings include: Don’t wear clothing with repeating patterns. Don’t wear long sleeves. Play in a well-lit room, but not backlit. “Avoid non-players in the camera view.”

These all help a single camera tell people from their background — but parents know some are harder than they sound! Our kids get game time after their evening bath, which means PJs. Have you seen kids’ PJs? They have long sleeves and repeating patterns. Hearts. Stars. Smiley faces. Repeating cats and unicorns till the cows come home.

We had to roll up sleeves and rethink seating. Realistically, “Avoid non-players in the camera view” meant clearing the entire living room of anyone who wasn’t bowling, having them stand far off to the side, so that the camera didn’t suddenly snap to the wrong person mid-play. Sometimes we could sit on the couch with hands hidden behind blankets or laptops.

Even so, my kids frequently got too frustrated with the controls. “I can’t keep my hand steady! I just can’t keep it steady!” complained my five-year-old, trying to send her cute puppy for a spa treatment in Nex’s Nintendogs-like game. Many games don’t penalize kids for swinging their arms wildly, but some inexplicably require dragging a cursor to press virtual buttons.

It also feels like the Playground lags behind my movements, even plugged directly into a low-latency OLED TV with Game Mode turned on. In Nex’s kart racer game, I couldn’t turn the steering wheel as fast as I wanted in its fastest 150cc mode.

Again, the issues didn’t stop us from having fun, particularly when with games that don’t require precision. The kids had a blast with Mirrorama, which turns your TV into a giant mirror with magical camera filters that let kids shoot lightning bolts from their hands, stretch their face, blur like as speedy as Sonic the Hedgehog, dance with their own clone.

Mirrorama, above, made my kids laugh the most.

They enjoyed Copy Cat, where they just had to strike a zany cartoon pose and let AI judge who did it better. Meanwhile, I found Brick Buster to be an excellent Breakout clone — you only need move your body left or right to move the paddle, which is forgivingly large, and thrilling multiball action makes it fun.

I can’t say we’d get our money’s worth, though, because so many games are simple and inanely repetitive, or — like Connect 4 Bounce, where my kid and I gave up trying to get balls to even go in — frustrating from the get-go. Many sports games are either laughably easy or have a large learning curve because the camera can’t see depth, so it can’t detect how you’re hitting a ball. With tennis, for example, you can’t aim with your arm: it only controls the timing of your swing. You have to move the rest of your body to aim left or right.

One of Nex’s biggest marketing points is that it’s already attracted huge kid brands to the platform: Bluey, Peppa Pig, Gabby’s Dollhouse, Sesame Street, How to Train Your Dragon, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. But my kids weren’t necessarily sold.

Bluey, is one of the better licensed experiences — but my Bluey-loving kids weren’t that into it.

They seemed entranced at first with Unicorn Academy, but quickly disappointed when they couldn’t ride the unicorn anywhere interesting. The TMNT game is a frustrating endless runner where you constantly have to hop into the air to clear obstacles, though I suppose it could help tire out my kids. And even though they love Bluey, my kids quickly asked me to quit its too-repetitive balloon-bouncing game.

There’s enough in the Playground’s library that I bet your kids will find something they enjoy. My eldest wants to go visit her puppy, and the other night at dinner, my youngest erupted into cheers of “Bowling!!! I love bowling!!!” when we said we might play it again. Despite countless tracking failures, they say that Nex’s Flappy Bird clone, where up to four people hop in the air to keep their dragons eating fruit instead of crashing into towers, is one of their favs.

I think the Playground is far too much money for not nearly enough game. But it goes to show fun isn’t all about quality of execution. Many classic arcade games are frustratingly unfair, even broken — but sometimes you just want another turn to beat the machine.

            <div id="article-text">Google says it’s complying with the Epic injunction by erecting new programs and fees.

Google says it’s complying with the Epic injunction by erecting new programs and fees.

Today was the deadline for Google to reveal how it’s complying with Judge James Donato’s order to crack open Android for third-party app stores, stop illegally tying its Google Play Billing system to its app store, and let developers link to ways to download their apps outside the Play Store in the US.

But Google isn’t just letting app developers do things however and whenever they’d like. The company’s quietly updated its support pages with a January 28th deadline to enroll in specific Google programs for “alternative billing” and “external content links” — and these programs will come with large alternative fees of their own, assuming Judge Donato doesn’t opt for Epic and Google’s proposed settlement instead.

While it isn’t collecting fees yet, Google says it will charge developers $2.85 for every app and $3.65 for every game a user installs within 24 hours of clicking a link that takes you outside Google’s app store to download them outside the Google ecosystem.

Plus, it’ll take a 20 percent cut of any in-app purchases and 10 percent of any auto-renewing subscriptions. Apps still need to be submitted to Google for review, use a Google API to track them, and developers have to report all transactions (including $0 free trials) if they want to participate.

Meanwhile, developers who want to offer their own billing solutions will only get a 5 percent discount compared to Google’s current fees, likely making it not worth the effort to try alternative billing at all. Google will charge 25 percent for in-app purchases and 10 percent for auto-renewing subscriptions there; devs will need to integrate a Google API to track those, and report all transactions within 24 hours.

The company will cap some of these fees at 10 percent of a developer’s first $1 million of earnings, making it a bit easier for small developers, but perhaps no easier than it is currently. Google already offers a similar cap at 15 percent, so this too is a 5 percent discount.

How will Judge James Donato react? When Apple told Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers it would require a 27 percent fee for external payments in the parallel Epic v. Apple case, she found Apple in contempt of court, and an appeals court backed up that decision just days ago. However, the appeals court did suggest that Apple may be able to collect some fee, writing that:

Apple should be able to charge a commission on linked-out purchases based on the costs that are genuinely and reasonably necessary for its coordination of external links for linked-out purchases, but no more.

Google currently claims that “the fees associated with the external content links program reflect the value provided by Android and Play and support our continued investments across Android and Play.”

But Google also says it won’t collect any fees quite yet, writing:

In the future, Google intends to apply a service fee on successful transactions and downloads completed via external content links. At this time, however, Google is not assessing these fees and is therefore not requiring developers in this program to report these transactions or downloads to Google.

In their joint progress report today, Epic and Google’s lawyers write that while Epic agrees with the January 28th deadline and other requirements, “Epic has indicated that it opposes the service fees that Google announced it may implement in the future and that Epic will challenge these fees if they come into effect.”

Of course, none of this will come to pass if Judge Donato accepts Google and Epic’s proposed settlement instead, which would generally apply worldwide (instead of just in the US) and comes with lower standard transaction fees.

But Google signaled that settlement, too, would come with fees on alternative billing and external app downloads, and Judge Donato seemed skeptical of the settlement in November. He’s ordered an evidentiary hearing on January 22nd before he makes a decision.

Since Google’s support pages seem to be fluid as Epic v. Google continues, we’ve archived copies of their current text below.

China figured out how to sell EVs. Now it has to bury their batteries.

In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road.

It’s a weird time to be an AI doomer.This small but influential community believes, in the simplest terms, that AI could get so good it could be bad—very, very bad—for humanity.The doomer crowd has had some notable success over the past several years: including helping shape AI policy coming from the Biden administration. But a number of developments over the past six months have put them on the back foot. Talk of an AI bubble has overwhelmed the discourse as tech companies continue to invest in multiple Manhattan Projects’ worth of data centers without any certainty that future demand will match what they’re building.So where does this leave the doomers? We decided to ask some of the movement’s biggest names to see if the recent setbacks and general vibe shift had altered their views. See what they had to say in our story.—Garrison Lovely

Synthesia’s AI clones are more expressive than ever. Soon they’ll be able to talk back.

Earlier this summer, I visited the AI company Synthesia to create a hyperrealistic AI-generated avatar of me. The company’s avatars are a decent barometer of just how dizzying progress has been in AI over the past few years, so I was curious just how accurately its latest AI model, introduced last month, could replicate me.I found my avatar as unnerving as it is technically impressive. It’s slick enough to pass as a high-definition recording of a chirpy corporate speech, and if you didn’t know me, you’d probably think that’s exactly what it was.My avatar shows how it’s becoming ever-harder to distinguish the artificial from the real. And before long, these avatars will even be able to talk back to us. But how much better can they get? And what might interacting with AI clones do to us? Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In August 2025, Wang Lei decided it was finally time to say goodbye to his electric vehicle.

Wang, who is 39, had bought the car in 2016, when EVs still felt experimental in Beijing. It was a compact Chinese brand. The subsidies were good, and the salesman talked about “supporting domestic innovation.” At the time, only a few people around him were driving on batteries. He liked being early.

But now, the car’s range had started to shrink as the battery’s health declined. He could have replaced the battery, but the warranty had expired; the cost and trouble no longer felt worth it. He also wanted an upgrade, so selling became the obvious choice.

His vague plans turned into action after he started seeing ads on Douyin from local battery recyclers. He asked around at a few recycling places, and the highest offer came from a smaller shop on the outskirts of town. He added the contact on WeChat, and the next day someone drove over to pick up his car. He got paid 8,000 yuan. With the additional automobile scrappage subsidy offered by the Chinese government, Wang ultimately pocketed about 28,000 yuan.

Wang is part of a much larger trend. In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.

But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.

The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, building out formal recycling networks and take-back programs, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road.

Like the batteries in our phones and laptops, those in EVs today are mostly lithium-ion packs. Their capacity drops a little every year, making the car slower to charge, shorter in range, and more prone to safety issues. Three professionals who work in EV retail and battery recycling told MIT Technology Review that a battery is often considered to be ready to retire from a car after its capacity has degraded to under 80%. The research institution EVtank estimates that the year’s total volume of retired EV batteries in China will come in at 820,000 tons, with annual totals climbing toward 1 million tons by 2030.

In China, this growing pile of aging batteries is starting to test a recycling ecosystem that is still far from fully built out but is rapidly growing. By the end of November 2025, China had close to 180,000 enterprises involved in battery recycling, and more than 30,000 of them had been registered since January 2025. Over 60% of the firms were founded within the past three years. This does not even include the unregulated gray market of small workshops.

Typically, one of two things happens when an EV’s battery is retired. One is called cascade utilization, in which usable battery packs are tested and repurposed for slower applications like energy storage or low-speed vehicles. The other is full recycling: Cells are dismantled and processed to recover metals such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese, which are then reused to manufacture new batteries. Both these processes, if done properly, take significant upfront investment that is often not available to small players.

But smaller, illicit battery recycling centers can offer higher prices to consumers because they ignore costs that formal recyclers can’t avoid, like environmental protection, fire safety, wastewater treatment, compliance, and taxes, according to the three battery recycling professionals MIT Technology Review spoke to.

“They [workers] crack them open, rearrange the cells into new packs, and repackage them to sell,” says Gary Lin, a battery recycling worker who worked in several unlicensed shops from 2022 to 2024. Sometimes, the refurbished batteries are even sold as “new” to buyers, he says. When the batteries are too old or damaged, workers simply crush them and sell them by weight to rare-metal extractors. “It’s all done in a very brute-force way. The wastewater used to soak the batteries is often just dumped straight into the sewer,” he says.

This poorly managed battery waste can release toxic substances, contaminate water and soil, and create risks of fire and explosion. That is why the Chinese government has been trying to steer batteries into certified facilities. Since 2018, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has issued five “white lists” of approved power-battery recyclers, now totaling 156 companies. Despite this, formal recycling rates remain low compared with the rapidly growing volume of waste batteries.

China is not only the world’s largest EV market; it has also become the main global manufacturing hub for EVs and the batteries that power them. In 2024, the country accounted for more than 70% of global electric-car production and more than half of global EV sales, and firms like CATL and BYD together control close to half of global EV battery output, according to a report by the International Energy Agency. These companies are stepping in to offer solutions to customers wishing to offload their old batteries. Through their dealers and 4S stores, many carmakers now offer take-back schemes or opportunities to trade in old batteries for discount when owners scrap a vehicle or buy a new one.

BYD runs its own recycling operations that process thousands of end-of-life packs a year and has launched dedicated programs with specialist recyclers to recover materials from its batteries. Geely has built a “circular manufacturing” system that combines disassembly of scrapped vehicles, cascade use of power batteries, and high recovery rates for metals and other materials.

CATL, China’s biggest EV maker, has created one of the industry’s most developed recycling systems through its subsidiary Brunp, with more than 240 collection depots, an annual disposal capacity of about 270,000 tons of waste batteries, and metal recovery rates above 99% for nickel, cobalt, and manganese.

“No one is better equipped to handle these batteries than the companies that make them,” says Alex Li, a battery engineer based in Shanghai. That’s because they already understand the chemistry, the supply chain, and the uses the recovered materials can be put to next. Carmakers and battery makers “need to create a closed loop eventually,” he says.

But not every consumer can receive that support from the maker of their EV, because many of those manufacturers have ceased to exist. In the past five years, over 400 smaller EV brands and startups have gone bankrupt as the price war made it hard to stay afloat, leaving only 100 active brands today.

Analysts expect many more used batteries to hit the market in the coming years, as the first big wave of EVs bought under generous subsidies reach retirement age. Li says, “China is going to need to move much faster toward a comprehensive end-of-life system for EV batteries—one that can trace, reuse and recycle them at scale, instead of leaving so many to disappear into the gray market.”

            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard!

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you. We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.
