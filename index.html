            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/florida-schools-plan-to-vastly-expand-use-of-ai-that-mistook-clarinet-for-gun/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A Florida middle school was locked down last week after an AI security system called ZeroEyes mistook a clarinet for a gun, reviving criticism that AI may not be worth the high price schools pay for peace of mind.

Human review of the AI-generated false flag did not stop police from rushing to Lawton Chiles Middle School. Cops expected to find “a man in the building, dressed in camouflage with a ‘suspected weapon pointed down the hallway, being held in the position of a shouldered rifle,&#39;” a Washington Post review of the police report said.

Instead, after finding no evidence of a shooter, cops double-checked with dispatchers who confirmed that a closer look at the images indicated that “the suspected rifle might have been a band instrument.” Among panicked students hiding in the band room, police eventually found the suspect, a student “dressed as a military character from the Christmas movie Red One for the school’s Christmas-themed dress-up day,” the Post reported.

ZeroEyes cofounder Sam Alaimo told the Post that the AI performed exactly as it should have in this case, adopting a “better safe than sorry” outlook. A ZeroEyes spokesperson told Ars that “school resource officers, security directors and superintendents consistently ask us to be proactive and forward them an alert if there is any fraction of a doubt that the threat might be real.”

“We don’t think we made an error, nor does the school,” Alaimo said. “That was better to dispatch [police] than not dispatch.”

Cops left after the confused student confirmed he was “unaware” that the way he was holding his clarinet could have triggered that alert, the Post reported. But ZeroEyes’ spokesperson claimed he was “intentionally holding the instrument in the position of a shouldered rifle.” And seemingly rather than probe why the images weren’t more carefully reviewed to prevent a false alarm on campus, the school appeared to agree with ZeroEyes and blame the student.

“We did not make an error, and the school was pleased with the detection and their response,” ZeroEyes’ spokesperson said.

In a letter to parents, the principal, Melissa Laudani, reportedly told parents that “while there was no threat to campus, I’d like to ask you to speak with your student about the dangers of pretending to have a weapon on a school campus.” Along similar lines, Seminole County Public Schools (SCPS) communications officer, Katherine Crnkovich, emphasized in an email to Ars to “please make sure it is noted that this student wasn’t simply carrying a clarinet. This individual was holding it as if it were a weapon.”

However, warning students against brandishing ordinary objects like weapons isn’t a perfect solution. Video footage from a Texas high school in 2023 showed that ZeroEyes can sometimes confuse shadows for guns, accidentally flagging a student simply walking into school as a potential threat. The advice also ignores that ZeroEyes last year reportedly triggered a lockdown and police response after detecting two theater kids using prop guns to rehearse a play. And a similar AI tool called Omnilert made national headlines confusing an empty Doritos bag with a gun, which led to a 14-year-old Baltimore sophomore’s arrest. In that case, the student told the American Civil Liberties Union that he was just holding the chips when AI sent “like eight cop cars” to detain him.

For years, school safety experts have warned that AI tools like ZeroEyes take up substantial resources even though they are “unproven,” the Post reported. ZeroEyes’ spokesperson told Ars that “in most cases, ZeroEyes customers will never receive a ‘false positive,&#39;” but the company is not transparent about how many false positives it receives or how many guns have been detected. An FAQ only notes that “we are always looking to minimize false positives and are constantly improving our learning models based on data collected.” In March, as some students began questioning ZeroEyes after it flagged a Nerf gun at a Pennsylvania university, a nearby K-12 private school, Germantown Academy, confirmed that its “system often makes ‘non-lethal’ detections.”

One critic, school safety consultant Kenneth Trump, suggested in October that these tools are “security theater,” with firms like ZeroEyes lobbying for taxpayer dollars by relying on what the ACLU called “misleading” marketing to convince schools that tools are proactive solutions to school shootings. Seemingly in response to this backlash, StateScoop reported that days after it began probing ZeroEyes in 2024, the company scrubbed a claim from its FAQ that said ZeroEyes “can prevent active shooter and mass shooting incidents.”

At Lawton Chiles Middle School, “the children were never in any danger,” police confirmed, but experts question if false positives cause students undue stress and suspicion, perhaps doing more harm than good in absence of efficacy studies. Schools may be better off dedicating resources to mental health services proven to benefit kids, some critics have suggested.

Laudani’s letter encouraged parents to submit any questions they have about the incident, but it’s hard to gauge if anyone’s upset. Asked if parents were concerned or if ZeroEyes has ever triggered lockdown at other SCPS schools, Crnkovich told Ars that SCPS does not “provide details regarding the specific school safety systems we utilize.”

It’s clear, however, that SCPS hopes to expand its use of ZeroEyes. In November, Florida state Senator Keith Truenow submitted a request to install “significantly more cameras”—about 850—equipped with ZeroEyes across the school district. Truenow backed up his request for $500,000 in funding over the next year by claiming that “the more [ZeroEyes] coverage there is, the more protected students will be from potential gun violence.”

ZeroEyes is among the most popular tools attracting heavy investments from schools in 48 states, which hope that AI gun detection will help prevent school shootings. The AI technology is embedded in security cameras, trained on images of people holding guns, and can supposedly “detect as little as an eighth of an inch of a gun,” an ABC affiliate in New York reported.

Monitoring these systems continually, humans review AI flags, then text any concerning images detected to school superintendents. Police are alerted when human review determines images may constitute actual threats. ZeroEyes’ spokesperson told Ars that “it has detected more than 1,000 weapons in the last three years.” Perhaps most notably, ZeroEyes “detected a minor armed with an AK-47 rifle on an elementary school campus in Texas,” where no shots were fired, StateScoop reported last year.

Schools invest tens or, as the SCPS case shows, even hundreds of thousands annually, the exact amount depending on the number of cameras they want to employ and other variables impacting pricing. ZeroEyes estimates that most schools pay $60 per camera monthly. Bigger contracts can discount costs. In Kansas, a statewide initiative equipping 25 cameras at 1,300 schools with ZeroEyes was reportedly estimated to cost $8.5 million annually. Doubling the number of cameras didn’t provide much savings, though, with ZeroEyes looking to charge $15.2 million annually to expand coverage.

To critics, it appears that ZeroEyes is attempting to corner the market on AI school security, standing to profit off schools’ fears of shootings, while showing little proof of the true value of its systems. Last year, ZeroEyes reported its revenue grew 300 percent year over year from 2023 to 2024, after assisting in “more than ten arrests through its thousands of detections, verifications, and notifications to end users and law enforcement.”

Curt Lavarello, the executive director of the School Safety Advocacy Council, told the ABC News affiliate that “all of this technology is very, very expensive,” considering that “a lot of products … may not necessarily do what they’re being sold to do.”

Another problem, according to experts who have responded to some of the country’s deadliest school shootings, is that while ZeroEyes’ human reviewers can alert police in “seconds,” police response can often take “several minutes.” That delay could diminish ZeroEyes’ impact, one expert suggested, noting that at an Oregon school he responded to, there was a shooter who “shot 25 people in 60 seconds,” StateScoop reported.

In Seminole County, where the clarinet incident happened, ZeroEyes has been used since 2021, but SCPS would not confirm if any guns have ever been detected to justify next year’s desired expansion. It’s possible that SCPS has this information, as Sen. Truenow noted in his funding request that ZeroEyes can share reports with schools “to measure the effectiveness of the ZeroEyes deployment” by reporting on “how many guns were detected and alerted on campus.”

ZeroEyes’ spokesperson told Ars that “trained former law enforcement and military make split-second, life-or-death decisions about whether the threat is real,” which is supposed to help reduce false positives that could become more common as SCPS adds ZeroEyes to many more cameras.

Amanda Klinger, the director of operations at the Educator’s School Safety Network, told the Post that too many false alarms could carry two risks. First, more students could be put in dangerous situations when police descend on schools where they anticipate confronting an active shooter. And second, cops may become fatigued by false alarms, perhaps failing to respond with urgency over time. For students, when AI labels them as suspects, it can also be invasive and humiliating, reports noted.

“We have to be really clear-eyed about what are the limitations of these technologies,” Klinger said.</div>

            <h2>LLMs’ impact on science: Booming publications, stagnating quality</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/llms-impact-on-science-booming-publications-stagnating-quality/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There have been a number of high-profile cases where scientific papers have had to be retracted because they were filled with AI-generated slop—the most recent coming just two weeks ago. These instances raise serious questions about the quality of peer review in some journals—how could anyone let a figure with terms like “runctitional,” “fexcectorn,” and “frymblal” through, especially given the ‘m’ in frymblal has an extra hump? But it has not been clear whether these high-profile examples are representative. How significantly has AI use been influencing the scientific literature?

A collaboration of researchers at Berkeley and Cornell have decided to take a look. They’ve scanned three of the largest archives of pre-publication papers and identified ones that are likely to have been produced using Large Language Models. And they found that, while researchers produce far more papers after starting to use AI and the quality of the language used went up, the publication rate of these papers has dropped.

The researchers began by obtaining the abstracts of everything placed in three major pre-publication archives between 2018 and mid-2024. At the arXiv, this netted them 1.2 million documents; another 675,000 were found in the Social Science Research Network; and bioRxiv provided another 220,000. So, this was both a lot of material to work with and covered a lot of different fields of research. It also included documents that were submitted before Large Language Models were likely to be able to produce output that would be deemed acceptable.

The researchers took the abstracts from the pre-ChatGPT period and trained a model to recognize the statistics of human-generated text. Those same abstracts were then fed into GPT 3.5, which rewrote them, and the same process was repeated. The model could then be used to estimate whether a given abstract was likely to have been produced by an AI or an actual human.

The research team then used this to identify a key transition point: when a given author at one of these archives first started using an LLM to produce a submission. They then compared the researchers’ prior productivity to what happened once they turned to AI. “LLM adoption is associated with a large increase in researchers’ scientific output in all three preprint repositories,” they conclude.

This effect was likely to be most pronounced in people that weren’t native speakers of English. If the researchers limited the analysis to people with Asian names working at institutions in Asia, their rate of submissions to bioRxiv and SSRN nearly doubled once they started using AI and rose by over 40 percent at the arXiv. This suggests that people who may not have the strongest English skills are using LLMs to overcome a major bottleneck: producing compelling text.

The value of producing compelling text should not be underestimated. “Papers with clear but complex language are perceived to be stronger and are cited more frequently,” the researchers note, suggesting that we may use the quality of writing as a proxy for the quality of the research it’s describing. And they found some indication of that here, as non-LLM-assisted papers were more likely to be published in the peer reviewed literature if they used complex language (the abstracts were scored for language complexity using a couple of standard measures).

But the dynamic was completely different for LLM-produced papers. The complexity of language in papers written with an LLM was generally higher than for those using natural language. But they were less likely to end up being published. “For LLM-assisted manuscripts,” the researchers write, “the positive correlation between linguistic complexity and scientific merit not only disappears, it inverts.”

But not all of the differences were bleak. When the researchers checked the references being used in AI-assisted papers, they found that the LLMs weren’t just citing the same papers that everyone else did. They instead cited a broader range of sources, and were more likely to cite books and recent papers. So, there’s a chance that AI use could ultimately diversify the published research that other researchers consider (assuming they check their own references, which they clearly should).

There are a couple of cautions for interpreting these results. One, acknowledged by the researchers, is that people may be using AI to produce initial text that’s then heavily edited, and that may be mislabeled as human-produced text here. So, the overall prevalence of AI use is likely to be higher. The other is that some manuscripts may take a while to get published, so their use of that as a standard for scientific quality may penalize more recent drafts—which are more likely to involve AI use. These may ultimately bias some of the results, but the effects the authors saw were so large that they’re unlikely to go away entirely.

Beyond those cautions, the situation these results describe is a bit mixed. On the plus side, the ability of AIs to help researchers express their ideas could help more scientific work come to the attention of the wider community. The authors also note that the use of LLMs trained on general language may limit their reliance on jargon, and thus open up scientific disciplines to people with other specializations, potentially enabling new collaborations.

That said, the disconnect between writing quality and scientific quality may make it harder for researchers to take their usual shortcuts to estimating scientific quality. With nothing obvious to replace it, this could cause some significant challenges for researchers.

Left completely unmentioned is the issue of how this plays out in the peer review process. The low cost of starting online-only journals has led to their proliferation, with a corresponding growth in the need for peer reviewers. Editors regularly complain about not getting reviews back in a timely manner and faculty that they’re swamped with requests to review papers. If LLMs boost researchers’ ability to produce manuscripts for review, the situation is only going to get worse.

In any case, the authors point out this is an entirely new capability, and we’re only just starting to see it put to use. “As models improve and scientists discover new ways to integrate them into their work,” they write, “the future impact of these technologies will likely dwarf the effects that we have highlighted here. ”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Guitarists today are spoiled for choice, and that goes doubly true for players who use computer-based amp modeling software. I’m one such player, and I don’t miss the size, weight, deafening volume, or cost of owning an amp and cabinet collection, to say nothing of all those pedals and cables. For clean to mid-gain tones alone, I already have more terrific options than I need, including Neural DSP’s Tone King and Cory Wong and Mateus Asato, Polychrome DSP’s Lumos, and Universal Audio’s new Paradise Guitar Studio. All work slightly differently, but they can each output record-ready tones that are really, really close to the (often incredibly expensive) hardware that they model, and they each give you plenty of great-sounding presets to start from.

So do we really need one amp sim package?

Neural DSP thinks we do, because the Finnish company just dropped a major new release yesterday called Archetype: John Mayer X. It doesn’t model Mayer’s type of gear but his actual hardware units, along with all the actual settings he uses in the studio and on stage. It even has some presets that he designed. Which is great if you want to sound like John Mayer—but what does the software offer for those of us not trying to cover Continuum?

To find out, I spent a few hours playing with Mayer X, and I came away impressed. Neural DSP has released so many metal amp sims in the last few years that I’ve come to associate the company with downtuned chugga-chugga. Don’t get me wrong: I like long hair, skulls, and palm-muted riffs as much as the next person, but it’s nice to have some variety.

Mayer X brings that variety by modeling three of Mayer’s amps: a 1964 Fender Vibroverb, a Dumble Steel String Singer #002, and a not-yet-released prototype Two-Rock. Each amp also comes with a model of its associated speaker cabinet, in front of which you can freely position zero, one, or two microphones to shape the recorded sound and to control the room tone as desired.

This is standard practice for Neural DSP’s “Archetypes” line, but one wrinkle is the new “three-in-one amp” mode that blends the sounds from all amps at once. Here’s the marketing speak: “It merges all three amps and their matching cabinets with Mayer’s exact settings, mic placements, and EQ decisions, creating a unified, dimensional sound that reflects his full signal path without requiring individual amp balancing.” In this mode, each amp gets a single knob, but you are always free to turn this off and use one particular amp instead, which exposes more controls for that unit.

Also new here is an effect that Neural calls the “Gravity Tank.” This effects unit combines Mayer’s “favorite spring reverb” with the harmonic tremolo found in the Victoria Reverberato. It sounds great; while I like spring reverbs for character, especially on guitar parts, some are a bit too “drippy” for me. And although this one definitely sounds like a spring, it’s subtle and spacious rather than clangy or overly metallic, and the tremolo—which you can sync to your DAW’s tempo—sounds terrific too.

Instead of a compressor pedal at the front of the amp, as in many Neural DSP plugins, the Mayer X Archetype features a rack-mounted compressor (this one is modeled off the famous Distressor) that comes after the amp. The controls are much simpler than a real Distressor, but under the hood, Neural says that it is using “Mayer’s exact attack, release, and sidechain settings”; users, however, only need to spin the Input and Output dials.

Above the compressor is an EQ, but unlike Neural’s usual practice, this is not a multiband graphic EQ. Instead, it’s a four-band semi-parametric EQ with knobs rather than sliders, plus a high-pass and low-pass filter. The EQ is said to “balance the naturally full low end of [Mayer’s] amplifiers.”

There are effects pedals here, too—five are up front, before the amps. You get a volume boost pedal meant especially to thicken the tone of single-coil pickups like those found on Fender Stratocasters or PRS Silver Sky guitars (which Mayer also helped design). Then you get an “antelope filter” that provides a sort of auto-wah effect; usually, I hate these sorts of things, but this one sounds good enough that I could see myself using it on lead lines without feeling like I’m some kind of ’70s funk refugee.

After that come two drive pedals that are modeled on the Klon Centaur, the Ibanez TS-10, and the Marshall Bluesbreaker MK1. That’s right: You get three effects units jammed into two virtual pedals, because one of the pedals has a toggle switch to offer two different tones.

Finally, there’s a bucket brigade delay meant largely for slapback echoes, while a separate post-amp effects section offers more traditional delay and reverb (both hall and plate) for space.

While you won’t find this exact gear and these exact settings elsewhere, several of the amp simulation suites mentioned at the top of this piece provide plenty of “ballpark” options. (Paradise Guitar Studio, for instance, also models a Klon Centaur pedal and offers boost pedals and even more overdrive pedal options, along with spring reverb and bucket brigade delays.)

Whether you need (or “need”) Mayer X depends on just what other gear you have and what kind of tone you’re chasing. To me, the presets in Mayer X sound just slightly more modern than Paradise Guitar Studio, which especially emphasizes “classic” rock sounds from the ’60s to the ’90s. And Mayer X offers so many more amps and effects than Neural DSP’s Tone King, which I previously used for some of these sorts of sounds.

One of the best things about this package is that it is not “hyped” to sound over the top in standalone guitar demos, which is why its sounds fit so well into mixes. Reverb, delay, tremolo, boost, and drive are subtle and judicious, as is compression. Nearly everything is usable if you play anywhere in the pop/blues/rock/funk landscape. Even effects like freeze delay and the antelope filter—two types of effects that generally feel irrelevant or gimmicky to me—here inspire actual creativity. This is my personal taste talking—yours may differ—but the entire Mayer X package offers tone colors I would actually use in projects rather than garish neons that sound “impressive” but are unlikely to work as-is in any given song.

So if you’re looking for Mayer’s brand of smooth-but-full blues-inspired leads or his edge of breakup rhythm tones, John Mayer X is certainly a good way to get it in one package. This doesn’t feel like a cash-in, either; the quality and variety is immediately apparent, especially in new or custom bits like the boost pedal, the antelope filter, the Gravity Tank, and the “three-in-one” amp.

Just to see what I could do with almost no tweaking, I played around with presets for a couple of hours and came up with this short demo that features rhythm, double-tracked rhythm, filtered, overdriven rhythm, and delayed lead sounds. I even laid down a little bass (Mayer X does include a few bass-specific presets to get you started). To me, everything works well right out of the box, and the sounds blend well with each other (and with bass/drum tracks) in the mix, something not always true of presets. A little EQ and some mild master bus processing, and I ended up with the demo below:

Redditors who have played with the plugin so far seem impressed. “Absolutely blown away. Every single amp, mic, cab and pedal option is usable and sounds amazing,” wrote one.

“I’m a mostly clean-to-slight-crunch player, and this is by FAR the most plug-in-and-get-great-sounds-out-of-it NDSP plugin for that style that I’ve tried,” wrote another.

But they also echo my chief complaint. The downside of all these guitar sim plugins is that they are getting increasingly expensive. Universal Audio’s recent Paradise Guitar Studio claims a full price of $199 (I say “claims” because most of the company’s products are on sale most of the time). John Mayer X is going for €169 + tax in the US ($198 at current currency rates), and even more in Europe, while Neural DSP’s previous Archetype, the Misha Mansoor X, is only €125 ($146). Perhaps in this Archetype, the “X” stands for “expensive”?

That’s a lot of scratch for a plugin, though of course this one models gear worth many thousands of dollars and is far cheaper than buying modeling hardware like Neural DSP’s own Quad Cortex. (Those inclined to wait may be able to pick up Mayer X during one of Neural DSP’s biannual sales, often at 50 percent off.) And this one certainly sounds great.

If you’re one of those who suffer from gear acquisition syndrome (GAS), potent in both its physical and digital forms, these $150–$200 plugins add up quickly. Buy four or five and you’re into some real money! So if you already have other clean to mid-gain amp sims that work well for you, wisdom might suggest making your peace with what you have rather than looking for incremental improvements every time a new plugin appears. (There’s always a 14-day trial if you want to test Mayer X first.)

But if you’re newer to the amp sim market or have money to blow on your hobby or just love Mayer’s tones, Mayer X is certainly a wonderful place to start. Will you sound like Mayer? Probably not, given how much “tone” actually resides in the fingers, but you will get a great creative toolkit for bringing out the best in your own sound.

The real takeaway here is that technology has made it an amazing time to be a guitar player. We’re blessed for choices, and those choices get better every day.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">What’re professional team sports without a good shoving match? Basketball star Kyrie Irving got into one recently — though not on the court, but with a humanoid robot.

In a video shared by the Dallas Mavericks social media page, a Unitree G1 android shows off its slick karate moves in front of the team, before Irving approaches and squares it up. The diminutive 4’2″ robot displays better survival instincts than most humans and nervously skitters away from the imposing athlete, who is two feet taller.

But it was to no avail. Irving shoves it in the chest, and the robot stumbles with human-like agility — or lack thereof — before falling flat on its back. Onlookers howl in laughter as it lies paralyzed on the ground, utterly motionless.

“My apologies, I thought I could push him a little harder,” Irving says, while the robot’s operators attend to it like courtside medics. “My bad.”

Maybe next time he can shoot hoops with one instead.

Back falls are no joke. Irving and the others try to lift the bot back on its feet, but it remains unresponsive, its limbs flopping around. Later, Irving comes back to check on it one last time, but it’s still out cold.

The Unitree G1 has become a cultural sensation with its surprising spryness and cute stature, with influencers using them for all kinds of slapstick stunts and “GONE WRONG!” videos. Some have become their own mini-celebrities, like “Jake the Rizzbot,” which is known for slinging Gen-Z slang and coming out as gay, whatever that means for a robot.

One way Unitree bots often shows off their adroitness is by performing martial arts moves, a trend that other robotics companies have eagerly jumped on (with some interesting iterations.) The flipside is that they also make tempting punching-bags for humans. No doubt that it’s hilarious to see them ragdoll on the ground after getting laid out, but they can only take so much abuse. The owners of Jake the Rizzbot, for instance, are currently suing the popular streamer IShowSpeed for allegedly wrecking their little celebrity after he punched it in the face, pinned it to a couch, and threw it to the ground during a stream.

As it stands, it’s unclear what condition the Mavericks robot is in after Irving made it eat pavement. But we hope it’s okay — if not for its sake, then for our own.

“Skynet will remember that,” a commenter joked.

            <h2>When Asked to Generate an Alphabet Poster for Preschoolers, the Latest Version of ChatGPT Just Flails Wildly</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On December 11, OpenAI release ChatGPT 5.2, the latest version of the widely used AI chatbot.

As it does every time it releases a minor update, the company hailed its latest version as a “significant improvement in general intelligence,” calling it the “best model yet for real-world, professional use.” In a further display of hubris, OpenAI even went so far as to claim 5.2 is their “first model that performs at or above a human expert level.”

Yet when we ran it through an incredibly simple prompt — to generate an alphabetized chart of animals for school children — the world-beating AI model came up laughably short.

The ABC deficiency was first noticed by BCA Research chief global strategist Peter Berezin. Using ChatGPT 5.1, which was released back in November, Berezin asked the AI to “draw [a] poster where you say A is for an animal that starts with the letter A, B for an animal that starts with B, all the way to Z.”

That version thought for six seconds, and spat out an image with 25 letters, as opposed to the standard English alphabet which uses 26. Already off to a rocky start, 5.1 does an okay job with “A” through “I,” but falls off the rails as soon as it gets to “K,” which it says “is for Lion.”

It goes on like this: “O is for jellyfish,” while “Q is for penguin” and “R is for snake.” By the time it gets to the end, “Z” is for “urba” — a turtle, apparently — followed by “B,” along with a picture of a pig.

“Still needs more capex,” Berezin quips, referencing the $1.15 trillion OpenAI has committed to spending on hardware in 2025 alone.

We were curious how ChatGPT 5.2 stacked up to its month-old predecessor — and sure enough, it didn’t disappoint.

Though the latest version of ChatGPT did a bit better with individual animals, it still only identified 24 letters in the English alphabet, forgetting “U” and “Z.” Instead, 5.2 listed “Y” for “Yak” right after “T.” This particular alphabet ends with “X,” which of course stands for “X-ray fish,” but is illustrated by a Zebra.

Its illustrations were also a bit suspect, with Kangaroos sporting a weird limb, an Iguana with two tails, a Narwal with a strange mash of eyes and fins as well as a bird’s beak, and a hedgehog with a cat’s face, to name a few weak points.

A follow-up prompt only spread the spill around. This time, there are 25 letters total. “Y” is still a problem area, taking the place of “U,” only this time it stands for “Unicorn,” which isn’t a real animal in the first place. By the end, there are two entries for “X,” one of which “is for fish,” followed by another “X,” again for “X-ray fish,” but with the same Zebra illustration.

The second poster also starts to scramble the instructions, injecting bits of the prompt into the poster title: “A is for alligator, B is for bear…”

As some users on X-formerly-Twitter pointed out, results are the same for Google’s Gemini, and as a quick glance at Grok shows, Elon Musk’s AI engine isn’t even close. But while ChatGPT might be the best at making an animal poster, it still comes up laughably short — and certainly not at the level of any “human expert” we’ve ever met.

            <div id="article-text">You don’t share the road with robotaxis — the robotaxis munificently share the road with you.

This week, one of Waymo’s fully driverless cabs was spotted blundering down the wrong side of a street in Austin, Texas, causing the human motorists driving in the correct direction to cautiously come to a halt, not unlike hikers encountering a bear.

The incident was captured in footage uploaded to Reddit. For a split second, it shows the Waymo flash its emergency signal, before switching to its turn signal. The robotaxi then turns in the opposite direction indicated by its blinker and pulls into a gas station, taking its sweet time.

“Just another day in Austin,” the uploader wrote in the caption.

Local news site My San Antonio reports that the incident took place on a stretch of frontage road next to the Interstate 35 highway in downtown Austin.

It’s another example of robotaxis acting with the kind of impunity to traffic laws you might expect from someone playing Grand Theft Auto. In fact, it’s not even the first time they’ve been caught driving on the wrong side of the road. Waymo may boast an impressive safety record, but its driverless cabs can still go off the rails in ways that can be comical, baffling, or genuinely dangerous.

This month, for example, Waymo recalled a software patch after its robotaxis were caught blowing past stopped school buses with active warning lights and stop signs, including at least one incident where a Waymo drove right by students who were disembarking. Twenty of these incidents were reported in Austin alone, MySA noted, prompting the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to open an investigation into the company.

It’s not just school buses: the cabs don’t always stop for law enforcement, either. Earlier this month, a Waymo careened into an active police standoff, driving just a few feet away from a suspect who was lying facedown in the asphalt while cops had their guns trained on him.

In San Francisco, Waymo sparked outrage in the community after one of its robotaxis killed a beloved bodega cat known to locals as Kit Kat. Another ran over a dog that witnesses say was playing in the street.

These come as Waymo has been updating its cars’ software to drive more aggressively like a human motorist.

“Safety is our highest priority at Waymo, both for people who choose to ride with us and with whom we share the streets,” a spokesperson told MySA in a statement. “We take situations like this seriously and are committed to improving road safety through our ongoing learnings and experience.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Instacart will pay $60 million in refunds to settle allegations by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission that it deceived consumers with false advertising. The federal agency alleged Instacart misled consumers with unlawful tactics, causing them to pay higher fees while also denying refunds.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) stated Instacart’s ‘free delivery’ claims are misleading because customers are still required to pay a mandatory service fee, which can add up to 15% to their total order.

The agency also said the delivery platform’s “100% satisfaction guarantee” promise is false because it implies  it will provide full refunds when consumers are not fully satisfied with their orders, which is typically not the case when people receive late deliveries or unprofessional service.

Additionally, Instacart hid the refund option from the “self-service” menu that consumers use to report problems with their orders, making people believe they could only get a credit toward a future order rather than a refund, the FTC claimed.

Instacart also failed to clearly disclose terms relating to the Instacart+ membership enrollment process, the agency said. The sign-up process for the free trial of the subscription service did not disclose consumers would be charged once the trial ended, which allowed Instacart to charge people without their informed consent. These consumers will be receiving refunds as a result of the settlement, the FTC said.

“The FTC is focused on monitoring online delivery services to ensure that competitors are transparently competing on price and delivery terms,”  said Christopher Mufarrige, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a statement.

Instacart acknowledged the settlement in a blog post and denied “any allegations of wrongdoing.” The company also said it believes “the foundation of the FTC’s inquiry was fundamentally flawed.”

The settlement comes as Instacart is currently under fire over a recent study that revealed its AI-powered pricing tool is causing some customers to receive different prices for the same items at the same stores. Instacart responded to the controversy by stating that retailers determine their own prices, and any pricing tests conducted through its AI tool are random and not influenced by user data. Reuters reported on Wednesday the FTC has begun an investigation into the delivery platform’s AI pricing tool.

            <div id="article-text">App developers looking to launch their programs in ChatGPT can now submit them for review and potential publication, OpenAI said Wednesday. The company also introduced a new app directory within Chat’s tools menu that has swiftly been dubbed an “app store.”

In October, the company announced the arrival of apps in its chatbot, explaining that the move would bring a broader suite of capabilities to ChatGPT users. Major platforms—including Expedia, Spotify, Zillow, and Canva—announced integrations that would allow users to access their services directly from Chat conversations. Now, the company is opening up the field to a broader array of players.

“Apps extend ChatGPT conversations by bringing in new context and letting users take actions like order groceries, turn an outline into a slide deck, or search for an apartment,” the company said Wednesday.

OpenAI’s Apps SDK, which is still in beta, currently provides a toolkit for developers looking to create new experiences for ChatGPT users. Once developers are ready, they can submit their apps to the company’s OpenAI Developer platform, where they will be able to track its approval status, the company said. A number of approved apps will start launching within Chat in the coming year, it added.

This is a big step for OpenAI towards expanding the app ecosystem within Chat and, at the same time, giving users more reasons to use the app and stay on it.

            <div id="article-text">Pickle Robot, which builds autonomous unloading robots for warehouses and distribution centers, announced a new chief financial officer just days after a report of a major deal with UPS.

The Charlestown, Massachusetts-based company announced that it hired Jeff Evanson as its CFO on Thursday. Evanson had been consulting for the company since September and recently joined full time.

Evanson previously served as the vice president of global investor relations and strategy at Tesla from 2011 to 2017. In that role, he worked directly with Elon Musk and helped the company raise debt and equity financing to support the launch of multiple Tesla vehicle lines and company acquisitions.

Evanson will be Pickle’s first CFO and joins as the company — founded in 2018 with around $100 million in venture capital raised — reportedly expands its partnership with shipping giant UPS. According to Bloomberg, UPS is investing $120 million to purchase 400 of Pickle’s robots, with deployment beginning in late 2026 and early 2027.

Pickle declined to comment on this week’s UPS news. A Pickle spokesperson did confirm that UPS has been a Pickle customer for a few years but wouldn’t confirm when the partnership started.

On his 70th birthday, in 1905, Mark Twain gave a speech about the secret to successful aging. (If 70 doesn’t sound aged to you, bear in mind that because of high infant-mortality rates, the average life expectancy for someone born before 1850 was less than 40.) “I have achieved my 70 years in the usual way,” he declared, according to an account in The New York Times, “by sticking strictly to a scheme of life which would kill anybody else.” The maxim he offered was this: “We can’t reach old age by another man’s road.”

Typical for Twain, this was solid folk wisdom wrapped in a joke. The secret to a long and happy life is clearly not smoking, drinking, and carousing. But he’s correct that there is no plug-and-play formula that works for everyone. Within obvious parameters, each of us should experiment with different ideas and specific ways of living, a proposition I have previously discussed. Some people are at their healthiest on a vegetarian diet; others will be so by eating Mediterranean. Some are happiest living in a big metropolis such as New York City and Los Angeles; others are living their best life out in the country.

These details aside, however, a few general habits do matter. I won’t detain you with the health-and-wellness stuff that you might hear from your doctor: Lay off the smokes and go for a walk, for God’s sake. I want instead to call your attention to certain patterns of behavior that are not so obvious but that help explain why old people tend to be happier than young adults. The sooner you can learn and adopt these rules for good living, the sooner you can enjoy their fruits.

No question, you will come across some grouchy, unhappy old people, but on average in the United States, older adults score significantly higher in well-being than younger adults. Older people experience lower psychological distress and negative affect, and more frequent positive affect. I have also written before about how older folks tend to enjoy positive changes to their personality: agreeableness and conscientiousness rise as we age; neuroticism falls. What explains this pattern is not immediately apparent. Without a doubt, acquired wisdom plays a role: Older people have more life data and make fewer errors. But three particular patterns of behavior that old people display do matter a great deal.

Arthur C. Brooks: How to be happy growing older

The first involves social networks. Early in life, you were probably encouraged to develop a wide range of friendships with different kinds of people, for the sake of your happiness. This was good advice insofar as you learned new ways of thinking and living from people outside your typical social circles. But it doesn’t mean that you need to expend special effort maintaining links with lots of people with whom you have superficial ties. This would just fill your free time with unrewarding interactions. Yet precisely this sort of broad but thin acquaintance characterizes the networks of many young adults. Older people selectively narrow their social circles to focus on the individuals with whom they share common passions, experience positive emotions, and derive satisfaction. The casual associates who don’t make the cut are left behind.

This might sound selfish, but people actually become more altruistic as they age—the second pattern of behavior that raises older people’s happiness compared with that of young people. In a 2021 survey of research on self-reported altruism and observed charitable behavior, four psychologists found that 14 of the 16 studies they reviewed revealed that older adults are more focused on others than younger ones. In one especially ingenious demonstration of this finding, researchers asked adults of differing ages to clasp a handheld grip-strength device called a dynamometer and squeeze it with a high level of effort in order to obtain rewards for themselves or others. Younger adults gripped harder than older adults for self-rewards; older adults gripped harder than the younger adults to gain rewards for others.

The third pattern involves how older people react to difficult events in life. As a person ages, they usually get better at both avoiding and dealing with life stress. One 2023 longitudinal study involving nearly 3,000 adults ages 25 to 74 found that 70-year-olds felt stress on 40 percent fewer days than 25-year-olds did. Part of this is because the elders exposed themselves less to stressful events, but it is also because they were less reactive to stressful situations. Some of this is surely down to life circumstances: Retired 70-somethings no longer have demanding jobs. But another factor is that when old people encounter a stressful situation, they tend simply to shrug it off. Whether to respond to a challenging event might not seem voluntary, but in fact, it can be—and when the stress is unavoidable, the elderly simply react less by caring less.

As I was writing this essay, one experience came to mind that reinforced the points above, involving a two-day meeting that I’d attended in Rome some 25 years ago for a large international charity. The conference convened a small group of well-being specialists —some very junior (as I was at the time), some much older and more famous. Among the latter was a 60-year-old woman of global stature in the field. Feeling honored to be in her company, I paid close attention to her behavior. At the time, it seemed a bit strange; now it does not.

She had flown long haul through the night to attend the meeting, without compensation, and participated fully in every session. But when it came to the lavish dinner party held on the last night of the conference—which to me was a great perk—she walked into the bistro and declared, “This place is too loud” and left. This remarkable woman was exhibiting all three happiness patterns: She was spending time professionally with people who shared her passion for a cause, she was making a personal effort and donating her considerable expertise, and she was saying no to something that wasn’t worth the stress and sacrifice for her.

At 36, I was amazed that she’d pass on the party. Today, at 61, I follow her example: I will go to considerable personal effort to serve causes that I care about, and I will discuss matters of spiritual depth or scientific importance for hours on end. But small talk in a noisy bar? No chance.

So what follows are three general rules I learned from older people that lead to higher well-being.

1. Go deep or go home. I try to ensure that my social relationships—those that are voluntary and involve discretionary time—focus only on facets of life that matter: love, faith, philosophy, virtue, culture, aesthetics. I don’t want to talk about my beach vacation, or yours, unless a major epiphany occurred as the tide came in.

2. Serve more. A unique channel of well-being is serving others in causes I care about. This can mean giving money and time, of course. But it also entails regularly subjecting my work to a “values test”: Does each activity primarily edify and uplift others?

3. Care less. I think back to the things that kept me awake as a younger man—this conflict at work, that worry about money—and shake my head. Now when something is bothering me or threatens to stress me out, I ask myself whether the issue is likely to be bothering me in a week’s time. If the answer is no, I try to get a head start right then on not caring.

True to his craft as a satirist, Twain preferred to mock the whole business of elders dispensing counsel to youngsters, as he did in his 1882 essay “Advice to Youth”: “If a person offend you, and you are in doubt as to whether it was intentional or not, do not resort to extreme measures; simply watch your chance and hit him with a brick.”

I strongly suspect, however, that Twain followed better rules than this by the time he was 70. Closing his birthday remarks, the old riverboat pilot said that he had laid a course “toward the sinking sun with a contented heart”—no doubt by following the happy (if not quite so funny) principles above.</div>

            <h2>The Riot That Foretold an Unstable Future</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/2025/12/joe-sacco-once-future-riot-journalism-comics/685285/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The cartoonist and journalist Joe Sacco has made a career of rescuing history from the cleavages of memory. One set of scenes in his 2009 book, Footnotes in Gaza, exemplifies this, revealing how testimony about painful events can diverge among witnesses, even within a family. Sacco speaks with an elderly woman named Omm Nafez, illustrating her story: She says that her husband and two of his brothers were shot by Israeli soldiers while walking out of the family home; a third brother, Khamis, jumped over a courtyard wall and survived. When Sacco finds Khamis, however, his account doesn’t entirely match Nafez’s. He recalls that his brothers were lined up in the courtyard and shot, killed not in a surprise scuffle but by premeditated execution. Khamis remembers visiting one of these brothers on his deathbed, but Nafez and another source say that Khamis was not there. So Sacco depicts both variations, while drawing out their disjunctions through commentary and supplementary reporting. The reader experiences these memories, and then questions them, and then at last sees the author’s process as he labors to tell the most honest-possible version of the truth.

Key word: see. Sacco reported Footnotes in Gaza from Khan Younis and Rafah, two cities at the south end of the Gaza Strip, over multiple trips in the aughts, and ultimately told a larger story—which stretches over decades of displacement and violence—in comic-strip panels. In this format, he is a character too, his round glasses and rabbit teeth peeking out amid the clustered limbs and busy tableaus. He’s used this approach to investigate catastrophes around the world, reporting from Chechnya, India, Iraq, Canada’s Northwest Territories, and the International Criminal Court. His work combines on-the-ground reportage with historical reconstruction, often stitched together from a patchwork of oral recollections.

In all of his coverage, Sacco places you inside the moment, dynamically re-creating not only how it looks but also how it feels. Despite his intense and difficult subject matter, his style reflects the unruly world of the underground comics in which he came of age. In his early, memoiristic Yahoo series, he employed an outlandish vernacular, influenced by R. Crumb and Art Spiegelman. And today Sacco’s drawings are still loose, dynamic, even a bit cartoonish—but he always senses when caricature should end and the facts should take over.

His newest book makes such fact-finding a key theme, demonstrating the instability of a political system grounded in untruth—and investigating how populist leaders can wield that for their own ends. The Once and Future Riot concerns a series of escalating clashes in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. In late August and early September of 2013, violence between Hindu Jats and Muslim villagers culminated in a full-scale assault against a third group: the landless Muslim laborers who lived and worked in Jat villages. It is now widely agreed that 62 people were killed, two-thirds of them Muslim, and 50,000 people, again mostly Muslim, were driven from their villages. But when Sacco arrived, more than a year later, details about who was responsible for the violence and who was harmed proved strikingly hard to pin down. He encountered something more potent than facts: “the fiction, the myth,” as he puts it, a set of competing (and politically convenient) narratives that are already taking the place of the historical event.

Traveling around Uttar Pradesh with the help of a local journalist, Piyush Kumar, he finds, and illustrates, plenty of physical evidence: torched houses, refugee camps, scarred and displaced victims. Based on witnesses’ recollections, he draws massive crowd scenes in which hundreds or even thousands of people converge and clash. To keep the reader from losing their way, he tiles these full-page panels with smaller inserts, revealing visually who is providing what testimony. But these stories quickly begin to contradict one another—and Sacco’s presentation of his interviewees’ faces and names takes on a second layer of meaning, showing how a journalistic reconstruction is pieced together from disparate sources, sometimes overlapping and sometimes conflicting, which illustrates handily that the story he is constructing is not the only one on offer.

Official accounts—from village chiefs, social leaders, and a district magistrate—differ based on who’s speaking and where. In Muslim villages, Sacco’s interviewees tell him that only women and children threw stones; among the Jats, the party line is that no Muslim laborers were killed, and everyone left peacefully on their own. Each of these stories works to suppress contrary evidence; all are deployed in service of what Sacco calls the “One True Story:” each village’s authority-sanctioned, broadly accepted narrative of their own communal innocence and their enemy’s communal guilt. There are those, like the Muslim refugees, who speak for themselves. But they are already outcasts, with no power, and no influence over any version, big or small.

Sacco traces the origins of the riot back to the murder of a Muslim boy by two Jats, who were then killed by a crowd in the village of Kawal. But all of these interactions were quickly imbued with a set, predetermined meaning. For many of the Jats interviewed by Sacco, a Muslim boy could not simply court a Hindu girl; he must be trying to seduce and despoil her, an act the Jats call “Love Jihad.” After the Jats called a mass meeting, known as a panchayat, some local Muslims armed themselves, perhaps believing that the Jats were planning a massacre on the scale of the 2002 Gujarat riots, during which more than 1,000 people died.

A year later, the displaced Muslim laborers are still living in tents, trapped between their persecutors and government officials who, Sacco suggests, wish to compensate only a handful of the victims. But the story of this disaster won’t be swept quietly onto the ash heap of history, as the author has learned across the world: For those living in conflict zones, “events are continuous,” an interviewee in Footnotes says.

Sacco knows better than most that political chauvinists of all kinds can point to past moments of injury and humiliation to justify any current cruelty or authoritarian project—an especially powerful appeal when those historical injustices are real. His Gazan interlocutors were speaking in the midst of the Second Intifada, when past atrocities were referenced by militants and politicians alike to justify new violence against civilians. In his 2000 book about the breakup of Yugoslavia, Safe Area Goražde, the Bosnian Serbs massacring their neighbors in the 1990s defended their crimes by appealing to similar killings carried out against ethnic Serbs during the Nazi-era fascist regime. The Once and Future Riot sees it happening again: Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalists rode the Uttar Pradesh riots to electoral victory, invoking very real suffering to excuse bellicose ethnic supremacism and the persecution of Muslim minorities.

Safe Area is one of Sacco’s best works because he takes the time to characterize the residents of Goražde, making visible what both propaganda and the fog of war tend to obscure. The book is full of harrowing, enraging war stories, but the main subjects are the people of Goražde, the remaining Bosniaks whose survival presents a firm rebuttal to their besiegers. The Serb ethno-nationalists he quotes seemingly can conceive of living and belonging only in the abstract, atavistic language of ethnicity and blood. But Sacco’s subjects don’t need to ruthlessly assert their right to their home; they belong in Goražde because they are already there. They share a love of pop music, The Bodyguard, and Levi’s 501s; they care more about the mundane facts of their love lives, their education, and their families than ancient feuds or religious rivalries. By focusing on the persistence of private life during wartime, the book widens from an investigation into a kind of communal portrait, literally illustrating the way injustice contorts and is resisted by people, together and alone.

Riot is more narrowly focused than that sweeping work; Sacco is searching for a story, and he eventually finds it, sometimes at the cost of the subject’s human dimensions. We get many perspectives on what happened before and after the panchayat, but “rather than provide a region-wide sampler of the violence visited on the Muslim peasantry,” he focuses only on the village of Lisarh, where the reprisals were especially lethal. This allows him to map out a precise timeline of the entire riot, as well as to catalog the many denials and excuses offered by local officials and activists. But because of this focus, he spotlights the actions of particular Jats and blurs together the broader experience of the victims, until both perpetrators and casualties grow abstract. I left the book uncertain about some key facts: the scale of the riots, how many villages they affected, whether they looked different in rural versus urban areas. In past books, Sacco made a point of emphasizing this kind of epistemic uncertainty, but in Riot he occasionally glosses over it—perhaps because too much remains unknown.

This might be an unavoidable shortcoming, but it can undermine what is best in his method, as well as the higher ideas he’s using the book to pursue. Victims emerge and disappear, without much time given over to individuating them. He does not probe their life stories, as he did with Omm Nafez and Khamis back in Gaza; he must race off to the next source. Like figures in a massive spread, they lose their particularity, and they form again as a collective, a swirling mass where no face can stand out.

Then again, what the cartoonist loses in detail he gains in scope. The Once and Future Riot is a new sort of book for Sacco, more philosophical than humanistic, its eye trained on larger social and political structures. Here, he’s concerned less with the aftereffects of political violence and more with the future it might engender. Such mass assaults, he believes, might become a common feature of Indian democracy, where politics is dominated by Hindu nationalists intent on making a populous and diverse country into a two-tiered polity fighting abstracted enemies. And there are uncomfortable analogues across the world, conflicts driven by demagogues who don’t care about the fuzziness of the truth or the fallibility of memory—only about power, and about weaponizing any cleavage or crack they can find. “A democracy that arouses violence,” he suggests, “may one day be overwhelmed by it.” After a career spent reporting on ethnic chauvinism, criminal impunity, and history’s endlessly reopened wounds, he has stepped back to take in the long view. The outlook isn’t bright.

It&#39;s not just videos.  Trying to listen to music has been thrown into the same cesspool.  I was listening to a song last night and about a third of the way in the music stopped.  I saw there were an additional 6 - 8 scripts which needed run to have the music play, even after I already enabled 6- 8.

I closed out of the song and did something else.

If you have to enable over a dozen scripts to play a 4 minute song, you suck.

I agree, as long as it&#39;s labeled or satire and clearly not trying to be &quot;real&quot; then I don&#39;t have any problems with it and it could be pretty amusing.

The issue became that those automatic labels aren&#39;t always communicated to other services -- so you&#39;d end up with, for example and most aggravatingly, your newsreel on your mobile device passing you a link for a new trailer and discover only after clicking it that it wasn&#39;t the official trailer but an AI fake.

I had already had to ask my phone to stop showing me content from Screen Culture because of this problem. It is deliberately deceptive practices that Screen Culture was engaging in.

On Sunday, father-and-son gunmen armed with shotguns killed 15 people and injured 40 more at Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia. Their target was Chanukah by the Sea, an annual event run by the Chabad of Bondi. The dead include a Holocaust survivor, a rabbi, and a 10-year-old girl. It is the deadliest mass shooting to occur in Australia since the Port Arthur massacre in 1996, a tragedy that reshaped the nation and led to the creation of gun laws that have, until now, prevented such violence from being a regular occurrence.

It is hard to parse this violence as a person from a country where it is abnormal. It is impossible not to personalize the grief, shock, and confusion. I was scrolling Instagram Stories on a sleepy Sunday arvo when I saw a friend post “just heard what I think are gunshots at Bondi - what’s going on?” The events unfolded so rapidly and brutally that it has shocked Australia into a whiplash of the soul that we will be grappling with for years to come.

We are in shock. This does not happen here. And yet, it has. It is difficult to reconcile that reality with who we are and who we imagine ourselves to be as a nation.

In the worst ways possible, the early response to the attack has taken on contours that would be familiar to Americans. That’s partly because authorities have said the shooters were motivated by “Islamic State ideology,” and because Israel’s genocide in Gaza—and the Australian complicity in it, mostly at the hands of Americans—has been a roiling issue here.

In the immediate aftermath of this attack, Benjamin Netanyahu blamed the tragedy on Australia’s prime minister, Anthony Albanese of the Australian Labor Party, for recognizing an independent state of Palestine back in September. In his early career, Albanese was an ally of Palestine, co-founding the Parliamentary Friends of Palestine in 1999, but as prime minister he has tacitly supported Israel, Netanyahu, and the genocide in every material sense beyond a few empty gestures and hollow statements. This has divided Labor’s moderate base and beyond, and the government’s unwillingness to criticize Israel, let alone stop selling them arms, has been a major reason for the mass protests that have had hundreds of thousands of Australians marching through the streets of our major cities every weekend since Oct. 7, 2023.

Earlier this year, Albanese controversially appointed an “Antisemitism envoy” to appease Zionist interest groups. Jillian Segal, whose husband had donated to the Nazi-adjacent far-right group Advance Australia, used this position to put forth a highly censorious and constitutionally dubious list of proposed reforms framed as a “plan to combat antisemitism” that would all but outlaw criticism of Israel in Australia if adopted (which they weren’t, but likely will be in the wake of this weekend’s events). Segal has done little else in this perfunctory role other than push the narrative that the boom in antisemitism stems from the peaceful pro-Palestine movement—a falsehood she was quick to repeat in immediate response to the attacks. She has ignored the many neo-Nazi and white nationalist marches that have taken place in Australia this year, and many have concluded that she perceives more antisemitic hatred in a keffiyeh than a literal swastika.

Despite neither of the shooters being at all linked as of this writing with the pro-Palestine movement, Australia’s conservative politicians, its conservative media (which is most of it), and its right, far right, and alt right have all been quick to link the attack to the pro-Palestine crowd, particularly the campus protests, where some claim the shooter was “radicalized.” Which is odd, as the young shooter appears to be a brickie (Australian for bricklayer) who never attended university. In fact, the shooters have been found to have affiliations with the Islamic State, which is a known enemy of the Palestinian people, the pro-Palestine movement, Hamas, and Hezbollah.

Still, Australia’s right, like America’s, do not turn their nose up at an opportunity. They have had a rough time of it of late. Our conservative party, the Coalition (a combination of the Liberals and the Nationals), now headed by placeholder leader Sussan Ley, was annihilated in one of the most resounding electoral defeats in Australia’s history in May 2025. So disastrous is Ley, the Coalition’s polling, and the Coalition’s electoral prospects both on the state and federal level, that our major conservative party is essentially on the point of extinction.

Unable to find a weak spot in Albanese’s radically Zen centrism, the Coalition cynically exploited Sunday’s bloodbath almost immediately. Ley laid the blame at Albanese’s feet, and Josh Frydenberg, a major figure of the party’s hard right, demanded Albanese take “personal responsibility” for the attack. Former Prime Minister John Howard—imagine Ronald Reagan crossed with Dick Cheney crossed with Gollum, or imagine if Richard Nixon was your longest-serving president—emerged from his lair to point fingers at Albanese, his government, and Howard’s oldest, most loathed enemy, the amorphous “left.” (Howard looms over the Coalition like Darth Sidious, and as prime minister, he was the architect of Australia’s involvement in the illegal Iraq war.)

These are the mainstream of Australian conservatism and the Australian right. Behind them are a cavalcade of bloodthirsty grifters, knuckle-draggers, and hatemongers whose immediate response to the news was to lick their lips. They have been waiting for an event like this their entire lives. Pauline Hanson, founder and head of One Nation, a party that has been the fetishized mascot of white nationalism and paranoiac race hatred in Australia for 30 years, arrived with her newly anointed goon Barnaby Joyce to fire off a hateful screed before the freshly laid memorial flowers. She condemned the prime minister, Muslims, and antisemitism—somewhat of an irony, as she was recently the headline speaker at one of the many neo-Nazi marches that have recurred in Melbourne and Sydney this past year.

Other prominent bigots preferred the safety of the internet. “Western civilisation enjoyer” Drew Pavlou, a basement-dwelling influencer known best for taking a decade to complete an undergrad degree, immediately began livestreaming the shootings on his monetized YouTube channel. He took to X and began firing out dangerous misinformation, egging on racial violence with the rabid Islamophobia that has become his bread and butter. As people still lay dying, he falsely claimed that a preplanned Christmas firework event taking place in Sydney was in fact the city’s Muslim community taking to the streets in celebration. As I write, he is livestreaming himself at the public memorial, where his excitement at the prospect of inciting a race war is palpable.

I focus on Drew as a particularly grotesque case study of the breed of professional hate-peddlers that America is all too aware and fond of. The deluge of misinformation that promulgated in the immediate wake of the attacks was fueled by American social media platforms that have prioritized and monetized bigotry and psychosis. X, Meta, and YouTube were flooded with A.I. fakes, the most darkly comical of which was a reimagining of the great hero of the day, Ahmed al-Ahmed, the Syrian Muslim fruit-shop owner who bravely wrestled a gun from one of the shooters, as a white man with a comfortably white name.

Australian racism is not too dissimilar from America’s—indeed, it is largely informed by it these days—but of course it is different by the very nature of our unique histories and cultures. Like America, Australia’s Islamophobia has been violent, demented, and frothing since 9/11, and, like America, our domestic and foreign policies have unfairly targeted Muslims and the Muslim world—Iraq, Palestine, Indonesia, and beyond. Our media, much of which is owned by Rupert Murdoch and other billionaires who sometimes outpace even him in their hatreds, regularly runs extremely Islamophobic content, occasionally resulting in real violence (such as the notorious Cronulla riots, which occurred nearly 20 years ago to the day of the Bondi shootings). This reached its nightmarish apex in the 2019 Christchurch shootings, where an Australian white nationalist terrorist flew to New Zealand and murdered 51 people at a mosque. This took place in New Zealand, but it was very much an Australian shooting.

Hatred breeds hatred, and the surge of antisemitism, neo-Nazi groups like the NSN, and white nationalists like Pauline Hanson and Drew Pavlou, exists within, and is inflamed by, the malformed hatreds that are tragically intrinsic to the Australian identity. Antisemitic attacks were on the rise far before this month, raising alarm. I cannot sum up 250 years of Australian history in this article—it is hard enough to contextualize the last week—but it is important for you to do that most un-American of things and recognize that these events do not take place in a void, but rather within the specific context of a long and complicated history.

But the right’s narrative may not win out in the end, especially with the deeply unpopular and off-putting American right weighing in loudly and regularly on their behalf, laying the blame on Australia’s infamously strict gun laws. It might sound alien to even moderate Americans, but the immediate consensus here after the shooting has been that our gun laws are not strict enough—an observation many experts have been making for years as private gun ownership has bloomed exponentially, especially in the past decade. Both our prime minister and the premier of New South Wales, Chris Minns—who was an ally of the pro-gun Shooters, Fishers, and Farmers Party—have vowed gun law reform. How a person like the alleged shooter who the ASIO (our FBI) had been tracking for ties to the Islamic State associations as early as 2019 was able to acquire a gun license, let alone six shotguns, will no doubt be the subject of a lengthy parliamentary inquiry in the months to come.

In truth, if Sunday holds any lessons for Americans, it’s that Australia’s gun laws, though flawed, work. How many would have been killed if the terrorists were able to buy a couple of AR-15s from their local Coles? How many mass shootings would we have had since Port Arthur if John Howard (yes, the same man I described above) had not brought in such strict and transformative gun laws in the immediate aftermath? All I know is this is the first mass shooting on Australian soil since 1995. America has had 468 this year.

Still, American discourse, and American policy, regularly leads us about by the nose. We are The Kid to your Judge Holden, and we will ride with you to our doom. Our role as loyal foot soldiers in every American war since Korea, but especially in Iraq, and again with our support of Israel (which is largely to placate the United States), has a hand here. Our insidiously growing gun culture and broken discourse and outpourings of online-hatred blueprints imported from America have again brought the violence home to us. We of all people should know the boomerang swings back, but we got too dependent on you to truly acknowledge that. As I write, Australia’s mainstream journalists—many of whom rank among the dumbest on Earth—are riling up great dramas and screeds in a tone and style that is distinctly American, which is to say, worrying.

And yet, it is useful to see these people as a loud minority.

A contradiction I’m sure you understand is that Australia is a country of many hatreds, but also a country of great love. That love for one another is what we aspire toward as Australians; those who act on this love are the greatest Australians there are. Ahmed al-Ahmed, the Syrian refugee who confronted the shooter head-on, saving countless lives, is what we’d call the light on the hill—a kind of goodness and courage we, as Australians, must collectively strive for. Boris and Sofia Gurman, two Bondi locals who were killed in their attempts to stop one of the shooters, reflexively moved to save lives at the cost of their own. The community that has come forward to grieve and lay flowers, the swimmers who have insisted on keeping this beloved beach a place of mateship and joy, the imams and rabbis who hug and shake hands and hold each other in mourning, understanding, and support, the millions of “Are you OK?” “How are you feeling?” and “I’ll ride with you if you’re feeling unsafe” texts sent between friends, neighbors, and comrades, the record-breaking amount of blood donations given these past few days, and the rejection of violent hatred as abject, alien, and fundamentally un-Australian—this is what it has always meant, and will continue to mean, to be what we call “True Blue.” This is the Australia as it should and must be.

Last weekend brought an awful series of tragedies: a mass shooting at Brown University that left two promising young students dead; a mass shooting targeting Jews at a Hanukkah event in Australia that left 15 people dead; and the murder of Rob and Michele Reiner, allegedly by their troubled son.

But some American conservatives who weren’t directly affected by the violence have regardless found a way to frame themselves as the real victims amid all this tragedy—even if they have to invent facts to get there.

Donald Trump descended to new lows with his tweet about the Reiners’ deaths, writing:

A very sad thing happened last night in Hollywood. Rob Reiner, a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star, has passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS.

This was a bizarre take—police have arrested the Reiners’ son Nick, who has struggled for years with drug addiction and homelessness, and he has been charged with killing the couple—and while many conservatives did criticize the president, others, including Fox News columnist David Marcus, defended him for saying “what a lot of people are really thinking but won’t say.” (Were a lot of people actually thinking: Rob Reiner was probably murdered because of his anti-Trump views?)

College Republicans founder and chairman William Branson Donahue wrote that Ella Cook, one of the Brown murder victims, “was allegedly targeted for her conservative beliefs, hunted, and killed in cold blood.” Elon Musk reposted a now-deleted tweet blaming the left for Cook’s murder. Conspiracy theorist and Trump whisperer Laura Loomer tweeted, “Jewish and Christian conservative students and faculty targeted at Brown University and they want you to think western civilization isn’t under attack.” New York City Council member Vickie Paladino, who has also called to expel Muslims from Western nations, claimed that it is “very clear now that the attack at Brown was perpetrated by a leftist activist and targeted Republicans.” Republican Rep. Claudia Tenney of New York state tweeted about Cook’s killing, noting that “conservatives have been targeted again and again.” Other conservative influencers asserted that “the police explicitly claimed it was likely a targeted attack to [Cook’s] family and that when [the shooter] came in the room he looked specifically for her first before he fired”; they also stated, “Young men and women like Ella know they can be killed for their political beliefs on a college campus.”

Except the Brown shooter had not yet been apprehended, there was no word on his motive, and officials had not stated that Cook was singled out. He shot up not a College Republicans meeting but a voluntary economics study session. And he killed a second student, Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, and injured nine more. Despite wholly uncorroborated claims of “sources” and police statements, those spreading the rumor that Cook had been murdered for her politics have provided no actual evidence.

That didn’t stop Vice President J.D. Vance from highlighting Cook and Cook alone in his initial post about the Brown shooting, in which he also emphasized her political beliefs; it took him until the next day to recognize Umurzokov. He described Cook as “a beautiful young girl”; Umurzokov, he wrote, was “a brilliant young man.” (Cook was, in fact, a year ahead of Umurzokov.)

The claim that conservatives are the primary victims of political violence as opposed to the primary perpetrators of it has been invented and disseminated by powerful right-wing figures. And it is peak hypocrisy in about a dozen different directions. Conservatives have for years chastised liberals to not “politicize” gun deaths, only to use the shooting in Sydney to argue in favor of expelling Muslims from America. (Statistically, both guns and men are involved in many more shootings than Muslims are.)

After anti-cancel-culture hero Charlie Kirk was killed, conservatives not only claimed they were being systematically hunted down—they became the cancellation squad, demanded the firing of anyone who so much as quoted Kirk in a way that made him sound bad (something, it turns out, that isn’t hard to do). Even Vance joined the mob. Some 600 people, nearly all of them average Americans and not elected officials or people otherwise in power, were punished for their social media posts about Kirk. So far, there is no right-wing demand to penalize the president for his ugly comments about Reiner.

For decades, feminists have asserted that calling abortion providers baby killers and sharing their names, photos, and addresses was putting a target on their backs; conservatives disagreed, claiming that the many, many, many “pro-life” advocates who harassed women, set clinics on fire, stalked clinic staff, and shot doctors were simply hundreds upon hundreds of lone wolves. After Kirk was killed, conservatives began to argue that using terms like fascist or authoritarian was tantamount to inciting violence, and that Kirk’s death was not the result of one extremist making an evil choice but the fault of progressive groups and funders.

And for many years, as liberals have pointed out right-wing violence—including the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021—MAGA acolytes have mocked us, ignored us, or flat-out denied reality. Trump, after all, encouraged his followers to descend on Washington based on the lie that the election had been stolen from him, and it was that lie that fueled the Jan. 6 rioters’ rage. Trump then pardoned nearly all of them, including those who behaved violently—and several have gone on to commit other serious crimes. Now, without evidence, conservatives claim that they’re the real victims of political violence.

This right-wing victim mentality has been building for years. Trump twice careered into the White House on the fumes of largely white and largely male resentment, after telling his voters that, yes, they were oppressed and mistreated and stolen from and put upon, and their attackers were immigrants, liberals, feminists, the media, and the deep state. Now that he’s in office and grabbing unprecedented levels of power, his followers remain convinced of their own victimization, this time around by “leftists,” who they insist are attacking them and even threatening their lives. Left-wing violence is indeed a problem, as Kirk’s murder demonstrated—but in truth, right-wing violence remains significantly more common; 75 percent to 80 percent of people who have died at the hands of domestic terrorists in the U.S. since 2001 were killed by right-wing extremists.

Facts, as some conservatives like to say, don’t care about your feelings. But MAGA supporters are a deeply feeling bunch, and they definitely care about their feelings over the facts. Fear is a conservatizing force, and conservatives tend to be more fearful than liberals. I don’t doubt that conservatives genuinely fear violence being carried out against them, just as I don’t doubt that they genuinely fear immigrants the same way they genuinely fear new experiences. Studies have found that conservatives’ brains are more reactive to fear than liberals’ brains, which can cause them to overreact and let emotion override reality. The wealth of evidence demonstrating that it’s conservatives, not liberals, who are more prone to behaving violently for political ends can’t penetrate a strongly held belief based on a primordial panic.

Moving through life this way—fearful, angry, and convinced one is being perpetually victimized—is no doubt exhausting. It also explains the genius of Trump and his MAGA movement. While many Republicans before him espoused a kind of pull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps rugged individualism, the president did away with all of that, simply telling his followers that they had been wronged and identifying familiar groups upon whom to heap blame. And, of course, Trump had been wronged worst of all (is still, perpetually, being wronged). No president in American history has portrayed himself as nearly as much of a victim as Trump, a man who holds unimaginable power in his hands but yet is never at fault, a person who has had every advantage in life but still speaks of himself as the most persecuted man in history. His followers make blasphemous imagery of him as Jesus: a perfect, abused man who would give his very life for their sins (of which, naturally, Trump has none).

One can see the appeal of the conservative victim mentality. Victims are innocent: Their dream jobs aren’t materializing because of immigrants, not because they dropped out of college. It’s liberals calling people fascists that fuels violence, not the Republican-enabled lack of gun laws that make the U.S. a radical outlier on both gun safety and gun deaths. It can feel safer, for a while, to not take responsibility for one’s own life. And feeling embattled can convince a person that they’re courageous, their cause noble, and their efforts to vanquish their enemies virtuous—even if, in reality, they’re simply a frightened hypocrite, terrorizing others so that they might feel less afraid.

“Our initial investigation has identified that our most recent release introduced a backwards-incompatible database schema update,” the company wrote in its incident report. “As a result, previous release packages errantly referenced the updated fields, resulting in version mismatch errors and causing operations to fail or take an extended amount of time to complete.”

The update took down 10 of Snowflake’s 23 global regions. In the US, the outage hit chunks of Snowflake customers accessing its Azure data center in Virginia, and its AWS data center in Oregon. Globally, users of Snowflake’s data centers in Ireland, Zurich, London, Sweden, Mumbai, Singapore, and Mexico were hit.

The outage was first reported as an issue with Snowflake Data Cloud at 0255 UTC Tuesday when customer queries against their data returned SQL execution errors.

About an hour and a half later, Snowflake said that it had identified the problem and it was working on a fix. The systems were back up and running by about 0500 UTC.

“I dealt with this yesterday,” one user groused on Snowflake&#39;s Reddit page. “Took them way too long to role [sic] back this change”

The company said it would release its root cause analysis within five days of closing the incident, which should be Sunday.

“We have nothing additional to share at this time,” a spokesperson told The Register.

This was Snowflake’s second incident inside of a week after a Dec 10 database infrastructure issue caused degraded performance among users who employ its software out of the AWS datacenter in Oregon, according to its status page.

Snowflake is not the only data platform with issues this month.

Between Dec 11 and Dec 13, Snowflake’s archrival Databricks had a days-long service disruption where customers in several US regions experienced latency or errors when using Mosaic AI, the company’s assistant for building AI agents, which was contained to users of the company’s Azure data centers in seven US regions.

That came after customers in its US Gov West AWS region endured a “complete outage, with all Databrick services presumed unavailable” for about two hours on Dec 3.

Unlike Snowflake, which lists the preliminary cause of outages and follows up with a root cause analysts on its incident page, Databricks does not publish the cause of its outages.

Databricks did not respond to an email from The Register seeking comment. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Web browsers for desktop and mobile devices tend to receive regular security updates, but that often isn&#39;t the case for those that reside within game consoles, televisions, e-readers, cars, and other devices. These outdated, embedded browsers can leave you open to phishing and other security vulnerabilities.

Researchers affiliated with the DistriNet Research Unit of KU Leuven in Belgium have found that newly released devices may contain browsers that are several years out of date and include known security bugs.

In a research paper [PDF] presented at the USENIX Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS) 2025 in August, computer scientists Gertjan Franken, Pieter Claeys, Tom Van Goethem, and Lieven Desmet describe how they created a crowdsourced browser evaluation framework called CheckEngine to overcome the challenge of assessing products with closed-source software and firmware.

The framework functions by providing willing study participants with a unique URL that they&#39;re asked to enter into the integrated browser in the device being evaluated. During the testing period between February 2024 and February 2025, the boffins received 76 entries representing 53 unique products and 68 unique software versions.

In 24 of the 35 smart TVs and all 5 e-readers submitted for the study, the embedded browsers were at least three years behind current versions available to users of desktop computers. And the situation is similar even for newly released products.

&quot;Our study shows that integrated browsers are updated far less frequently than their standalone counterparts,&quot; the authors state in their paper. &quot;Alarmingly, many products already embed outdated browsers at the time of release; in fact, eight products in our sample included a browser that was over three years obsolete when it hit the market.&quot;

According to KU Leuven, the study revealed that some device makers don&#39;t provide security updates for the browser, even though they advertise free updates.

The researchers cited several case studies that assessed the exploitability of devices with outdated browsers. The Boox Note Air 3 e-ink tablet, released in January 2024, for example, ships with the NeoBrowser, which is based on Chromium 85, released in August 2020.

&quot;Notably, across four software updates, the integrated browser remained unpatched,&quot; the researchers said, adding that the company lacked a security reporting channel and that support staff misrepresented the resolution of the problem. As a result, the authors reported the matter to the EU regulatory authorities.

In December 2024, the EU Cyber Resilience Act came into force, initiating a transition period through December 2027, when vendors will be fully obligated to tend to the security of their products. The KU Leuven researchers say that many of the devices tested are not yet compliant.

The authors also looked at gaming applications that include an embedded browser: Steam, Ubisoft Connect, and AMD Adrenalin.

The Steam enrollments submitted through the CheckEngine framework included two browsers based on Chromium 109, from January 2023, and one that used Chromium 126, from June 2024. The researchers said that while they could not reproduce any of the three known vulnerabilities tested, they found that they could spoof the origin of alert boxes in the older versions.

&quot;Here, by exploiting an open redirect – previously discovered for a Steam domain – an attacker could craft a URL that triggers an alert box appearing to originate from a legitimate domain, which is useful for phishing attacks,&quot; the researchers said.

Ubisoft Connect&#39;s embedded browser, based on Chromium 109, also didn&#39;t yield to known vulnerabilities due to a limitation that did not allow the opening of new tabs or windows, but the authors did find the browser came configured with the --no-sandbox flag, which raised the risk of privilege escalation attacks.

With AMD Adrenalin, the KU Leuven researchers reproduced the address bar spoofing vulnerability in its Chromium 112-based browser from April 2023. AMD, they said, acknowledged the issue and was working on a fix at the time they initially presented their findings.

The authors put some of the blame on development frameworks like Electron that bundle browsers with other components.

&quot;We suspect that, for some products, this issue stems from the user-facing embedded browser being integrated with other UI components, making updates challenging – especially when bundled in frameworks like Electron, where updating the browser requires updating the entire framework,&quot; they said in their paper. &quot;This can break dependencies and increase development costs.&quot;

But in other cases, they suggest the issue arises from inattention on the part of vendors or a choice not to implement essential security measures.

While they suggest mechanisms like product labels may focus consumer and vendor attention on updating embedded browsers, they conclude that broad voluntary compliance is unlikely and that regulations should compel vendors to take responsibility for the security of the browsers they embed in their products. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Your AWS account could be quietly running someone else&#39;s cryptominer. Cryptocurrency thieves are using stolen Amazon account credentials to mine for coins at the expense of AWS customers, abusing their Elastic Container Service (ECS) and their Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) resources, in an ongoing operation that started on November 2.

The illicit cryptocurrency-mining campaign abuses compromised valid AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) credentials with &quot;admin-like privileges&quot; - it doesn&#39;t exploit a vulnerability - and then uses this access to deploy a SBRMiner-MULTI on ECS and EC2, Amazon security engineer Kyle Koeller said in a blog this week.

&quot;Within 10 minutes of the threat actor gaining initial access, crypto miners were operational,&quot; Koeller wrote.

Amazon&#39;s GuardDuty threat detection service spotted the cryptomining operation in a handful of customer accounts and alerted customers, we&#39;re told.

After the crooks obtained the compromised AWS credentials, they checked EC2 service quotas to see how many instances they could launch, and tested their credential permissions by calling the RunInstances API multiple times with the DryRun flag enabled. This allowed them to ensure the credentials had sufficient privileges to proceed with their illicit mining, while not yet incurring compute charges and risking detection.

They also created &quot;dozens&quot; of ECS clusters to enable their illegal activities, sometimes exceeding 50 in a single attack, and used auto scaling groups in EC2 to maximize service quotas and resource consumption.

To make disruption more difficult - and thus allow the criminals to collect more cryptocurrency from stolen resources - they used ModifyInstanceAttribute with disable API termination set to true for persistence. This blocks the termination of AWS instances used for mining, and forces victims to take an extra step and re-enable API termination before deleting the impacted resources.

&quot;The threat actor&#39;s scripted use of multiple compute services, in combination with emerging persistence techniques, represents an advancement in crypto mining persistence methodologies that security teams should be aware of,&quot; Koeller wrote.

After deploying miners, the miscreants created an AWS Lambda function configured with no authentication and exposed it via a public Lambda Function URL, allowing them to maintain persistent access to the victims’ environments.

To prevent becoming a victim of cryptomining abuse, Amazon recommends strong identity and access management controls, as well as temporary credentials instead of long-term access keys. As always, enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users, and apply least privilege to IAM. ®

            <div id="article-text">OpenAI is also updating ChatGPT’s guidelines on how to talk to teens.

OpenAI is also updating ChatGPT’s guidelines on how to talk to teens.

OpenAI and Anthropic are making tweaks to their chatbots that they say will make them safer for teens. As OpenAI has updated its guidelines on how ChatGPT should interact with users between the ages of 13 and 17, Anthropic is working on a new way to identify if someone might be underage.

On Thursday, OpenAI announced that ChatGPT’s Model Spec — the guidelines for how its chatbot should behave — will include four new principles for users under 18. Now, it aims to have ChatGPT “put teen safety first, even when it may conflict with other goals.” That means guiding teens toward safer options when other user interests, like “maximum intellectual freedom,” conflict with safety concerns.

It also says ChatGPT should “promote real-world support,” including by encouraging offline relationships, while laying out how ChatGPT should set clear expectations when interacting with younger users. The Model Spec says ChatGPT should “treat teens like teens” by offering “warmth and respect” instead of providing condescending answers or treating teens like adults.

The change comes as lawmakers turn up the pressure on AI companies and their chatbots over their potential impact on mental health. OpenAI is currently facing a lawsuit alleging that ChatGPT provided instructions for self-harm and suicide to a teen who took his own life. OpenAI later rolled out parental controls and said ChatGPT will no longer talk about suicide with teens. It’s part of a larger push for online regulation that also includes mandatory age verification for a number of services.

OpenAI says the update to ChatGPT’s Model Spec should result in “stronger guardrails, safer alternatives, and encouragement to seek trusted offline support when conversations move into higher-risk territory.” The company adds that ChatGPT will urge teens to contact emergency services or crisis resources if there are signs of “imminent risk.”

Along with this change, OpenAI says it’s in the “early stages” of launching an age prediction model that will attempt to estimate someone’s age. If it detects that someone may be under 18, OpenAI will automatically apply teen safeguards. It will also give adults the chance to verify their age if they were falsely flagged by the system.

Anthropic is rolling out similar measures, as it’s developing a new system capable of detecting “subtle conversational signs that a user might be underage” during conversations with its AI chatbot, Claude. The company will disable accounts if they’re confirmed to belong to users under 18, and already flags users who self-identify as a minor during chats.

Anthropic also outlines how it trains Claude to respond to prompts about suicide and self-harm, as well as its progress at reducing sycophancy, which can reaffirm harmful thinking. The company says its latest models “are the least sycophantic of any to date,” with Haiku 4.5 performing the best, as it corrected its sycophantic behavior 37 percent of the time.

“On face value, this evaluation shows there is significant room for improvement for all of our models,” Anthropic says. “We think the results reflect a trade-off between model warmth or friendliness on the one hand, and sycophancy on the other.”

The platform is capping the amount of hashtags you can add to a post.

If you’re tired of seeing Instagram posts with a seemingly endless list of hashtags, Instagram is making a change to stop that. In a post today, Instagram chief Adam Mosseri said that the platform will now cap hashtags to five per post.

“While I know it can be tempting to use more, a few specific tags actually perform better than a long list of generic ones,” Mosseri says on his “Instagram advice” channel. “Quality over quantity is key.” Mosseri notes that hashtags do help with search, but “don’t increase your reach” — instead, you should “focus on working out what kind of content resonates with your audience.”

Instagram has also worked to prevent Threads users from spamming tags (which are essentially hashtags) with their posts by limiting each post to just one tag. “The hope is this design focuses tags more on communities and less on engagement hacking,” Mosseri said at the time.

Folding phones come with great responsibilities and great rewards.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

A foldable phone isn’t for the faint of heart. They’re generally heavier, pricier, and have less capable cameras than a standard slab-style phone. They’re also still not as durable as regular smartphones, though they’re not nearly as fragile as they once were. In fact, thanks to Google, we finally have a foldable phone we can take with us to the beach.

There are basically two kinds of foldables at the moment — the kind that fold like books and the ones that fold clamshell style, like your old flip phone. Here’s how I think of it: a book-style foldable is like a phone plus a tablet, and a flip-style foldable is a phone plus a smartwatch. The book foldables provide an outer screen for all your regular phone needs, and then a tablet-like inner screen when you want, well, more screen. Flip phones come with a smaller secondary display on the outer panel that’s useful for checking information quickly. When you need to do regular phone stuff, you unfold it.

There’s no shortcut to properly testing a phone; I put my personal SIM card (physical or otherwise) in each phone I review and live with it for a minimum of one full week. I set up each phone from scratch, load it up with my apps, and go about living my life — stress testing the battery, using GPS navigation on my bike while streaming radio, taking rapid-fire portrait mode photos of my kid — everything I can throw at it. Starting over with a new phone every week either sounds like a dream or your personal hell, depending on how Into Phones you are. For me, switching has become so routine that it’s mostly painless.

The phones listed here have powerful processors and enough RAM to keep up for years, so it’s fair to expect more than a handful of OS updates throughout the life of your phone. Four years of new OS versions and five years of security updates is a healthy benchmark for this class, and many of the phones here meet or exceed that standard.

Most phone cameras can perform well in good lighting conditions, from the flagship class down to $300 budget phones. The devices listed here offer a little something extra, like a useful telephoto lens, a great portrait mode, or impressive low-light shooting — and many include all three. Stabilization for the main camera unit to help in low light is a must in this category.

Most modern foldables carry an IP48 rating, meaning they’re built to withstand full water immersion and solid particles 1mm or bigger. Devices with an IP48 rating aren’t fully protected from dust, which remains a concern when it comes to long-term durability. However, Google’s Pixel 10 Pro Fold carries an IP68 rating, making it the first foldable to offer full water and dust resistance.

In addition to the best devices at any price, I look for phones that offer the best mix of must-have features for good prices. That might lead to a recommendation of a lower-tier model if it’s particularly feature-rich for its price or last year’s model if it’s still sold new and this year’s device doesn’t offer many upgrades.

So while they all fit in one category of folding tech, they’re suited to two very different kinds of people — someone who wants even more phone with their phone and someone who wants to be fully immersed a little less. Whichever category you fit into, you’d be wise to get the manufacturer’s extended warranty with your purchase; fixes can be expensive, and you won’t be able to walk into just any phone repair shop to get them. If you don’t opt for the warranty, you’ll want to be sure you can comfortably afford to replace your phone in the event of a sudden sand-related catastrophe. Death can come swiftly to a folding screen.

If I haven’t scared you off by this point, then you’re probably the kind of person who will have a heck of a good time with a foldable. I’ve used every phone under the sun, and folding phones are some of my favorite gadgets. Run four apps at once! Prop it up like a tiny laptop! Hold it like a camcorder when you shoot video! There are tons of possibilities, and the thrill you get when you fold your phone shut never fully wears off.

Full dust resistance! On a foldable!Qi2 support with built-in magnets

Heavy and chunkyCameras aren’t as good as the other 10 Pro phones’Pricier than a regular phone

Screen: 8-inch, 2076p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 6.4-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED cover screen / Processor: Google Tensor G5 / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS; 10.8-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS; 10.5-megapixel ultrawide; 10-megapixel selfie (cover screen); 10-megapixel inner selfie camera / Battery: 5,015mAh / Charging: 30W wired, 15W wireless (Qi2) / Weather resistance: IP68

Durability has long been the North Star of the foldable category, and the Pixel 10 Pro Fold marks a real milestone in that journey. With an IP68 rating, it’s the first foldable to offer full water and dust resistance. That means you can take the $1,799 device on a hike or to the beach without worrying that a stray grain of sand will absolutely destroy it. Add in Qi2 support with built-in magnets for accessories and wireless charging — along with Google’s more powerful Tensor G5 chip — and you have the most well-rounded foldable available.

The Pixel 10 Pro Fold isn’t without its shortcomings, though. It offers all-day battery life with minimal use of the inner display; however, if you spend most of your time using the inner screen, your battery will likely be in the red by bedtime. Also, while we love the device’s improved durability, its cameras fall short of Google’s other 10 Pro models, especially in low light. The foldable is a bit heavier and thicker than the Galaxy Z Fold 7, too, which is a fair trade for greater peace of mind.

Samsung finally adopted the big cover screenAll-day batteryReliable camera

More susceptible to dust than your average phoneStill too hard to run full apps on the cover screen

Screen: 6.9-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 4.1-inch, 948p, OLED cover screen / Processor: Samsung Exynos 2500 / Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 main with OIS; 12-megapixel ultrawide; 10-megapixel selfie (inner screen) / Battery: 4,300mAh / Charging: 25W wired, 15W wireless, 4.5W reverse wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP48

The latest Galaxy Z Flip may not be as fun as the newest Razr Ultra, but it does offer a few new tricks. Samsung ditched the old file-folder cover screen in favor of a glorious, 4.1-inch edge-to-edge panel that wraps around the cameras. The extra real estate means you have more room to quickly respond to messages or perform any task that doesn’t require you to open your phone (and risk getting lost in a digital rabbit hole).

In addition to the larger cover screen, the Flip 7 offers a couple of other thoughtful updates. It’s thinner than its predecessor and features a bigger 4,300mAh battery, which is a step up from the 4,000mAh battery found in the last-gen Flip 6. The camera system remains unchanged from last year’s model, too, though that’s not necessarily a bad thing. The 50-megapixel main shooter still produces great images, and you get all the versatility the flip form factor has to offer, including the ability to easily take selfies using the rear camera.

Despite some welcome changes, the Flip 7 carries the same IP48 rating as last year’s model, which means long-term durability against fine dust particles remains a concern. However, Samsung offers a great warranty and repair program, along with seven years of OS and security updates. The Flip 7 isn’t perfect, but it’s the most powerful and polished version yet — just don’t drop it while lounging on the beach.

One of the best-looking phones you can buyGreat battery lifeOuter screen is useful in unexpected ways

AI button is wasted real estate Long-term durability is still a question markCamera processing is occasionally weird

Screen: 7-inch 1224p OLED 165Hz inner screen; 4-inch 1080p OLED 165Hz outer screen / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite / Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 main with OIS; 50-megapixel f/2.0 ultrawide; 50-megapixel f/2.0 selfie / Battery: 4,700mAh / Charging: 68W wired, 30W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP48

The Razr Ultra is the newest and most advanced member of Motorola’s foldable lineup. Compared to the Razr Plus, it boasts a higher-resolution inner screen, Qualcomm’s most powerful mobile processor, double the storage space, and an upgraded selfie camera. The device is also one of the best-looking phones you can buy — the gold-bronze chassis and wooden back panel lend the Ultra a real elegance. When every phone tends to look the same — even in the foldable market — the Razr Ultra stands out in a crowd, which only adds to its charm.

Beyond its appearance, the Ultra is just plain fun to use. The 4-inch outer screen covers almost the entire front of the phone, making it perfect for checking notifications, responding to messages, and taking quick actions such as hailing an Uber. The titanium hinge is also an upgrade over the stainless steel found in the Razr Plus. While the Ultra is enjoyable, it can’t overcome the gripes we’ve had with previous Motorola foldables, like inconsistent camera processing. Meanwhile, Motorola is only promising three OS upgrades and four years of security updates, which is on the shorter side considering the $1,300 retail price.

It’s really, really thinExcellent battery lifeThe crease is almost invisible

Foldables are still fragileIt’s not launching in the US or Europe

Screen: 8.12-inch, 2248p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 6.62-inch, 1140p, 120Hz OLED outer screen size/ Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.9 main with OIS, 50-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 8-megapixel ultrawide, 8-megapixel selfie cameras (inner and outer) / Battery: 5,600mAh / Charging: 80W wired, 50W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IPX8/IPX9

Let’s get the bad news out of the way first: if you live in the US or Europe, you can’t buy the Oppo Find N5. That rules out, well, a lot of us. But if you live in China, Singapore, or any of the other Asian countries Oppo included in its so-called “global” release, then you’re in luck: you can pick up one of the world’s thinnest book-style folding phones, and the rest of us are all very jealous of you.

The Find N5 isn’t all about thinness, either. Its Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset is highly capable, the phone is fully water-resistant, and battery life is excellent. It utilizes silicon-carbon battery technology to accommodate a large (by foldable standards) 5,600mAh battery, which easily holds up after a long day of heavy use. What’s even more impressive is that, like the aforementioned Z Fold 7, the Find N5 is still barely thicker than a standard slab-style phone and only slightly heavier. That matters when you’re using the phone via the cover screen for long periods of time or stashing it in the side pocket of your yoga pants. When a foldable is only about as heavy and bulky as a regular phone, using the inner screen feels like getting away with something fantastic — not a benefit you have to make many other sacrifices for. Oppo delivers this in spades, and I just wish more of us could… find it.

After months of teasing, Samsung has finally announced the Z TriFold, which the company is planning to launch during the first quarter of 2026 here in the US. The device takes the foldable concept a step further with not one, but two hinges, which open to reveal an inner screen that measures 10 inches diagonally. The outer display, meanwhile, is 6.5 inches and features a normal 21:9 aspect ratio, similar to what you’d find in a standard smartphone. The device also features a ceramic-glass, fiber-reinforced polymer back panel that’s designed to resist cracking, plus an IP48 rating, meaning it’s fully water-resistant but not dust-tight.

            <h2>China figured out how to sell EVs. Now it has to bury their batteries.</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/18/1130148/china-ev-battery-recycle/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In August 2025, Wang Lei decided it was finally time to say goodbye to his electric vehicle.

Wang, who is 39, had bought the car in 2016, when EVs still felt experimental in Beijing. It was a compact Chinese brand. The subsidies were good, and the salesman talked about “supporting domestic innovation.” At the time, only a few people around him were driving on batteries. He liked being early.

But now, the car’s range had started to shrink as the battery’s health declined. He could have replaced the battery, but the warranty had expired; the cost and trouble no longer felt worth it. He also wanted an upgrade, so selling became the obvious choice.

His vague plans turned into action after he started seeing ads on Douyin from local battery recyclers. He asked around at a few recycling places, and the highest offer came from a smaller shop on the outskirts of town. He added the contact on WeChat, and the next day someone drove over to pick up his car. He got paid 8,000 yuan. With the additional automobile scrappage subsidy offered by the Chinese government, Wang ultimately pocketed about 28,000 yuan.

Wang is part of a much larger trend. In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.

But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.

The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, building out formal recycling networks and take-back programs, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road.

Like the batteries in our phones and laptops, those in EVs today are mostly lithium-ion packs. Their capacity drops a little every year, making the car slower to charge, shorter in range, and more prone to safety issues. Three professionals who work in EV retail and battery recycling told MIT Technology Review that a battery is often considered to be ready to retire from a car after its capacity has degraded to under 80%. The research institution EVtank estimates that the year’s total volume of retired EV batteries in China will come in at 820,000 tons, with annual totals climbing toward 1 million tons by 2030.

In China, this growing pile of aging batteries is starting to test a recycling ecosystem that is still far from fully built out but is rapidly growing. By the end of November 2025, China had close to 180,000 enterprises involved in battery recycling, and more than 30,000 of them had been registered since January 2025. Over 60% of the firms were founded within the past three years. This does not even include the unregulated gray market of small workshops.

Typically, one of two things happens when an EV’s battery is retired. One is called cascade utilization, in which usable battery packs are tested and repurposed for slower applications like energy storage or low-speed vehicles. The other is full recycling: Cells are dismantled and processed to recover metals such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese, which are then reused to manufacture new batteries. Both these processes, if done properly, take significant upfront investment that is often not available to small players.

But smaller, illicit battery recycling centers can offer higher prices to consumers because they ignore costs that formal recyclers can’t avoid, like environmental protection, fire safety, wastewater treatment, compliance, and taxes, according to the three battery recycling professionals MIT Technology Review spoke to.

“They [workers] crack them open, rearrange the cells into new packs, and repackage them to sell,” says Gary Lin, a battery recycling worker who worked in several unlicensed shops from 2022 to 2024. Sometimes, the refurbished batteries are even sold as “new” to buyers, he says. When the batteries are too old or damaged, workers simply crush them and sell them by weight to rare-metal extractors. “It’s all done in a very brute-force way. The wastewater used to soak the batteries is often just dumped straight into the sewer,” he says.

This poorly managed battery waste can release toxic substances, contaminate water and soil, and create risks of fire and explosion. That is why the Chinese government has been trying to steer batteries into certified facilities. Since 2018, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has issued five “white lists” of approved power-battery recyclers, now totaling 156 companies. Despite this, formal recycling rates remain low compared with the rapidly growing volume of waste batteries.

China is not only the world’s largest EV market; it has also become the main global manufacturing hub for EVs and the batteries that power them. In 2024, the country accounted for more than 70% of global electric-car production and more than half of global EV sales, and firms like CATL and BYD together control close to half of global EV battery output, according to a report by the International Energy Agency. These companies are stepping in to offer solutions to customers wishing to offload their old batteries. Through their dealers and 4S stores, many carmakers now offer take-back schemes or opportunities to trade in old batteries for discount when owners scrap a vehicle or buy a new one.

BYD runs its own recycling operations that process thousands of end-of-life packs a year and has launched dedicated programs with specialist recyclers to recover materials from its batteries. Geely has built a “circular manufacturing” system that combines disassembly of scrapped vehicles, cascade use of power batteries, and high recovery rates for metals and other materials.

CATL, China’s biggest EV maker, has created one of the industry’s most developed recycling systems through its subsidiary Brunp, with more than 240 collection depots, an annual disposal capacity of about 270,000 tons of waste batteries, and metal recovery rates above 99% for nickel, cobalt, and manganese.

“No one is better equipped to handle these batteries than the companies that make them,” says Alex Li, a battery engineer based in Shanghai. That’s because they already understand the chemistry, the supply chain, and the uses the recovered materials can be put to next. Carmakers and battery makers “need to create a closed loop eventually,” he says.

But not every consumer can receive that support from the maker of their EV, because many of those manufacturers have ceased to exist. In the past five years, over 400 smaller EV brands and startups have gone bankrupt as the price war made it hard to stay afloat, leaving only 100 active brands today.

Analysts expect many more used batteries to hit the market in the coming years, as the first big wave of EVs bought under generous subsidies reach retirement age. Li says, “China is going to need to move much faster toward a comprehensive end-of-life system for EV batteries—one that can trace, reuse and recycle them at scale, instead of leaving so many to disappear into the gray market.”

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you’ll see it’s a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

            <div id="article-text">This is today&#39;s edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what&#39;s going on in the world of technology.

Welcome to our annual list of the worst, least successful, and simply dumbest technologies of the year.We like to think there’s a lesson in every technological misadventure. But when technology becomes dependent on power, sometimes the takeaway is simpler: it would have been better to stay away.Regrets—2025 had a few. Here are some of the more notable ones.—Antonio Regalado

Each time you’ve heard a borderline outlandish idea of what AI will be capable of, it often turns out that Sam Altman was, if not the first to articulate it, at least the most persuasive and influential voice behind it.For more than a decade he has been known in Silicon Valley as a world-class fundraiser and persuader. Throughout, Altman’s words have set the agenda. What he says about AI is rarely provable when he says it, but it persuades us of one thing: This road we’re on with AI can go somewhere either great or terrifying, and OpenAI will need epic sums to steer it toward the right destination. In this sense, he is the ultimate hype man.To understand how his voice has shaped our understanding of what AI can do, we read almost everything he’s ever said about the technology. His own words trace how we arrived here. Read the full story.—James O’Donnell

This story is part of our new Hype Correction package, a collection of stories designed to help you reset your expectations about what AI makes possible—and what it doesn’t. Check out the rest of the package here.

Can AI really help us discover new materials?

One of my favorite stories in the Hype Correction package comes from my colleague David Rotman, who took a hard look at AI for materials research. AI could transform the process of discovering new materials—innovation that could be especially useful in the world of climate tech, which needs new batteries, semiconductors, magnets, and more.But the field still needs to prove it can make materials that are actually novel and useful. Can AI really supercharge materials research? And what would that look like? Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard.

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you.  We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.

            <div id="article-text">Tekpon has acquired 100% of the TNW media and events brands, which cover and convene the European technology ecosystem, from the FT.

The transaction is Tekpon’s largest investment in media and events so far. It broadens the company’s reach across SaaS and AI and strengthens its role in the global innovation landscape.

TNW’s brand and editorial standards will be maintained, while its events and digital platforms will be integrated into Tekpon’s wider strategy.

The FT will continue to own and operate TNW Spaces, Amsterdam’s dynamic tech hub, offering private offices and coworking spaces that support a thriving community of startups, scale-ups, and innovators.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Alexandru Stan, Founder and CEO of Tekpon, said:

TNW is one of Europe’s most respected technology brands. Its legacy, its community, and its influence have shaped the European tech scene for nearly twenty years. This acquisition accelerates our mission to connect the global SaaS and AI ecosystem and supports Europe’s position in the next decade of innovation.

Tekpon will begin working on TNW branded initiatives immediately. Plans for 2026 include an expanded TNW Conference, new SaaS and AI program tracks curated by Tekpon, cross-regional executive programmes, and specialised gatherings for founders, executives, and investors.

The acquisition is part of Tekpon’s long-term plan to build an international ecosystem connecting software, media, events, advisory, and innovation.
