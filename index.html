            <h2>Cloudflare defies Italy’s Piracy Shield, won’t block websites on 1.1.1.1 DNS</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/cloudflare-may-pull-servers-out-of-italy-over-order-that-it-block-pirate-sites/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Italy fined Cloudflare 14.2 million euros for refusing to block access to pirate sites on its 1.1.1.1 DNS service, the country’s communications regulatory agency, AGCOM, announced yesterday. Cloudflare said it will fight the penalty and threatened to remove all of its servers from Italian cities.

AGCOM issued the fine under Italy’s controversial Piracy Shield law, saying that Cloudflare was required to disable DNS resolution of domain names and routing of traffic to IP addresses reported by copyright holders. The law provides for fines up to 2 percent of a company’s annual turnover, and the agency said it applied a fine equal to 1 percent.

The fine relates to a blocking order issued to Cloudflare in February 2025. Cloudflare argued that installing a filter applying to the roughly 200 billion daily requests to its DNS system would significantly increase latency and negatively affect DNS resolution for sites that aren’t subject to the dispute over piracy.

AGCOM rejected Cloudflare’s arguments. The agency said the required blocking would impose no risk on legitimate websites because the targeted IP addresses were all uniquely intended for copyright infringement.

In a September 2025 report on Piracy Shield, researchers said they found “hundreds of legitimate websites unknowingly affected by blocking, unknown operators experiencing service disruption, and illegal streamers continuing to evade enforcement by exploiting the abundance of address space online, leaving behind unusable and polluted address ranges.” This is “a conservative lower-bound estimate,” the report said.

The Piracy Shield law was adopted in 2024. “To effectively tackle live sports piracy, its broad blocking powers aim to block piracy-related domain names and IP addresses within 30 minutes,” TorrentFreak wrote in an article today about the Cloudflare fine.

Cloudflare co-founder and CEO Matthew Prince wrote today that Cloudflare already “had multiple legal challenges pending against the underlying scheme” and will “fight the unjust fine.”

“Yesterday a quasi-judicial body in Italy fined Cloudflare $17 million for failing to go along with their scheme to censor the Internet,” Prince wrote. He continued:

The scheme, which even the EU has called concerning, required us within a mere 30 minutes of notification to fully censor from the Internet any sites a shadowy cabal of European media elites deemed against their interests. No judicial oversight. No due process. No appeal. No transparency. It required us to not just remove customers, but also censor our 1.1.1.1 DNS resolver meaning it risked blacking out any site on the Internet. And it required us not just to censor the content in Italy but globally. In other words, Italy insists a shadowy, European media cabal should be able to dictate what is and is not allowed online.

Prince said he will discuss the matter with US government officials next week and that Cloudflare is “happy to discuss this with Italian government officials who, so far, have been unwilling to engage beyond issuing fines.” In addition to challenging the fine, Prince said Cloudflare is “considering the following actions: 1) discontinuing the millions of dollars in pro bono cyber security services we are providing the upcoming Milano-Cortina Olympics; 2) discontinuing Cloudflare’s Free cyber security services for any Italy-based users; 3) removing all servers from Italian cities; and 4) terminating all plans to build an Italian Cloudflare office or make any investments in the country.”

“Play stupid games, win stupid prizes,” Prince wrote.

AGCOM said today that in the past two years, the Piracy Shield law disabled over 65,000 domain names and about 14,000 IP addresses. Italian authorities also previously ordered Google to block pirate sites at the DNS level.

The Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA), a trade group that represents tech companies including Cloudflare and Google, has criticized the Piracy Shield law. “Italian authorities have included virtual private networks (VPN) and public DNS resolvers in the Piracy Shield, which are services fundamental to the protection of free expression and not appropriate tools for blocking,” the CCIA said in a January 2025 letter to European Commission officials.

The CCIA added that “the Piracy Shield raises a significant number of concerns which can inadvertently affect legitimate online services, primarily due to the potential for overblocking.” The letter said that in October 2024, “Google Drive was mistakenly blocked by the Piracy Shield system, causing a three-hour blackout for all Italian users, while 13.5 percent of users were still blocked at the IP level, and 3 percent were blocked at the DNS level after 12 hours.”

The Italian system “aims to automate the blocking process by allowing rights holders to submit IP addresses directly through the platform, following which ISPs have to implement a block,” the CCIA said. “Verification procedures between submission and blocking are not clear, and indeed seem to be lacking. Additionally, there is a total lack of redress mechanisms for affected parties, in case a wrong domain or IP address is submitted and blocked.”

The 30-minute blocking window “leaves extremely limited time for careful verification by ISPs that the submitted destination is indeed being used for piracy purposes,” the CCIA said. The trade group also questioned the piracy-reporting system’s ties to the organization that runs Italy’s top football league.

“Additionally, the fact that the Piracy Shield platform was developed for AGCOM by a company affiliated with Lega Serie A, which is one of the very few entities authorized to report, raises serious questions about the potential conflict of interest exacerbating the lack of transparency issue,” the letter said.

A trade group for Italian ISPs has argued that the law requires “filtering and tasks that collide with individual freedoms” and is contrary to European legislation that classifies broadband network services as mere conduits that are exempt from liability.

“On the contrary, in Italy criminal liability has been expressly established for ISPs,” Dalia Coffetti, head of regulatory and EU affairs at the Association of Italian Internet Providers, wrote in April 2025. Coffetti argued, “There are better tools to fight piracy, including criminal Law, cooperation between States, and digital solutions that downgrade the quality of the signal broadcast via illegal streaming websites or IPtv. European ISPs are ready to play their part in the battle against piracy, but the solution certainly does not lie in filtering and blocking IP addresses.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Collecting fallen (or “shed”) elk antlers is a popular pastime in elk-heavy places like Montana, but it’s usually a pretty low-tech, on-the-ground affair. That’s why last year’s story about a US Black Hawk helicopter descending from the skies to harvest shed elk antlers on a ranch was such an odd one.

Was it really possible that US military personnel were using multimillion-dollar government aircraft to land on private property in the Crazy Mountains—yes, that’s their actual name—just to grab some antlers valued at a few hundred bucks?

In May 2025, Montana rancher Linda McMullen received a call from a neighbor. “He said, ‘Linda, there’s a green Army helicopter landed on your place, picking up elk antlers,’” McMullen told The New York Times last year. “I said, ‘Are you joking?’ He said, ‘I’m looking at them with binoculars.’”

The local sheriff, who said he was “still trying to figure all this out” at the time, added that this was “the first helicopter I’ve heard of” regarding shed antler collection.

The Adjutant General for the Montana National Guard, J. Peter Hronek, quickly issued a statement on Facebook “regarding unauthorized use of military aircraft.”

In it, Hronek said that he was “aware of an alleged incident involving a Montana Army National Guard helicopter landing on private property without authorization” and that “an internal investigation is underway, and appropriate adverse and/or administrative action will take place if the allegations are determined to be true.” The Black Hawk was apparently on a training flight at the time.

The three servicemen on the chopper were eventually charged in Sweet Grass County Court with trespassing. They all pleaded not guilty. This week, pilot Deni Draper changed his plea to “no contest,” allowing sentencing to go forward without a trial (but without actually admitting guilt).

According to local reporting, prosecutors had evidence that “no trespassing signs were posted on McMullen’s property” and that “Draper admitted to Montana game warden Austin Kassner that he piloted the helicopter and decided to land it.” In addition to the neighbor’s testimony, “helicopter tire indentations and exhaust marks in the grass” were present at the site of the alleged landing.

The judge has accepted the change of plea and hit Draper with a $500 fine—the maximum penalty. So long as Draper stays out of trouble for the next six months, he will avoid further fines and jail time.

As for the antlers themselves, they are currently held by Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks but could go back to McMullen once cases against the other two servicemembers are resolved.

Update: According to a report this week in the Livingston Enterprise, this is not the first time Montana National Guard aircraft have stopped to take antlers.

“By way of a thorough inquiry, we can confirm isolated incidents of collecting antlers (with a military aircraft) have occurred previously,” Lt. Col. Thomas Figarelle of the Montana National Guard told the paper.

Figarelle added that the Guard has now explicitly banned this kind of activity. “(The Montana Army National Guard) issued clear directives no antler collecting of any type is authorized,” he added. “This is misuse of government property inconsistent with our standards. We are not going to tolerate it.”</div>

            <h2>Is Orion’s heat shield really safe? New NASA chief conducts final review on eve of flight.</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/nasa-chief-reviews-orion-heat-shield-expresses-full-confidence-in-it-for-artemis-ii/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">WASHINGTON, DC—This week, NASA’s new administrator, Jared Isaacman, said he has “full confidence” in the space agency’s plans to use the existing heat shield to protect the Orion spacecraft during its upcoming lunar mission.

Isaacman made the determination after briefings with senior leaders at the agency and a half-day review of NASA’s findings with outside experts.

“We have full confidence in the Orion spacecraft and its heat shield, grounded in rigorous analysis and the work of exceptional engineers who followed the data throughout the process,” Isaacman said Thursday.

Isaacman has previously indicated that reviewing the heat shield issue early in his tenure, especially with the Artemis II mission due to launch in as few as four weeks, was a top priority. He met with senior agency officials about the matter within hours of being sworn in on December 18.

The private astronaut and billionaire entrepreneur has also said there should be more public transparency at NASA.

Following the Artemis I mission in November 2022, NASA was roundly criticized for its opaque handling of damage to Orion’s heat shield. The seriousness of the problem was not disclosed for nearly a year and a half after the Artemis I mission, when NASA’s Inspector General finally published close-up images of char loss—chunks of ablative material at Orion’s base that were intended to protect the spacecraft during its return but had fallen away.

To address these concerns, NASA tapped an “independent review team” in April 2024 to assess the agency’s investigation of the heat shield. This group’s findings were finalized in December 2024, at which time NASA formally decided to fly the Artemis II mission with the existing heat shield. Although NASA held a news conference to discuss its conclusions, a publicly released copy of the independent review team’s report was heavily redacted, creating further doubt about the integrity of the process. Some notable critics assailed NASA’s decision to fly on the heat shield as is and decried the ongoing lack of transparency.

That is more or less where the matter stood until a few days before Christmas, when Isaacman officially became NASA administrator.

After taking the job in Washington, DC, Isaacman asked the engineers who investigated the heat shield issue for NASA, as well as the chair of the independent review team and senior human spaceflight officials, to meet with a handful of outside experts. These included former NASA astronauts Charles Camarda and Danny Olivas, both of whom have expertise in heat shields and had expressed concerns about the agency’s decision-making.

For the sake of transparency, Isaacman also invited two reporters to sit in on the meeting, me and Micah Maidenberg of The Wall Street Journal. We were allowed to report on the discussions without directly quoting participants for the sake of a full and open discussion.

Convened in a ninth-floor conference room at NASA Headquarters known as the Program Review Center, the meeting lasted for more than three hours. Isaacman attended much of it, though he stepped out from time to time to handle an ongoing crisis involving an unwell astronaut on orbit. He was flanked by the agency’s associate administrator, Amit Kshatriya; the agency’s chief of staff, Jackie Jester; and Lori Glaze, the acting associate administrator for NASA’s Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate. The heat shield experts joined virtually from Houston, along with Orion Program Manager Howard Hu.

Isaacman made it clear at the outset that, after reviewing the data and discussing the matter with NASA engineers, he accepted the agency’s decision to fly Artemis II as planned. The team had his full confidence, and he hoped that by making the same experts available to Camarda and Olivas, it would ease some of their concerns.

What followed was a spirited discussion, with Camarda sparring regularly with the presenters and Olivas asking questions more infrequently. The engineering team in Houston, led by Luis Saucedo, went through dozens of charts and presented reams of data that had not been made public before.

“That level of openness and transparency is exactly what should be expected of NASA,” Isaacman said after the meeting.

Perhaps the most striking revelation was what the NASA engineers called “what if we’re wrong” testing.

At the base of Orion, there are 186 blocks of a material called Avcoat, individually attached to provide a protective layer that allows the spacecraft to survive the heating of atmospheric reentry. Returning from the Moon, Orion encounters temperatures of up to 5,000° Fahrenheit (2,760° Celsius). A char layer that builds up on the outer skin of the Avcoat material is supposed to ablate, or erode, in a predictable manner during reentry. Instead, during Artemis I, fragments fell off the heat shield and left cavities in the Avcoat material.

Work by Saucedo and others—including substantial testing in ground facilities, wind tunnels, and high-temperature arc jet chambers—allowed engineers to find the cause of gases becoming trapped in the heat shield, leading to cracking. This was due to the Avcoat material being “impermeable,” essentially meaning it could not breathe.

After considering several options, including swapping the heat shield out for a newer one with more permeable Avcoat, NASA decided instead to change Orion’s reentry profile. For Artemis II, it would return through Earth’s atmosphere at a steeper angle, spending fewer minutes in the environment where this outgassing occurred during Artemis I. Much of Thursday’s meeting involved details about how the agency reached this conclusion and why the engineers deemed the approach safe.

However, toward the end of the meeting, the NASA team agreed to discuss something that “no one really liked to talk about.” This was an analysis of what would happen to Orion if large sections of the heat shield failed completely during Artemis II. Formally, this is known as a “damage tolerance evaluation,” the engineers said. Informally, it’s known as “What if we’re wrong.”

The Avcoat blocks, which are about 1.5 inches thick, are laminated onto a thick composite base of the Orion spacecraft. Inside this is a titanium framework that carries the load of the vehicle. The NASA engineers wanted to understand what would happen if large chunks of the heat shield were stripped away entirely from the composite base of Orion. So they subjected this base material to high energies for periods of 10 seconds up to 10 minutes, which is longer than the period of heating Artemis II will experience during reentry.

What they found is that, in the event of such a failure, the structure of Orion would remain solid, the crew would be safe within, and the vehicle could still land in a water-tight manner in the Pacific Ocean.

“We have the data to say, on our worst day, we’re able to deal with that if we got to that point,” one of the NASA engineers said.

The composite layer beneath the heat shield is intended to withstand a maximum temperature of 500° F during reentry. During Artemis I, the maximum temperature recorded, despite the persistent cracking and char loss, was 160°. So any crew on board would have been safe. Even so, the heat shield damage was a serious concern because the agency’s modeling did not predict it.

After more than two years of testing and analysis of the char loss issue, the NASA engineers are convinced that, by increasing the angle of Orion’s descent during Artemis II, they can minimize damage to the heat shield. During Artemis I, as the vehicle descended from about 400,000 to 100,000 feet, it was under a “heat load” of various levels for 14 minutes. With Artemis II, this time will be reduced to eight minutes.

Orion’s entry profile will be similar for the first two and a half minutes, but afterward, the Artemis II entry will undertake a bit of a higher heat load than Artemis I for a couple of minutes. All of the agency’s modeling and extensive arc jet testing indicate this will produce significantly less cracking in the Avcoat material.

Much of the discussion Thursday delved into the technical minutiae of heat shields, tamp planes (the process of packing Avcoat into blocks), early char loss, spallation, and more. The discourse also revealed that one test in 2019, three years before Artemis I, indicated hints of the char loss later observed in flight. But this finding was not unequivocal, nor did it throw up a huge red flag at the time, the NASA officials said.

The message from Isaacman, Kshatriya, and other NASA officials at the meeting was clear. This heat shield was not perfect. If NASA knew several years ago what it knows now, the heat shield would be designed differently. It would be permeable to prevent the outgassing problems. Those changes are being incorporated into the Artemis III mission’s heat shield. There will be other tweaks to increase reliability.

Nevertheless, the agency is confident that flying the Artemis II heat shield on the revised profile is perfectly safe. In NASA jargon, such a rigorous justification that a space mission is safe to fly is known as flight rationale.

But why get to flight rationale at all? About 18 months ago, as the agency was narrowing in on the root cause of the heat shield issues, NASA’s leaders at the time, including Kshatriya, considered their options. They mulled the possibility of flying Artemis II in low-Earth orbit to test its life support equipment but not overly stress the heat shield. They thought about flying a second robotic mission around the Moon.

Perhaps most seriously, they considered moving forward with the Orion spacecraft (or at least its heat shield) that will be flown in Artemis III, which has permeable Avcoat, to be used for this mission. I asked Kshatriya on Thursday why they had not simply done this.

“We had considered ‘let’s just pull forward CSM 3 (the Artemis III spacecraft),’” he said, in part. “and essentially turn CSM 2 (Artemis II) either into a test article or something else. Again, CSM 3 has unique capabilities, docking systems on it, right? We didn’t have a docking mode for that mission (Artemis II). CSM 2 could not be retrofitted with the docking system because of the uniqueness of the tunnel. Really, CSM 2 is kind of uniquely a free return vehicle because of the way it was designed initially. So the mods that would have had to be made for (Artemis) II and III to do that swap would have been too odious, and we wouldn’t have gotten the learnings. And, you know, we’re trying to get up hill as quickly as we can.”

Given all of this, how should we feel about this flight rationale, with Artemis II potentially launching in early February?

Over the last 18 months, I have had many discussions with experts about this, from mid-level engineers and current and former astronauts to senior leaders. I know definitively that the four Artemis II astronauts, Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch, and Jeremy Hansen, are comfortable with the decision. They did not feel that way at the beginning of the process. Wiseman, in particular, was quite skeptical. But they’ve been won over. Like almost everyone else who has reviewed NASA’s data at length, they accept the plan. Indeed, they are ready and eager to fly.

But what of the outside critics? That was the whole point of Thursday’s session. Could the NASA engineers convince Olivas and Camarda?

Olivas flew two Space Shuttle missions in 2007 and 2009 and has an advanced degree in materials science from Rice University. Before this week’s meeting, he had not gone public with his heat shield concerns. But he has been talking to me and another space reporter, Robert Pearlman, for about a month now.

Olivas is very credible on these issues. He was asked by the NASA leadership in late 2023, before the independent review team was formally named, to provide a second set of eyes on the space agency’s heat shield work. He saw all of the investigative data in real time. Although not formally a member, he sat in on the review team’s meetings through 2024 before that process ended. Afterward, he had some lingering questions he felt were unresolved by that process. A few weeks ago, he told Pearlman and me he would be reluctant to fly on Orion. It was a stunning admission.

Isaacman appeared to take these concerns seriously. In advance of Thursday’s meeting, he engaged with Olivas to hear him out and share information about what NASA’s engineers had done over the last 18 months to resolve some of the independent review team’s questions. These included char loss very early in Orion’s reentry.

After Thursday’s meeting, Olivas told me he had changed his mind, expressing appreciation and admiration for the in-depth engineering work done by the NASA team. He would now fly on Orion.

Camarda, another former shuttle astronaut, was less effusive. He has been very public with his criticism of NASA’s handling of the Orion heat shield. He told me in December 2024 that the space agency and its leadership team should be “ashamed.” Unlike Olivas, however, he has been on the outside the whole time. NASA had kept Camarda, 73, at arm’s length, and he felt disrespected. Given his credentials—the aerospace engineer spent two decades working on thermal protection for the space shuttle and hypersonic vehicles–Camarda could be a potent voice of skepticism leading up to the Artemis II launch.

After the meeting, I asked Camarda whether he felt any better about flying crew on the Artemis II heat shield.

“I would never be happy accepting a workaround and flying something that I know is the worst version of that heat shield we could possibly fly and hoping that the workaround is going to fix it,” Camarda said. “What I really hope he [Isaacman] gets is that if we don’t get back to doing research at NASA, we’re not going to be able to help Starship solve their problems. We’ve got to get back to doing research.”

But Camarda was no longer the firebrand he was at the outset of the meeting. Near its end, in fact, he even thanked the leadership team for being brought in, read in on the data, and allowed to have his say.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/these-60000-year-old-poison-arrows-are-oldest-yet-found/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Poisoned arrows or darts have long been used by cultures all over the world for hunting or warfare. For example, there are recipes for poisoning projective weapons, and deploying them in battle, in Greek and Roman historical documents, as well as references in Greek mythology and Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey. Chinese warriors over the ages did the same, as did the Gauls and Scythians, and some Native American populations.

Archaeologists have now found traces of a plant-based poison on several 60,000-year-old quartz Stone Age arrowheads found in South Africa, according to a new paper published in the journal Science Advances. That would make this the oldest direct evidence of using poisons on projectiles—a cognitively complex hunting strategy—and pushes the timeline for using poison arrows back into the Pleistocene.

The poisons commonly used could be derived from plants or animals (frogs, beetles, venomous lizards). Plant-based examples include curare, a muscle relaxant that paralyzes the victim’s respiratory system, causing death by asphyxiation. Oleander, milkweeds, or inee (onaye) contain cardiac glucosides. In Southeast Asia, the sap or juice of seeds from the ancar tree is smeared on arrowheads, which causes paralysis, convulsions, and cardiac arrest due to the presence of toxins like strychnine. Several species of aconite are known for their use as arrow poisons in Siberia and northern Japan.

According to the authors, up until now, the earliest direct evidence of poisoned arrows dates back to the mid-Holocene. For instance, scientists found traces of toxic glycoside residues on 4,000-year-old bone-tipped arrows recovered from an Egyptian tomb, as well as on bone arrow points from 6,700 years ago excavated from South Africa’s Kruger Cave. The only prior evidence of using poisons for hunting during the Pleistocene is a “poison applicator” found at Border Cave in South Africa, along with a lump of beeswax.

The authors sampled 10 quartz-backed arrowheads recovered from the Umhlatuzana Rock Shelter site in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The results revealed that five of the 10 tested tips had traces of compounds found in Boophone disticha, aka gifbol (poisonous onion), sometimes called the century plant, which is common throughout South Africa. Various parts of the plant have been used as an analgesic (specifically a volatile oil called eugenol) as well as for poisonous hunting purposes. Its more toxic compounds include buphandrine, crinamidine, and buphanine; the latter is similar in effect to scopolamine and can cause hallucinations, coma, or death.

The new analysis specifically identified alkaloid residues of buphandrine and epibuphanisine. This cannot be a coincidence, per the authors. “If I speculate, Boophone poison was probably discovered by people eating the bulbs and then becoming sick or dying from it,” co-author Marlize Lombard of the University of Johannesburg in South Africa told New Scientist. “The plant also has preservative, antibacterial, and hallucinatory properties, so that it is used in traditional medicine, and human deaths still occur as a result of accidental overdosing.”

The hunter-gatherers who made the arrow tips probably derived the poison from the milky bulb extract of a B. disticha plant. The thick liquid can be dried in the sun until it has a gum-like consistency, or reduced by heating it over a fire. Even small amounts of this substance have proven lethal to rodents within 30 minutes. In humans, it causes nausea, coma, flaccid muscles, rapid pulse rates, labored breathing, and edema of the lungs depending on the dosage. (Small doses can have medicinal effects.)

The authors note that poison arrows are not meant to kill instantly on impact. Rather, the intent is to pierce the skin just enough to introduce the poison into the bloodstream, with the arrowhead breaking off on impact and remaining under an animal’s skin. The wounded animal would then run for a day or more as the hunters continued to track it. This is evidence of complex cognition, per the authors, suggesting advanced planning, abstraction, and causal reasoning.

Historical 18th century records describe how the plant was used for hunting purposes, such as Carl Peter Thunberg’s account of native hunters using the root of B. disticha to poison arrows for hunting game like springbok. For comparison purposes, the authors also analyzed 250-year-old arrowheads found in collections in Sweden, brought back from South Africa by travelers. Those arrowheads also had traces of the same type of poison.

“Finding traces of the same poison on both prehistoric and historical arrowheads was crucial,” said co-author Sven Isaksson of Stockholm University. “By carefully studying the chemical structure of the substances and thus drawing conclusions about their properties, we were able to determine that these particular substances are stable enough to survive this long in the ground. It’s also fascinating that people had such a deep and long-standing understanding of the use of plants.”

            <h2>X’s half-assed attempt to paywall Grok doesn’t block free image editing</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/xs-half-assed-attempt-to-paywall-grok-doesnt-block-free-image-editing/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Once again, people are taking Grok at its word, treating the chatbot as a company spokesperson without questioning what it says.

On Friday morning, many outlets reported that X had blocked universal access to Grok’s image-editing features after the chatbot began prompting some users to pay $8 to use them. The messages are seemingly in response to reporting that people are using Grok to generate thousands of non-consensual sexualized images of women and children each hour.

“Image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers,” Grok tells users, dropping a link and urging, “you can subscribe to unlock these features.”

However, as The Verge pointed out and Ars verified, unsubscribed X users can still use Grok to edit images. X seems to have limited users’ ability to request edits made by replying to Grok while still allowing image edits through the desktop site. App users can access the same feature by long-pressing on any image.

Using image-editing features without publicly prompting Grok keeps outputs out of the public feed. That means the only issue X has rushed to solve is stopping Grok from directly posting harmful images on the platform.

X declined to comment on whether it’s working to close those loopholes, but it has a history of pushing janky updates since Elon Musk took over the platform formerly known as Twitter. Still, motivated X users can also continue using the standalone Grok app or website to make abusive content for free.

Like images X users can edit without publicly asking Grok, these images aren’t posted publicly to an official X account but are likely to be shared by bad actors—some of whom, according to the BBC, are already promoting allegedly Grok-generated child sexual abuse materials (CSAM) on the dark web. That’s especially concerning since Wired reported this week that users of the Grok app and website are generating far more graphic and disturbing images than what X users are creating.

It’s unclear how charging for Grok image editing will block controversial outputs, as Grok’s problematic safety guidelines remain intact. The chatbot is still instructed to assume that users have “good intent” when requesting images of “teenage” girls, which xAI says “does not necessarily imply underage.”

That could lead to Grok continuing to post harmful images of minors. xAI’s other priorities include Grok directives to avoid moralizing users and to place “no restrictions” on “fictional adult sexual content with dark or violent themes.” An AI safety expert told Ars that Grok could be tweaked to be safer, describing the chatbot’s safety guidelines as the kind of policy a platform would design if it “wanted to look safe while still allowing a lot under the hood.”

Updates to Grok’s X responses came after the platform risked fines and legal action from regulators around the world, including a potential ban in the United Kingdom.

X seems to hope that forcing users to share identification and credit card information as paying subscribers will make them less likely to use Grok to generate illegal content. But advocates who combat image-based sex abuse note that content like Grok’s “undressing” outputs can cause lasting psychological, financial, and reputational harm, even if the content is not illegal in some states.

That suggests that paying subscribers could continue using Grok to create harmful images that X may leave unchecked because they’re not technically illegal. In 2024, X agreed to voluntarily moderate all non-consensual intimate images, but Musk’s promotion of revealing bikini images of public and private figures suggests that’s no longer the case.

It seems likely that Grok will continue to be used to create non-consensual intimate images. So rather than solve the problem, X may at best succeed in limiting public exposure to Grok’s appalling outputs. The company may even profit from the feature, as Wired reported that Grok pushed “nudifying” or “undressing” apps into the mainstream.

So far, US regulators have been quiet about Grok’s outputs, with the Justice Department generally promising to take all forms of CSAM seriously. On Friday, Democratic senators started shifting those tides, demanding that Google and Apple remove X and Grok from app stores until it improves safeguards to block harmful outputs.

“There can be no mistake about X’s knowledge, and, at best, negligent response to these trends,” the senators wrote in a letter to Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook and Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai. “Turning a blind eye to X’s egregious behavior would make a mockery of your moderation practices. Indeed, not taking action would undermine your claims in public and in court that your app stores offer a safer user experience than letting users download apps directly to their phones.”

A response to the letter is requested by January 23.

Whether the UK will accept X’s supposed solution is yet to be seen. If UK regulator Ofcom decides to move ahead with a probe into whether Musk’s chatbot violates the UK’s Online Safety Act, X could face a UK ban or fines of up to 10 percent of the company’s global turnover.

“It’s unlawful,” UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said of Grok’s worst outputs. “We’re not going to tolerate it. I’ve asked for all options to be on the table. It’s disgusting. X need to get their act together and get this material down. We will take action on this because it’s simply not tolerable.”

At least one UK parliament member, Jess Asato, told The Guardian that even if X had put up an actual paywall, that isn’t enough to end the scrutiny.

“While it is a step forward to have removed the universal access to Grok’s disgusting nudifying features, this still means paying users can take images of women without their consent to sexualise and brutalise them,” Asato said. “Paying to put semen, bullet holes, or bikinis on women is still digital sexual assault, and xAI should disable the feature for good.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Welcome to Edition 8.24 of the Rocket Report! We’re back from a restorative holiday, and there’s a great deal Eric and I look forward to covering in 2026. You can get a taste of what we’re expecting this year in this feature. Other storylines are also worth watching this year that didn’t make the Top 20. Will SpaceX’s Starship begin launching Starlink satellites? Will United Launch Alliance finally get its Vulcan rocket flying at a higher cadence? Will Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket be certified by the US Space Force? I’m looking forward to learning the answers to these questions, and more. As for what has already happened in 2026, it has been a slow start on the world’s launch pads, with only a pair of SpaceX missions completed in the first week of the year. Only? Two launches in one week by any company would have been remarkable just a few years ago.

As always, we welcome reader submissions. If you don’t want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets, as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.

New launch records set in 2025. The number of orbital launch attempts worldwide last year surpassed the record 2024 flight rate by 25 percent, with SpaceX and China accounting for the bulk of the launch activity, Aviation Week & Space Technology reports. Including near-orbital flight tests of SpaceX’s Starship-Super Heavy launch system, the number of orbital launch attempts worldwide reached 329 last year, an annual analysis of global launch and satellite activity by Jonathan’s Space Report shows. Of those 329 attempts, 321 reached orbit or marginal orbits. In addition to five Starship-Super Heavy launches, SpaceX launched 165 Falcon 9 rockets in 2025, surpassing its 2024 record of 134 Falcon 9 and two Falcon Heavy flights. No Falcon Heavy rockets flew in 2025. US providers, including Rocket Lab Electron orbital flights from its New Zealand spaceport, added another 30 orbital launches to the 2025 tally, solidifying the US as the world leader in space launch.

International launches… China, which attempted 92 orbital launches in 2025, is second, followed by Russia, with 17 launches last year, and Europe with eight. Rounding out the 2025 orbital launch manifest were five orbital launch attempts from India, four from Japan, two from South Korea, and one each from Israel, Iran, and Australia, the analysis shows. The global launch tally has been on an upward trend since 2019, but the numbers may plateau this year. SpaceX expects to launch about the same number of Falcon 9 rockets this year as it did last year as the company prepares to ramp up the pace of Starship flights.

South Korean startup suffers launch failure. The first commercial rocket launched at Brazil’s Alcantara Space Center crashed soon after liftoff on December 22, dealing a blow to Brazilian aerospace ambitions and the South Korean satellite launch company Innospace, Reuters reports. The rocket began its vertical trajectory as planned after liftoff but fell to the ground after something went wrong 30 seconds into its flight, according to Innospace, the South Korean startup that developed the launch vehicle. The craft crashed within a pre-designated safety zone and did not harm anyone, officials said.

An unsurprising result... This was the first flight of Innospace’s nano-launcher, named Hanbit-Nano. The rocket was loaded with eight small payloads, including five deployable satellites, heading for low-Earth orbit. But rocket debuts don’t have a good track record, and Innospace’s rocket made it a bit farther than some new launch vehicles do. The rocket is designed to place up to 200 pounds (90 kilograms) of payload mass into Sun-synchronous orbit. It has a unique design, with hybrid engines consuming a mix of paraffin as the fuel and liquid oxygen as the oxidizer. Innospace said it intends to launch a second test flight in 2026. (submitted by EllPeaTea)

Take two for Germany’s Isar Aerospace. Isar Aerospace is gearing up for a second launch attempt of its light-class Spectrum rocket after completing 30-second integrated static test firings for both stages late last year, Aviation Week & Space Technology reports. The endeavor would be the first orbital launch for Spectrum and an effort at a clean mission after a March 30 flight ended in failure because a vent valve inadvertently opened soon after liftoff, causing a loss of control. “Rapid iteration is how you win in this domain. Being back on the pad less than nine months after our first test flight is proof that we can operate at the speed the world now demands,” said Daniel Metzler, co-founder and CEO of Isar Aerospace.

No earlier than… Airspace and maritime warning notices around the Spectrum rocket’s launch site in northern Norway suggest Isar Aerospace is targeting launch no earlier than January 17. Based near Munich, Isar Aerospace is Europe’s leading launch startup. Not only has Isar beat its competitors to the launch pad, the company has raised far more money than other European rocket firms. After its most recent fundraising round in June, Isar has raised more than 550 million euros ($640 million) from venture capital investors and government-backed funds. Now, Isar just needs to reach orbit.

A step forward for Canada’s launch ambitions. The Atlantic Spaceport Complex—a new launch facility being developed by the aerospace company NordSpace on the southern coast of Newfoundland—has won an important regulatory approval, NASASpaceflight.com reports. The provincial government of Newfoundland and Labrador “released” the spaceport from the environmental assessment process. “At this stage, the spaceport no longer requires further environmental assessment,” NordSpace said in a statement. “This release represents the single most significant regulatory milestone for NordSpace’s spaceport development to date, clearing the path for rapid execution of Canada’s first purpose-built, sovereign orbital launch complex designed and operated by an end-to-end launch services provider.”

Now, about that rocket... NordSpace began construction of the Atlantic Spaceport Complex last year and planned to launch its first suborbital rocket from the spaceport last August. But bad weather and technical problems kept NordSpace’s Taiga rocket grounded, and then the company had to wait for the Canadian government to reissue a launch license. NordSpace said it most recently delayed the suborbital launch until March in order to “continue our focus on advancing our orbital-scale technologies.” NordSpace is one of the companies likely to participate in a challenge sponsored by the Canadian government, which is committing 105 million Canadian dollars ($75 million) to develop a sovereign orbital launch capability.

H3 rocket falters on the way to orbit. A faulty payload fairing may have doomed Japan’s latest H3 rocket mission, with the Japanese space agency now investigating if the shield separated abnormally and crippled the vehicle in flight after lifting off on December 21, the Asahi Shimbun reports. Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency officials told a science ministry panel on December 23 they suspect an abnormal separation of the rocket’s payload fairing—a protective nose cone shield—caused a critical drop in pressure in the second-stage engine’s hydrogen tank. The second-stage engine lost thrust as it climbed into space, then failed to restart for a critical burn to boost Japan’s Michibiki 5 navigation satellite into a high-altitude orbit.

Growing pains… The H3 rocket is Japan’s flagship launch vehicle, having replaced the country’s H-IIA rocket after its retirement last year. The December launch was the seventh flight of an H3 rocket, and its second failure. While engineers home in on the rocket’s suspect payload fairing, several H3 launches planned for this year now face delays. Japanese officials already announced that the next H3 flight will be delayed from February. Japan’s space agency plans to launch a robotic mission to Mars on an H3 rocket in October. While there’s still time for officials to investigate and fix the issues that caused last month’s launch failure, the incident adds a question mark to the schedule for the Mars launch.

SpaceX opens 2026 with launch for Italy. SpaceX rang in the new year with a Falcon 9 rocket launch on January 2 from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, Spaceflight Now reports. The payload was Italy’s Cosmo-SkyMed Second Generation Flight Model 3 (CSG-FM3) satellite, a radar surveillance satellite for dual civilian and military use. The Cosmo-SkyMed mission was the first Falcon 9 rocket flight in 16 days, the longest stretch without a SpaceX orbital launch in four years.

Poached from Europe… The CSG-FM3 satellite is the third of four second-generation Cosmo-SkyMed radar satellites ordered by the Italian government. The second and third satellites have now launched on SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets instead of their initial ride: Europe’s Vega C launcher. Italy switched the satellites to SpaceX after delays in making the Vega C rocket operational and Europe’s loss of access to Russian Soyuz rockets in the aftermath of the invasion of Ukraine. The rocket swap became a regular occurrence for European satellites in the last few years as Europe’s indigenous launch program encountered repeated delays.

Rocket deploys heaviest satellite ever launched from India. An Indian LVM3 rocket launched AST SpaceMobile’s next-generation direct-to-device BlueBird satellite December 23, kicking off the rollout of dozens of spacecraft built around the largest commercial communications antenna ever deployed in low-Earth orbit, Space News reports. At 13,450 pounds (6.1 metric tons), the BlueBird 6 satellite was the heaviest spacecraft ever launched on an Indian rocket. The LVM3 rocket released BlueBird 6 into an orbit approximately 323 miles (520 kilometers) above the Earth.

The pressure is on… BlueBird 6 is the first of AST SpaceMobile’s Block 2 satellites designed to beam Internet signals directly to smartphones. The Texas-based company is competing with SpaceX’s Starlink network in the same direct-to-cell market. Starlink has an early lead in the direct-to-device business, but AST SpaceMobile says it plans to launch between 45 and 60 satellites by the end of this year. AST’s BlueBird satellites are significantly larger than SpaceX’s Starlink platforms, with antennas unfurling in space to cover an area of 2,400 square feet (223 square meters). The competition between SpaceX and AST SpaceMobile has led to a race for spectrum access and partnerships with cell service providers.

Ars’ annual power rankings of US rocket companies. There’s been some movement near the top of our annual power rankings. It was not difficult to select the first-place company on this list. As it has every year in our rankings, SpaceX holds the top spot. Blue Origin was the biggest mover on the list, leaping from No. 4 on the list to No. 2. It was a breakthrough year for Jeff Bezos’ space company, finally shaking the notion that it was a company full of promise that could not quite deliver. Blue Origin delivered big time in 2025. On the very first launch of the massive New Glenn rocket in January, Blue Origin successfully sent a test payload into orbit. Although a landing attempt failed after New Glenn’s engines failed to re-light, it was a remarkable success. Then, in November, New Glenn sent a pair of small spacecraft on their way to Mars. This successful launch was followed by a breathtaking and inspiring landing of the rocket’s first stage on a barge.

Where’s ULA?… Rocket Lab came in at No. 3. The company had an excellent year, garnering its highest total of Electron launches and having complete mission success. Rocket Lab has now gone more than three dozen launches without a failure. Rocket Lab also continued to make progress on its medium-lift Neutron vehicle, although its debut was ultimately delayed to mid-2026, at least. United Launch Alliance slipped from No. 2 to No. 4 after launching its new Vulcan rocket just once last year, well short of the company’s goal of flying up to 10 Vulcan missions.

Rocketdyne changes hands again. If you are a student of space history or tracked the space industry before billionaires and venture capital changed it forever, you probably know the name Rocketdyne. A half-century ago, Rocketdyne manufactured almost all of the large liquid-fueled rocket engines in the United States. The Saturn V rocket that boosted astronauts toward the Moon relied on powerful engines developed by Rocketdyne, as did the Space Shuttle, the Atlas, Thor, and Delta rockets, and the US military’s earliest ballistic missiles. But Rocketdyne has lost its luster in the 21st century as it struggled to stay relevant in the emerging commercial launch industry. Now, the engine-builder is undergoing its fourth ownership change in 20 years. AE Industrial Partners, a private equity firm, announced it will purchase a controlling stake in Rocketdyne from L3Harris after less than three years of ownership, Ars reports.

Splitting up… Rocketdyne’s RS-25 engine, used on NASA’s Space Launch System rocket, is not part of the deal with AE Industrial. It will remain under the exclusive ownership of L3Harris. Rocketdyne’s work on solid-fueled propulsion, ballistic missile interceptors, tactical missiles, and other military munitions will also remain under L3Harris control. The split of the company’s space and defense segments will allow L3Harris to concentrate on Pentagon programs, the company said. So, what is AE Industrial getting in its deal with L3Harris? Aside from the Rocketdyne name, the private equity firm will have a majority stake in the production of the liquid-fueled RL10 upper-stage engine used on United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan rocket. AE Industrial’s Rocketdyne will also continue the legacy company’s work in nuclear propulsion, electric propulsion, and smaller in-space maneuvering thrusters used on satellites.

Tory Bruno has a new employer. Jeff Bezos-founded Blue Origin said on December 26 that it has hired Tory Bruno, the longtime CEO of United Launch Alliance, as president of its newly formed national security-focused unit, Reuters reports. Bruno will head the National Security Group and report to Blue Origin CEO Dave Limp, the company said in a social media post, underscoring its push to expand in US defense and intelligence launch markets. The hire brings one of the US launch industry’s most experienced executives to Blue Origin as the company works to challenge the dominance of SpaceX and win a larger share of lucrative US military and intelligence launch contracts.

11 years at ULA… The move comes days after Bruno stepped down as CEO of ULA, the Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture that has long dominated US national security space launches alongside Elon Musk’s SpaceX. In 11 years at ULA, Bruno oversaw the development of the Vulcan rocket, the company’s next-generation launch vehicle designed to replace its Atlas V and Delta IV rockets and secure future Pentagon contracts.

A California spaceport has room to grow. A new orbital launch site is up for grabs at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, Spaceflight Now reports. The Department of the Air Force published a request for information from launch providers to determine the level of interest in what would become the southernmost launch complex on the Western Range. The location, which will be designated as Space Launch Complex-14 or SLC-14, is being set aside for orbital rockets in a heavy or super-heavy vertical launch class. One of the requirements listed in the RFI includes what the government calls the “highest technical maturity.” It states that for the bid from a launch provider to be taken seriously, it needs to prove that it can begin operations within approximately five years of receiving a lease for the property.

Who’s in contention?… Multiple US launch providers have rockets in the heavy to super-heavy classification either currently launching or in development. Given all the requirements and the state of play on the orbital launch front, one of the contenders would likely be SpaceX’s Starship-Super Heavy rocket. The company is slated to launch the latest iteration of the rocket, dubbed Version 3, sometime in early 2026. Blue Origin is another likely contender for the prospective launch site. Blue Origin currently has an undeveloped space at Vandenberg’s SLC-9 for its New Glenn rocket. But the company unveiled plans in November for a new super-heavy lift version called New Glenn 9×4.

            <h2>Fentanyl Overdose Deaths Are Now Falling Sharply, and You’ll Never Guess Why</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For many years, the United States has waged a bitter battle against fentanyl.

The staggering number of overdose deaths caused by the drug has been used by Donald Trump’s administration to justify attacking boats in the Caribbean, deploy militarized forces to detain legal citizens, and impose sweeping tariffs — despite having little data to prove that its target countries, including Canada, were actually to blame.

The president went as far as to sign an executive order calling the highly addictive and extremely potent synthetic opiate a “weapon of mass destruction.”

Yet the latest research shows something inconvenient for that narrative: a sharp reduction in fentanyl overdoses that started before Trump took office, almost certainly in response to policy under his predecessor Joe Biden.

As researchers noted in a paper published in the journal Science this week, fatal overdoses from synthetic opioids like fentanyl plummeted after peaking at 76,000 in 2023 in the US, dropping by over a third by the end of 2024. (Full numbers aren’t in yet for 2025, but provisional data from the CDC suggests another double-digit percentage drop.)

The researchers proposed a possible explanation, writing that a “major disruption in the illicit fentanyl trade, possibly tied to Chinese government actions,” may have “translated into sharp reductions in overdose mortality beginning in mid- or late-2023 and continued into 2024 across both the US and Canada.”

In other words, as Axiom reports, diplomatic pressure has proven far more effective than efforts to crack down on drug dealers on the street.

“That is heartening because street-level enforcement can result in large and racially disproportionate increases in incarceration while at the same time there is little evidence that tougher domestic enforcement, either at the street level or at the wholesale level, can make drugs more expensive or make them harder to acquire,” the paper reads.

The researchers used data from the US and Canadian governments, as well as discussions on Reddit, to come to their conclusion. They found that Beijing starting to shut down Chinese companies that were supplying Mexican criminal groups with precursor chemicals to fentanyl in 2023 was associated with the decline in fentanyl deaths.

In other words, a major supply chain disruption, which started long before Trump started his second term, was likely behind the decline.

The US Drug Enforcement Administration also noted in its 2025 National Drug Threat Assessment that Chinese chemical suppliers were “wary of supplying controlled precursors to its international customers, demonstrating an awareness on their part that the government of China is controlling more fentanyl precursors.”

“This demonstrates how influential China can be and how much they can help us — or hurt us,” Keith Humphreys, coauthor and former White House drug policy adviser under president Barack Obama, told the Washington Post.

It’s not a given that the positive trend will continue. For one, CDC data found that there was a small increase in fatal overdoses between January 2024 and January 2025, bucking seventeen months of declines.

University of North Carolina epidemiologist Nabarun Dasgupta suggested there may be a far simpler reason why overdoses dropped: the habits of drug users may have changed, with some choosing to cut back.

“It’s not a straight line between drug supply and overdose deaths because of protective behaviors that have been adopted in between,” he told WaPo.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A stack of major AI ethics lawsuits against Google have finally come to an end.

According to the New York Times, the family of a deceased 14-year-old named Sewell Setzer III has agreed to settle a lawsuit against Google and the AI companion company Character.AI out of court for an undisclosed sum. In a filing submitted on Wednesday, the parties involved said they had agreed “to resolve all claims,” though the exact terms of the agreement haven’t been finalized.

Setzer’s case has dominated headlines, though his was just one of five lawsuits settled with the tech companies this week.

In summer of 2024, Google injected $3 billion into Character.AI, which hosts a virtual library of thousands of chatbot personas and soon became explosively popular with teens. But it quickly became clear that the platform was barely moderated, hosting bots modeled after child predators, school shooters, and eating disorder coaches.

In an even darker twist, Character.AI was soon connected to several youth suicides and a wave of other grisly outcomes for young people.

Following Setzer’s death, for instance, his mother discovered that his last conversation had been with an AI chatbot styled after “Game of Thrones” character Daenerys Targaryen and had revolved around suicide.

In his last messages to the bot, the Character.AI persona generated text asking Setzer to “please come home to me as soon as possible.”

“What if I told you I could come home right now?” Sewell replied. “…please do, my sweet king,” the AI responded. Soon after, Setzer took his own life with his father’s gun.

“I feel like it’s a big experiment,” Setzer’s mother, Megan Garcia, told the NYT at the time, “and my kid was just collateral damage.”

Haley Hinkle, a policy attorney at Fairplay, a nonprofit that works to promote online child safety, told the NYT not to view the settlements as the final word on the issue. “We have only just begun to see the harm that AI will cause to children if it remains unregulated,” Hinkle said.

While we don’t know what the giant tech companies offered Setzer’s family as recompense, their settlement comes a few months after Character.AI moved to ban all minors under 18 from accessing the platform.

The crackdown on minors was a significant step for the platform, since adolescents make up a huge portion of its userbase. As part of the new enforcement regime, Character.AI said it developed a new in-house tool to identify minors based on their conversations with the platform’s chatbot, and had partnered with a third-party company to verify users’ ages based on government IDs.

As far as Google and Character.AI were concerned, it’s likely they were apprehensive about a court case that would potentially expose their internal processes and communications as the bots were developed, giving both companies ample reason to offer a generous out-of-court settlement.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Thinking about dropping those flavorful white sachets of nicotine this resolution season? You might want to reconsider how fast you hit the off ramp.

Zyns — those tiny nicotine pouches that seem to nowinfest every urinal, bar-top, and sidewalk — have captured the hearts and mouths of many who would never consider smoking a cigarette, let alone packing ‘chaw. Since tobacco giant Philip Morris International acquired the Swedish brand for $16 billion in 2022, Zyn consumption among teens and young adults has nearly quadrupled, according to a November study by the CDC Foundation.

As it turns out, it’s much easier to start on the packs than it is to quit, especially if you go cold turkey. A horrifying profile by GQ details writer Rosecrans Baldwin’s effort to go from one 15-pouch can per day to none, virtually overnight. His experience was agonizing.

About four hours after deciding to lay off the nicotine lodes for good, Baldwin wrote that he began to experience dizziness, headaches, intense sweating, a rapid heart rate, clenching jaw, and even rolling hallucinations.

“For several hours, I’d been haunted by yellow-tinted hallucinations, sweeping in and out of my mind like searchlights, which told me I might’ve slipped between worlds,” he explained of his withdrawal experience. “The street was quiet and empty. I knew I shouldn’t stand, let alone go anywhere, in case the situation got worse.”

Little did he know at the time, Baldwin was in the throes of a panic attack, very likely brought about by acute nicotine withdrawal. “I was afraid I’d lost my mind,” he recalled.

In the US, Zyn sells its pouches in strengths varying from 3mg to 6mg. Though cigarettes contain anywhere from 10 to 12mg of nicotine, less than 2mg typically enters the body for each cigarette smoked, since a lot of the smoke drifts away. The absorption rate on nicotine pouches is much higher, as nicotine is delivered straight through the mouth’s mucous membranes and into the blood vessels.

Though Baldwin admits he’s long held a casual relationship with nicotine, he says Zyns took the habit to another level.

“Years went by when I didn’t smoke at all, and there were a few years when I smoked maybe a couple cigarettes a week,” he said. “My Zyn use turbocharged all of that, fostering a dependence I fed unwittingly, with a sachet secreting nicotine into every waking moment for more than a year.”

Baldwin’s first quitting attempt wasn’t successful, as he soon bought a pack of cigarettes and fell back into “nicotine’s grasp.” A while later, though, he decided to try again, this time by winding down his intake steadily over a few months — an effort which he says has finally freed him from the substance once and for all.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI chatbots may be explosively popular, but they’re known to dispense some seriously wacky— and potentially dangerous — health advice, in a flood of easily accessible misinformation that has alarmed experts.

Their advent has turned countless users into armchair experts, who often end up relying on obsolete, misattributed, or completely made-up advice.

A recent investigation by The Guardian, for instance, found that Google’s AI Overviews, which accompany most search results pages, doled out plenty of inaccurate health information that could lead to grave health risks if followed.

But seemingly unperturbed by experts’ repeated warnings that AI’s health advice shouldn’t be trusted, OpenAI is doubling down by launching a new feature called ChatGPT Health, which will ingest your medical records to generate responses “more relevant and useful to you.”

Yet despite being “designed in close collaboration with physicians” and built on “strong privacy, security, and data controls,” the feature is “designed to support, not replace, medical care.” In fact, it’s shipping with a ludicrously self-defeating caveat: that the bespoke health feature is “not intended for diagnosis or treatment.”

“ChatGPT Health helps people take a more active role in understanding and managing their health and wellness — while supporting, not replacing, care from clinicians,” the company’s website reads.

In reality, users are certain to use it for exactly the type of health advice that OpenAI is warning against in the fine print, which is likely to bring fresh new embarrassments for the company.

It’ll only be heightening existing problems for the company. As Business Insider reports, ChatGPT is “making amateur lawyers and doctors out of everyone,” to the dismay of legal and medical professionals.

Miami-based medical malpractice attorney Jonathan Freidin told the publication that people will use chatbots like ChatGPT to fill out his firm’s client contact sheet.

“We’re seeing a lot more callers who feel like they have a case because ChatGPT or Gemini told them that the doctors or nurses fell below the standard of care in multiple different ways,” he said. “While that may be true, it doesn’t necessarily translate into a viable case.”

Then there’s the fact that users are willing to surrender medical histories, including highly sensitive and personal information — a decision that OpenAI is now encouraging with ChatGPT Health — despite federal law, like HIPAA, not applying to consumer AI products.

Case in point, billionaire Elon Musk encouraged people last year to upload their medical data to his ChatGPT competitor Grok, leading to a flood of confusion as users received hallucinated diagnoses after sharing their X-rays and PET scans.

Given the AI industry’s track record when it comes to privacy protection and struggles with significant data leaks, all these risks are as pertinent as ever.

“New AI health tools offer the promise of empowering patients and promoting better health outcomes, but health data is some of the most sensitive information people can share and it must be protected,” Center for Democracy and Technology senior counsel Andrew Crawford told the BBC.

“Especially as OpenAI moves to explore advertising as a business model, it’s crucial that separation between this sort of health data and memories that ChatGPT captures from other conversations is airtight,” he added. “Since it’s up to each company to set the rules for how health data is collected, used, shared, and stored, inadequate data protections and policies can put sensitive health information in real danger.”

“ChatGPT is only bound by its own disclosures and promises, so without any meaningful limitation on that, like regulation or a law, ChatGPT can change the terms of its service at any time,” Electronic Privacy Information Center senior counsel Sara Geoghegan told The Record.

Then there are concerns over highly sensitive data, like reproductive health information, being passed on to the police against the user’s wishes.

“How does OpenAI handle [law enforcement] requests?” Crawford told The Record. “Do they just turn over the information? Is the user in any way informed?”

“There’s lots of questions there that I still don’t have great answers to,” he added.

            <div id="article-text">Watch out, bartenders: your jobs might be next on the AI chopping block — at least if tech startup Breakreal has anything to say about it.

With CES 2026 in full-swing, tech insiders and industry journalists are getting a first-hand look at the madcap gadgets that research and development teams are forcing into the world. One of those devices is the Breakreal R1, a cocktail dispenser that its creators say is imbued with the power of a large language model.

A first-hand look at the device from Gizmodo‘s James Pero reveals what we can probably all intuit: the device is no match for a human bartender.

For starters, the liquid possibilities are pretty limited. Though the Breakreal website brags that R1’s “LLM-powered intelligence… distills your cravings into bespoke generative recipes” via “unlimited AI generated recipes,” the device can only hold eight cocktail ingredients at a time.

Consider a scenario where you load up ingredients to pump out a Manhattan — rye whiskey, sweet vermouth, and bitters — as well as a Vesper, which calls for gin, vodka, and Lillet Blanc. You only have two extra chambers left for auxiliary ingredients, and those first six don’t exactly blend well with each other.

The R1 is also “a bit slow,” Pero reports, taking 20 to 40 seconds to spit out a cocktail, some of which was leaking “out of the arm of the machine and not the nozzle.”

On top of all that, it’s incredibly expensive. According to Breakreal’s website, the R1 will retail for a mind-blowing $1,299 when it launches on Kickstarter at some point in the future. (At the moment, prospective buyers can currently get an early-access coupon to shave $300 off that price, bringing it down to $999.)

Compare this to the non-AI powered Bartesian cocktail machine, a similarly frivolous though much cheaper gadget currently going for just $349, and it’s difficult to imagine a world where R1 lasts very long.

Still, for $999, R1 buyers will get a cocktail maker with “LLM-powered interactive conversation” and “mood-sensing flavor adaptation” — which sound like word soup at best, and a sycophantic alcoholism machine at worst.

Luckily for those who do crave a connection with the entity making their cocktail, you can always trek over to a magical place: your local bar.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the first time ever, NASA has been forced to cut a mission to the International Space Station short due to a “serious medical condition” affecting a crew member.

The four Crew-11 astronauts, who arrived at the station in early August, will now be returning a month early on board a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule. All four crew members must return together, since they all rely on the same spacecraft for transportation and a place to hide out in case of an emergency.

There’s a lot we still don’t know about what occurred. On Thursday, NASA held a news conference to discuss the situation, insisting that the crew member was “stable” and that “due to medical privacy,” it wouldn’t be “appropriate for NASA to share more details about the crew member.”

The agency, however, revealed that the unidentified crew member did not sustain an injury and was “totally unrelated” to any space operations, including a Wednesday spacewalk that was unexpectedly cancelled.

Recently sworn-in NASA administrator Jared Isaacman made the announcement that the Crew-11 mission would be cutting their time on board the aging orbital outpost short. It’s likely the biggest decision he’s had to make during his extremely short tenure as the agency’s head.

More information about a more detailed timeline will be released within the next 48 hours.

“After discussions with our chief health and medical officer, Dr. JD Polk, and leadership across the agency, I’ve come to the decision that it’s in the best interests of our astronauts to return Crew-11 ahead of their planned departure,” he said.

Polk also insisted that “because the astronaut is absolutely stable, this is not an emergency evacuation.”

“We’re not immediately disembarking and getting the astronaut down,” he added.

It’s a historic moment for the space station. Despite having been continuously inhabited since the year 2000, there has never been an early evacuation, as the BBC points out. According to Polk, early predictive models concluded a medical evacuation would happen once every three years — not 25.

“For over 60 years, NASA has set the standard for safety and security in crewed spaceflight,” Isaacman said during Thursday’s conference. “In these endeavors, including the 25 years of continuous human presence onboard the International Space Station, the health and well-being of our astronauts is always and will be our highest priority.”

Getting medical treatment in the cramped and microgravity environment of the ISS isn’t easy. Astronauts are highly trained for medical emergencies, but beyond being able to provide EMT-like treatment, options are limited, Ars Technica reports, options are limited.

“We have a very robust suite of medical hardware onboard the International Space Station, but we don’t have the complete amount of hardware that I would have in the emergency department, for example, to complete the workup of a patient,” Polk told reporters.

The ISS will have to continue operations with a much smaller crew of three after the departure of the Crew-11 crew. According to Isaacman, the subsequent Crew-12 mission may be moved up from its current February 15 date.

            <div id="article-text">CES 2026 is winding down in Las Vegas, as the consumer tech industry and everyone swarming around it begin their return flights home. Over the past few days, we saw a slew of announcements from mainstays like Nvidia, Sony, and AMD, along with smaller companies and startups vying for attention through the Unveiled event (CES’s showcase for new products) and across the show floor.

As has been the case for the past two years, AI was at the forefront of many companies’ messaging, though the hardware upgrades and oddities that have long defined the annual event still have their place on the show floor and in adjacent announcements. This year, physical AI was particularly prominent, taking the place that agentic AI held last year as the show’s buzzy topic. That focus on physical AI came alongside a big focus on robotics, with robots demonstrated all over the show and showcased in numerous press events.

To relive the reactions and thoughts from our team on the ground, you can go back in time via our live blog right here. Otherwise, let’s dive into some of the biggest and most notable announcements from CES.

If audio or video are more your thing, then head right to the latest episode of our Equity podcast, which goes into detail about what we thought about the show, or watch the full episode below on YouTube.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivered an expectedly lengthy presentation at CES, taking a victory lap for the company’s AI-driven successes, setting the stage for 2026, and yes, hanging out with some robots.

The Rubin computing architecture, which has been developed to meet the increasing computation demands that AI adoption creates, is set to begin replacing Blackwell architecture in the second half of this year. It comes with speed and storage upgrades, but our senior AI editor Russell Brandom goes into the nitty-gritty of what distinguishes Rubin.

And Nvidia continued its push to bring the AI revolution into the physical world, showcasing its Alpamayo family of open source AI models and tools that will be used by autonomous vehicles this year. That approach, as senior reporter Rebecca Bellan notes, mirrors the company’s broader efforts to make its infrastructure the Android for generalist robots.

AMD chair and CEO Lisa Su delivered the first keynote of CES, with a presentation that featured partners, including OpenAI president Greg Brockman, AI legend Fei-Fei Li, Luma AI CEO Amit Jain, and more.

Beyond the partner showcases, senior reporter Rebecca Szkutak detailed AMD’s approach toward expanding the reach of AI through personal computers using its Ryzen AI 400 Series processors.

Let’s face it, by this point in the show the major announcements have been made, products have been showcased, and it’s time to eye some of the most brow-raising reveals from CES. We started our list of what stood out to us as odd and noteworthy, but we’re open to more suggestions!

CES isn’t all hardware showcases and show floor attractions — there are plenty of additional industry panels and speakers drawing eyeballs. We kept tabs on a few notable highlights, ranging from Palmer Luckey pushing retro aesthetics, to why the “learn once, work forever” era may be over, to previews of the new Silicon Valley-based series “The Audacity,” to the expansion of Roku’s $3 streaming service, to All-In host Jason Calacanis putting a $25,000 bounty on an authentic Theranos device.

Ford is launching its assistant in the company’s app before a targeted 2027 release in its vehicles, with hosting managed by Google Cloud and the assistant itself built using off-the-shelf LLMs. As we noted in our coverage of the news, however, few details were offered around what drivers should expect from their experience with the assistant.

As part of the ever-present push for AI’s impact on the physical world, Caterpillar and Nvidia announced a pilot program, “Cat AI Assistant,” which was demonstrated at CES Wednesday. This system, coming to one of Caterpillar’s excavator vehicles, is happening alongside another project to use Nvidia’s Omniverse simulation resources to help with construction project planning and execution.

One of the buzziest reveals of the show is the debut phone from Clicks Technology, the $499 Communicator, which brings back BlackBerry vibes with its physical keyboard, plus a separate $79 slide-out physical keyboard that can be used with other devices.

Check out our full rundown from the show floor here, but the Communicator makes a good first impression, per Consumer Editor Sarah Perez:

“In our hands-on test, the phone felt good to hold — not too heavy or light, and was easy to grip. Gadway told me the company settled on the device’s final form after dozens of 3D-printed shapes. The winning design for the phone features a contoured back that makes it easy to pick up and hold.

“The device’s screen is also somewhat elevated off the body, and its chin is curved up to create a recess that protects the keys when you place it face down.”

A big part of LG’s CES presentation was dedicated to its robotics efforts, with home robot CLOiD as a prominent figurehead. And how did the robot fare once it was off the press conference stage and out in the wild? We’ll let Senior Writer Lucas Ropek’s impressions speak for themselves:

“Unfortunately, at the presentation I saw, CLOid didn’t do a whole lot. I saw the bot very gingerly take a shirt out of a basket and place it into a dryer. I also saw it pick up a croissant and (again, very gingerly) place it into an oven. In addition to the live performance from the bot, the presentation was intercut with highly produced videos of the bot in a number of hypothetical scenarios where it might prove useful to potential users.”

Long used in industrial settings, UV printers that can print ink directly onto objects have been prohibitively expensive for individuals to own. But the eufyMake E1 is set to launch for $2,299 later this year, which makes bulk printing on things like mugs, water bottles and phone cases a bit more attainable for individuals. Lucas Ropek has more first impressions here.

MyCommuters has a novel take on creating office space by helping companies find locations that are beneficial to them and their employees. The platform pulls together different datasets to examine commute time, expenses, and other factors to identify an ideal spot for an office, not just the easiest thing to spot that’s on the market. Sean O’Kane has more reporting on the idea that drove founder Guillaume Acier to start the company here.

This family planning tool caught our eye on the show floor, not just for its calendar and planning capabilities, but for its AI capabilities that are able to sync calendars from different sources; create new to-dos based off of messages or photos, appointment reminders; and more. Check out our full impressions here.

Hyundai’s press conference focused on its robotics partnerships with Boston Dynamics, but the companies revealed that they’re working with Google’s AI research lab rather than competitors to train and operate existing Atlas robots, as well as a new iteration of the humanoid robot that was shown onstage. Transportation editor Kirsten Korosec has the full rundown.

Amazon’s AI-centric update with Alexa+ is getting the kind of push you’d expect at CES, with the company launching Alexa.com for Early Access customers looking to use the chatbot via their browsers, along with a similar, revamped bot-focused app. Consumer editor Sarah Perez has the details, along with news on Amazon’s revamp to Fire TV and new Artline TVs, which have their own Alexa+ push.

On the Ring front, consumer reporter Ivan Mehta runs through the many announcements, from fire alerts to an app store for third-party camera integration, and more.

In the past, Razer has been all about ridiculous hardware at CES, from three-screen laptops to haptic gaming cushions to a mask that landed the company a federal fine. This year, its two attention-grabbing announcements were for Project Motoko, which aims to function similarly to smart glasses, but without the glasses.

Then there’s Project AVA, which puts the avatar of an AI companion on your desk. We’ll let you watch the concept video for yourself.

Lego joined CES for the first time to hold a behind-closed-doors showcase of its Smart Play System, which includes bricks, tiles, and Minifigures that can all interact with each other and play sounds, with both the debut sets having a Star Wars theme. Senior writer Amanda Silberling has all the details here.

            <h2>How the Sleepbuds maker, Ozlo, is building a platform for sleep data</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/09/how-the-sleepbuds-maker-ozlo-is-building-a-platform-for-sleep-data/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ozlo, the maker of comfortable, easy-to-use Sleepbuds that drown out outside noise so you can get better rest, is turning its product into a platform.

The company’s plan began to take shape last month with the announcement of a partnership between Ozlo and meditation app Calm. But it kicked into high gear at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week as the company met with prospective partners to expand its reach.

Those new partners could help Ozlo tap into new audiences and build a revenue model beyond consumer-focused hardware and into the profit-margin-rich world of software subscriptions and healthcare. For instance, software features that use AI or are designed to provide relief to users with tinnitus could be offered as premium subscriptions. And a recent acquisition of a neurotech startup should help Ozlo expand beyond being a consumer product to entering the medical device market, too.

Founded by former Bose employees, Ozlo always intended to build an ecosystem, Ozlo co-founder and CEO NB Patil explained on the sidelines of CES.

“The way we did that from the beginning is we built the iOS and Android SDK — so our first-party app actually runs on that SDK. That means whatever you see in our app can be made available to anybody,” Patil said.

The mental wellness company Calm, for instance, is using the SDK to tell whether its sleep and meditation content is actually resonating with its customers. While Calm can’t tell from its own app if customers have fallen asleep, Ozlo’s sensors can. The device detects how body movements and respiration rates change, and that data is sent to the Ozlo charging case. There, a machine learning algorithm determines whether someone is asleep or is relaxed.

Ozlo’s smart case has other sensors as well, including a temperature sensor and a light sensor that can add more data.

Now, that information can be shared with apps like Calm and others.

For example, if a user started playing a breathing exercise, Ozlo could tell if their respiration rate had gone down and share that data with its partner. If the exercise is unsuccessful, the partner would know they need to change the pattern or do something different.

“So there are two parts,” Patil notes. “Taking real-time action when the customer achieves the desired state [which Ozlo does with its feature that can shut off sounds after the user falls asleep] and the other part, which is very important, actually — that content creators are not quite thinking about — is, are they investing in the right content?”

Patil explains that content creators for these types of meditation and sleeping aid apps tend to invest in volume without measuring whether or not their content is effective.

“They don’t understand, actually, how it works in the field because there is no data,” he says.

This relationship could also add another revenue stream to Ozlo’s business beyond selling hardware. For instance, if a customer is prompted to upgrade their subscription to the partner’s product, Ozlo could take a portion of that transaction.

Patil told TechCrunch the company is already in discussions with other sleep and meditation apps, but this closed-loop feedback system could be used with any sort of content, including therapy or even audiobooks.

Ozlo is also working on tinnitus therapy tools to address the ear-ringing problem that affects 15% of its customer base. The company teamed up with Walter Reed Hospital last year to launch a clinical study of the problem and found that playing the right masking frequency overnight for many weeks can fool the brain into stopping the irritating signals producing the ringing sounds.

Patil says the tinnitus therapies will be available via a subscription and will roll out in the second quarter of 2026.

Ozlo is also working to expand the insights it provides its own customers, and AI is an increasingly important piece. The company launched Sleep Patterns within its app in November to help customers understand how long and well they’ve slept, what their patterns are across the past weeks, and what factors could be disturbing their rest.

This year, Ozlo plans to introduce an AI agent that customers can text with and use as a “sleep buddy.” (The company revealed the “buddy” name for its AI agent in an Easter egg within the app. The app displays an animated character — “buddy” — that runs across the top of the screen when you open and close the case five times in a row.)

By integrating with other wearables and Apple’s HealthKit, Ozlo will be able to better understand a user’s patterns and what they need to sleep better. It also wants to be able to connect with IoT devices, like smart thermostats, to set the right sleeping temperature for users as soon as they open the case at night.

The AI features are expected in the second quarter.

Ozlo’s next-generation case will address the issue of the earbuds sometimes not being properly seated in the charger.

“We changed the contours inside the case — when you place [the sleepbud], it’s perfect. And then we’ll have a Bluetooth button to do the pairing,” Patil says.

Plus, the new device will include a redesigned antenna and extender for improved range, and will add an amplifier to boost how loud the headphones can be to drown out plane and train noise, when needed. This updated hardware will also arrive in Q2.

In terms of products, Ozlo will launch a bedside speaker in Q2 that will offer similar functionality to the Sleepbuds, but won’t need to go in the ear. A 4×6-inch speaker would also have its own sensor, allowing it to do things like tracking how many times you woke up for bathroom breaks, or alert others if you had fallen.

The speaker would allow the company to market to families with children under 13, as kids aren’t advised to wear earbuds at night. It could also make sense for elderly individuals who aren’t as technically savvy and don’t want to fiddle with in-ear devices.

Like the popular Hatch alarm clock, Ozlo is working on adding a light to a product in the future to gently wake you up. (The time frame to launch is still being determined.)

Acquisitions are also part of Ozlo’s growth strategy.

The 60-person, Boston-based company just acquired Segotia, an EEG-focused neurotech firm from Ireland, that has been building “hearable” technologies. Ozlo believes this will allow it to bring brain-level insights to its consumer device and later develop tools to do real-time sleep intervention.

“Basically, we are custom designing the eartip that is going to measure the electrical signals from your ear. From that, actually, you can derive the delta signals from the brain, and you should be able to say what your brain is doing when it comes to sleep, or when it comes to awareness, and all that,” Patil explained.

A product incorporating the EEG technology will launch in 2027, allowing the company to move into the medical products field, as well.

With the busy year ahead, Ozlo will need to execute well on each new feature and product in rapid order to maintain its current pace and grow its customer base. It will also need additional capital. Patil told TechCrunch the company is in the process of closing a Series B round now, with more details to come in the month ahead.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/09/meta-signs-deals-with-three-nuclear-companies-for-6-plus-gw-of-power/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Meta today announced three deals to provide its data centers with nuclear power: one from a startup, one from a smaller energy company, and one from a larger company that already operates several nuclear reactors in the U.S.

Oklo and TerraPower, two companies developing small modular reactors (SMR), each signed agreements with Meta to build multiple reactors, while Vistra is selling capacity from its existing power plants.

Nuclear power has become a favored power source for tech companies as their AI ambitions have grown, providing stable 24/7 electricity. Startups and existing reactors have benefited from the race for data center power, though in different ways.

Existing reactors tend to be the cheapest form of baseload capacity, but there are only so many to go around, which has pushed Meta and its peers toward SMR startups. Companies like Oklo and TerraPower are betting that by building a large number of smaller reactors, they’ll be able to bring the cost down through mass manufacturing. It’s a plausible hypothesis, though one that has yet to be tested. Meta’s deal could give SMR startups a chance to prove it.

The deals are the result of a request for proposals that Meta issued in December 2024, in which Meta sought partners that could add between 1 to 4 gigawatts of generating capacity by the early 2030s. Much of the new power will flow through the PJM interconnection, a grid which covers 13 Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern states and has become saturated with data centers.

The 20-year agreement with Vistra will have the most immediate impact on Meta’s energy needs. The tech company will buy a total of 2.1 gigawatts from two existing nuclear power plants, Perry and Davis-Besse in Ohio.

As part of the deal, Vistra will also add capacity to those power plants and to its Beaver Valley power plant in Pennsylvania. Together, the upgrades will generate an additional 433 MW and are scheduled to come online in the early 2030s.

Meta is also buying 1.2 gigawatts from young provider Oklo. Under its deal with Meta, Oklo is hoping to start supplying power to the grid as early as 2030. The SMR company went public via SPAC in 2023, and while Oklo has landed a large deal with data center operator Switch, it has struggled to get its reactor design approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

If Oklo can deliver on its timeline, the new reactors would be built in Pike County, Ohio. The startup’s Aurora Powerhouse reactors each produce 75 megawatts of electricity, and it will need to build more than a dozen to fulfill Meta’s order.

TerraPower is a startup co-founded by Bill Gates, and it is aiming to start sending electricity to Meta as early as 2032. It has designed a reactor that uses molten sodium to transfer energy from reactor to generator. When demand is low, the superheated salt can be stored in an insulated vat until more power is needed. The reactor can generate 345 megawatts of electricity, while the storage system can provide an additional 100 to 500 megawatts for more than five hours.

The company has navigated the NRC process more smoothly, and it is working with GE Hitachi to build its first power plant in Wyoming. Its first two reactors for Meta would provide 690 megawatts, and Meta said it has rights to buy another six units for a total of 2.8 gigawatts of nuclear capacity and 1.2 gigawatts of storage.

Meta did not disclose financial terms of the deals.

The power purchases from Vistra are certain to be the cheapest — electricity from already operating nuclear reactors is among the cheapest on the grid.

Costs for SMRs still have yet to be worked out. Several startups have aggressive cost targets: TerraPower has estimated that it can bring it down to $50 to $60 per megawatt-hour, while Oklo has said it is aiming for $80 to $130 per megawatt-hour. Those figures are for later power plants — the first examples are likely to cost more.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk’s AI company has restricted Grok’s controversial AI image-generation feature to only paying subscribers on X, after the tool invited heavy criticism from across the world for letting users generate sexualized and nude images of women and children.

In replies to users on Friday, Grok said only paying subscribers on X would be able to generate and edit images on the platform. Notably, these limits do not apply to the Grok app, which, at the time of publication was letting anyone generate pictures without having to pay for a subscription.

Initially available to anyone with daily limits, Grok’s image-generation feature allowed users to upload anyone’s picture and ask it to edit it or generate a sexualized or nude version. What ensued was a veritable flood of non-consensual sexualized images of children, actors, models and prominent figures, drawing the ire of multiple nations.

X and Musk have both publicly denounced the use of the tool to produce such images, writing that the company would stick to its policies against posting illegal content on the social media platform. “Anyone using grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” Musk tweeted last week.

The U.K., the European Union, and India have all publicly denounced X and Grok for allowing such use of its capabilities. The EU on Thursday asked xAI to retain all documentation relating to the chatbot, and India’s communications ministry last week ordered X to make immediate changes to stop the image-generation features from being misused or risk its safe harbor protections in the country. The U.K.’s communications watchdog said it’s been in touch with xAI over the issue as well.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Andreessen Horowitz just announced the firm has raised a little more than $15 billion in new funding. The haul represents over 18% of all venture capital dollars allocated in the United States in 2025, according to firm co-founder Ben Horowitz, but even more jaw-dropping is that it brings the organization to more than $90 billion in assets under management, putting it neck-and-neck with Sequoia Capital as among the largest venture firms in the world. Which is fitting, since a16z appears to be very friendly with actual sovereign wealth funds, including at least one from Saudi Arabia.

The firm, which employs approximately hundreds of people across five offices — three in California, plus New York and Washington, D.C. — has become a globe-spanning operation with employees on six continents. In December, it opened its first Asia office in Seoul for its crypto practice.

That newly committed capital breaks down across five funds: $6.75 billion for growth investments, $1.7 billion each for apps and infrastructure, $1.176 billion for “American Dynamism” (more on that shortly), $700 million for biotech and healthcare, and another $3 billion for other venture strategies. It’s the kind of money that makes you wonder where it all comes from and, more importantly, where it all goes.

The “where it comes from” question is one the firm has historically declined to answer. When we asked a16z this week about its limited partners and its distributed-to-paid-in capital ratio — the DPI, or how much actual cash the firm has returned to investors over its 16-year history — the firm didn’t respond. What we do know is that CalPERS invested $400 million in 2023, marking the first time in a16z’s history it took money from a major California pension fund, probably because institutions with transparency requirements don’t really align with the firm’s preference for opacity. We also know that Sanabil Investments, the venture arm of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, lists Andreessen Horowitz among its portfolio holdings.

The Saudi connection isn’t subtle. Back in 2023, Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz appeared onstage with WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann to discuss their $350 million investment in his then-new residential real estate venture, Flow. The venue was a conference backed by one of Saudi Arabia’s largest sovereign funds. Horowitz praised Saudi Arabia as a “startup country,” adding that “Saudi has a founder; you don’t call him a founder, you call him his royal highness.”

But Marc Andreessen has found another royal to admire. Since President Donald Trump’s November 2024 election victory, Andreessen has logged a lot of hours at Mar-a-Lago, by his own account, helping shape policy on tech, business, and economics. Early last year, he became an “unpaid intern” at Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, vetting candidates for the Trump administration — not just for tech roles but for positions in the Defense Department and intelligence agencies. Scott Kupor, a16z’s first employee back in 2009, was sworn in as director of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management this past summer.

This matters because a16z’s current strategy is heavily weighted toward what it calls “American Dynamism” — a practice that invests in defense, aerospace, public safety, housing, education, and manufacturing. The portfolio aligns remarkably well with Defense Department priorities: Anduril (autonomous defense systems), Shield AI (military drones), Saronic Technologies (autonomous naval vessels), and Castelion (hypersonic missiles). The bigger bet is that America needs to reindustrialize and reshore critical manufacturing, particularly since, as a16z itself notes, the U.S. would exhaust its entire missile inventory “in something like 8 days” in a conflict with China over Taiwan, then need three years to rebuild it.

Then there’s the AI bet, which might be the firm’s highest-risk, highest-reward play yet. a16z has positioned itself across every level of the AI stack: infrastructure (Databricks), foundation models (with stakes in Mistral AI, OpenAI and xAI), and applications (Character.AI, among many other portfolio companies).

The firm has wins to point to. Its $25 million investment in Coinbase turned into an $86 billion valuation at the 2021 IPO. There’s Airbnb (public at over $100 billion), Slack (acquired for $27.7 billion), and GitHub ($7.5 billion to Microsoft). Its portfolio includes 115 unicorns, 35 IPOs, and 241 acquisitions, according to the market intelligence firm Tracxn. The firm has also made and lost money by snapping up cryptocurrency tokens, though there’s less visibility into those numbers.

In a blog post published Friday morning, Ben Horowitz writes that “as the American leader in Venture Capital, the fate of new technology in the United States rests partly on our shoulders.” It’s the kind of statement certain to cause agita at rival firms, some of which have been around closer to 50 years, compared with the much younger a16z. Horowitz frames a16z’s mission as “ensuring that America wins the next 100 years of technology.”

Whether that happens remains to be seen. What’s certain is that Andreessen Horowitz has mastered the art of raising money — $15 billion this time — to fund a vision of American technological dominance that runs through Riyadh, Mar-a-Lago, and the Pentagon. That’s quite a pitch, and plainly, it works.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI research lab Anthropic continues to land sizable enterprise deals. Its latest entails bringing its large language models to a legacy German insurance giant.

Anthropic on Friday announced a deal with Munich, Germany-based global insurance conglomerate Allianz to bring “responsible AI” to the insurance industry. The parties declined to share financial terms of the deal.

The partnership is made up of three specific initiatives.

The first is making Claude Code, Anthropic’s AI-powered coding tool, available to all of Allianz’s employees. Anthropic and Allianz will also build custom AI agents for Allianz employees that can execute multistep workflows with a human in the loop.

This partnership also includes an AI system that logs all AI interactions to keep the AI transparent and ensure that information is readily available for regulatory or other needs.

“With this partnership, Allianz is taking a decisive step to address critical AI challenges in insurance,” Oliver Bäte, CEO of Allianz SE, said in the company’s press release. “Anthropic’s focus on safety and transparency complements our strong dedication to customer excellence and stakeholder trust. Together, we are building solutions that prioritize what matters most to our customers while setting new standards for innovation and resilience.”

This is just the latest enterprise deal Anthropic has landed in recent months.

In December, the company inked a $200 million deal to bring its AI models to data cloud company Snowflake and its customers. Shortly after, it announced a multi-year partnership with the consulting firm Accenture.

In October, it signed a deal with consulting firm Deloitte to bring its Claude chatbot to the firm’s 500,000 employees. That same month, Anthropic signed a deal with IBM to bring its AI models into the latter’s products.

The race for AI enterprise dominance is clearly on, and Anthropic appears to be winning — so far at least.

Anthropic holds 40% of enterprise AI market share, according to a December survey from Anthropic investor Menlo Ventures, and 54% of the market share for AI coding. Anthropic market share increased throughout last year. When Menlo’s original survey came out in July, the company held a 32% market share for overall enterprise LLM use.

Google launched its dedicated enterprise AI product, Gemini Enterprise, in October. At the time, the company touted that the product suite already had customers, including fintech Klarna, design software company Figma, and cruise line operator Virgin Voyages, among others.

OpenAI launched its enterprise version of ChatGPT, ChatGPT Enterprise, in 2023. Recently, the company reportedly expressed deep concern in an internal memo that Google Gemini’s success was starting to encroach on its business. Shortly after, the company released a report that said enterprise use of ChatGPT had surged 8x in the past year.

A recent TechCrunch investor survey found that enterprise-focused VCs overwhelmingly think that 2026 will be the year that enterprises start to see a meaningful return on their investment into AI products.

While Anthropic seems to be a clear favorite at the moment, this year will likely be telling of what the enterprise AI market — and its competitive landscape — will look like in the future.

            <h2>Stand-Up Comedy, All Joking Aside</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/01/is-this-thing-on-movie-review-bradley-cooper/685568/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For someone best known as an actor, Bradley Cooper’s core interest as a filmmaker is perhaps unsurprising. Thus far, he has been entirely consumed by examinations of performance—first digging into a pop musician’s stratospheric career climb in A Star Is Born, then wrestling with Leonard Bernstein’s desire to reimagine classical music in Maestro. Both movies were hefty pieces of entertainment, filled with love, death, and grand human experiences. His newest, the fetching dramedy Is This Thing On?, has all that heady, arty stuff too. But Cooper has now dropped the wildly high stakes of his previous stories, to focus on someone audiences may find more recognizable: a regular guy telling jokes.

Instead of concerts held in ancient cathedrals or sold-out stadiums, Is This Thing On? follows its protagonist to the Comedy Cellar, the famed New York City institution. There, a listless, middle-aged salaryman named Alex (played by Will Arnett) rediscovers himself as a stand-up comic. Based ever so loosely on the true story of a British performer who stumbled into a new life as a club fixture, Cooper’s film is still about the ways that art and art-making can invigorate the soul and lay bare its dark truths. Only now, those realizations are being mumbled by the gravel-voiced Alex to a small crowd at an open-mic night.

In some ways, I appreciate the scaled-back approach. Cinemas have been lacking for these kinds of movies of late: stories about grown-ups working through their feelings, navigating interpersonal relationships, and at no point picking up a gun, encountering a demon, or doing battle with a supervillain or serial killer. The tension of Is This Thing On? simply revolves around whether Alex will make some emotional progress while he tells his punch lines, and if doing so will help him heal his rift with his wife, Tess (Laura Dern). In an awards season filled with human suffering, the premise is a refreshing downshift.

The tone reminded me most of the work of Cameron Crowe, a former collaborator of Cooper’s. Cooper starred in Crowe’s Aloha, one of the director’s later and more misbegotten films. Cooper obviously longs for that era of storytelling to return—nobody could lob a sincere, big-feelings dramedy over the plate better than Crowe (Say Anything, Singles, and Jerry Maguire). Is This Thing On?, in its strongest moments, brushes against those heights. Yet the movie is too scattered, switching haphazardly between Alex’s journey as a stand-up and his efforts to rebuild his marriage.

The stand-up-comedy section of the movie simplifies some matters. Perhaps it’s implausible that Alex gets to stumble onstage at one of America’s most celebrated comedy clubs, but just roll with it, for the sake of cinema. Cooper uses the clubs’ brick-wall backdrop and claustrophobic vibes to his advantage, taking a setting that looks familiar to even the most casual comedy fan and turning it into a hostile proving ground for Alex’s darkest, weirdest thoughts. A handful of real-life comedians (none of whom are household names) essentially play themselves, and they nudge Alex to be more daring. Cooper uses these established performers sparingly, to present a more honed version of what Alex is stumbling toward: material that’s more self-deprecating and personal than observational or political, recalling the confessional mode of today’s most popular comics.

Cooper keeps the camera in a tight close-up on Arnett’s face every time he performs, embracing the harsh intimacy of the stand-up form; the choice can be both appealing and distressing. More important, he never lets Alex get too good at delivering jokes; the character rises from doing awkward and stilted five-minute sets to mediocre 10-minute ones, achieving the level of a competent hobbyist at best. Any movie about comedians might prefer to lean on some rags-to-riches narrative or, in the social-media era, a convenient plot shortcut about “going viral.” Is This Thing On? avoids all of those pitfalls, and the Comedy Cellar (and other venues that Alex eventually visits) is used simply as a place for the character to build up some interiority.

Alex’s search inward speaks to the other side of the film, the relationship drama. Alex and Tess begin the story having agreed to a divorce, before reckoning with what led to it—and whether it was the right decision. Dern does great, heartfelt work as a mom and a former Olympic volleyball player who feels taken for granted by Alex. But Cooper (and his co-screenwriters, Arnett and Mark Chappell) have made the breakup so light on drama that the consequences are a little lacking. Is This Thing On?, in essence, is about two adults realizing they’ve forgotten to have a few big conversations. I do commend Cooper’s willingness to try something more prosaic with this occasionally sweet little tale. At times, though, Alex’s career journey makes me miss the gifted protagonists of Cooper’s previous films—and their many crescendoing triumphs and failures.</div>

            <h2>Trump’s Unexpected Opportunity</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/01/regime-change-iran-protests-trump-opportunity/685567/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Marching alongside a column of protesters through the city of Borujerd in western Iran, a middle-aged woman appeared unperturbed by the blood streaming down her chin. “I am not afraid,” she called out in a video clip posted by Iran International. “I have been dead for 47 years.”

She spoke for many in the crowds of protesters now thronging Iran’s streets. As the Islamic Republic convulses with demonstrations across all 31 provinces, Iranians of all ages are catching a glimpse of national rebirth after nearly half a century of theocratic rule.

Periodic mass protests have marked Iranian life for nearly two decades—the Green Movement of 2009; the fuel protests of 2019; the Women, Life, Freedom uprising of 2022–23. Each wave was brutally repressed. But never before has the Islamic Republic been so weakened at home and so vulnerable to pressure from abroad. The possibility of overthrowing Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s regime is no longer theoretical.

Arash Azizi: Change may be coming to Iran

For President Trump, these protests present a historic opportunity to cement his legacy as the Ronald Reagan of his era. Reagan did not collapse the Soviet Union through military force. He did it by applying overwhelming economic, ideological, and proxy pressure from the outside—while supporting dissidents on the inside. Trump can do the same with the Islamic Republic.

Over the course of his two terms, Trump has attacked the regime’s foundations through robust sanctions, diplomatic pressure, and—by joining the final stage of Israeli strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities last June—military action. As a result, the Islamic Republic is weaker today than at any point since its founding, in 1979. Yet it would be foolhardy to believe that the regime’s decline is irreversible. The ayatollahs will not go quietly. They will resort to bloodshed against a mostly unarmed population, as they have since 2009. Trump is uniquely positioned to make the difference between the regime surviving or its joining the Soviet Union on what Reagan called the “ash heap of history.”

Trump’s established policy of maximum pressure—targeting Iran’s nuclear program, missile development, and regional terror proxies—now needs to be combined with maximum support for the protests. With millions in the streets, the objective of regime change is suddenly achievable, without the invasions and occupations that defined America’s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

How would this work? In the spirit of the Hippocratic oath, first do no harm. Trump should discipline his rhetoric, avoiding terms such as riots and stampedes that echo regime propaganda. And because he has already learned that the regime uses negotiations only to buy time and divide the West, he should flatly reject any pleas from Tehran to resume nuclear talks.

Trump has openly admired the Iranian people’s “enthusiasm to overturn that regime” and warned the ayatollahs that the United States remains “locked and loaded” if they resort to massacre. This strategic messaging matters. It reminds protesters that the regime is not omnipotent—especially after its poor performance in June’s 12-Day War with Israel and the U.S., and its failure to address Iran’s economic collapse and deepening water and environmental crises.

Trump can also highlight individual acts of bravery, naming protesters in interviews and speeches, and sharing videos on social media. The State Department’s Persian-language accounts are valuable amplifiers, but they are no substitute for presidential leadership.

At the same time, the administration must name, shame, and sanction human-rights violators at every level of the regime’s repressive apparatus. In particular, it should fully enforce sanctions authorized by the bipartisan MAHSA Act, passed after the murder of Mahsa Amini, which sparked the Women, Life, Freedom protests.

Iran’s energy sector—the regime’s financial lifeline—can and must be squeezed further. Because of the lack of sanctions enforcement for four years under the Biden administration, Iranian oil exports remain near 2 million barrels a day, far above the Trump administration’s stated goal of 100,000 barrels. The regime should not be permitted to sell oil illicitly to fund repression. Deploying the U.S. Navy to seize Iranian oil tankers—as the administration has already done with Venezuela—is necessary. Sanctioning Chinese banks facilitating these purchases is essential. Every dollar denied means fewer resources for the regime’s security forces.

With foreign journalists barred, social media is the protest movement’s lifeline. Predictably, the regime has imposed a nationwide internet blackout to isolate demonstrators and conceal atrocities. The United States should work with private-sector partners to ensure free and secure communications, flooding the country with Starlink terminals and expanding access to free VPNs. If Iranians cannot communicate, they cannot mobilize, coordinate, or expose the regime’s crimes.

Trump should also press U.S. allies to do more. The European Union has sanctioned individual Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps members but not the IRGC itself—the regime’s dark heart, enriched by Iran’s energy sector, ports, infrastructure, and banks. Western capitals should also reconsider allowing Iranian embassies to remain open despite clear evidence of regime-linked terror plots in Germany, the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Australia as well as the United States. These diplomatic ties should be severed.

Finally, Trump can hasten internal collapse by weakening the regime from within. He can offer incentives for defectors. He can authorize targeted cyber and covert operations against instruments of repression such as the Basij, cyber police, and morality police, as Israel demonstrated last June. He can conduct influence operations to deepen fractures among regime supporters losing faith. And if necessary, he can act in real time, striking security convoys moving to crush protests and denying the regime control over its own streets.

Tom Nichols: Trump’s ‘Operation Iranian Freedom’

None of this requires occupation or nation building. It requires precision intelligence, covert action, and close cooperation between the CIA and Israel’s Mossad—capabilities already proven inside Iran.

The overthrow of the Islamic Republic would rank among the most consequential foreign-policy achievements of the 21st century. A free Iran would transform the Middle East, dismantle the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism, and restore a proud, pro-American nation to its rightful place as a force for stability and prosperity.

Trump recently told The New York Times that the only constraint on his power is “my own morality, my own mind.” If so, he has a unique chance to act—but his window of opportunity is closing fast.

            <h2>How ICE Lost Its Guardrails</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/minneapolis-shooting-ice-dhs-guardrails/685565/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If the Department of Homeland Security’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties was still functioning as it did before Donald Trump returned to the presidency, Julie Plavsic and her former colleagues would have spent yesterday opening an investigation into the shooting death of Renee Nicole Good by an ICE officer in Minnesota. Although the DHS inspector general takes the lead on criminal investigations of officers, after an incident like this, CRCL’s job would have been to review policies, training, and oversight procedures to try to prevent anything like it from happening again. But today, the office is effectively dormant.

Plavsic was a senior policy adviser at CRCL. She and her colleagues were put on leave in March and officially dismissed from their positions two months later. The administration also closed two other offices with mandates to protect the public from misconduct—the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman and the Immigration Detention Ombudsman—saying the cuts were necessary to limit redundancy. Nonprofit groups sued, arguing that a department with more than 250,000 employees that interacts with 3 million to 4 million members of the public each day needed more oversight, not less. The offices reopened with a skeleton staff of inexperienced contractors who, former officials told me, are doing almost nothing. (DHS did not respond to my request for comment.)

Across the department, DHS has experienced considerable turnover since Trump returned to office, as supporters of his mass-deportation plans have replaced people with years of experience. “They have different priorities and they don’t care about safety and they don’t care about doing things right,” Plavsic told me. She retired after she was laid off. Since the Minneapolis shooting, she has been talking with former colleagues who no longer recognize the agency they worked for: “People are just saying, ‘I’m so glad to be unaffiliated with DHS.’”

The changes at DHS are part of a government-wide push by the administration away from transparency and accountability. Trump fired 17 inspectors general soon after he took office. He has neutered civil-rights offices across multiple departments. And he handed ICE the biggest cash infusion it’s ever seen, more than tripling the agency’s budget, without attaching any requirements for oversight. All the while, the president, his top advisers, and his public-affairs offices have pumped out rhetoric and imagery that celebrates the merciless, military-style pursuit of deportations. The overall message to employees, including those who carry weapons, is that anything goes.

The DHS oversight offices that Trump all but scrapped did not have enforcement powers, but their recommendations often led to significant policy changes. All three were created by Congress. CRCL investigated the use of whole-body restraints and sent rapid-response teams to investigate the Border Patrol’s practice of corralling people outdoors under bridges when it ran out of detention space. Staff from the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman made frequent visits to detention centers, identifying violations of the agency’s health and safety standards. The Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman handled more than 20,000 complaints a year from immigrants and their employers about the visa-application process.

Trump’s recent statements suggest that immigration officers are now free to act without fear of accountability. Video recordings of the Minneapolis shooting show Good telling the officer “I’m not mad at you,” then briefly moving her SUV toward him before turning away. The vehicle appears to clip him as he opens fire. But within hours of the incident, before investigators had reached any conclusions, Trump posted online that Good “ran over the ICE Officer.” Kristi Noem, the homeland-security secretary, accused Good of domestic terrorism, a label the administration has used to justify cracking down on political opponents. A DHS spokesperson blamed “rioters,” even though the recordings show no evidence of a riot. “It seems like the message is that the only repercussions are for not going far enough,” Claire Trickler-McNulty, who spent more than a decade in both nonpolitical and politically appointed positions at ICE and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, told me. She departed last January.

At least 11 people have been shot by immigration-enforcement officers since Trump returned to office, two of them just yesterday, in Portland, Oregon. ICE was involved in three shootings in 2023 and five the year before, according to an analysis by The New York Times. None of the officers who shot civilians in the past year has been disciplined, according to CBS News.

The leaders of the agencies that will investigate the shooting face their own controversies. The DHS’s inspector general, Joseph Cuffari, is one of the few IGs who survived Trump’s firings, but he’s been embroiled in scandals for years. Cuffari has been accused of, among other things, retaliating against his employees and failing to disclose during his confirmation hearings that he had been under investigation when he left a previous job at the Department of Justice. (Cuffari has called the accusations “baseless.”) The administration is blocking Minnesota police from the investigation into Good’s death, leaving it in the hands of Kash Patel’s FBI.

Former ICE officers I spoke with said that the Minneapolis shooting never should have happened, and that it seemed to stem, in part, from the overwhelming pressure the agency is working under. Jim Rielly, who spent 23 years at ICE, said the encounter looks problematic from the start. It begins with Good’s car in the path of an ICE vehicle. An officer gets out and rushes toward her, yelling at her to “get out of the fucking car” and trying to force open her car door. “I would have said, ‘Ma’am, please shut your car off and get out of the car,’” he told me, sounding bewildered. “It looks like she just panicked.”

Rielly acknowledged that Good failed to comply with the officer’s demands, but he said there was no reason to fire a weapon. ICE policy allows deadly force only when there is a “reasonable belief” of imminent death or bodily harm. The officer who shot Good, identified in multiple press reports as Jonathan Ross, could have simply stepped to the side to avoid being hit, Rielly said. Ross did so, but at the same time, he shot Good three times in the face. “If she wants to drive off, let her drive off,” Rielly said.

Ross had more than a decade of experience and was part of a unit trained to handle tactical arrests, but not traffic stops. Over the summer, he was dragged by a car and seriously injured while trying to arrest the driver. Rielly and others I interviewed said that law-enforcement officers who conduct traffic stops are trained never to hold on to a moving vehicle, as it appears Ross did in the first incident, or to shoot at one, as he did in this one. Rielly also said Ross should have known better than to stand in front of Good’s car. “That’s common sense and good police work,” one officer who recently retired told me. The agency’s policy dictates that officers “avoid intentionally and unreasonably placing themselves in positions in which they have no alternative to using deadly force.”

Since the Wednesday shooting, Rielly and his former colleagues in the Chicago field office have been discussing how some ICE employees—including those who are great at their desk jobs—aren’t well trained or confident enough to calmly interact with the public. Now that ICE is bringing on new recruits in droves while cutting training time, Rielly said he worries more incidents like the one in Minneapolis are inevitable. One former colleague texted him, “You should see the guys they’re hiring now.”</div>

            <h2>What a Fantasy Can Reveal About Real Life</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-09</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is an edition of the Books Briefing, our editors’ weekly guide to the best in books. Sign up for it here.

Someone once said something like “Literature is the lie that tells the truth”—although, appropriately enough, the origin of the phrase is uncertain. Straightforwardly, this means that a novel’s invented characters and plots can sometimes help us understand human nature better than factual recitations can. But many of my favorite stories raise the stakes; they revolve around a made-up character who, in turn, makes things up. This week, Erin Somers wrote in The Atlantic about six books that dwell in the “limitless realm of freedom” conjured by a person’s imagination. Lately, I’ve been indulging in books with protagonists who lie in ways that illuminate the truth about them.

First, here are five new stories from The Atlantic’s Books section:

On her list, Somers includes Shirley Jackson’s horror-inflected novel Hangasman—a book about a troubled girl who is constantly “retreating into imaginary worlds,” Somers writes, and who ends up seduced by “an odd apparition created by her own mind.” I recently read Jackson’s 1959 masterpiece, The Haunting of Hill House, and I was particularly compelled by its main character, Eleanor Vance. Near the opening of the novel, Eleanor is hired to help a scientist observe paranormal phenomena inside the mansion of the title. On her long drive there, she collages the images and landmarks she passes into her own fantasy life, imagining herself residing in a cottage guarded by oleander trees, stone lions, and a white cat. When she meets the rest of the Hill House crew, she presents this patchwork daydream as her real life.

The reader knows, however, that Eleanor has no home of her own; after years spent caring for her ailing mother, she occupies a cot in her sister’s house. Even the car she’s driven doesn’t entirely belong to her. As the happenings at Hill House begin to erode her sanity, the fabrication of her independent life also collapses, intensifying her humiliation. Jackson reveals more about Eleanor’s psychology through the shape of her lies, which are built over the loneliness and vulnerability in her life, than she does through glimpses of harsh reality.

If The Haunting of Hill House were merely about an evil domicile, one described as “arrogant and hating,” it wouldn’t be much more than a ghost story. Instead, it is about what happens when a fantasy falls apart, giving way to something darker. Eleanor only confesses her untruth once she’s brought to a breaking point, and she only lied in the first place because she had precious little else to live on. Her predicament made me think of the nameless narrator of Knut Hamsun’s 1890 modernist classic, Hunger, another character prone to fantasies and lies—who says, during his own confession, that “there were natures that fed on trifles and died from a harsh word.” Like him, Eleanor is deeply unhealthy and in many ways extreme. But anyone who has nurtured a daydream, or told a self-protective lie, can empathize with her, and learn something true about themselves.

These novels highlight the power—both good and bad—of unchecked fantasizing.

The Haçienda: How Not to Run a Club, by Peter Hook

The Haçienda in Manchester was a catalyst of the U.K. acid house scene in the late ’80s, and a prophecy foretold: “The haçienda must be built,” the Situationist poet Ivan Chtcheglov wrote in 1953. Heeding these cryptic words some three decades later, the audacious (and well-read) impresario Tony Wilson opened the Haçienda together with the circle of post-punk musicians and designers involved with his label, Factory Records. Their attempt to decipher Chtcheglov’s mystical phrase lasted 15 years. Hook, the bassist for New Order, served as a kind of player-coach at the Haçienda, helping manage its madcap affairs while his band became the club’s cash cow. In this memoir of misbegotten business administration, Hook returns to the storied nights out that changed British culture even as they threatened to bankrupt him—and worse. Beset by gangs and guns, the Haçienda faltered in the ’90s despite clever-sounding schemes such as replacing the club’s security with the gangsters themselves. This is a scrapbook of utopian folly, yes, but also an insider’s look at what was, for a time, the wildest workplace on Earth.  — Andrew Holter

In interviews, the company’s “chief concept officer,” Nicolas Jammet, paid lip service to “reevaluating and redefining fast food,” but I suspect that Sweetgreen was also “reevaluating and redefining” how to make money in a world that appeared poised to move on from buying what the company was trying to sell.

In this episode of Galaxy Brain, Charlie Warzel discusses the nightmare playing out on Elon Musk’s X: Grok, the platform’s embedded AI chatbot, is being used to generate and spread nonconsensual sexualized images—often through “undressing” prompts that turn harassment into a viral game. Warzel describes how what once lived on the internet’s fringes has been supercharged by X’s distribution machine. He explains how the silence and lack of urgency isn’t just another content-moderation failure; it’s a breakdown of basic human decency, a moment that signals what happens when platforms choose chaos over stewardship.

Then Charlie is joined by Mike Masnick, Alex Komoroske, and Zoe Weinberg to discuss a vision for a positive future of the internet. The trio helped write the “Resonant Computing Manifesto,” a framework for building technology that leaves people feeling nourished rather than hollow. They discuss how to combat engagement-maximizing products that hijack attention, erode agency, and creep people out through surveillance and manipulation. The conversation is both a diagnosis and a call to action: Stop only defending against the worst futures, and start articulating, designing, and demanding the kinds of digital spaces that make us more human.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Alex Komoroske: AI should not be your friend. If you think that AI is your friend, you are on the wrong track. AI should be a tool. It should be an extension of your agency. The fact that the first manifestation of large language models in a product happens to be a chatbot that pretends to be a human … it’s like the aliens in Contact who, you know, present themselves as her grandparents or whatever, so that she can make sense of it.

It’s like—it’s just a weird thing. Perfect crime. I think we’re going to look back on it and think of chatbots as an embarrassing party trick.

Charlie Warzel: Welcome to Galaxy Brain. I’m Charlie Warzel. Initially, I wanted to start something out for the new year where I wanted to just talk about some things that I’ve been paying attention to every week, and give a bullet-pointed list of stuff that I think you should pay attention to. Stuff I’m covering, reporting on, et cetera, before we get into our conversation today. But today, I really only have one thing, and it has been top of mind for little less than a week. And it is something that I can’t stop thinking about and that frankly I find extremely disturbing. And I’m mad about it, honestly. To ditch the sober-journalist part, it’s infuriating. And this is what’s going on on Elon Musk’s X app.

I don’t know if you’ve heard about this, but Elon Musk’s AI chatbot, Grok, has been used to create just a slew of nonconsensual sexualized images of people, including people who look to be minors. This has been called a, quote, “mass-undressing spree.” And essentially what has happened is: A couple of weeks ago, some content creators who create adult content on places like OnlyFans used Grok’s app, which is infused inside of the X platform. You can just @Grok and ask it to, prompt it to do something. And the chatbot will, you know, generate whatever. It will make a meme for you, a photo, it will translate text. It will, you know, basically do anything like a normal chatbot would do, but it’s inside of X’s app. And, so some of these content creators said, Put me in a bikini. They were asking for this, and Grok did it. And a bunch of trolls essentially took notice of this and then started prompting Grok to put tons of different people in these compromising situations. On communities and different forums across the internet, people are trying to game the chatbot to try to get it to push the boundaries further and further and further. They’re prompting it to do things like edit an image of a woman to, quote, “Show a cellophane bikini with white donut glaze.” Really absolutely horrific and disgusting things that are these workarounds to get it to create sexualized images.

This has been happening for a long time online. There’s always been, since these AI tools have come out, problems with nonconsensual imagery being generated. There are lots of so-called “nudify” apps, right, that take regular dressed photos of people and undress them. And there are communities that share these as revenge porn and use them to harass and intimidate women and all kinds of vulnerable people. And this has been a problem.

People are trying to figure out the right ways to put guardrails up to stop this—to make sure that these communities get shut down, that they don’t continue to prompt these bots to do this, trying to get these tools to stop doing this. And a lot of this has been happening in these small backwater parts of the internet, and it does bubble up to the surface. But what’s changed here with X and Grok is that Grok is, as I said earlier: It’s baked into the platform. And so what has essentially happened is that X—xAI, Elon Musk—they have created a distribution method, and linked it with a creation method, and basically allowed for the viral distribution of these nonconsensual sexual images. And it has become, in the way that it does in places like 4chan and other backwater parts of the internet, it’s become a meme in this community. And people have decided that they are going to intimidate people and generate these images out in public.

And so what you have is publications posting photos of celebrities, and then a bunch of people, you know, in the comments saying: “@Grok undress this person.” “@Grok, put them into bikini.” “@Grok, put them in a swastika bikini.” “@Grok, put them in a swastika bikini doing a Roman salute.” And then you have a photo of a celebrity, undressed without their consent, in a Nazi uniform, giving a Nazi salute.

This is stuff that I have seen all across the platform. Not going into strange backwater areas of it—just looking directly at it. So this is out there. Something I noticed earlier this week—we’re recording this on Wednesday—was there was a photo of the Swedish deputy prime minister at a podium, giving a talk. And a bunch of people were asking Grok, prompting Grok to put her in a bikini, et cetera.

X and the people who work there have issued a statement saying that they’re working on the guardrails for this system. This is against their community standards, and they will punish the people who are involved here. But that doesn’t really seem to be happening. Just yesterday I was looking around, and people who are asking Grok to put women in compromising photos have blue checks next to their name, which means they asked the company for a verified badge. Those people are still on the platform as of this time when I’m talking to you.

So I reached out to Nikita Bier on his personal email. He’s the head of product at X. And I asked as a journalist, as a human: How someone can in good conscience work for a company that’s willing to tolerate this type of thing? Like, what’s the rationale? Who’s being served? How can you tolerate your product doing this? Do you imagine you’ll be able to get this under control with the appropriate guardrails? And if not, how can you sign your name to this stuff? How is this allowed to be in the world? They did not respond. They forwarded me to their comms lead, and I asked the same questions of them, and they never responded back to me. I have also asked Apple and Google similar questions. How can they allow an app like this on their app store? And they also have not gotten back to me.

The lack of response to this from the people who are the stewards of this platform, and the people who can exert pressure on this—including X employees or investors, or Elon Musk himself, who has made jokes about the @Grok bikini-photo stuff on the platform over the past week.

The lack of apologizing. The lack of urgency in trying to fix this. The lack of really seeming, from my perspective, to care about this, I think, feels a bit like crossing some kind of Rubicon. This is not a standard content-moderation issue. This is not a bunch of people trying to scold for something that is a part of some kind of ideology. This is basic human decency: That we shouldn’t have tools that can very easily create viral content of women and children being undressed against their will. Feels like the lowest possible bar, and yet the silence is—it just speaks volumes of what these platforms have become and what their stewards seem to think.

I would just ask of truly anyone who works at these platforms: How do you sleep at night with this? The silence from X, from employees there who we’ve tried to contact just to get some basic understanding of what they’re doing and how this can be allowed. And what’s happening on the platform, because the platform is not taking enough action to stop this, because it’s still allowing this undressing meme to go forward. What’s happened is: A culture has evolved here. And that culture is one of harassment and intimidation. And it feels like the people who are doing this know that no one’s going to stop them. They’re doing this out in the open. They’re doing it proudly. They’re doing it gleefully.

Something has to change here. I’ve been covering these platforms for 15-plus years, and I’ve watched different people in these platforms struggle with moderation issues in good faith, in bad faith. I’ve watched it devolve into this idea of politics and ideology. I’ve watched people pledge to do things, and then give up on those things.

It ebbs, it flows. The internet is chaos. I get it. But this is just different. This is a standard of human decency and social fabric and civic integrity that you can’t—you can’t punt on it. You either choose to have rules and order of some kind of a very base level, or you just—it does become full anarchy and chaos. And it seems to be that’s the direction where they want to go.

So if you work at X, if you’re an investor, if you’re somebody who can exert any influence in this situation, I would a) love to hear from you. And also I would ask: Is this okay? Is this what you want the legacy to be? Sorry for getting on a soapbox there, but I think it’s a massive, massive story. And one that, again—I think if this is allowed to just be the way that the internet is, then we lose something pretty fundamental.

So anyhow, it’s a tough way to segue there, but today’s conversation is actually the opposite of all of this. I do a lot of tech criticism. Do a lot of really sort of, you know, aggressive reporting, trying to hold tech companies to account. And that means looking at a lot of awful things and talking about a lot of awful things. But today’s podcast is about something great, something that’s actually hopeful that’s being built. It’s about a group of technologists who’ve come together with a different vision for the internet: a positive vision for the internet, something that they are trying to build that can sort of lead to positive outcomes and people living their best lives.

And so this project is called the “Resonant Computing Manifesto.” Basic top-line idea of it is that technology should bring out the best in humanity. It should be something that allows people to flourish. And they have five core principles here, that are essentially meant to combat the hyperscalers and extraction of what we know as the current algorithmic internet that we all live on.

And to talk about that, I’ve brought on Zoe Weinberg, Mike Masnick, Alex Komoroske. They are three of the writers of the “Resonant Computing Manifesto.” And I had them on to talk about why they came up with all this, and what, if anything, we can do to change the internet in 2026.

Warzel: All right: Zoe, Alex, Mike. Welcome to Galaxy Brain.

Warzel: You all put forward something that I actually came across very recently. Often my timeline is a mess of the horrors of the world. The terrible things, the doomscroll. And this kind of stopped me in my tracks, because frankly, it wasn’t doomscrolly at all.

And when I clicked on it, I began to feel this very strange emotion I’m not used to feeling, which is hope. And/or, I agree. And I agree, and it doesn’t make me furious. And so what you guys have done in part, with a group of other people, is come up with something called the “Resonant Computing Manifesto.”

And it is based off of this idea of resonance. And when you guys put this out—and I want you guys to describe all of this—but when you put it out, you said that you were hoping this was going to be the beginning of a conversation. A process about getting people to realize technology should work for us, and not just for the people at the very top, the people behind [Donald] Trump on the inauguration dais, that sort of thing.

And so, in this world of mergers and acquisitions and also artificial intelligence and all that jazz, I wanted to start the conversation off with a definition of what resonant technology is and what it means. And I’ll bring that up to either all of you or one of you.

But what is resonant technology? What does it mean to you?

Alex Komoroske: So to me, that resonant computing. There’s a difference between things that are hollow—leave you feeling regret. And things that are resonant—leave you feeling nourished. And they’re superficially very similar in the moment. And it’s not until afterwards, or until you think through it, or let it kind of diffuse through you, that you realize the difference between the two.

And I think that technology amplifies whatever you apply it to. And now with large language models that are taking what tech can do and making it go even further than before, it’s more important than ever before to make sure the stuff that we’re applying technology and computing to is resonant.

And I think we are so used to not having a word for this. And we can tell that something is off in slop or things that are just outrage bait or what have you. And social networks, but we don’t know how to describe it. And just having a term for that: the kind of stuff that you like.

And then also the more that you think about it, the closer you look, the more you like it. Does that capture it?

Masnick: Yeah, pretty much. I mean, we spent a lot of time trying to come up with the term.

Komoroske: And you wanted something that was ownable, that was distinctive, that wasn’t just a thing that would fade into nothing.

Zoe Weinberg: There’s a lot of terms out there that now have a lot of baggage. Even something that sounds kind of innocuous—responsible tech—I think now comes laden for a lot of people with a bunch of associations or different movements of people, whether it’s corporate or grassroots or otherwise.

And so, you know, we were trying to move beyond that a little bit in the choice of the word resonance.

Warzel: Yeah. There is also like—there’s an onomatopoeia to it. There’s sort of, this is what it sounds like. You have resonance there. And also there is something a little bit, the word that comes to mind is almost monkish.

Like, a monastery type. There’s something that’s very, it’s … resonance is not, like, a capitalistic word. It is a word that signifies something much different to me. Like sort of sacred. You know?

Komoroske: Yeah. It’s balance, pureness. tThere’s something about it that feels very whole, maybe.

Warzel: And at the top of the manifesto, there’s this line that is sort of offset there. A pull quote, if you will. Says: “There’s a feeling you get in the presence of beautiful buildings, bustling courtyards. A sense that these spaces are inviting you to slow down, deepen your attention, and be a bit more human. What if our software could do the same?”

That was the thing that struck me there. When did you guys see a sort of architectural element to this? Like, an inspiration from things that we see and experience in meatspace, so to speak, in the world?

Komoroske: We had the word resonance, I think, actually came before we …so, I’m a big fan of Christopher Alexander. He lived a few blocks away from me. And, you know, a big fan of The Timeless Way of Building and a few other books.

And so we had various formulations of it, that try to key off of that frame or idea. I don’t think he ever calls it resonance in the book, in his actual book. But, you know, it’s a word that other people—maybe he might offer it as one of the potential names. He calls it aliveness and wholeness and other things.

But so, it was always in the mix of the kind of vibe that we were trying to capture. And then we decided to lean into resonance and introduce it via this architectural lens. And actually, that addition at the top was a late addition, because it starts off talking about resonance kind of indirectly and it pivots into this architectural frame.

And someone was like, What? I thought you were talking about technology. We said, Okay, let’s put a little teaser about the architectural connection up at the top, to help connect with the way the middle of it is going, so you don’t get confused.

Weinberg: I think there’s something also powerful about writing and thinking about software, which exists in a digital plane—that is, not a physical space—that feels like it’s kind of in the ether and a little bit untouchable. And then trying to ground that in a very human reality, which is in fact tied to place and space and where we spend time.

And maybe drawing some insights from those physical realities into the way in which we build digital spaces.

Komoroske: Christopher Alexander, when you read some of his work and, we all know that feeling, we can all imagine the situations that we’ve been in, the environments where we feel that resonance. And there’s something very, I don’t think we ever think about it in the digital world. Because you have to be, when you’re in it, in the physical world. It’s impossible to ignore it when when you’re in it.

And there’s always point. Let’s—why don’t we ask the question, why do digital experiences not feel the same way? They absolutely could. You know.

Weinberg: And I think, you know, what is the feng shui for software? It’s maybe a way of thinking about it. But I think that goes much deeper than UX and UI-design principles.

It’s much more about: What is the experience as a user, and as a human, interacting with a tool over repeated periods of time?

Warzel: Well, and I think too, a lot of—at least what I reach for in my work, which a lot of it is, critiques of, you know, big-tech platforms and such. A long time ago, I found the word architecture—the “architecture of these platforms”—as just being extremely helpful to communicate some of this stuff.

I think there is a way for people who, you know, are just using these platforms to get from A to B. Or, you know, on the toilet at a moment of just, I’ve just gotta get away from the kids, or whatever it is. If you’re not thinking with the critical lens—which, there’s no judgment there—about these platforms, you might just sort of think this is a neutral thing. Or this is a thing that just does a thing, and, you know, whatever. And I think that, you know, architecture—this idea that there are designs, there is an intentionality to this algorithm or this layout or whatever choice that a platform has made that leads to these outcomes—that leads you to post more incendiary things, or whatnot. And I think that architecture there is so helpful to let people see like: no, no, no. In the same way that, you know, these arches are the way they are. This stained-glass window does this, to give this vibe. So is putting the “What are you thinking?” bar right here, or whatever. The poke icon wherever.

Komoroske: So I think that’s also about, with connection to architecture, that’s even stronger there. I think of traditionally, architecture is, like, this designed-top-down cathedral. Like, the designer’s intent. And one of the things that Christopher Alexander later did was this bottoms-up emergent of: How is this space actually used and modified? How does it come alive?

And I think that’s one of the reasons architecture, in his sense, I think really nails it. Because a lot of these experiences, like a bunch of people, when you build Facebook 10 years ago, were trying to connect the world. That’s a prosocial outcome. It’s prosocial in the first order. The second-order implications, turns out, oh, actually are not prosocial.

And so you get these emergent characteristics that are not what anyone intended going in, necessarily. And still, and yet, they emerge out of the actual usage of how different people react off each other, and how the incentives kind of bounce off each other. And so I think architecture hits that emergent case too.

Warzel: Mm-hmm. So, Mike, I’ll throw this to you. How did this come about? What is the behind-the-scenes process here? I’ve heard, you know, “We’re using these words, and we’re taking ’em for a spin in the world for two weeks.” This does not sound like something that you guys wrote last weekend and put up on the thing.

There’s a lot of people behind it who aren’t on this call here. Or this podcast here, I should say, not a call. How did this come about?

Masnick: Yeah, I mean a lot of this is Alex, and so I’m curious about his version of this. But in my case: I mean, I met Alex about a year ago. Almost exactly a year ago at some event.

And we got to talking, and it was a good conversation. It was a resonant conversation, where I sort of came out of it saying, Oh wow, there are people thinking through these things and having interesting conversations. And then we kept talking and he said, “You know, I’ve been having this same conversation with a group of different people. And I thought I might just pull them all together, and we’ll get into a Signal chat, and we’ll have a Google Meet call every couple weeks. And we will try to figure out what do we all—we’re all having this feeling, what do we do about it?”

And then we did that for almost a year. I mean, it’s kind of incredible. And where we would just sort of be chatting in the group chat and occasionally having a call and sort of talking through these ideas, and working on it. And trying to figure out even what we were going to do with it.

Weinberg: I definitely think the manifesto emerged very organically.

Weinberg: To the point that I would say in the first couple months of us meeting, Charlie, like I was like: Okay. It’s really fun chit-chatting with these interesting people that Alex has brought together, but let’s get to brass tacks. Is this going anywhere? And I have to say, there was a part of me that wanted to end those calls being: Okay guys, what’s our agenda? Where are we going? What are the outputs? How are they met? Whatever. And I actually think, Alex, you did a really great job of kind of keeping people from jumping to that sort of action-item mode too early.

And so, from my perspective, we did not get together to write a manifesto. We got together to talk about these issues. And then, very naturally, you know, out of those conversations came a set of ideas and principles, and sort of theses. That then felt like we should put them out in the world.

Warzel: Did this feel like—the choice of the word manifesto and the choice to just do this—does this feel a little bit, too, like a response to we’re in a manifesto-heavy moment here? It feels like there are a lot. Whether we’re talking like the Marc Andreessens of the world or, if you pay taxes in San Francisco, you need to write a manifesto to get your garbage picked up or something.

But is this a response in the same way? Or is it meant to be seen as, in some senses, in dialogue with some of these other things that are coming out there?

Komoroske: I think to some degree, I don’t know, actually. I can’t remember how we ever discussed if it should be a manifesto.

We just knew that there should be something that we could point people at, that kind of distilled some of the conversations and ideas that we were having. And I think I’ve seen a bunch of manifestos in the tech industry, that sometimes I look at and go, Oh my God, is that the tech industry that I’m a part of?

That doesn’t seem at all like—that seems so cynical or so close-minded about the sort of broader humanistic impacts that technology might have. And so, I think the choice of doing something that other people have, you know … this manifesto was deliberately kind of humble. It says: We don’t have all the answers; just here’s a few questions that seem relevant to us.

That was a very important stylistic choice. Manifestos are not typically humble. But we aimed for that because we wanted to almost counter-position to some of the ones that say, This is definitely the right way. And everyone should think about it this way.

Masnick: Yeah, I almost think I’ve been using that as a joke to other people. Where it’s, This is the most humble manifesto you’ll ever see.

Which is not something—you know, you don’t normally see those two words together. You don’t think of as a manifesto as being humble. But, I mean, this was definitely a part of the conversation that we had. Which is: We want to be explicit that we don’t have all the answers, and that this is the start of a conversation. Not, you know, putting an exclamation point on a philosophy or something.

Weinberg: I do think, Charlie, you’re touching on something noteworthy here. Which is, and I’ll speak only for myself, but I’ve been observing in the last couple years as it has felt to me like the ideological landscape of the discussion in Silicon Valley has been really defined by these extremes.

And on one end, it’s like the accelerationist kind of techno-optimism way of seeing the world. And on the other side, on the other kind of far extreme, it is like existential and catastrophic risk and ways that, you know, we must prevent that. And I know a lot of people who don’t feel like they really belong in either of those camps, and actually don’t even really think that the optimist/pessimist spectrum is like the right way to think about it.

And so from my own perspective, part of what I have hoped that the “Resonant Computing Manifesto” will accomplish is, like, helping to establish some values and some north stars that are kind of on a different plane from that conversation. That also feels like there can be both. You can both be optimistic about the ways things might develop, and also concerned about the places we’ve come from. And that those things can coexist, and that is like the beauty and complexity of the technological moment we’re in.

Masnick: Yeah, totally. Because, you know, I had written something in response to Andreessen’s manifesto, and I never really thought of this as like a response.

Warzel: Is it the “build one” or the “techno-optimist” manifesto?

Masnick: There’s been many. Yeah, that’s true. Fair enough. But, you know, I’ve always considered myself, and I’ve been accused of being, a techno optimist. Like, to a fault. And like, I am optimistic about technology. But to me, his manifesto really, you know, rubbed me the wrong way. Because I was like, This isn’t optimism. What he was presenting was not an optimistic viewpoint.

It was a very dystopian, very scary viewpoint. And so soon after it came out, I had written a response, like, “That’s not optimism that you’re talking about.” And there, and if you really believe in this—this vision of like a good, better world from technology—then you should also be willing to recognize the challenges that come with that.

Because if you don’t acknowledge that, and don’t seek to—if we’re building these new technologies—understand what kinds of damages and harms they might create, then the end result is inevitably going to be worse. Because something terrible is going to happen. And then, you know, the politicians will come in and make everything else that you want to do impossible.

It’s just like: Think this through. Like a couple steps ahead.

Komoroske: And so technology is powerful. Like, we should be careful with that power, and we should use it for good. And I think it is incumbent—you know, it’s a good thing for people to do, to use technology for good. Like, you shouldn’t sit there and not use it.

You should use it, and you should be aware of the second-order implications and the third-order implications. And not say, “Well, who could have seen this inevitable outcome?” You know, so much in the tech industry is about optimizing. It’s about driving the number up. It’s about thinking, not necessarily thinking about second-order implications.

I, at some point, had somebody tell me, You know, anything that can’t be understood via computer science is either unknowable or unimportant. Which is an idea that, you know, pervades some parts of Silicon Valley. And I think this combination of the humanistic side and the technology side into the synthesis, I think is where a lot of value for society is created. And you have to have them in balance. You have to be in conversation with each other.

Warzel: Well, that’s definitely speaking my language, for sure. That’s like Charlie bait right here. But I want to define a little of this. I want to actually define it, but first I want to define it via its opposite.

What’s the opposite of resonance here? How would you describe the current software dynamic? I’ll let anyone who wants to take that. But maybe all of you, honestly.

Komoroske: And to me it’s just, I think, most of the technology, the tech experience and consumer world is hollow. In that you wake up the next day and go, God, why did I do that?

Or you use the thing. To me, if you use a tool and then after you are sober, after you’ve sort of come down from it, because sometimes you’ll be really hopped up on the thing. So maybe a week later, or the next day, would you proudly recommend it to somebody you care about? And if not, then it’s probably not resonant.

And you know, at some point, somebody—I was having this debate with somebody at Meta many years ago—they said, Oh, Alex, despite what people say, our numbers are very clear. People love doomscrolling. It’s like, that’s not love. That’s right. Like that’s a … what are you talking about?

So I think trying to just make number go up, and increase engagement or what have you, is what creates hollow experiences. And that tends to happen when you have, hypercentralized, hyperscale products. One of the reasons that happens inevitably is if you have five hyperscale products that are all consumer, and trying to get as many minutes of your waking day, there’s only so many waking minutes of people’s time in a given day. And so you naturally kind of have to marginally push. You know, try to figure out the thing that’s going to be more engaging than the other thing. And that emerges, I think, fundamentally when you have these hyperscale products—which is what emerges when you have massive centralization.

And all these things are of a piece, and lead to these. Hollow. Yeah.

Masnick: I think there’s a concept that has come up a few times in the conversations, in the various meetings that we had. And I don’t remember if it originated from you, Alex, or from someone else. But like, the difference between what you want and what you want to want, which may take a second. You think through, and you begin to like, Oh, right.

Like, there is this belief within certain companies that revealed preference is law. “If people love doomscrolling, ’cause they keep doing it, then we’re just giving them what they want.” Like, shut up. Like, you know, anyone who complains about that is just wrong. But then, as Alex said, it leaves you feeling terrible.

You have a hangover from it later. Whereas, if there’s this intentionality—of like, No, this is what I really want; I get nourishment out of it; I get value out of it in a real way—that lives on. That stays with me; that lingers. That’s different. And there’s that intentionality. As opposed to like, the problem with Oh, people love to doomscroll.

It’s, yeah. Because you’re sort of manipulating people into it. And people feel that they might not be able to explain it clearly. But like, it just feels like someone’s twisting the knobs behind the scenes, and I have no control over it. Right. And I think that feeling is what pervades; it’s the opposite of resonant computing.

Weinberg: I also think the opposite can be defined as any technology that’s ultimately undermining human agency. And so that can be things that are attention, you know, engagement-maximizing. And so it removes your agency in that sense. ’Cause you’re not actually able to express what you really want.

But also all the kind of micro ways in which we end up feeling deeply surveilled by the technology that we use. And I think all of us have probably had moments where we feel deeply creeped out by our tools. And I think, to me, that is the opposite of resonance also. So part of it’s about attention and engagement. And then part of it also is about, you know, having some individual autonomy in how you make decisions, where your data lives, who has access to it. And all of that we’ve tried to kind of embed into this piece.

Warzel: So you all write in the manifesto—and I’m going to quote you guys here, back to you at length. Hopefully it’s not cringey because it is written, you know, with a committee of people; I hate when people read my own stuff back to me.

But you all say: “For decades, technology has required standardized solutions to complex human problems. In order to scale software, you have to build for the average user, sanding away the edge cases. In many ways, this is why our digital world has come to resemble the sterile, deadening architecture that Alexander”—mentioned by you guys before—“has spent his career pushing back against. This is where AI provides a missing puzzle piece. Software can respond fluidly to the context and particularity of each human at scale. One size fits all is no longer a technological or economic necessity.”

This is the one part where I was tripped up while reading, and not in the “I am reflexively against AI” kind of way. But because personalization, I feel, in my own experience a lot of times, can be discordant with that idea of resonance.

I think personalization can be great. I think it’s actually, you know, underutilized or -realized in the tech space. But when I look around at the algorithmic world that we’re living in, sometimes it can feel like optimization. Which was, you know, the word there—like personalization and optimization comingle together.

Yeah. To become part of the problem and not the solution. So I was curious how you all would respond or think about that.

Komoroske: I think that the key thing there, I agree with that. What is the angle of the thing that is personalizing itself for you? Is it the tool, is it like trying to figure out how to fit exactly into the crevices of your brain? To get you to do something that is … you know, to click the ads or whatever?

Or does it feel like an outgrowth of your agency? Like, one way I talked about it is: Large language models can write infinite software. They can write little bits of software on demand, which has the potential to revolutionize what software can do for humanity. Today, software feels like a thing.

You go to the big-box store, and you pick which one of the three beige boxes, all of which suck, are you going to purchase. And instead, what if software felt like something that grew in your own personal garden? It was something that nourished you and felt like it aligned with your interest naturally and intrinsically, because it was an extension of your agency and intention?

And I think that kind of personalization—where it doesn’t feel like something else manipulating you, but it feels like something that is an extension of you and your agency and intention—I think is a very different kind of thing. We’re just not familiar with that kind, because it doesn’t exist currently.

Warzel: I was going to ask Alex just to push—not push back on it, but further follow up on that. Is there anything that exists like that, you think? A piece of software that feels garden grown versus a big-box store?

Komoroske: The one that keeps me coming back in my history is like—I think looking back at the early days of the web, actually, is where you had a bunch of these interesting bottoms-up kind of things.

HyperCard is my favorite one from many, many, many years ago. Have you heard of HyperCard? It’s like this thing that allowed you to make little stacks of cards. And you could have images on them; you could click between them, and you could program them to be like slideshows. Or like stacks of different things. And interlink.

The original game Myst, that was really popular, was actually implemented as a HyperCard stack back in the day. And so HyperCard, to me, is an example of one of these tools that allows you a freeform thing, that allows you to create this situated, very personalized software. You could argue that spreadsheets also have this kind of dynamic, because it’s an open substrate that allows you to express lots of different logic and build up very complex worlds inside of itself.

It’s pretty intimidating, but it is something that gives you that kind of ability to create meaning and behavior, inside of that substrate.

Masnick: Yeah. The thing I’ll say, to that point—and you’re not the only one who has sort of stopped on that line. And a few people have called it out and raised questions about it. And I think it’s because the idea of personalization, to date, has generally really been optimization. And it’s been optimization for the company’s interest, as opposed to the user’s interest. I think the real personalization is when it’s directly in your interest—and it’s doing something for you and not the company.

In the end, it has to be the user who has the agency, who has the control. Who says, This is what I want; this is what I want to see. And having it match that.

Komoroske: Charlie, I’ve also made a bunch of little tools. You know, a bunch of—if you’re technical, you can build these little bespoke bits of software now that fit perfectly to your workflow with large language models.

And that’s the kind of thing that a few of us can see a glimpse of this today, who are at the forefront and able to use Claude code and in the terminal to make these things. And I think in the not-too-distant future, large language models would, put on the proper substrate, will allow basically everyone on Earth to have that same kind of experience, that feels like an extension of their agency.

And I think that’s what some of us are seeing. And that’s why it’s in that essay. And that people who haven’t seen that yet are like, Excuse me, what? Like, you know, because they haven’t experienced it yet, they can’t see what’s coming.

Weinberg: Yeah; I do think that that sentence itself in many ways is a little bit forward looking. And so, as Alex said, there’s glimpses of it.

But I think the urgency and feeling like we needed to write about this is that it feels, I think to many of us, like the introduction of AI into all of our workflows gives us this kind of amazing opportunity. And crossroads. To either build along the lines of the paradigm of big tech and platforms and everything we’ve seen in the last, you know, couple decades—or we can try to shift into this new paradigm that is about personalization that, as Mike said, is not extrinsic from a third party, But something that you are building intrinsically yourself.

Warzel: I want to go through, actually, some of these starting principles. You all have five of them

that are these guiding lights. And I’d love to just sort of rapid-fire go through them, have whoever wants to explain just a little bit about how you’re thinking of them. Or how they, you know, might work to give a framework or a set of ethics or values to whatever is going to come out of this manifesto.

Right. And how they could be incorporated. And so the first one here is “private.” Which it says: In the, in the era of AI, whoever controls the context holds the power. Data often involves multiple stakeholders, and people in the service stewards of their own context, determining how it’s used.

We’ve talked a little around that. What “private” makes me think of, in a world of AI, is like: Our consumer-AI tools look the way that they do now because they’re built by the people who have spent—not totally, but when you think about like X, Google, Meta—the people who have spent the last, you know, 10, 15, 20 years collecting information on people.

So you are going to build a product that makes having that information more valuable to the end use. That’s part of the architecture there. But talk to me about how you see that first principle. Yeah. Zoe, do you want to take that one?

Weinberg: We debated this word a lot, and even the concept of privacy.

Komoroske: Yeah. We debated all these words.

Weinberg: Yeah, that’s true. But, you know, I think this one in particular is tricky, because we really went back and forth on—is it privacy that we feel like is the key value here? Or is it really about control, and putting the user in the driver’s seat?

And so it’s about, you know, consent. Rather than it is about just, like—and I think I speak for all of us. Like, I don’t think any of us are privacy maximalist. There are lots of, you know, amazing, wonderful prosocial reasons that you don’t always want to keep information private. And actually sharing information can be very helpful. And all those things.

And so, I guess, there’s a different way that we could have framed this that was a little bit more about control, or about agency, or whatever. But I think there is something meaningful about privacy as a value, and the notion. And the point of having privacy in the digital world is to be able to have a rich interior life. And that is, in many ways, very central to the experience of being human. And that’s why privacy is an individual value. It’s also a societal value. And I think that that was sort of important to capture in the mix here.

Komoroske: What we try to do with all these words is the word themselves.

We want to communicate on its own. And, if anything, go a little bit too hard in the direction it’s going. And because we actually soften the statement a fair bit about data stewardship. Because, you know, various thoughtful people pointed out that, well, actually data is owned, co-owned by the different parties. And in some cases you do want to give it up for an advantage, and whatever.

Mm-hmm. But we wanted the word to be private. Like, we wanted to be obvious when you have these five words. Like you could apply it to a product and say, “Does this fit, or does this not?” And not have little, like, soft, nuanced words for some of this. So we try to add the nuance in the sentence after the key word.

Warzel: Well, to that point, Alex: “dedicated.” You guys define it as: “Software should work exclusively for you, ensuring contextual integrity where data use aligns with expectations. You must be able to trust that there are no hidden agendas, conflicting interests.” Why’d you use the word dedicated? Like what do you mean exactly?

Komoroske: I wanted something that was, again, about: It’s an extension of your agency. It is not a conflict of interest, because it is in your interest. And “contextual integrity” actually is a meaningful phrase, because this is Helen Nissenbaum’s concept of contextual integrity. Which is, to my mind, the gold standard of what people mean when they think of privacy.

And it means: Your data is being used in line with your interests and expectations. So it’s aligned. It’s not being used against you, and it’s being used in ways that you understand or could be—or would not be surprised by if you were to understand it. And so that we wanted to get the words contextual integrity in there to get across this alignment with your interests and expectations.

Masnick: I think that’s a really important concept. You know, one of the discussions that comes up when talking about privacy is this idea that privacy is like a thing. And to me it’s always been a set of trade-offs. And the thing that really seems to upset people is when their data is being used in ways that they don’t understand, for purposes that they don’t understand.

And that is the world that we often live in, in the digital context. It’s like we know we’re giving up some data for some benefit, and neither side of that is fully understood by the users. We don’t know quite how much data we’re giving up. And we’re not quite sure for what purpose. And we’re getting some benefit, but we can’t judge whether or not that trade-off is worth it.

Warzel: I think about this all the time in terms of the “terms of service” agreement. I try to tell people, with that: Imagine that on the other side of the button that you were about to click is the most expensive-looking boardroom that you’ve ever seen in your life. With a whole bunch of people who make more in a week than you do in a year.

All in fancy suits. You know, like perfectly coiffed. And they’re just standing there, being like you versus them, you know? That’s what that is. It’s not a fair fight. You are agreeing to things. Yeah. Anyway, I want to keep running through this, though, because I want to get to ask a couple more questions here.

But the third of the five principles is “plural.” Which is: No single entity should control that distributed power. Interoperability. That seems relatively obvious. But, I mean, is this the idea of the decentralized, Bluesky sort of, you know, protocol-type thing? Being able to port your information to that, just being like a central tenant?

Masnick: Obviously that’s a big tenant for me.

Warzel: Yeah, I was going to say, I spent a lot. And you were involved with Bluesky, correct?

Masnick: Yes, yes. I’m on the board of Bluesky. But I also wrote the “Protocols not Platforms” paper that sort of was part of the inspiration for Bluesky. So, that kind of thinking—I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about that thing. And so I did. But I do think it’s important, not just in the social context—it’s important across the board. And this idea of, you know, why I’ve always thought that Bluesky or just a protocol-decentralized system is so important is this idea that we want to avoid giant centralized systems that will continually manipulate things. And so making sure that we don’t go down that path with, you know, the AI systems, I think, is really important. And just putting out there the idea that now, at this stage of the development of AI, we should be thinking about that. Rather than what we’re doing with social. Which is having to go back, you know, a decade: Oh crap. Like, Oh wait, we shouldn’t have done that.

And it’s funny to talk to the early Twitter people, who were like, Yeah, you know, we kind of thought that’s what we were doing. And we just lost track of it.

Warzel: Well, and it’s also like the biggest form of competition, actually, Like if you have a place where you can just say, I mean, I feel like I’m seeing this. I’ve seen this so much with the newsletter game.

Yes. Like, you have a lot of people who came to a company like Substack, just because, okay, yeah, this works really well. Great recommendation system. I can grow this audience; I can do this, I can link it to my, you know, paid. Boom. Like it just works. And then some of those people have problems with the leadership, the direction of the company, whatever.

And because of the way that, you know, newsletter lists work, and things like that. And the portability via, you know, different payment companies. You can just, you know, pop it over, and it’s relatively seamless. And then, of course, you have companies trying in ways to, you know, lock in these ways to keep people.

But this idea of interoperability: is that like competition? It allows Ghost or Beehiiv to, yeah.

Komoroske: Plurality is one of the things that leads to it. Also, it’s important to make sure you don’t have that undue influence of one particular voice. It’s important also to have competition and adaptability. A healthy system has multiple options that are multiple opposite, who are trying and competing to be the best version of it. And if we all used a single model, for example, and we didn’t realize what its bias was, or what it else could do, that would be bad. And that’s one of the reasons that having most people using just a single chatbot of ChatGPT, which obviously only works with OpenAI models, is not nearly as good of a feature as one where people can use different models in different contexts and try them out and switch between them.

Warzel: The fourth principle here is “adaptable.” Anyone can take it. It does seem relatively understandable.

Komoroske: The way I think about that one is: It lifts you up. It doesn’t box you in. ’Cause a lot of products have, like, if a product manager said, These are the five actions you were allowed to do in this context. I want a system that’s open-ended, that I can use to build whatever I want to do. As opposed to something that kind of limits me into a particular subset of things that I can do.

Warzel: And the last one is like—this is my music, man. “Prosocial.” Technology should enable connection, coordination; help us become better neighbors, collaborators, stewards of shared spaces, online and off.

This dovetails—we can talk about that all day. I’d love to hear what you guys think about it. I went through some of the comments of people who are, you know, who are seeing this. Who want to be either signatories or contributors or just help out with the process. A lot of really interesting comments.

A lot of people writing their own thoughts. One of them kind of hit me a little. I guess resonated with me a little bit. And it was the culture. It was, I’ll quote them: “The cultural backlash against attention extraction is coming. Technologies that respect and protect human attention will, in time, win the marketplace.”

To this idea of, like, the prosocial: I think it’s pretty obvious that these tools are having antisocial effects. Not always; not in every context. But there are, you know, ways they’re trapping us, keeping us from living the lives we want to live. In some contexts, making us feel just bad, or adding to problems with mental health that people may be having.

I’m curious about this idea of the cultural backlash, though. Zoe, I’d love for you to begin on this one. But do you all feel like this is happening? To me, it feels very much like people are waking up to the idea that, like, This stuff makes me feel bad, and I don’t know how much longer I really want to feel bad in this context.

Weinberg: You know, it’s funny; I exist in this world of tech and start-ups and VC, where everybody is really excited about AI and thinks it’s really positive. But if you take even a half a step outside that bubble, I think it is very clear, at least to me, that the AI backlash is coming, or it is already at our doorstep. Or it’s already here. And that there is a lot of hate and vitriol, and I get it. Because, I think, Charlie, you nailed it. Like fundamentally, I think what people are reacting to is that AI, in many ways, has been profoundly antisocial.

Even in the ways that social media itself were bad, it’s almost like it’s almost gotten worse. Like, I’ll give you an example. Like, we used to worry about people falling down these, you know, these sort of disinformation rabbit holes, because they’re in these echo chambers on social media. Now, you can fall down a disinformation echo chamber, a rabbit alone with a chatbot. You know, it’s like an echo chamber of one.

Weinberg: It’s the way that I think about it. And that’s even more antisocial than the previous version, which, you know, what was itself very problematic and very, very harmful. And so I think that’s part of what people are reacting against.

And, look, I live in New York City. There was a subway campaign for a product called friend.com that elicited a ton of backlash from the city. And, you know, I’ve been observing things like that—and a few other instances along the way—that have definitely convinced me that I think for most people, whether or not they’ve used AI tools or they feel like AI is coming for their job or not, there’s just this sort of instinct of like, No, I don’t want this in my life.

Komoroske: Especially as an extension of the tech of the last decade. I mean, this industry, the one who gave us this crap and this hypercentralized. People who make these bombastic statements that are unnuanced and just don’t really seem to grapple with the amount of power and responsibility that they have.

Like, that’s not the place that you want AI to be. I also think, by the way, there’s a difference between AI tools. AI should not be your friend. If you think that AI is your friend, you are on the wrong track. AI should be a tool. It should be an extension of your agency. The fact that the first manifestation of large language models in a product happens to be a chatbot that pretends to be a human … it’s like the aliens in Contact who, you know, present themselves as her grandparents or whatever, so that she can make sense of it.

It’s like—it’s just a weird thing. Perfect crime. I think we’re going to look back on it and think of chatbots as an embarrassing party trick. You know, in five years, and be like, Oh, that was the wrong manifestation of large language models. Large language models should be in this inherent tool thing where you don’t get confused about whether this thing is your friend and you don’t get, you know, caught up in delusions of grandeur and everything.

Warzel: Well, I think too with the backlash, like—you mentioned this with this idea. It’s like, Oh, these companies are going to build, you know, the next generation of it. But I think, too, that it’s bigger than AI. Like I think you see this a lot.

This is, I think, the third time I’ve said this on this podcast now. But you can feel with younger generations that they understand very acutely how they’re being manipulated. Like they’re born into this ecosystem that a lot of people have had to take time to learn and understand.

There’s this real idea of it. And there’s sort of—though they are a part of it in a big way, also really, they don’t suffer fools in that sense. It’s like, I don’t necessarily want that. I’m feeling bad about it. It does feel like when I want to get hopeful about this stuff, I talk myself into this idea that we are sort of on the cusp of a little bit of a change.

I’ve experienced in the last year more phone-free spaces in general. Yeah, yeah. Right. Like this idea of this thing is not helping me in context, you know, outside of where I want to use it as a tool. I’m going to put it away right now. Or I need, I need someone to create a permission structure for me to put it away.

Komoroske: Going to saunas, I’ve heard, is a big thing, because you can’t have phones in them. Like, as a social space to be in person.

Weinberg: I predict that in the next year, we’re going to start to see people creating human-only spaces and saying, like, Okay, just so you know: This gathering, whether it’s online or in person, this is a human-only space.

Like, no wearables. Like, don’t bring your AI assistant or your, you know, Copilot. I’ll go on record. That’s a prediction for 2026.

Masnick:  I was gonna say, I think one of the interesting things is that society adapts to these things. And there is this belief that like, oh, you know, once we start spiraling down, we continue to go down. But, like, people and society as a whole starts to figure this stuff out. And it may take a while, and there may be a lot of damage done in the interim.

Today, going on Facebook, I mean—they’ve picked other places. You know, over time as new generations come in, they sort of look at the old stuff, and they realize, they see the problems of it. Because, you know, they’re all much more obvious. And then they look for somewhere other space.

And so, you know, in the social world—that had been TikTok, for example, which has its own problems. But if there’s going to be another generation, and there’ll be another generation, of AI tools. And there’ll be another generation of social as well. And if we’re in a position where we’re creating spaces that are welcoming, human people will move to them eventually, as they realize how problematic the other ones are.

And that’s, like, a lot of the response that I’ve heard—at least to the manifesto as it came out. Was like just this—like an exhale. Like, yes. Like I’ve been thinking that we need this, you know, vision. And I’ve been thinking about it. I didn’t realize other people were thinking it. And I think that’s part of society, you know—moving forward with these things and thinking through. Like, what is next?

What do I want? If I’m going to make a jump to new tools and new systems, you know, like I want to be a little more deliberate about it. And if the people building it are also more deliberate about it, maybe we can actually have a next generation that meet these principles that we’re talking about

Warzel: To that end. there are some interesting critiques here that are made, I think, in good faith. One of them, I wanted to just highlight and get your reaction to, which is: Somebody on Bluesky said, quote, “Like other cyber libertarian frameworks, they stop short of the root cause, which is politics. Liberation depends on shifting political power, because power determines which values take hold.” That’s obviously true. I think other criticisms that I have seen in general that seem to be, you know, part of the cynicism of living in 2025—or 2026, as people listen to this—is this idea that it’s like, Yeah, that sounds great, you know, in theory.

But again, you butt up against the politics of it all. The capitalism of it all, the scale of it all. Like all of all of those things. Very real. Yep. By the time people hear this, like Warner Brothers may be bought by like 450 companies.

We don’t know what that future looks like, but all of them portend some kind of strange dystopian consolidation. No, but yeah. But in general, like, how are you guys thinking about that? This is a guiding statement, to some degree. This is not meant to, you know, solve every problem that exists.

But how are you thinking about that? But, you know, coming up against politics of it.

Komoroske: I think the one broader point—by the way, I published another essay about optimization and how modern society just kinda optimizes everything. It’s true in the technology industry, but it’s also true in tech, or, sorry, in business and in politics too. I think it’s the defining characteristic of modern society—that we forgot that optimization actually does come in at a cost.

It’s just an indirect and harder-to-see cost. and I think that that is true across many different dimensions. It’s part of what I think everyone is feeling in this moment. And I think I would also point out that we are part of the industry. And we are also realists. We understand the incentive structures, the things that get us stuck in these kinds of behaviors.

A couple things. One, I think a lot of this is to a point that we made earlier in the conversation. Some of it is totally structural, and it’s, you know, the person at the top making these kind of decisions to optimize for Wall Street or something. Other parts of it are just emergent. They’re just local product managers in a given team making a decision: Okay, oh, we know that number is supposed to go up.

And it’s not thinking about what the downside of number going up is. And actually, if they think about it in terms of resonance, they might make a better product that actually creates more value for the shareholders, too. It doesn’t have to be intention. So little things, if everybody can say, Hey, is this resonant?

Just having people be able to have that terminology, and ask that question. If lots of different people are asking that throughout the industry, that could have an impact. And second, myself and a number of others who are working on this manifesto are working on things that are structural changes. To the kinds of distribution structures and power structures that create technology.

I’m working on an alternate security model that’s open and decentralized and allows getting rid of some of these silos that lead to aggregation, while still being fully aligned with people’s private interests. And so, we are not just saying: “Oh, what if everyone just said, Hey, let’s be nice today?”

You know, there’s some of that that actually could be somewhat effective. And also, we are realists about the emergent factors that cause some of these things. And working to modify or tweak or do what we can to help, you know, the right kinds of things emerge.

Masnick: There are many reasons to be cynical right now.

I completely understand where all that is coming from. And I think some of the job that we’re hoping to do—or at least I’m hoping; I shouldn’t speak for anyone else on this—is like, the more that we can paint this picture and show people. And yes, like, maybe some of us are a few steps into the future on this stuff. but if we can start to bring that back, begin to show people there are real things behind this, and we can all start to make decisions in this direction. And hopefully we can start to thaw out some of that cynicism and show that there’s something real here.

And each one of those steps is important. We’re not going to, you know, flip the entire structure of the world right now. But we can take these little steps and really make a difference over time.

Weinberg: The only thing I would add is that I think that there’s already been a lot of ink spilled doing the diagnosis. And I think capitalism is part of it. I think our political system is part of it. I think optimization culture is part of it. I think it’s a confluence of different factors. But I think part of what we were trying to do, at least in this piece, is move beyond just the diagnosis of the problem and try to craft a positive vision for where we should go.

But absolutely: A totally valid critique might be that you need to spend more time unpacking some of those underlying drivers. Of which we are all, I think, very aware of the ways in which that shapes, you know, the current reality.

Warzel: So I want to land this plane with: People are going to be listening to this at the beginning of the year.

I think this is a hopeful vision of a future. Or at least telling people. What if you planted the seed in your brain of a hopeful vision while you’re constructing these things? What is giving you all hope about what’s coming next this year in this space?

You’ve gone through this. You are clearly hopeful people to put this together in some sense. No matter how, you know, beaten down and cynical anyone who exists online is these days. But yeah. What is keeping you guys going forward on this?

Weinberg: I think what gives me hope on this vision is that I am seeing this whole new generation of founders and technologists, many of whom are like contemporaries of me, that grew up kind of under big tech and are just questioning all of the assumptions that underlie the way that we built things. And are trying to think about building things in new ways, and I think are very subscribed to the types of values and vision that we lay out in the manifesto.

And so I think that’s what gives me hope. I feel like the tide is really turning. And the fact that there’s been a ton of interest and momentum in the manifesto itself, I think, suggests to me like, you know—there’s a critical mass here who feels this way? And that’s kind of all you need to, like, nudge it in the right direction, I think.

Masnick: Yeah, I was going to say, like, I guess I’m the old man of the crew. I think that I’ve been alive slightly longer than the others. And that I remember the early days when people were thrilled with new technology, and it was exciting. And before it all seemed to turn. And to me, there is this element of going back to that. You know, there are mistakes that were made, but being able to go back to that time while recognizing the mistakes and doing a better job this time, I think, is actually really important.

And I’ve had, like, some of the criticism I’ve seen. Because I talked about this concept of going back, and some of the criticism was like, No; it was always terrible. And it’s like, No, like, I lived that time. And I remember when using new technology in the internet was enjoyable and exciting. And we can bring that back.

There’s nothing that says we have to keep the awful parts of the internet working the way that they currently work. And really against our own interests. And so I’m very optimistic; when you put these things out in the world, you know, people are gravitating to it. And that’s the first step toward pretty massive change over time.

Komoroske: I think for me—I think people have felt so cynical, and that they can’t do anything. And like, maybe they’re the only one that wants to push back against some of these optimization pressures. And seeing the response that people have to this has been really inspiring to me. Because at some degree, I’m thinking that we’re saying this thing that no one’s going to care about.

Everyone’s going to think it’s kind of dumb. And people are like: Yeah, how can I participate? I’m like, Oh my gosh; wow. Okay. I mean, I’m into it too, but so it feels very encouraging to me to see people feel that agency and wanting to sort of change the world in this way. And again, I work with a bunch of folks who are at the cutting edge of using large language models, and interesting ways to create infinite bits of situated software that—you know, personalized software.

And like, it’s exciting what you can do with some of these things. And again, I think chatbots—if you’re looking at chatbots like this is going to be social media, but worse and just kind of the same old story of centralization. Like, my hope is that we will be beyond that relatively soon as people start waking up to all the other things that you can do that are now possible. And democratized and available to just about anyone, to aid and empower them.

It’s really cool. And so I’m just extremely excited about what we as a society are going to do with some of these technologies.

Warzel: All right, with that, let’s go forth into 2026 and make it suck less than it did before. No, I appreciate everyone’s time. Zoe, Alex, Mike: Thank you for coming on Galaxy Brain and offering a unusual dose of positivity and hope.

Masnick: Excellent. Well, thanks for having us. Thanks.

Warzel: Thank you again to Zoe Weinberg, Mike Masnick, Alex Komoroski. I wanted to have this conversation because back in November at this panel discussion that I participated in, in Bozeman, Montana, we had this long conversation about the generative-AI moment. And so much of it was focused on the economic issues, the fears of artificial general intelligence, the ways in which this is all being abused. The conversation—as it tends to with new technologies that are consequential—it gets very negative, and very reactive, and very thinking about all the scary externalities of a new technology.

And at the very end of the conversation, one of the panelists, Sarah Myers West, who does a lot of work in AI policy, ended with something that was very—to borrow the term—resonant to me. And that was that she was really tired of talking about all the bad stuff and all the stuff that AI shouldn’t be—you know, the future that is being brought to the world that we need to fear—and wanted to think about ways to put forward a positive vision. To stop being on the defensive all the time and to think about: What is the future you want to build? If this technology is here, if it’s not going away, how do we harness it to do something that will be productive and helpful to human flourishing? And that just stuck with me, especially as someone who’s always focused on these negatives. And so a couple days later, when I saw this manifesto, I just thought to myself, Some of this stuff is probably idealistic. Some of this stuff is gonna be really hard to enact from.

From a political standpoint, from a fundraising standpoint, it’s gonna be a challenge. It’s always a challenge to build something that resists scale in general. But that doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t try. We shouldn’t try to be so rational about all of this, that we talk ourselves out of building something that matters, that helps, that actually aligns with the goals of being a good human living a good life. And so I found the conversation—in that sense more than anything—to just be motivating, to be something that, as we continue to do episodes here, as I continue to do my reporting, as you all continue to live your life out there among this technology, to think about. What it is you want. What it is we should be building to come up with positive visions of how this stuff should work, instead of constantly just defending against it.

So I hope this conversation gave you some of those ideas, some of those tools. It certainly did for me. And it’s something we’re gonna be continuing to explore throughout the year. So thank you once again. If you liked what you saw here, new episodes of Galaxy Brain are dropping every Friday.

            <h2>Trump’s Folly</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/trump-mistake-venezuela-injustice/685560/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the 1970s, an ideological struggle within the Republican Party pitted the views of Henry Kissinger, the secretary of state under Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, against those of Ronald Reagan.

Kissinger, a brilliant, German-born statesman, embraced realpolitik—a pragmatic, power-based approach to foreign policy that downplays morality and ethics. Reagan believed that although realpolitik might be pursued by other nations, the concept was alien to the United States. He thought that it undermined American ideals, which were a source of strength and not a weakness. He promised that if he became president, he would place human rights and the expansion of human liberty at the center of his national-security strategy.

In 1983, Reagan called the Soviet Union an “evil empire.” Time and again he framed the Cold War, and America, in explicitly moral terms. His loathing for totalitarianism was among the very few hatreds Reagan ever held, his biographer Edmund Morris said.

During a May 1988 trip to the Soviet Union, he made a point of meeting with more than 100 dissidents. The New York Times reported at the time that senior Soviet officials complained that “a planned Presidential meeting with Soviet dissidents would be an unwelcome breach of superpower protocol.” Reagan’s determination to press the human-rights issue in Moscow “loomed as a potentially disruptive issue on the eve of his arrival,” the story said. “Moscow has traditionally resented what is seen here as an unwarranted and intrusive American assumption of moral superiority.”

Anne Applebaum: Trump has a new definition of human rights

No matter. For Reagan, America was a “shining city on a hill,” a moral example to the world. And even when America fell short, when its actions didn’t align with its ideals, when national interests overrode high-minded principles, its aspirations didn’t change. America’s ideals provided its people with a standard by which they could judge themselves.

America’s Founders conceived of America in a certain way, too. It was a novus ordo seclorum, a “new order for the ages,” at the core of which lay a universalistic ethic. Abraham Lincoln, America’s greatest Republican and one of its two greatest presidents, saw the nation in profoundly moral terms; he described it as the world’s “last, best hope.” And almost every president has understood, in one way or another, that America cannot be pried apart from its ideals and remain America. The ethic in some nations may be that might makes right, but not in the United States. Until Donald Trump, that is. Now everything is different.

Give Trump his due: He has never pretended to be something other than what he is in this area. His affinity for brutal dictators and authoritarian leaders—Kim Jong Un, Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Viktor Orbán, Mohammed bin Salman, Rodrigo Duterte—is well known. During the 2016 campaign, when MS NOW’s Joe Scarborough said Putin “kills journalists, political opponents, and invades countries,” Trump replied, “At least he’s a leader.” Besides, Trump added, “I think our country does plenty of killing also.”

A year later, the Fox News host Bill O’Reilly pressed Trump on his repeated expressions of respect for Putin. When O’Reilly described Putin as a killer, Trump responded, “There are a lot of killers. You think our country’s so innocent?”

It’s little wonder, then, that in his second term, a more liberated, less constrained Trump has repeatedly made it clear why he invaded Venezuela: He wanted its oil, and he was therefore entitled to seize it.

But it hardly ends there. A few days ago, Trump said invading Colombia “sounds good to me.” He’s hinted at using force against Mexico. Last year, he reiterated threats to “take back” the Panama Canal. He’s talked openly about making Canada America’s “51st state.” And Trump and his administration are now openly declaring they will seize, by military force if necessary, Greenland, a self-governing territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, which was a founding NATO member.

“We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security,” Trump recently said, describing the region as “covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place.”

Since NATO was founded, in 1949, no member has attacked another. If that were to happen, it’s not clear that Article V, the collective-defense clause stating that an attack on one member is an attack on all and obligating other members to assist the attacked party, could successfully be invoked. But any such attack would surely destroy the greatest military alliance in history.

Read: Trump seizing Greenland could set off a chain reaction

On Tuesday, major European allies, including Denmark, said in a joint statement they would “not stop defending” the values of sovereignty and Greenland’s territorial integrity.

“Greenland belongs to its people,” they said. “It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.”

Republican Representative Andy Ogles of Tennessee, in defending Trump’s stance on Greenland, referred to the United States as the “dominant predator” in the Western Hemisphere. He meant it as a compliment.

Earlier this week, in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, Stephen Miller, Trump’s most influential adviser, was asked, “Can you rule out that the U.S. is ever going to try to take Greenland by force?” Miller responded by saying that the official position of the Trump administration is that “Greenland should be part of the United States.” He wouldn’t take military force off the table. But what was most notable was Miller’s articulation of the MAGA worldview.

“We live in a world in which you can talk all you want about international niceties and everything else, but we live in a world, in the real world, Jake, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power,” Miller said. “These are the iron laws of the world since the beginning of time.”

In Donald Trump’s America, the law of the jungle rules. The strong do what they can; the weak do what they must.

A few days later, in an interview with the Times, Trump was asked if there were any limits on his global powers. “Yeah, there is one thing,” Trump said. “My own morality. My own mind. It’s the only thing that can stop me.”

Margaret MacMillan: This is the way a world order ends

That statement is worrisome on two levels. The first is that the man making it is the most powerful person in the world. He is also a malignant narcissist, consumed by hate and driven by vengeance. His mind is warped, his sense of morality corrupted. And yet his mind and his morality are the only checks on his power that he recognizes. Trump believes he is free to do whatever he wills. And it’s not at all clear who or what can stop him.

The second reason Trump’s statement is worrisome is that he has changed the United States in fundamental ways. He has not only pried America apart from its ideals; he has inverted them. For a decade, he has been the overwhelmingly dominant figure in American life, and he has reshaped how hundreds of millions of Americans—including the great majority of Republicans and evangelical Christians—think about right and wrong, good and evil, justice and injustice.

Many of the same people who once fiercely supported Reagan and opposed moral relativism and nihilism have come to embody the ethic of Thrasymachus, the cynical Sophist in Plato’s Republic who insists that justice has no intrinsic meaning. All that matters is the interests of the strongest party. “Injustice, if it is on a large enough scale, is stronger, freer, and more masterly than justice,” he argued.

The United States under Trump is dark, aggressive, and lawless. It has become, in the words of Representative Ogles, a predator nation. This period of our history will eventually be judged, and the verdict will be unforgiving—because Thrasymachus was wrong. Justice matters more than injustice. And I have a strong intuition and a settled hope that the moral arc of the universe will eventually bend that way.</div>

A better solution would be to just require the ISPs to block Cloudflare.

They&#39;re not a problem if you wall them off.

Does Italy have a law that can require ISPs to block access to a particular IP?
One wonders when you&#39;re forced to accept that you&#39;re creating your own Great Firewall of China.
Just have everyone route all traffic through China - problem solved. Well... that one anyway. /s

There&#39;s also enhanced CDs which are really just multisession and have a data track, but they don&#39;t have standard formats.

I think WIMP grabbed the info by default. It would also take a pile of tracks in a directory and ID them. If you had nothing but the track numbers right, and they didn&#39;t even have to be in tags (just the filenames) then it would successfully ID albums. Before I found other tools which would do this, I found this very useful.

For some years now, my primary audio application has been MediaMonkey because it freely and easily syncs between Windows and Android.  Yes, I&#39;m that guy who has over 5,000 tracks on my computer and phone...

When CDDB went away, gnudb stepped up and is now offering it for your favorite ripping software.

I am using it with CDex with no problems today.   I buy a lot of expanded limited release film soundtrack scores from the likes of Intrada and LaLaLand, which are only released on CD so that they can afford the licensing from the studios for a small release.   So I still have a great use for it.  I&#39;ve long since ripped the rest of my CD collection, but I buy a new soundtrack CD once every few months.

I wouldn&#39;t touch any microsoft-authored player.

Yeah, and I prefer k3b.  But most windows systems don&#39;t have it installed.

So what you&#39;re saying is that not even you do CD lookups from media players to play CDs, and instead convert the CD to some other format and embed the metadata with it?

This isn&#39;t a case of not touching a Microsoft-authored player, it&#39;s you no even doing the thing the completely irrelevant, even to you someone who has a CD collection, thing that the Microsoft software used to offer.

There is no resurgence in the CD as a physical media format. None what so ever. The trend is down. Last year was the fourth lowest sales year on record other than 1983, 1984 and 1985.

Sure the register paints this as some form of Microsoft incompetence rather than what it actually is: dropping support for a feature which has literally never been less relevant in all of Window&#39;s history. Also worth noting is they aren&#39;t the first to actually stop this. CDDB (the actual meaningful and most popular CD data look

&quot;Our findings challenge the belief that school boards are unimportant&quot;Who is saying that?

Like towns, there are all levels of varying dynamics - there are strong school admins with rubber-stamp school boards; there are overwhelmingly powerful school boards making critical decisions for tens of thousands of students, and unfortunately, usually beyond culpability for the policies they inflict.

But I don&#39;t think anyone has suggested they&#39;re unimportant.

Yes, the ones who deal with schools have big impacts on the running of the schools they oversee, for good and for evil.  This is somehow surprising?

California is all-in on imposing the exact same identitarian based equity this school board study tries to tout, yet it’s an all around debacle. It’s plummeted in the national NAEP state rankings, especially in classically underserved demographics, and its colleges are surging remedial classes - 25 percent of whose students got straight As in K-12 math.

Having worked in public schools for 20 years now, the vast majority of school board members just went along with rubber-stamping about 99.9% of everything that was recommended by school officials.  They had practically no reason to not trust what was happening in their school.  Also, a majority of board members I&#39;ve worked with didn&#39;t have college degrees, so I think some of the materials presented to them might have felt a little over their heads in the first place.

What&#39;s really concerning is that, when it

nonsense, private companies made the montioned vaccines and you can get them

Also: flat earth, fake moon landing, p3d0 island, lizard people!

Can we describe the vaccines themselves as golden? As in .. made of gold? That seems to be one of the few things that gets Trump&#39;s interest.

I will, if you first cite to me legitimate, peer-reviewed studies showing any of these vaccines are safe and effective.

> Smart people are much more likely to be college educated, and vaccination rates among college educated are WAY higher.

Take a look at the Covid vaccination stats. Smart people and dumb people were the least likely to get vaccinated.

The typical &quot;college-educated smart people&quot; are midwits, who believe everything they&#39;re told. Which rather demonstrates my point.

They made some stupid choices, of their own free will, and now that genetic line is *gone*.Thanks, I needed some cheering up today.

...Trump and the MAGAts will declare vaccine researchers enemies of the state and have them imprisoned or executedOf course, that&#39;s just hyperbole.  What&#39;s not hyperbole is using federal funding of research and programs to cancel ideas and people that they don&#39;t like.  Tens of billions of dollars and at least tens of thousands of researchers and medical personnel have lost their funding and some of them their jobs.  There&#39;s no need to imprison or execute when simply killing their programs does the same thing.

Because ten years ago they couldn&#39;t even get mRNA treatments for cancer approved on safety grounds, and many companies in the field abandoned it because they believed mRNA would always be too toxic to use on a large scale.

hey here&#39;s a protip, you should read the articles you post because none of that is in there, the story is &quot;they&#39;re working to figure mRNA vaccines out&quot; and guess what, they did, and not only did they but a whole ass other company did too.

&quot;Delivery — actually getting RNA into cells — has long bedeviled the whole field. On their own, RNA molecules have a hard time reaching their targets. They work better if they’re wrapped up in a delivery mechanism, such as nanoparticles made of lipids. But those nanoparticles can lead to dangerous side effects, especially if a patient has to take repeated doses over months or years.Novartis abandoned the related realm of RNA interference over concern

There is no such thing as &quot;turbo cancer&quot;.  If anyone who got the shot then got cancer, they had cancer prior to the shot.  There is no other way it could happen.

&quot;There is no such thing as &quot;turbo cancer&quot;. If anyone who got the shot then got cancer, they had cancer prior to the shot. There is no other way it could happen.&quot;

That kind of argument is why no-one takes &quot;The Science&quot; seriously any more.

We know the friend who survived didn&#39;t have cancer before the shot because they&#39;d had cancer a few years before and were being regularly monitored in case it came back. Then they got injected, and oops, rapidly-growing cancer much worse than they had before. The other was per

so you&#39;re ignorant of cancer recurrence rates and ignorantly blame a vaccine.

meanwhile no vaccinated people I know have cancer, but two unvaccinated ones did because of other self-destructive behavior that we can add to their list that included vaccine avoidance.

The people who claim they don&#39;t trust the science are the same ones who will tell you they did their own research.

Queensland Australia, had a unique experiment. Our borders were locked and we had no C19, until the govt thought enough of us were vaxxed and opened the borders. The govt published daily deaths, was COVID present at time of death(not cause just active) , how many C19 vaccinations they had and their decile age range. I recorded the data for about 8 weeks as I was interested as an engineer if I could see efficacy.The data clearly showed if you were under 50 vaccination status made no difference to mortality.

If you&#39;re adamant that, like the anti-vaxxer Robert F. Kennedy, Jr, vaccines are not safe, let&#39;s here your excuses for why disease cases plummeted when vaccines were administered [imgur.com].

Side note, if you look below the first heat map, you&#39;ll notice the CDC no longer published measels cases after 2002.  Think real hard why that might be and why we now have over 2,100 cases in five months.

viruses mutate by themselves and later variants were milder. No need for a vaccine now, unlike with the initial deadly variants

For me, pizza delivery is just getting too expensive to justify.I don&#39;t mind the 20% added charge to deliver. I mind the charge to deliver AND the 25% &quot;tip for the driver&quot; to deliver it, which includes the delivery charge.Sort of like charging sales tax on top of the $5 a pack cigarette tax stamp. A double dip  - not that I smoke. Charging a tax on top of a tax. Same with charing me a fee to send me a bill telling me how much I need to pay you, but now it&#39;s another $10 because you sent me an email telling me what my water bill is. Or worse, garbage bill that doesn&#39;t change every month. I already know how much to pay, It&#39;s on automatic. Same with the cell phone bill.

They wanted at least 6 months of product for no charge first, no limit on quantity. I can&#39;t afford that. Pretty sure it was a &quot;go away&quot; tactic because they started selling a store brand line of &quot;plus toppings&quot;. Or maybe they already saw the need and filled it and I was just a coincidence.

Pizza used to be cheap. Now, it&#39;s $20 or more, delivery fees are $5.99 instead of free and the driver expects a tip on top of the delivery fee. On top of that, quality has gone down. So we&#39;ve gone from pizza every week or two to rarely doing take out. But they&#39;ve priced themselves in the range of some much better choices.

I generally agree, that&#39;s the reason *I* don&#39;t buy much pizza any more. And if I do get one, it&#39;s usually from Costco. It&#39;s cheapass mediocre pizza, but it&#39;s super duper affordable. It&#39;s still better than little seizures.

We had a halfway decent, not too terribly expensive pizza place nearby. But unfortunately they had too much oven and not enough business, so they didn&#39;t run the oven at full temperature, and the middles of pizzas were usually uncooked if there were a lot of toppings. Only a pepperoni could

That&#39;s 67.5% papa johns pizza inflation in 10 years. That&#39;s roughly 5.3% increase per year. Which is more than the food inflation in the US over the same period.

you should compare it to food inflation since it includes taxes, tips and delivery fees.  Much of the increase is not related to the food itself.

but the increase is disturbing and consistent with my experience.  Two large pizzas for me is always more than $70.

I dont think they are falling out of love with pizza, but you now have options. With uber, door dash and other services you can get food delivery from pretty much anyplace.  Historically Pizza was the dominant delivery food,but now anything is fair game.I suspect some of the downfall might be the junk they call pizza now. Gone are the neighborhood pizza shops that  are back filled with corporate cheap pizza.One more factor to throw into the mix.  Schools often offer pizza on their lunch menus.  Because most schools don&#39;t have kitchens anymore and instead just have places to heat up food, the food quality is bad.  My kids complain about the lunch pizza.  They will not eat it unless there are no other options.  Perhaps we have been educating our kids to despise pizza because they think of the bad pizza they get in schools.

Enshittification isn&#39;t just a computer thing.

i also worked at a pizzeria in my teen years, a then-brand-new one in my hometown.  It&#39;s still there.  They endured, persevered, grew.  tip o&#39; the hat for Faccio Pizza!

No, sir.  The good pizzerias are still around, but they don&#39;t have the billboards, they don&#39;t have the TV ads.  They just have word-of-mouth.

The local pizzeria in my town closed down because they a) fucking sucked and b) had five people working in a business which could run with two.

Shit food is a bit of a theme for this town. We do have one basically competent restaurant but they&#39;re super overpriced. They&#39;re next to the bar, which I presume is what keeps them alive.

I&#39;m a bit of a pizza snob myself, and I feel like I live in a pizza desert.  I&#39;m near DC, and there&#39;s a ton of pizza places.  The problem?  All of them are either crazy expensive, or they&#39;re trying to create a high-end type of feel for pizza.

But to me, and I suspect to a lot of others, pizza isn&#39;t a high-end food, it&#39;s a comfort food.  I grew up in a rural area where there was a single local pizza place that had what I would describe as &quot;generic New York style&quot; pizza.  To me, that is what pizza should be.  I cannot get that kind of pizza here, and not for lack of trying, as I&#39;ve tried a lot of pizza places.

Meanwhile, the big name chains don&#39;t have that feel either.  Dominos is good, for example, but it&#39;s definitely something that doesn&#39;t scratch the pizza itch.  I have to be in the mood for Dominos, not generically for pizza.  Same for the other chains.

When I visit where I grew up, the pizza is always top notch, and quite a bit cheaper.  My wife and I go out of our way to get it on many of our visits.  But here?  I end up on frozen pizza much of the time when I want pizza because it&#39;s cheaper and just as fast as delivery much of the time, and if you&#39;re picky, just as good as local delivery.  (And my wife started making pizza, which is also really, really good.)

It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if things like this are driving down the interest in pizza.  In chasing the top end, they&#39;re abandoning the much larger low end.  At least, that&#39;s what it looks like to me.

When customers expect your primary product to be cheap and your fixed costs are jumping, you have a problem.

Most of the cheap joints in San Francisco are long gone - there are a few left, seems mostly to be the ones that own their buildings.

And you&#39;re still going to pay at least $10 for a slice and a drink.

Today, pizza shops are engaged in price wars with one another and other kinds of fast food. Food-delivery apps have put a wider range of cuisines and options at Americans&#39; fingertips. And $20 a pie for a family can feel expensive compared with $5 fast-food deals, frozen pizzas or eating a home-cooked meal.Price wars typically result in lower prices for the consumer, and if you&#39;re eating frozen pizza - that still counts as pizza.

On what planet does a whole pizza compete with &quot;5 dollar fast food deals&quot;?

The problem is like everything else, some clowns are trying to sell pizza off as a swanky meal when we all know and expect pizza to be an affordable family splurge.

Next you&#39;re going to tell me raman is goin out of style because people stopped buying $20 bowls of noodles and the bougie raman outfit next to the jewelry store is going out of business.

$30 worth of pizza delivered used to feed the family.

Now I cant order a pizza for less that 50 bucks and what get delivered is a sad shitty pie and the box demands I give over even more money to your driver because the 8-10$ delivery fee I just paid doesn&#39;t actually cover the delivery.

We live in a world where everything is online. I can price out every single delivery option available in 5 minutes, and they&#39;re all competing with what I&#39;ve already got in the fridge. You want to sell me pizza? Stop pretending your a swanky upscale bistro and sell me and my family a still hot slab with proper the amount of cheese and toppings for an affordable price.

I can throw together cheese burgers for 5 in 10 minutes for around 25 bucks- I&#39;ll pay a little more to not get off my ass, but not if i means cold pizza an hour from now for $65.

The chains mentioned are all oven-fired and blacken their pizza.  I tried &quot;Coalfire&quot; and it was burned rubbish.   Yes, a wood oven and proper technique can make a great pizza, but no one wants to eat a briquette disk.

So no, America loves pizza but the inferior ones are being weeded out.

So no, America loves pizza but the inferior ones are being weeded out.Well, it looks like the chains that are failing are the ones that tried to turn pizza into a haute cuisine.  You always run the risk of customers tastes changing or belt tightening during economic uncertainty, when you overcharge for a fancier version of something widely available as peasant food.  It&#39;s why Starbucks keeps going through boom/bust cycles - overpaying for coffee with flavored syrups is only something people will do when they have a lot of extra money burning a hole through their pocket.

Best one i&#39;ve had in miami was inside an italian supermarket.  Literally in the center of it.  It&#39;s in North Miami, &quot;Laurenzo&#39;s.&quot;  50-60 year old place.  They have a fantastic brick oven made in Modena, and know how to use it.  My shop used to lunch there often.

If the business has a conveyor belt oven, it&#39;s shit.  and even if it has a real oven, you need skill to operate it and make good pizza.. and most here dont.

I make my own pizza for much, much less than pizza joints can offer. Over $20 for a large pizza, plus delivery, plus tip. I can make three or four of my own for that cost. Mine tastes better too, but I&#39;m probably biased.

Have you thought about turning your pizza&#39;s in a business? Are you offering pizza cooking courses?

On top of that there&#39;s a lot of popularity with home pizza ovens like the Ooni [ooni.com] which the high heat is usually the big factor in the difference between a pizza shop and at home.

Of course but there&#39;s so many methods and tutorials for getting good results in a home oven or a grill that it&#39;s by no means necessary to have something like that but nice that it&#39;s an accessible option if one wants.  I got gifted a Detroit style pizza pan and that works very well in the regular oven.

I just use my oven set to 425. Pie goes in for 16 minutes on a metal tray topped in tin foil lightly sprayed with olive oil and placed on the bottom rack. Slightly crispy on the bottom when finished. mmm .. mmm ... good.

Pizza Hut has degraded its food quality so badly that its barely edible.  Growing up and in college that was my pizza of choice but after not having pizza from them in over 5 years I decided over Christmas to try it again as &quot;maybe it got better?&quot;.  No.  It was still the same tasteless, oversalty, slop they&#39;ve been pushing for years.Likewise for Papa Johns which continues to lower their pizza quality to cut costs which I&#39;m sure their CFO here is well aware of and approved.

Mexican restaurants are doing well because they&#39;re mostly mom and pop shops actually COOKING their food and not relaying processed garbage.Mom and pop got picked up last month in an ICE raid. No menudo for you.

Pizza Hut was always called the grease pit in my house, we stayed far away. You mean they could actually make it worse?Sorry. Disagree. Pizza Hut used to make good pizza, particularly their style of deep dish. The bottom was crisp yet still chewy.  The pepperoni was what you&#39;d expect: greasy and burn your mouth hot. The cheese created the strings you see in commercials. The whole thing was firm but still had that droopy pizza quality.For whatever reason we stopped ordering from Pizza Hut then tried again many, many years later.  To answer your last question, yes, they made it worse.  Their dough is no longer made on site an

The New Haven pizza places still seem to be doing well. I think that Dave Portnoy and his fanbase have turned it into a pilgrimage for hardcore pizza fans.

It takes 30 minutes, tastes just as good, and doesn&#39;t cost $50. And I can put all the extra cheese I want on it.

Pizzas made at home or made by a restaurant that cares about quality are great.Pizzas made by national chains or frozen pizzas suck mightily and are getting worse as manufacturers switch to cheaper ingredients

The expenses of running a restaurant force many to buy materials from the big suppliers (Sysco/Performance Food/etc.)Once a place stops being unique, it stops being an option for me.I have dozens of local choices for pizza, all serving the same dough/sauce combo.It is the same pizza with a different chair and table.  No wonder folks lose interest.

There are great pizza places still around, you just have to look a little closer.

I never understood the appeal of pizza. As a food item it&#39;s somewhat acceptable, but it&#39;s possibly the worst take-out food you could come up with if you tried. The large surface area and thin height makes it probably the #1 candidate for &quot;lose heat fast&quot;. So by the time you get it delivered it&#39;s luke-warm and soggy.

Am I missing something, or is it just a case of lowest common denominator?

What is attractive about a pizza chain? It&#39;s not that Americans don&#39;t like pizza, but the pizza is terrible from chains. Little ceasers cardboard pizzas make me sick. Dominos is ok, I haven&#39;t sat down at a pizza hut for years. But all serve up not healty pizza. And I&#39;ve never had delivered pizza.

If you are a foodie and want good pizza stick to artisan or thin crust with fresh ingredients. Or go to Italy. Or make your own pizza with 00 pizza flour with durum wheat.

If you want to funnel carbs into your body s

Around here pizza is by far the most affordable on-demand way to feed the family.I think the issue is the &quot;on-demand&quot; part there. Pizza was predominantly a take-out / delivery meal. With people less and less excited about on-demand food to order they are suffering a lot from the reduced demand.We never order pizza anymore, it&#39;s so much cheaper and better to make our own, and when we do order food, well since COVID pushed the world to on-demand there are so many options to choose from so if we&#39;re going to go with an on-demand expense then we may as well spend $5 extra and get something a

I don&#39;t believe your story about the kids, but I am quite confident it will not last if there is any shred of truth to it.

&quot;...why would you eat pizza in a restaurant?&quot;

For the same reasons you would eat any food in a restaurant.

People....have options. You can pull out the phone and get something delivered from just about anyplace...even if they don&#39;t offer delivery. Pizza Hut is now just using doordash. 20 years ago...I could have pizza or Chinese food delivered. That was it. Most people&#39;s delivery options were limited.

Now you&#39;ve got people literally waiting in their cars to go grab something and deliver it to you. The only thing that happened to pizza is it lost it&#39;s delivery advantage.

Another metric that&#39;s downstream of changing demographics. It&#39;s like those heatmaps that are just 1:1 correlated with population density.

What the PJ CFO actually explained was, that with the proliferation of Door Dash, Grubhub, etc., pizza is no longer the strongest delivery option out there, so that has impacted sales.  People can get a hamburger or a chicken sandwich with the same ease as pizza, so many people are choosing other items these days.  Americans have been eating 3 billion pizzas a year.  Some niche or overpriced chains might be affected, but don&#39;t let anyone convince you that pizza is in danger.

“That’s fine, dude, I’m not mad at you,” Renee Nicole Macklin Good told Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross seconds before he shot and killed her in Minneapolis on Wednesday. Good’s last words are memorialized in newly released video footage seemingly taken by Ross on a cellphone as he circled her car. So are the last words Ross—or possibly another ICE officer—spoke to her as she lay dead or dying: “Fucking bitch.”

The video clearly portrays Good as a calm presence and ICE as a menacing one, which means it does not make good on the narrative conservatives have been spinning about Good’s death, claiming that she hit Ross with her car and he killed her in self-defense. And yet the leaked video was published by Alpha News, a right-wing media company based in Minnesota, that previously produced a falsehood-ridden documentary downplaying police culpability in George Floyd’s murder. Why would this kind of outlet decide to post a video that’s so sympathetic to Good?

In the days since Good’s death, the right has been trying to paint her as an agitator, a radical, a violent domestic terrorist. Though she certainly does not come off as such in the video, the footage does make clear that she was on that street to protest ICE. To many on the right, this makes her a disposable casualty in Donald Trump’s war on immigrants. Conservatives can point to this video to say that Good refused to follow orders to “get out of the fucking car,” making her culpable for her own death. There is no rule of proportionality in the MAGA universe: Any left-leaning protest activity or civil disobedience is grounds for assassination.

But the real reason for Alpha News’ decision may lie in the second half of the video, after Good tells the officer she isn’t mad at him. Good’s wife, Becca, is shown walking outside the car, filming Ross on her own phone. She identifies herself as a U.S. citizen and lightly mocks Ross for filming their license plates. “You want to come at us? I say go get yourself some lunch, big boy,” she says. Then she makes a move to get in the passenger seat, seemingly in preparation for the couple to vacate the area.

Becca is a clockable queer woman. She establishes Good as a member of a minority currently being demonized by Republicans as dangerous to children and a threat to society. This brands Good and her grieving widow as marginal Americans, not citizens of the country Trump and his followers are trying to protect. The administration is waging a war on empathy, and Good’s politics and identity placed her on the wrong side of the battle lines.

If you’re at all familiar with the language used by GOP leaders to dehumanize queer people—“groomer,” “tr***y”—it’s easy to view this video through the eyes of the MAGA faithful. You won’t see two mothers with full, precious lives who deserve to drive away from that street alive. Instead, they’re just a couple of brash dykes who got exactly what they deserved for standing in Trump’s way.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee Nicole Good while she attempted to drive away from an immigration enforcement operation in Minneapolis on Wednesday. Videos show Ross using unjustified force against Good, a 37-year-old mother and poet, when he appeared to be in no imminent danger. Yet the Trump administration immediately defended the murder, defaming Good as a “domestic terrorist,” asserting absolute immunity for Ross, and obstructing a state investigation into the incident. This defense came on the heels of the administration’s declaration that Congress could not limit its military actions in Venezuela, claiming that the president has inherent constitutional power to invade foreign countries.

On this week’s episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discuss how Good’s killing was not an aberration, but the logical end point of the administration’s theory of power—one fortified by the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity decision. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: I want to look back at the ways in which the events of the last week, aggregated across the events of the last couple of months, keep demonstrating Donald Trump’s absolutely limitless claims of power to do anything—to determine international law, to determine domestic law, to decide when there’s an emergency. There are no boundaries. That’s why the two bookended events in Venezuela and in Minnesota sit so heavily on us: We are hearing J.D. Vance and Stephen Miller and Kristi Noem and the president all claim, over and over again, some version of: The president can deport, bomb, arrest anyone he wants. He can invade sovereign nations. He can take over Greenland. He can do whatever he wants. So nobody should be surprised at the resounding claim that his agents can kill people in cold blood, and they’re immune from any scrutiny.

I want to go back to the conversation you and I had after Trump v. United States, which the Supreme Court wrote in these very bloodless terms about the immunity conferred upon the president within the outer and inner perimeters of his “official acts.” And I want to layer that against the image of a family car splattered in the blood of a mother gunned down for no good reason, including the reasons being proffered in defense of the murder. In some ways, I feel like this is the answer to the question that has been plaguing us since we started talking about the immunity case, which is: What does the law even mean when one man is given immunity that he can extend to his cronies and deploy against his enemies? When all of this gets made up on the fly as Trump sees fit, and without limits—beyond, as he told the New York Times this week, the outer boundaries of his conscience? How do we even think about this as a matter of “law”?

Mark Joseph Stern: I think when people in our profession see horrible murders like this—then watch the president claim it was justified because the victim was a “domestic terrorist”—there’s a temptation to process it through legal reasoning. To say: No, that’s not right. But you miss the point if you fail to look at the bigger picture. Because the lawyers crafting some of these statements for Trump know that what they’re saying is false. They know that Minnesota has jurisdiction to investigate this crime. They’re just lying about it. And at a certain point, it does seem foolish to keep arguing the legal logic when it is irrelevant to the people in charge.

The first and clearest sign we got about this came in March, when the Justice Department said that Judge James Boasberg’s investigation into unlawful deportation must yield to “the mandate of the electorate.” As if Trump’s election bestowed upon him a kind of sovereign power, not just as head of the executive branch, but as the personification of the American people’s will. So when anybody tries to stand in his way, they have to be pushed aside. Just this past week, congressional Republicans escalated their effort to impeach Judge Boasberg and remove him from the bench because he dared to resist the “mandate of the electorate” and say, Actually, laws still matter.

We can hold both truths in our heads: Laws matter, but not to this administration, so there will always be a limit to the legal arguments made against it. We have to insist that in this country nobody can ever claim that they have some kind of freestanding authority to deport, to bomb, to murder because they were elected by the American people. Yes, Trump won the election; that does not mean that he can send his goon squads in with masks and assault rifles and start shooting moms and motorists and anybody perceived as a threat.

Unfortunately, that is how the Supreme Court seemed to imply that law might work in its immunity decision when it stripped presidential conduct of factual context and insulated “official acts” from real accountability. And I believe that’s the key source of this administration’s extralegal logic. I remember Justice Neil Gorsuch saying, during those arguments, that he didn’t much care about the details of Trump trying to steal the 2020 election, because the court was writing “a rule for the ages.” And how that rule for the ages cashes out is Renee Good getting shot in the head, her blood splattered over her kid’s stuffed animals in the family car. That’s how the “rule for the ages” ends up transforming our country into a place where Hispanic people have to carry proof of citizenship and any protester can be executed for no reason.

All of this flows from the president’s own claim to represent the ultimate will of the people, to have total immunity for himself and his agents for any kind of criminal wrongdoing. When Trump started bombing the boats, we should have known that it would very quickly lead to his agents assassinating American citizens in the streets. And there has to be a groundswell of opposition to this conception of the law, because if you squint, you can see how they’re trying to call this “law.” It’s the “law” as whatever the president claims is necessary and correct, as he told the New York Times—whatever he believes the country needs, that becomes legal. We have to refuse to buy into the shared reality that the White House is demanding we all buy into.

I’ve been thinking a lot about one of the tropes we saw after the Minnesota shooting—a lot of people seemed to say: Wait, she’s a mom, just like me! She was at school drop-off, just like me! And not that long ago, an appeals court judge talking about the president renditioning people to CECOT said: If they designate anybody as a gang member, they can do it to me. For a lot of us, that seemed like a stretch, right? You’re a federal appeals court judge. Nobody’s going to rendition you to CECOT.

But the category error you’re identifying isn’t “The victim reminds me of me this time and therefore I’m horrified.” It’s that once you give the president the right to declare that people are gang members or drug runners or domestic terrorists—once you have the power to designate entire classes of people, like Somalis and Haitians, as enemies of the state—it can happen to you. I really want to lift that up as a way to think about why we are horrified at what happened to Renee Good. It’s not simply because her life is familiar to us. It’s because the taking of her life has been batted away on the grounds that she is of a class of people that’s subhuman and thus not deserving of the protections of the law. And we all need to realize that if the president can do this to her, the president can do it to me.

I guess what makes me despair is that, of course, everything you just said is correct, but it’s a lesson that we have to keep learning over and over again somehow. People always trot out Martin Niemöller’s poem about the Holocaust—first they came for them, and I didn’t speak out; then they came for me. I fear that we’ve reached the end of the usefulness of that poem, because what we’ve seen is that people have endless excuses for why it won’t be them. They think we live in a different time. We’ve learned it. We can move on.

But we haven’t learned it. Because there are still many people on the right, it seems, who defend the execution of Renee Good, even if they could relate to her on some level. There are a lot of moms out there who are MAGA, who voted for Donald Trump, and who evidently support this murder. So even now, they can’t make the connection that if it could happen to that woman, it could happen to me. I don’t know how we fix that. I really don’t have an answer. Many people just do not have the appropriate fear that we have handed the power over to this president to kill almost anyone he wants.

The videos of Renee Nicole Good’s killing are the stuff of nightmares. On Wednesday, according to footage shot by bystanders, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross appears to shoot Good in the face at point-blank range while she attempts to drive away from another ICE agent prying at her car door. Her wife was reportedly in the seat beside her. “We stopped to videotape, and they shot her in the head,” Good’s wife sobs in one of the most upsetting videos from the encounter. “We have a 6-year-old at school.”

The normal reaction to this incident is horror, rage, and sorrow. A woman is dead, killed by the government under unimaginably traumatic circumstances, her wife mere inches away. She leaves behind three children. Photos from the scene of her death show kids’ toys spilling out of her glove compartment.

The response from Republican officials seemed to describe a different event altogether. This wasn’t a poet, wife, and mother whose life was cut short by a bullet, but, according to Donald Trump, a “professional agitator” who “violently, willfully, and viciously” ran over her killer. (She didn’t.) In lockstep, GOP leaders lied about Good’s death and to absolve Ross of culpability, then demonized his victim. In their tale, Good was a domestic terrorist who was responsible for her own death. When GOP Sen. Pete Ricketts was asked for his reaction to the shooting on Newsmax, he said, “it’s terrible.” Not Good’s death, mind you, but “these attacks on law enforcement.”

Among their base, today’s GOP is trying to drum out any natural impulses toward compassion, such that there is no imperative to feel—let alone express—any dismay at the killing of an ideological adversary. If Good wasn’t on Trump’s side, the party line goes, she got what was coming to her. The rush to defend Ross is more than a political move to justify Trump’s personal militia run amok. It’s another round in the right wing’s mounting war on empathy.

For the past few years, influential Christian conservatives have been loudly proclaiming that empathy is toxic, a sin, and a tool of the devil. In their view, progressives use the human inclination to care for others as a way to sway evangelicals toward liberal causes, such as tackling racism or saving USAID, the dissolution of which some analysts say has already caused the deaths of 500,000 children worldwide. The innate desire among well-adjusted people to wish their neighbors happy, healthy lives is a political liability for the party of Medicaid cuts, SNAP freezes, ICE raids, refugee bans, and forced childbirth. Elon Musk has called empathy “the fundamental weakness of Western civilization.”

J.D. Vance has endorsed this perspective, too. In a Fox News interview last year, he laid out a warped version of a medieval Catholic doctrine, ordo amoris, to defend the administration’s brutal crackdown on immigrants. “You love your family, and then you love your neighbor, and then you love your community, and then you love your fellow citizens in your own country,” Vance said. “And then after that, you can focus and prioritize the rest of the world.” (Pope Francis later published a letter condemning the deportations that seemed to directly reject Vance’s view: “Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons and groups.”)

In this worldview, anyone who poses a danger to those within the inner circles of human worthiness does not warrant much empathy. And it’s easy enough to argue that just about anyone is a threat to one’s family, town, or country, thus exempting them from our responsibilities of care. A drag queen, let’s say. A liberal judge. Someone wearing a Zohran Mamdani T-shirt at the grocery store. A concerned Minnesotan who stopped to film the agents plucking people out of her community.

Once a person is no longer worthy of empathy, they become a justifiable casualty in service to any political aim. There is no need to consider proportionality; killing someone for distracting ICE agents is just as defensible as ending a life on a battlefield. From the right’s perspective, Good’s political views made her fair game, so her gruesome, untimely death by the gun of a masked federal agent need not be met with outrage or remorse. Any empathy for her or her family imperils a greater project: cleansing Minneapolis of immigrants.

It’s a short distance from believing someone’s death is unworthy of mourning to believing they deserved to die, and a short distance from there to inciting more death. The Trump administration’s knee-jerk defense of the ICE agent who killed Good bears echoes of Kyle Rittenhouse, the right-wing wannabe vigilante who, at 17, traveled across state lines to fight Black Lives Matter protesters and ended up killing two of them. In the six years since then, Rittenhouse has become a GOP hero—and, wouldn’t you know, he chimed in just a few hours after Good died. “After thinking about it, should I travel across the state line to Minnesota?” he posted on X with a laughing emoji.

The instinct to recoil at the killing of a fellow person, and to feel some vicarious pain as we consider the loss, is part of what makes us human. Historically, we have pathologized people who lack such impulses; they are known as psychopaths, and their qualities have been deemed incompatible with a functioning society. Empathy is the bedrock of what it means to have a society. To live together under some form of shared governance, we have to start from a place of believing our neighbors should not be shot dead in their cars, and being upset when they are.

Over the past two days, as Republican officials have applauded Ross for killing Good, they have repeatedly lied about the videos of the shooting, insulting the intelligence of observers who know what it looks like to be run over by a car. The lies have been instantaneous, effortless, and shameless: Just look at this photo of Trump aide Natalie Harp in the Oval Office, smugly playing a video for assembled New York Times reporters, as if she could convince them they were seeing something they were not.

Every falsehood spun by Trump and his acolytes is an attempt to degrade their followers’ capacity for empathy past the point of flinching at an innocent woman’s death. The goal is to diminish the ghastliness of Good’s death, and with it, the value of her life.

A decade ago, when we imagined the horrors of living in a world fractured into different realities, we pictured something technologically dystopian. Experts warned that the time would come when we, as a public, would no longer be able to tell what’s real and what’s not. We would be fed snippets meant to inflame our anger and disgust. There would be candidate sex tapes and footage of crimes committed by racial minorities and leaked audio files with politicians saying horrible things—all fabrications. We would live in a swirl of anguished mass confusion.

But now that that technology is here, it’s finally time to admit it wasn’t ever necessary. At least not to destroy our own shared reality. For that, we just need partisan loyalties.

On Wednesday, when an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed a woman in her car in Minneapolis, the casual and disproportionate violence seemed indisputable: no angle showed Renee Good, the driver, gunning for the ICE agent. The most charitable defense of the agent was that he was jumpy and reacted out of fear when the car started moving near his foot; it was harder to defend him shooting at the window after Good had already cleared him. But immediately, people with partisan and commercial interests in defending ICE declared that the video showed Good was trying to kill the ICE agent. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called it “domestic terrorism.” Official government statements cited a “ramming” event. President Trump wrote on social media that the car’s driver “violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense. Based on the attached clip, it is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital.” If you watch the videos, the ICE agent not only appears to have escaped unscathed, he also calmly holsters his gun and walks toward the car after the shooting.

And if social media is any indication—and it must be, as it remains one of the key places where large parts of the population take their cues on how to digest political news—the right has agreed to this interpretation. It needed no fake evidence; it only needed an assertion from authorities in the movement that there was a way to process what they were seeing without challenging their narratives. A simple answer that showed how, if you just thought about things the right way, you could ignore your lying eyes.

Yes, when the videos first emerged, there was some small amount of accompanying A.I.-driven disinformation. Some internet users shared A.I.-produced efforts to “unmask” the ICE agent who killed her, and others shared A.I.-generated photos of Good in conversation with the ICE agent. (Ultimately, A.I.’s biggest influence on this story was for provocation: An anonymous internet user asked an A.I. chatbot to reimagine her corpse in a bikini.)

But for the most part, the discussions surrounding the incident started from the authentic bystander videos, all of which clearly showed Good being shot as she was driving away from the officers. Trump and his allies didn’t need fraudulent evidence; they only needed to lie to themselves about what the video showed. The real video was enough for that.

As a result of all this, instead of mourning a tragedy, we’re stuck in a debate between two entirely different translations of the same material. This matters not just because it warps truth and dishonors Good’s memory but because it makes improving the world impossible. The first step to coming together to address a problem—a failure in training or protocol; a too-casual use of deadly force; a culture of hostility toward the public; or the charged situation itself, the result of a city under siege—is agreeing there is a problem. Right now, the mechanism for agreeing on that starting point is broken.

And when everything is subjective, nobody ever has to be accountable. That’s particularly true in the killing of Renee Good. But it’s also true with another event that unfolded this week: the ongoing rewriting of the events of Jan. 6, 2021, and the state-funded efforts to recast it as a patriotic response to a stolen election. The insurrectionists have received pardons and are asking for reparations; they no longer have to worry about accountability.

It has become clear that the insistence on polarized realities poses deeply existential threats. Threats to democracy, as with the notion that you can simply declare your election won. Threats to public safety, as with the refusal to acknowledge millions dead from a global pandemic. Threats to the planet, as with the refusal to recognize climate science. On a more intimate scale, it’s also just exhausting. It’s exhausting to be told you didn’t see what you saw; that you are lying; that you are acting on corrupt motivation, rather than pain in witnessing a human life snuffed out so casually. It’s exhausting to try to extend compassion and to be told that doing so is an inherently partisan activity.

The left is not immune to this. Liberals watched as a flailing President Biden crowed that we “finally beat Medicare” in a debate, and many still insisted he was fit for office. There had been appearances that showed his mental deterioration before that, and there would be others afterward. And yet they shook off what they could plainly see.

Still, Trump is in power, he has torn down all political norms, and his party bears far more responsibility for where we are today. But as long as everyone is willing to do this, to ignore what is right in front of us in order to arm ourselves for conversations to be won or lost, the dynamics will never change: Nothing is ever real, or not real. It’s always gray, always partisan.

Artificial intelligence will undoubtedly make all of this worse. But we won’t have to wait for that dark moment when it subsumes our reality; we’re already all too willing to alter reality in our own minds.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Accenture is betting that the future of retail will run through AI with an investment in Profitmind, an agent-based platform that automates pricing decisions, inventory management, and planning.

&quot;Profitmind bridges the gap between insight and action through agentic AI,&quot; Accenture global retail lead Jill Standish said in a statement that announced Accenture&#39;s buy in. &quot;It mirrors how retailers run their businesses, linking data from multiple sources for clear, prioritized recommendations that can be trusted and executed quickly in response to an increasingly competitive industry.&quot;

Neither party released the terms of the investment. Accenture Ventures, the company&#39;s venture capital arm that focuses on early stage startups in AI, provided the funding.

&quot;Profitmind brings a transformative technology that identifies and quantifies performance opportunities across a retail business,&quot; the startup&#39;s CEO Mark Chrystal told The Register via email. &quot;Because AI is increasingly automating merchandising and pricing, you need a system like Profitmind to stay on top of the market and respond to it. Further, Profitmind, within its Marketing Agent, has the ability to create Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) optimized product copy that increases the likelihood that AI search agents will find and recommend their products.&quot;

Count Salesforce among those who agree that the next wave of retail will be dependent on AI, both behind the scenes and in front of the customers.

The CRM platform released a look at online holiday sales data on Thursday that it says shows 2025 marked a turning point for AI-assisted shopping as the share of global and US traffic from third-party AI search doubled over last year.

The study found that AI and AI agents drove $262 billion, or about 20 percent of 2025&#39;s holiday spend amid what it said was a record breaking year for online sales that amounted to $1.29 trillion globally.

Salesforce said that, even amid higher prices, online holiday sales grew seven percent globally and four percent in the US where online sales reached $294 billion. And organizations which deployed their own AI agents – Pandora, SharkNinja and Funko – saw an average growth of 6.2 percent in holiday sales year over year, compared to 3.9 percent growth among those companies that did not.

&quot;Beyond answering their questions, these agents also took direct action on behalf of customers, handling 142% more tasks than they had in the prior two months. These tasks include updating delivery addresses and initiating returns, which are manual, resource-intensive tasks for human reps,&quot; Salesforce&#39;s study found.

Chrystal said that the Salesforce study reinforces the need for his platform which monitors the prices, assortments, and marketing of competitors in real-time. He also posited that, by teaming with Accenture, the company can scale to global customers and identify areas where they need to build new capabilities.

&quot;Accenture brings their expertise in transformation, business process change, implementation and business case development,&quot; he told us via email. &quot;Together, we believe we offer the full capability set to both deliver tools and transformation to positively impact any retail business.&quot;

During the National Retail Federation show next week, Microsoft will demonstrate Profitmind deployed on Azure at its booth. Redmond will also explain how its customers can gain faster access and support for the implementation of Profitmind through their partnership platform, Chrystal said. ®

            <h2>How hackers are fighting back against ICE surveillance tech</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/09/hackers_fight_back_against_ice/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">While watching us now seems like the least of its sins, the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was once best known (and despised) for its multi-billion-dollar surveillance tech budget.

Clever hackers and digital privacy advocates are fighting back against the snooping activities of Kristi Noem&#39;s masked agents. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has rounded up several of these counter surveillance projects, and perhaps unsurprisingly many of these have to do with Flock, best known for its automated license plate reader (ALPR).

Flock operates the largest network of surveillance cameras in America, and, while it has contracts with thousands of police departments and municipalities across the US, sometimes ICE gains access to this footage, according to US Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) and those who have looked into Flock&#39;s misuse.

We should also note that EFF and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) have sued the city of San Jose, California, over its alleged abuses of this technology.

One YouTuber discovered a way to prevent your license plate being recorded and logged by Flock&#39;s AI readers by screen printing &quot;tiny bits&quot; of adversarial noise and putting the sticker on your license plate. These &quot;abstract invisible license plate overlay patterns … cannot be detected by humans but make license plate recognition systems utterly shit the bed,&quot; Benn Jordan said on his video.

We&#39;ll note that this is illegal in California and some other states, and The Register does not advocate breaking the law.

Jordan also uncovered a massive Flock security snafu involving hundreds of misconfigured Flock cameras that exposed non-password protected admin interfaces to the public internet, allowing anyone to view live surveillance feeds, download videos, and view logs. &quot;Like a Netflix for stalkers,&quot; is how Jordan described it.

There are also open source tools like deflock.me, which has mapped more than 61,000 license plate readers in the US, and alpr.watch, which scans local city council and other meeting agendas for keywords like &quot;flock,&quot; &quot;license plate reader,&quot; and &quot;alpr,&quot; and more. It then maps where these meetings are happening so people can attend, and you can sign up for email alerts in your area.

Plus, apps including Stop ICE Alerts, ICEOUT.org, and ICEBlock allow users to report local ICE sightings.

Apple delisted ICEBlock from the App Store in the fall after the Trump administration turned up the heat on the iThings maker. Its developer, Joshua Aaron, has sued Attorney General Pam Bondi, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, ICE director Todd Lyons, and others, accusing them of infringing on his First Amendment right to free speech.

Also in response to the ban, the EFF filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit to disclose federal government officials&#39; communications with tech companies aimed at removing immigration enforcement apps and websites.

In October, Apple also banned Eyes Up, an app to securely record and archive ICE raids. But it&#39;s still available on Google Play.

&quot;It&#39;s important to remember that we are not powerless,&quot; EFF security researcher Cooper Quintin wrote. &quot;Even in the face of a domestic law enforcement presence with massive surveillance capabilities and military-esque technologies, there are still ways to engage in surveillance self-defense.&quot;

Now, if ICE would just stop shooting people. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Talk about letting things go! Ninety-six percent of software developers believe AI-generated code isn&#39;t functionally correct, yet only 48 percent say they always check code generated with AI assistance before committing it.

This conveniently self-validating statistic comes from Sonar, a company that sells code review and verification software, in its State of Code Developer Survey.

Based on data from more than 1,100 developers worldwide, the survey finds that AI coding tools have become the norm, with 72 percent of developers who have tried these tools using them every day or multiple times a day. And only six percent report occasional usage, meaning less than once a week.

Devs say 42 percent of their code includes significant assistance from AI models, a share they expect will reach 65 percent by 2027, up from just six percent in 2023.

The types of software projects where these developers are using AI tools range from prototypes (88 percent) to internal production software (83 percent), production software for customer-facing applications (73 percent), and production software for critical business services (58 percent).

The most commonly used code tools are: GitHub Copilot (75 percent), ChatGPT (74 percent), Claude/Claude Code (48 percent), Gemini/Duet AI (37 percent), Cursor (31 percent), Perplexity (21 percent), OpenAI Codex (21 percent), JetBrains (17 percent), Amazon Q Developer (12 percent), Windsurf (8 percent), and others (37 percent).

But the growing usage of AI tooling has, according to Sonar, created a verification bottleneck.

&quot;This verification step isn&#39;t trivial,&quot; the report says. &quot;While AI is supposed to save time, developers are spending a significant portion of that saved time on review. Nearly all developers (95 percent) spend at least some effort reviewing, testing, and correcting AI output. A majority (59 percent) rate that effort as &#39;moderate&#39; or &#39;substantial.&#39;&quot;

According to the survey, 38 percent of respondents said reviewing AI-generated code requires more effort than reviewing human-generated code, compared to 27 percent who said the opposite.

&quot;We are witnessing a fundamental shift in software engineering where value is no longer defined by the speed of writing code, but by the confidence in deploying it,&quot; said Tariq Shaukat, CEO of Sonar, in a statement. &quot;While AI has made code generation nearly effortless, it has created a critical trust gap between output and deployment.&quot;

Sonar cites remarks by Amazon CTO Werner Vogels to buttress the company&#39;s argument for more robust code verification.

Speaking at AWS re:Invent 2025, Vogels said, &quot;Now, the world is changing. You will write less code, &#39;cause generation is so fast, you will review more code because understanding it takes time. And when you write a code yourself, comprehension comes with the act of creation. When the machine writes it, you&#39;ll have to rebuild that comprehension during review. That&#39;s what&#39;s called verification debt.&quot;

That, said Vogels, is one of the two challenges he hears about from developers. The other, he explained, is hallucination. That&#39;s the anthropomorphic term for the tendency of AI models to make errors.

There are other challenges though for the companies employing these developers. Thirty-five percent of devs report using AI coding tools from personal accounts rather than corporate ones – perhaps unsurprising given Microsoft&#39;s recent call to take personal Copilot subscriptions to work, a position it subsequently argued against.

Developers say the shift toward AI tools has both benefits (93 percent) and drawbacks (88 percent). They appreciate, for example, that AI helps make the documentation process better (57 percent) and helps with creating test coverage (53 percent). They&#39;re less thrilled about code that looks correct but isn&#39;t (53 percent) or is unneeded or redundant (40 percent).

The report also notes that despite 75 percent of developers saying that AI reduces the amount of unwanted toil (managing technical debt, debugging legacy or poorly documented code, etc.), the reality is that AI tools just shift that work to new areas, like &quot;correcting or rewriting code created by AI coding tools.&quot;

&quot;Interestingly, the amount of time spent on toil (an average of 23-25 percent) stays almost exactly the same for developers who use AI coding tools frequently and for those who use them less often,&quot; the report says. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/09/ces_worstinshow_fatuous_ai_overlycomplex/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">From disposable electric candy to voice-activated refrigerators without physical handles, CES was crammed full of enshittified, intrusive, insecure, and wasteful technology this year – just like it is every year.

As regularly as bad tech shows up in Las Vegas in January, Repair.org and its allies in the repairability and tech responsibility movement were there to award a list of the worst things on display this year.

As was the case in 2025, there&#39;s a lot of AI on this list – but not just AI. There&#39;s some literal garbage on it, too.

Public Interest Research Group&#39;s right to repair campaign director Nathan Proctor had an obvious choice to make when it came to the worst environmental impact: Lollipop Star.

Literally a piece of e-waste in waiting, Lollipop Stars are suckers with an integrated battery and tiny speaker that, when placed in one&#39;s mouth, transmit sound through jaw vibrations, delivering what the brand calls &quot;music you can taste.&quot;

The device is non-rechargeable, gets about 60 minutes of battery life, plays a single song, and once the sucker is gone, it&#39;s garbage.

&quot;We need to stop making so many disposable electronics which are full of toxic chemicals, require critical minerals to produce, and can burn down waste facilities,&quot; Proctor said, noting that there are thousands of garbage fires every year due to improper disposal of batteries.

A Chinese company called Merach was in Las Vegas this week showing off its smart treadmill that comes with a conversational AI coach. In and of itself, that&#39;s nothing special – there&#39;s plenty of smart home fitness equipment with embedded AI available.

As Secure Resilient Future Foundation president and Securepairs founder Paul Roberts pointed out, it&#39;s not the tech that earned the worst in show cybersecurity award this year – it&#39;s the company&#39;s outright statement that your data just isn&#39;t safe.

&quot;In addition to personal information, network and online behavior, financial information … Merach&#39;s treadmills are also collecting biometric data, fitness and performance data, and the inferences that can be drawn from that information,&quot; Roberts explained in a video highlighting the ignominious awardees.

&quot;That&#39;s not surprising, but what is surprising was the security statement,&quot; Roberts continued, pointing to the Merach&#39;s privacy policy, which includes the rather bold admission that &quot;we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.&quot;

That alone, said Roberts, was enough to earn a place in the list.

Ever want to put a surveillance device on your desk that you can pretend is your girlfriend? No?

Well, neither did those who weighed in on the people&#39;s choice award for CES 2026 worst in show, which was awarded to the Lepro Ami AI &quot;Soulmate.&quot;

Take that creepy Stan Lee hologram, shrink it down to fit on your desk, and turn it into an anime waifu and you have the Lepro Ami AI. As CES visitors pointed out, it has an always-on camera and microphone, and while one can physically shutter the camera, users weren&#39;t impressed with the mental health-damaging privacy intrusion that is this unnecessary device.

Tech critic Cory Doctorow, who coined the term &quot;enshittification&quot; to describe how once-useful tech gradually becomes worse for users in a bid to extract maximum profit, was the natural choice to present the 2026 enshittification award. He handed it out to German tech firm Bosch for its eBike antitheft system that&#39;s basically just a parts-pairing nightmare waiting to happen.

Per Bosch, the new system allows users to report their eBikes as stolen through a mobile app, which is configured with serial numbers of the components on the bike. This naturally requires all the eBike&#39;s components to be registered to a specific user.

The catch? Bosch has total control over how parts are registered and reused.

&quot;Bosch can flip a switch and then you wouldn&#39;t be able to do independent repair using parts unless Bosch says they like the part that you were using,&quot; Doctorow said. &quot;Every manufacturer that started with parts pairing said they were fighting theft and counterfeiting and ended up using it to block independent repair.&quot;

We reported on the downright dystopian wildfire detection feature Amazon Ring unveiled at CES this week, but that wasn&#39;t why Electronic Frontier Foundation executive director Cindy Cohn chose Ring AI as the worst in show for privacy this year.

Citing the &quot;sheer expansion of surveillance capabilities that [Amazon] is supporting this year,&quot; Cohn expressed concern with facial recognition in Ring cameras, commercially deployable surveillance towers, and a new app store she said is &quot;going to let people develop even sketchier apps for the doorbell than ones that Amazon already provides.&quot;

More surveillance, Cohn added, doesn&#39;t always make us safer.

Bosch gets a second mention on the list of the CES 2026 worst in show with its 800 Series Personal AI Barista, a coffee maker that integrates Alexa+ to brew drinks on demand and is touted as the first espresso machine in the world to be powered by Amazon&#39;s new natural language AI tech.

The machine earned the &quot;who asked for this&quot; award, as – quite honestly – this sounds like more work than it&#39;s worth.

&quot;Adding voice control to a fancy coffee maker so you can tell it to make you a macchiato without having to learn the details&quot; is a good idea &quot;in theory,&quot; Consumer Reports director of technology policy Justin Brookman said. &quot;But in reality many people don&#39;t actually want to have a conversation with their coffee maker. It&#39;s too early for that – they just want to hit a couple buttons and get a nice cup of coffee.&quot;

In addition, as an Alexa+ device, it requires a Prime subscription, so even if you do love Alexa being your personal barista, cancelling your Prime account to save $139 a year would turn it into a simple dumb coffeemaker. And heaven forbid if Bosch decides to stop supporting it in a few years - not that such a thing has ever happened before.

For the second year running, a smart refrigerator has earned top honors for bringing garbage tech into consumers&#39; homes, though this time Samsung is stealing the crown from LG.

In this case, Samsung&#39;s Family Hub Smart Fridge earns double honors for being the worst in show for repairability and the overall worst in show, largely for the same reasons.

As iFixit chief Kyle Wiens explained, the new Samsung Smart Fridge doesn&#39;t actually have any physical handles, and is opened and closed entirely by voice command, quite possibly one of the stupidest things this vulture has ever heard of.

Noisy kitchen? Good luck opening the fridge. Mechanism breaks? Good luck opening the fridge. Internet outage? You know the drill.

As Wiens noted, Samsung has a poor track record when it comes to the quality of its fridges, with touchscreens (of course there&#39;s one on this one, too), compressors, and other components regularly failing.

Digital Right to Repair Coalition executive director Gay Gordon-Byrne said that the Samsung fridge was the worst thing she&#39;d seen at CES this year thanks to its excessive points of failure, connectivity dependence, and the fact that Samsung is serving ads on users&#39; refrigerators.

&quot;The one thing a refrigerator should do is keep things cold,&quot; Gordon-Byrne said. &quot;It needs to do that all the time; it needs to do that without difficulty.&quot;

Gordon-Byrne noted that Samsung&#39;s refrigerator is anything but that, with any number of situations leading to inaccessible food.

&quot;These things should not interfere with your use of a very simple device,&quot; Gordon-Byrne said. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Meta is writing more checks for nuclear investment, even though the new capacity tied to those deals is unlikely to come online until around 2030. The company says it will need the new power to run its hyperscale datacenters.

Facebook&#39;s parent company says it has inked agreements with three outfits - TerraPower and Oklo are developing new reactor technology or building fresh sites, while Vistra is supporting existing nuclear plants. All three will deliver electricity into the grid rather than straight to Meta&#39;s own facilities.

Meta claims that this work is part of ongoing efforts with electric utility companies and power providers to &quot;plan for and meet our energy needs years in advance of our data centers becoming operational.&quot;

Just over a year ago, the social media giant estimated that it would need one to four gigawatts of nuclear power in the future, on top of the energy it already consumes, and put out a request for proposals (RFP) to find firms willing to supply it.

That was followed by today&#39;s agreements with Vistra, TerraPower, and Oklo. Meta claims that these, along with the one signed last June with Constellation Energy, make it one of the largest corporate purchasers of nuclear energy in America, as the three combined will eventually add up to 6.6 GW to the grid.

However, missing from all of this is any mention of cost. We asked Meta how much these agreements are worth, but a spokesperson told us that it does not share the financial details of its clean energy agreements.

The deal with Oklo is for an &quot;advanced nuclear technology campus&quot; in Pike County, Ohio. This is expected to deliver up to 1.2 GW of baseload power to the PJM grid, which Meta says will support its operations in the region. This &quot;may&quot; come online as early as 2030.

Oklo, which is backed by OpenAI kingpin Sam Altman, disclosed in 2024 that it had interest from two major datacenter operators to provide power for them. Equinix signed an agreement last year.

The firm said it will use Meta&#39;s funding to secure nuclear fuel and advance Phase 1 of its Aurora powerhouse deployment. This is the name bestowed on its facilities, which are designed to look more like a Scandinavian log cabin or an art gallery than a power plant.

With TerraPower, the agreement is to support early development for two of the firm&#39;s Natrium reactors and energy storage system plants capable of generating up to 690 MW, plus rights for energy from up to six other units.

Each Natrium reactor is a 345 MW sodium fast reactor, which TerraPower pairs with a molten salt energy storage system designed to deliver gigawatt-scale output. Delivery of the initial units is slated for 2032.

Vistra already operates a number of nuclear power plants, and Meta&#39;s deal with it comprises 20-year power purchase agreements from three of these.

According to Vistra, Meta is paying for about 2.1 GW from the already operating Perry and Davis-Besse plants in Ohio, plus 433 MW of incremental capacity from power uprates at those sites and the Beaver Valley facility in Pennsylvania.

This additional capacity is expected to come online in the early 2030s, supporting the &quot;growing needs in the PJM grid region in the future,&quot; Meta said. In other words, the electricity generated at the plants will continue to flow to the grid.

In the meantime, Meta&#39;s mega server farms will continue to be largely powered by electricity generated using fossil fuels. Even the $10 billion facility it is building in Louisiana will be powered by gas turbines, even though this is not expected to come online until 2030, around the time its atomic investments are set to bear fruit.

As The Register reported last year, nuclear power may be seen as the ideal solution to power the AI-driven datacenter expansion, but build times for atomic plants mean that any additional capacity won&#39;t be ready until the next decade – leaving a gap that needs plugging somehow. ®

            <h2>Debian goes retro with a spatial desktop that time forgot</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/09/desktop_classic_system/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Desktop Classic System is a rather unusual hand-built flavor of Debian featuring a meticulously configured spatial desktop layout and a pleasingly 20th-century look and feel.

DCS, as project creator &quot;Mycophobia&quot; calls it, has been around in one form or another since 2023, but it came to the attention of The Reg FOSS desk thanks to mentions on the Lobste.rs community and a few days later on OSnews.

It&#39;s a minimalist, opinionated setup of Debian 13 &quot;Trixie&quot; with the MATE desktop, specially configured for spatial operation. That itself is a rare thing in the 21st century, but it&#39;s not the only unusual thing about this distro. There&#39;s no ISO image available, just a ZIP file containing the files needed to put on a blank FAT32 USB key to make it bootable.

Incidentally, merely copying some files onto a FAT32 volume isn&#39;t enough to make it bootable using a traditional BIOS – so this is a distro only for installation on real hardware that has UEFI firmware. As a side effect, it will be significantly tricky to try it out in a VM.

We tried it on both new and old Reg FOSS desk testbeds: a modern Dell XPS 13, with a USB-C external display, and a retro ThinkPad W520 with an Nvidia switchable second GPU, which needs version 390 or earlier of the Nvidia binary driver, so it&#39;s unsupported on anything newer than kernel 6.4 or so. It ran fine on both; although it was very slow to start on the ThinkPad, once booted it became snappy and responsive.

The Desktop Classic System in dual-head mode with a portrait monitor – enough to confuse some distros

The distro is a very stripped-back copy of Debian 13 &quot;Trixie&quot; with a customized MATE setup – the stock MATE 1.26 that Debian 13 provides. The distro is very bare. There are no additional apps, not even Firefox. There&#39;s only a mostly empty top panel, without the usual window buttons. It takes about 6 GB of disk and idles at under 800 MB of RAM in use. It&#39;s not a cut-down lightweight distro, it&#39;s just Debian with no extras at all.

The desktop is very sparse and clean, with a layout somewhat in the style of Classic Mac OS – in other words, the original Apple OS for the Mac from 1984 to 2001. No 21st century OS (except possibly Haiku) offers a true spatial metaphor, and as a result, the phrase &quot;spatial desktop&quot; gets misunderstood and misused, as we noted a few years back concerning Zorin OS 17. The Zorin folks interpreted &quot;spatial&quot; to refer to 3D effects for switching between apps and virtual desktops – but that is not the original meaning at all.

The core idea is a desktop that lets you use your spatial memory to navigate. The desktop remembers where you place icons, where windows were and their size and view settings, and when you click on a directory later, its window will reopen the same size in the same place. Mycophobia has described her preference for a spatial desktop and her choice of components at some length. She links to some truly seminal resources on the subject, notably the seriously deep and analytical essays of John Siracusa, the former Mac OS guru at Ars Technica, who wrote a lot about the spatial Finder in the early days of Mac OS X. (We&#39;d be remiss if we didn&#39;t mention the SpatialFinder tool, which attempts to re-enable this behavior on modern macOS.) Mycophobia also links to a piece on The Decline of Usability by Carl Svensson, which eloquently critiques modern UI design.

DCS with lots of Caja (née Nautilus file manager) windows open

This sort of desktop behavior polarizes people. Some people strongly prefer things to stay where they&#39;re put; others are happier with one or two automatically sorted windows. This vulture was extremely fond of Classic Mac OS, but on the other hand, we also like window tiling and self-organizing lists of files.

Either way, as well as writing long polemics about how she likes things, Mycophobia has gone the extra mile: she&#39;s put together a complete distro that you can install and use, configured how she likes it.

It&#39;s an interesting exercise, and we suspect this will appeal strongly to some people. It&#39;s the current Debian, with a very simple clean desktop layout. For instance, rather than MATE&#39;s stock three main menus, it has a single combined Windows-style one provided by the Brisk menu. We used the built-in extrepo command to add the Mozilla Debian-package repository and installed the latest Firefox:

And that was all it took: we were online, with a current browser. We added Chrome, Pandoc, and Panwriter, and were ready to get some work done.

By contemporary standards, the desktop setup is strange in several ways. Firstly, some standard MATE features have been turned off. There&#39;s no Win95-style row of window buttons. The closest thing is the MATE &quot;Window Selector&quot; applet, a discreet little icon in the notification area. That&#39;s OK with us. This vulture started using Macs when System 6 was still current, we still like Classic Mac OS today, and it has no graphical window switcher either.

Window title bars are sparse too. There&#39;s a close box at the right end, as is fairly standard these days. On the left are two buttons we see much less. The leftmost is a &quot;roll up&quot; button, which acts like a roller-blind: it collapses the window into its own title bar, leaving nothing else on screen. A few decades ago, many Mac users added this to Mac OS with an addon called WindowShades. It&#39;s a viable alternative to the minimize function that the influence of Microsoft Windows has made ubiquitous – but unless you neaten them into a staggered array, it can leave you with a cluttered collection of title bars. To the right of this is a button labeled &quot;Always On Visible Workspace.&quot; This pins the window so that it remains visible even when you switch virtual desktops. This vulture happens to prefer multiple physical screens to virtual ones, but if you hop between virtual desktops a lot then this could be handy.

And that&#39;s your lot. There are no maximize or minimize controls here. Less visibly, there&#39;s no snapping of windows to screen edges either. We liked the Aero Snap feature but we do understand that many people hated it, and Mycophobia seems to be one.

This leaves a big hole. Literally. The panel is almost empty – a Start menu on the left, a notification area on the right, and a yawning gap between them. Unlike Mac OS, there&#39;s no global menu bar. Again, like window snapping, this is a feature that some people like and others hate. We like them, so we tried to add them by installing the relevant MATE applet with apt install mate-applet-appmenu and added it to the panel. After a reboot, some apps used it, including Chrome and Panwriter, but more config is needed to get standard MATE accessories to use it. It may be that Mycophobia just doesn&#39;t like it, or that it doesn&#39;t integrate well. We noticed that it made the Brisk menu flicker sometimes, and although we enabled Firefox&#39;s global menu support, some menu options were inaccessible – the menus closed before we could reach some entries.

The fact that Chrome, which normally has a hamburger menu and no menu bar at all, picks up and automatically uses this feature when it&#39;s enabled shows that this can work. We wish distro makers put a bit more effort into polishing the rough edges of this existing functionality, and make it an option that can just be turned on and off, as it was in Unity. KDE Plasma really needs this option since too many of its apps are riddled with hamburger menus. We feel that the Desktop Classic System needs this option too. An ISO file and legacy-BIOS support would also be good to have.

These things aside, though, we rather like what we see here, and think it might appeal to quite a few people looking to escape the chaotic mess that is desktop UI design in the 2020s. ®

X claims the NMPA and music publishers attempted to pressure the platform into industrywide licensing deals.

X is suing music publishers and their trade group, the National Music Publishers’ Association (NMPA), accusing them of attempted coercion in their ongoing battle over licensing, as reported earlier by The Hollywood Reporter. The Elon Musk-owned platform accuses music publishers of colluding with the NMPA to “coerce X into taking licenses to musical works from the industry as a whole, denying X the benefit of competition between music publishers.”

In the antitrust lawsuit filed on Friday, X claims that the NMPA and music publishers “weaponized” the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) with requests to take down allegedly infringing content. The lawsuit claims that in 2021, the NMPA began “bombarding X with takedown notices every single week related to thousands of posts,” to “gain leverage and pressure X” into industrywide licensing deals.

X has had problems with copyright and piracy following Musk’s takeover. In 2023, for example, the entire Super Mario Bros. Movie kept getting posted to X.

This filing is the latest wrinkle in a years-long legal battle between X and the NMPA, which sued X for $250 million in 2023 for “massive” copyright infringement involving more than 1,700 songs.. A judge upheld parts of the still-pending lawsuit in 2024, and a November 2025 filing stated X and the NMPA “have made very substantial progress toward settlement,” according to The Hollywood Reporter.

X is asking the court for monetary damages and for the judge to block the NMPA from allegedly forcing X to collectively negotiate with the publishers.

            <div id="article-text">﻿With Apple staying quiet on the Bluetooth feature, this solution adds the functionality to the iPhone.

﻿With Apple staying quiet on the Bluetooth feature, this solution adds the functionality to the iPhone.

One of the issues holding Auracast back from wider mainstream use is some companies’ lack of support for the Bluetooth technology — Apple being a prime example. With iOS having 58 percent of the market share in North America and nearly 28 percent worldwide, a decision by Apple to enable native Auracast support would potentially put millions of Auracast devices into the world with a firmware update. As of yet, Apple has made no comment on Auracast, and I’m not hopeful that we’ll get one anytime soon.

But the audio technology company Atitan thinks it has the solution. It’s developing a small disc-shaped transceiver — the splitR — that can attach to an iPhone’s MagSafe and turn it into an Auracast device capable of either transmitting or receiving an Auracast broadcast. The company’s connectR app, which will be available on both the Apple App Store and Google Play this coming summer, will allow you to see broadcasts around you, your connected devices, and create your own Auracast channels or group listening sessions. You’ll be able to interact with all of your streaming platforms to play songs and playlists. Atitan is adding in a social component, too, allowing posts and chats with friends.

The splitR isn’t meant just for an Apple device, though. While the device will fit a MagSafe connection (although the early version I saw was still a little small for one), you can connect any non-Auracast product to it with a USB-C or 3.5mm cable to give that device Auracast capability. And Atitan tells me the next iteration will be able to pair wirelessly to translate a classic Bluetooth connection into a Bluetooth LE Auracast transmission.

The splitR can connect to a speaker to play content from your phone or Auracast-capable TV, or your turntable setup to send an Auracast broadcast out to play on headphones or speakers. If you get enough splitR transceivers, you could create an entire whole-home Auracast system. And unlike some Auracast-compatible companies that restrict their devices to work only within their ecosystem, the splitR broadcasts are open to any Auracast headphones or speakers allowed to receive them.

What I saw during my demo at CES was encouraging. Beyond sharing music broadcasts with friends, Auracast has the potential to help those in need of hearing assistance, either while out and about at concerts, airports, church, or lectures or just at home watching TV. The more Auracast can get into products — either natively or with adapters like the splitR — the more its accessibility uses become mainstream.

Other Auracast transmitters on the market that I have tried can be clunky to use, but the Atitan team is invested in making a product that’s easy to use and brings all your services and devices together in a single app. The company will be launching a Kickstarter campaign in the next few months for the splitR transceiver and currently has a waitlist for the connectR app.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/859994/ai-collectibles-funko-pops-amiibo-buddyo-heymates-ces-2026">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI toys, companions, and robots have been everywhere at CES this year, but among the horde of waddling plushies and light-up emoji eyes, two stood out to me. HeyMates and Buddyo are each betting that the collectible figurine boom is going to come back with an AI-powered vengeance, letting us chat to sports stars and superheroes from our desks.

The core concept to both is this: Take a cutesy figurine and stick it onto a smart base with a speaker, microphone, and maybe a flashing ring of light or two. Then use an accompanying app to power a basic LLM chatbot based on the figurine, so you can talk to Albert Einstein about relativity, or Darth Vader about crushing dissident forces, with some fun wake words and a cheesy joke or two.

Beyond that, the two startups I met this week differ. Olli is the more established of the two. It already provides its AI-driven BuddyOS to a number of other toy companies, but it now wants to build its own devices. With that in mind, it’s launching HeyMates, Funko-esque figurines with RFID chips in their bases, which become interactive AI characters when placed on the accompanying stand.

Olli intends to launch HeyMates on Kickstarter later this year, starting with three figurines: Einstein, who chats about science and creativity; Zara, a tarot reader who gives advice with a hint of mysticism; and Chandler, a bold choice of name for a toy who “brings the dry, sarcastic charm of a ’90s sitcom character,” given the 2023 death of Friends star Matthew Perry.

The company wants to build its own toys for the sake of creative control, and to get ahead of what CEO Hai Ta predicts is a market about to boom, with imitators and rivals likely on the way. He sees a future involving licensed characters and celebrity likenesses, along with Olli’s own line of HeyMates IP. In short, he wants to build the next Funko Pops, but make it AI.

Yijia Zhang, CEO of Buddyo, sees things differently. He doesn’t want to replace Funko Pops, but build a platform that might sit alongside them. In fact, it’s not even Funko Pops he really has in mind, but Nintendo’s Amiibo. Zhang describes himself as a Nintendo “superfan,” and Buddyo is his effort to get more out of his own Amiibo collection.

Instead of selling figurines, Buddyo is launching a stand it calls an AI Pod, with a slot the exact size of a standard Amiibo base. The Pod uses the same NFC tech as Nintendo’s figurines to recognize specific characters, and Buddyo will also sell its own NFC-equipped bases onto which you can place Funko Pops, bobbleheads, and (of course) Labubus, with plans for a larger Pod down the line capable of supporting bigger figures.

Since existing figurines don’t come with chatbot personalities baked in, Buddyo has developed an app to create a character for each figurine. Take a photo and give the character a name, and the app’s AI will analyze it, pulling up a backstory and personality. It’s capable of recognizing existing IP, so it knew that Stitch was a cartoon alien, and that Mario is a plumber with a questionable Italian accent who loves to say “It’s-a-me!” And it does deliver that exact accent, letting you pick the voice from a library of different sounds including sound samples matching copyrighted characters. Zhang is quick to emphasize these are all provided by the community, not the company, a loophole he clearly hopes will keep the infamously litigious Nintendo at bay.

Zhang’s background is in AI — he was once a software engineer at Google, working on Google Assistant, and currently heads up an AI and platforms team at Plaud. Perhaps that explains his focus on building an AI platform and base, rather than designing new toys from scratch. But he says it’s also about taking advantage of the fact that people already have a “deep connection” with their collections, which would be missing from new toys or new IP.

Once they’re up and running, HeyMates and Buddyo feel similar. Both emphasize fun, lighthearted chitchat with the AI avatars — “tell me a joke” remains everyone’s favorite demo question — though Zhang says Buddyo’s hybrid ChatGPT / Gemini AI stack can be used as a full AI assistant, just with a little more character. That’s not an option with HeyMates, which are each designed to do one thing well, with plans down the line for specific figurines to chat about movies, or cooking, or K-pop.

It’s still an open question whether there’s a meaningful market for AI toys and chatbot companions, but combining the tech with collectibles is the most convincing case I’ve seen yet.

Neither HeyMates nor Buddyo has any involvement from Funko, which has its own problems to deal with — just two months ago it warned investors that there was “substantial doubt” over its ability to continue operating, as sales slow and tariffs bite. Will we see a desperate Funko turn to AI for its salvation, or will its inaction provide the opening for a new company to take over the space? Either way, it’s clear chatty collectibles are coming — and soon.

﻿X’s deepfake porn feature clearly violates app store guidelines. Why won’t Apple and Google pull it?

Since X’s users started using Grok to undress women and children using deepfake images, I have been waiting for what I assumed would be inevitable: X getting booted from Apple’s and Google’s app stores. The fact that it hasn’t happened yet tells me something serious about Silicon Valley’s leadership: Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai are spineless cowards who are terrified of Elon Musk.

Here’s the relevant Apple App Store developer guideline: “Apps should not include content that is offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, in exceptionally poor taste, or just plain creepy.” Huh! How about that.

They sold their principles for power, and now they don’t even control their own companies

Here’s Google’s version of the same guideline, which is even clearer: “Apps that do not prohibit users from creating, uploading, or distributing content that facilitates the exploitation or abuse of children will be subject to immediate removal from Google Play. This includes all child sexual abuse materials.”

But booting X from these app stores for its flagrant violation of policy means upsetting Musk and the entire right-wing media ecosystem he controls through X — and with it, directly upsetting the clout-chasing content vampires who currently run the United States. Cook’s Apple has a massive dependency on China, and smartphones, computers, and chips are currently exempt from the tariffs on China. Cook can present Donald Trump with as many golden gifts as he wants, but those tariffs don’t have to stay that way.

Google’s Pichai is similarly weak. Trump has threatened Google numerous times over his placement in search results, and so far YouTube has managed to mostly avoid scrutiny over its content moderation policies because Pichai has been content to coddle Trump with promises that everything he does is the biggest thing in Google search history. Google also can’t risk upsetting Trump while AI policy remains deeply contested, and having an unhappy Musk influencing that policy is a nightmare of corruption.

This is the trap these men have gotten themselves into: They sold their principles for power, and now they don’t even control their own companies. Welcome to gangster tech regulation!

Apple’s lawyers heavily implied that a naked bananaman called Mr. Peely was somehow inappropriate for court

Apple and Google did not respond to requests for comment.

Less than five years ago, I sat through the interminable Epic v. Apple antitrust trial. Real heads will remember that Apple’s lawyers heavily implied that a naked bananaman called Mr. Peely was somehow inappropriate for court. This came after a week where Apple argued that an indie storefront that users could install via Epic was a problem because it hosted porny games, calling games on Itch.io “offensive and sexualized.”

You know what’s “offensive and sexualized,” you worthless fucking cowards? Nonconsensual AI-generated images of women in bikinis spreading their legs, and of children with so-called “donut glaze” on their faces — which, by the way, were being generated at a rate of one per minute. I’d also call that “offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, in exceptionally poor taste” and especially “just plain creepy”! Do you need a back brace to stand up straight, buddy? Because at this point, I am certain you haven’t got a single vertebra.

Hey, does anyone else remember when Tumblr got booted from the App Store over pornographic images of children? I guess the real problem was that Tumblr wasn’t owned by Musk, not its violation of App Store policy. Whoopsie!

Can Apple and Google even identify their values beyond their commitment to “shareholder value”?

It is genuinely unbelievable to me that I wasted hours of my actual life on a court case where Apple explained it needed total control of its App Store to protect its users. Total control of the App Store was Apple’s main argument against antitrust enforcement: The company insisted that its monopolistic control of what users could install on their phones was essential to create a walled garden where it could protect children from unsafe content.

Does Google have the same problem with its app store, Google Play? Of course it does, and of course it has made all the same arguments as Apple, although it does allow sideloading apps on Android. But it still hasn’t enforced its rules and pushed X to alternative app stores. Why? Hey Google, show me the photo of Sundar Pichai giggling with Elon Musk at Donald Trump’s inauguration!

The only consolation here is that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg almost certainly has steam coming out of his ears. Remember when Apple yanked Meta’s App Store enterprise certificate because it was taking too much data? Ah yes, those were the days. At this point, it kinda seems like Alex Roman wasn’t the only Apple witness brazenly lying on the stand.

I never want to hear any moral grandstanding from these boys ever again. The next time Tim Cook says “privacy is a human right,” the only possible response is to laugh in his face. I mean, Apple and Google are fine distributing an app that has created an undressed image Grok made of Renee Nicole Good, the mother who was shot by ICE in Minneapolis. How do you plan to defend getting rid of the ICEBlock app while allowing X to generate degrading images of a woman ICE killed? Can Apple and Google even identify their values beyond their commitment to “shareholder value”? What’s your fucking endgame here, guys?

So many possibilities when two bricks know one another’s exact relative position.

We just gave the Lego Smart Brick our Best In Show award at CES 2026, and I wanted to stop by The Lego Group’s suite to get a last glimpse before I left Las Vegas.

To my surprise, the company showed off one more feature I didn’t see during my first demo, perhaps the most impressive one should these bricks make their way to adult builders: precise distance measurement.

Lego Group design manager Maarten Simons whipped out a “Lego ruler” made of standard Lego bricks divided into segments that were each 10 Lego studs, or roughly 8cm (3.15 inches) long. He attached a Smart Brick to one end of the ruler, and dragged a second Smart Brick along its length. The Smart Bricks changed color every time another 10 ten studs was passed, exactly at the dividing lines of each segment.

Simons then moved the Smart Bricks away from the ruler and performed the same trick. Using just a pair of Smart Bricks, he was able to measure the distance between two points in 2D and 3D space. Simons says the bricks can accurately track each other’s position at distances of up to roughly 4 to 5 meters (12–16 feet) away.

Then, Simons rotated a brick in midair, and we watched it light up as soon as it was precisely facing the other brick.

From previous briefings, I already knew the bricks could tell their own orientation and if they were relatively closer or further from each other. But it’s clearly more powerful than that, with more potential than the first three Lego Star Wars sets will offer on launch day (assuming these precision features work in the real world with all its forms of wireless interference).

The Lego Star Wars sets very intentionally let kids blast each other’s ships without them truly facing each other, because the company’s research shows kids prefer that. But it clearly doesn’t have to be that way. Low-hanging fruit: future Lego creations could have a precise blasting game.

They might have potential in Lego robots too. Lego Mindstorms was one of the toymaker’s most sophisticated building sets, but even with drag-and-drop programming capabilities, its complexity limited its appeal to kids. With the Smart Brick’s ability to know its location and orientation around other Smart Bricks, Lego robots could possibly navigate obstacles built with Smart Tags, or autonomously find their way back to base stations without the need for detailed programming, cameras for sensing, or pricier components like the Mindstorms’ Intelligent Brick.

Lego’s being extremely quiet about future plans for its new Smart Play system, but it’s getting more and more interesting, with more potential uses, as the company reveals what the bricks are capable of.

            <div id="article-text">Emoji reactions have been hiding at the bottom of your personal Gmail messages for over two years, and now they’re coming to Workspace by default.

Emoji reactions have been hiding at the bottom of your personal Gmail messages for over two years, and now they’re coming to Workspace by default.

Google rolled out emoji reactions to personal Gmail accounts a little over two years ago, and I completely forgot about it until now — probably because the option is hidden within a small, smiley face icon beside the Forward button. But now, Google is bringing emoji reactions to all Workspace users by default on February 9th, reminding me of their existence (and all the times I could’ve replied with a “thumbs-up” instead of a full-blown message).

Selecting the inconspicuous smiley face button displays a range of emoji you can use in place of a written response. If your recipient is another Gmail user, they’ll see your reaction at the bottom of the email, as well as see the emoji as an update to the thread in their inbox. People using other email providers — or if they have emoji reactions disabled — will receive a separate email saying that you “reacted via Gmail.” Google introduced emoji reactions as an opt-in feature for Workspace users last April, so you may have seen them attached to your work email before this announcement.

Additionally, emails sent to multiple people will show how many people reacted to the message, and with which emoji. You can also hover over each reaction to see who it was from. As noted by Google, you won’t see the emoji reaction option for all emails, including if the message was sent to a group email list, if there are more than 20 recipients, or if you’ve “already sent more than 20 reactions to the same message” (lol).

Now that I know this feature exists again, I’m still not sure if I’m going to use it. Choosing an emoji might be easier than saying, “Thanks,” but I’m not sure if I’m ready to make my emails sound more like my text messages.

How I learned to stop worrying and love AI slop

If I were to locate the moment AI slop broke through into popular consciousness, I’d pick the video of rabbits bouncing on a trampoline that went viral last summer. For many savvy internet users, myself included, it was the first time we were fooled by an AI video, and it ended up spawning a wave of almost identical generated clips.

My first reaction was that, broadly speaking, all of this sucked. That’s become a familiar refrain, in think pieces and at dinner parties. Everything online is slop now—the internet “enshittified,” with AI taking much of the blame. Initially, I largely agreed. But then friends started sharing AI clips in group chats that were compellingly weird, or funny. Some even had a grain of brilliance.

I had to admit I didn’t fully understand what I was rejecting—what I found so objectionable. To try to get to the bottom of how I felt (and why), I spoke to the people making the videos, a company creating bespoke tools for creators, and experts who study how new media becomes culture. What I found convinced me that maybe generative AI will not end up ruining everything after all. Read the full story.

A new CRISPR startup is betting regulators will ease up on gene-editingHere at MIT Technology Review we’ve been writing about the gene-editing technology CRISPR since 2013, calling it the biggest biotech breakthrough of the century. Yet so far, there’s been only one gene-editing drug approved, and it’s been used commercially on only about 40 patients, all with sickle-cell disease.It’s becoming clear that the impact of CRISPR isn’t as big as we all hoped. In fact, there’s a pall of discouragement over the entire field—with some journalists saying the gene-editing revolution has “lost its mojo.”So what will it take for CRISPR to help more people? A new startup says the answer could be an “umbrella approach” to testing and commercializing treatments which could avoid costly new trials or approvals for every new version. Read the full story.

America’s new dietary guidelines ignore decades of scientific research

The first days of 2026 have brought big news for health. On Wednesday, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his colleagues at the Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture unveiled new dietary guidelines for Americans. And they are causing a bit of a stir.That’s partly because they recommend products like red meat, butter, and beef tallow—foods that have been linked to cardiovascular disease, and that nutrition experts have been recommending people limit in their diets.These guidelines are a big deal—they influence food assistance programs and school lunches, for example. Let’s take a look at the good, the bad, and the ugly advice being dished up to Americans by their government.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Here at MIT Technology Review we’ve been writing about the gene-editing technology CRISPR since 2013, calling it the biggest biotech breakthrough of the century. Yet so far, there’s been only one gene-editing drug approved. It’s been used commercially on only about 40 patients, all with sickle-cell disease.

It’s becoming clear that the impact of CRISPR isn’t as big as we all hoped. In fact, there’s a pall of discouragement over the entire field—with some journalists saying the gene-editing revolution has “lost its mojo.”

So what will it take for CRISPR to help more people? A new startup says the answer could be an “umbrella approach” to testing and commercializing treatments. Aurora Therapeutics, which has $16 million from Menlo Ventures and counts CRISPR co-inventor Jennifer Doudna as an advisor, essentially hopes to win approval for gene-editing drugs that can be slightly adjusted, or personalized, without requiring costly new trials or approvals for every new version.

The need to change regulations around gene-editing treatments was endorsed in November by the head of the US Food and Drug Administration, Martin Makary, who said the agency would open a “new” regulatory pathway for “bespoke, personalized therapies” that can’t easily be tested in conventional ways.

Aurora’s first target, the rare inherited disease phenylketonuria, also known as PKU, is a case in point. People with PKU lack a working version of an enzyme needed to use up the amino acid phenylalanine, a component of pretty much all meat and protein. If the amino acid builds up, it causes brain damage. So patients usually go on an onerous “diet for life” of special formula drinks and vegetables.

In theory, gene editing can fix PKU. In mice, scientists have already restored the gene for the enzyme by rewriting DNA in liver cells, which both make the enzyme and are some of the easiest to reach with a gene-editing drug. The problem is that in human patients, many different mutations can affect the critical gene. According to Cory Harding, a researcher at Oregon Health Sciences University, scientists know about 1,600 different DNA mutations that cause PKU.

There’s no way anyone will develop 1,600 different gene-editing drugs. Instead, Aurora’s goal is to eventually win approval for a single gene editor that, with minor adjustments, could be used to correct several of the most common mutations, including one that’s responsible for about 10% of the estimated 20,000 PKU cases in the US.

“We can’t have a separate clinical trial for each mutation,” says Edward Kaye, the CEO of Aurora. “The way the FDA approves gene editing has to change, and I think they’ve been very understanding that is the case.”

A gene editor is a special protein that can zero in on a specific location in the genome and change it. To prepare one, Aurora will put genetic code for the editor into a nanoparticle along with a targeting molecule. In total, it will involve about 5,000 gene letters. But only 20 of them need to change in order to redirect the treatment to repair a different mutation.

“Over 99% of the drug stays the same,” says Johnny Hu, a partner at Menlo Ventures, which put up the funding for the startup.

The new company came together after Hu met over pizza with Fyodor Urnov, an outspoken gene-editing scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, who is Aurora’s cofounder and sits on its board.

In 2022, Urnov had written a New York Times editorial bemoaning the “chasm” between what editing technology can do and the “legal, financial, and organizational” realities preventing researchers from curing people.

“I went to Fyodor and said, ‘Hey, we’re getting all these great results in the clinic with CRISPR, but why hasn’t it scaled?” says Hu. Part of the reason is that most gene-editing companies are chasing the same few conditions, such as sickle-cell, where (as luck would have it) a single edit works for all patients. But that leaves around 400 million people who have 7,000 other inherited conditions without much hope to get their DNA fixed, Urnov estimated in his editorial.

Then, last May, came the dramatic demonstration of the first fully “personalized” gene-editing treatment. A team in Philadelphia, assisted by Urnov and others, succeeded in correcting the DNA of a baby, named KJ Muldoon, who had an entirely unique mutation that caused a metabolic disease. Though it didn’t target PKU, the project showed that gene editing could theoretically fix some inherited diseases “on demand.”

It also underscored a big problem. Treating a single child required a large team and cost millions in time, effort, and materials—all to create a drug that would never be used again.

That’s exactly the sort of situation the new “umbrella” trials are supposed to address. Kiran Musunuru, who co-led the team at the University of Pennsylvania, says he’s been in discussions with the FDA to open a study of bespoke gene editors this year focusing on diseases of the type Baby KJ had, called urea cycle disorders. Each time a new patient appears, he says, they’ll try to quickly put together a variant of their gene-editing drug that’s tuned to fix that child’s particular genetic problem.

Musunuru, who isn’t involved with Aurora, does not think the company’s plans for PKU count as fully personalized editors. “These corporate PKU efforts have nothing whatsoever to do with Baby KJ,” he says. He says his center continues to focus on mutations “so ultra-rare that we don’t see any scenario where a for-profit gene-editing company would find that indication to be commercially viable.”

Instead, what’s occurring in PKU, says Musunuru, is that researchers have realized they can assemble “a bunch” of the most frequent mutations “into a large enough group of patients to make a platform PKU therapy commercially viable.”

While that would still leave out many patients with extra-rare gene errors, Musunuru says any gene-editing treatment at all would still be “a big improvement over the status quo, which  is zero genetic therapies for PKU.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The new year has barely begun, but the first days of 2026 have brought big news for health. On Monday, the US’s federal health agency upended its recommendations for routine childhood vaccinations—a move that health associations worry puts children at unnecessary risk of preventable disease.

There was more news from the federal government on Wednesday, when health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his colleagues at the Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture unveiled new dietary guidelines for Americans. And they are causing a bit of a stir.

That’s partly because they recommend products like red meat, butter, and beef tallow—foods that have been linked to cardiovascular disease, and that nutrition experts have been recommending people limit in their diets.

These guidelines are a big deal—they influence food assistance programs and school lunches, for example. So this week let’s look at the good, the bad, and the ugly advice being dished up to Americans by their government.

The government dietary guidelines have been around since the 1980s. They are updated every five years, in a process that typically involves a team of nutrition scientists who have combed over scientific research for years. That team will first publish its findings in a scientific report, and, around a year later, the finalized Dietary Guidelines for Americans are published.

The last guidelines covered the period 2020 to 2025, and new guidelines were expected in the summer of 2025. Work had already been underway for years; the scientific report intended to inform them was published back in 2024. But the publication of the guidelines was delayed by last year’s government shutdown, Kennedy said last year. They were finally published yesterday.

Nutrition experts had been waiting with bated breath. Nutrition science has evolved slightly over the last five years, and some were expecting to see new recommendations. Research now suggests, for example, that there is no “safe” level of alcohol consumption.

We are also beginning to learn more about health risks associated with some ultraprocessed foods (although we still don’t have a good understanding of what they might be, or what even counts as “ultraprocessed”.) And some scientists were expecting to see the new guidelines factor in environmental sustainability, says Gabby Headrick, the associate director of food and nutrition policy at George Washington University’s Institute for Food Safety & Nutrition Security in Washington DC.

Many of the recommendations are sensible. The guidelines recommend a diet rich in whole foods, particularly fresh fruits and vegetables. They recommend avoiding highly processed foods and added sugars. They also highlight the importance of dietary protein, whole grains, and “healthy” fats.

But not all of them are, says Headrick. The guidelines open with a “new pyramid” of foods. This inverted triangle is topped with “protein, dairy, and healthy fats” on one side and “vegetables and fruits” on the other.

There are a few problems with this image. For starters, its shape—nutrition scientists have long moved on from the food pyramids of the 1990s, says Headrick. They’re confusing and make it difficult for people to understand what the contents of their plate should look like. That’s why scientists now use an image of a plate to depict a healthy diet.

“We&#39;ve been using MyPlate to describe the dietary guidelines in a very consumer-friendly, nutrition-education-friendly way for over the last decade now,” says Headrick. (The UK’s National Health Service takes a similar approach.)

And then there’s the content of that food pyramid. It puts a significant focus on meat and whole-fat dairy produce. The top left image—the one most viewers will probably see first—is of a steak. Smack in the middle of the pyramid is a stick of butter. That’s new. And it’s not a good thing.

While both red meat and whole-fat dairy can certainly form part of a healthy diet, nutrition scientists have long been recommending that most people try to limit their consumption of these foods. Both can be high in saturated fat, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease—the leading cause of death in the US. In 2015, on the basis of limited evidence, the World Health Organization classified red meat as “probably carcinogenic to humans.”

Also concerning is the document’s definition of “healthy fats,” which includes butter and beef tallow (a MAHA favorite). Neither food is generally considered to be as healthy as olive oil, for example. While olive oil contains around two grams of saturated fat per tablespoon, a tablespoon of beef tallow has around six grams of saturated fat, and the same amount of butter contains around seven grams of saturated fat, says Headrick.

“I think these are pretty harmful dietary recommendations to be making when we have established that those specific foods likely do not have health-promoting benefits,” she adds.

Red meat is not exactly a sustainable food, and neither are dairy products. And the advice on alcohol is relatively vague, recommending that people “consume less alcohol for better overall health” (which might leave you wondering: Less than what?).

There are other questionable recommendations in the guidelines. Americans are advised to include more protein in their diets—at levels between 1.2 and 1.6 grams daily per kilo of body weight, 50% to 100% more than recommended in previous guidelines. There’s a risk that increasing protein consumption to such levels could raise a person’s intake of both calories and saturated fats to unhealthy levels, says José Ordovás, a senior nutrition scientist at Tufts University. “I would err on the low side,” he says.

Some nutrition scientists are questioning why these changes have been made. It’s not as though the new recommendations were in the 2024 scientific report. And the evidence on red meat and saturated fat hasn’t changed, says Headrick.

In reporting this piece, I contacted many contributors to the previous guidelines, and some who had led research for 2024’s scientific report. None of them agreed to comment on the new guidelines on the record. Some seemed disgruntled. One merely told me that the process by which the new guidelines had been created was “opaque.”

“These people invested a lot of their time, and they did a thorough job [over] a couple of years, identifying [relevant scientific studies],” says Ordovás. “I’m not surprised that when they see that [their] work was ignored and replaced with something [put together] quickly, that they feel a little bit disappointed,” he says.

Researchers are getting organoids pregnant with human embryos

At first glance, it looks like the start of a human pregnancy: A ball-shaped embryo presses into the lining of the uterus then grips tight, burrowing in as the first tendrils of a future placenta appear. This is implantation—the moment that pregnancy officially begins.

Only none of it is happening inside a body. These images were captured in a Beijing laboratory, inside a microfluidic chip, as scientists watched the scene unfold.

In three recent papers published by Cell Press, scientists report what they call the most accurate efforts yet to mimic the first moments of pregnancy in the lab. They’ve taken human embryos from IVF centers and let these merge with “organoids” made of endometrial cells, which form the lining of the uterus. Read our story about their work, and what might come next.

LLMs contain a LOT of parameters. But what’s a parameter?

A large language model’s parameters are often said to be the dials and levers that control how it behaves. Think of a planet-size pinball machine that sends its balls pinging from one end to the other via billions of paddles and bumpers set just so. Tweak those settings and the balls will behave in a different way.

OpenAI’s GPT-3, released in 2020, had 175 billion parameters. Google DeepMind’s latest LLM, Gemini 3, may have at least a trillion—some think it’s probably more like 7 trillion—but the company isn’t saying. (With competition now fierce, AI firms no longer share information about how their models are built.)

But the basics of what parameters are and how they make LLMs do the remarkable things that they do are the same across different models. Ever wondered what makes an LLM really tick—what’s behind the colorful pinball-machine metaphors? Let’s dive in.

What new legal challenges mean for the future of US offshore wind

For offshore wind power in the US, the new year is bringing new legal battles.

On December 22, the Trump administration announced it would pause the leases of five wind farms currently under construction off the US East Coast. Developers were ordered to stop work immediately.

The cited reason? Concerns that turbines can cause radar interference. But that’s a known issue, and developers have worked with the government to deal with it for years.

Companies have been quick to file lawsuits, and the court battles could begin as soon as this week. Here’s what the latest kerfuffle might mean for the US’s struggling offshore wind industry.

Inside the strange limbo facing millions of IVF embryosMillions of embryos created through IVF sit frozen in time, stored in cryopreservation tanks around the world. The number is only growing thanks to advances in technology, the rising popularity of IVF, and improvements in its success rates.At a basic level, an embryo is simply a tiny ball of a hundred or so cells. But unlike other types of body tissue, it holds the potential for life. Many argue that this endows embryos with a special moral status, one that requires special protections.The problem is that no one can really agree on what that status is. So while these embryos persist in suspended animation, patients, clinicians, embryologists, and legislators must grapple with the essential question of what we should do with them.

            <h2>Using unstructured data to fuel enterprise AI success</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/08/1129506/using-unstructured-data-to-fuel-enterprise-ai-success/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Enterprises are sitting on vast quantities of unstructured data, from call records and video footage to customer complaint histories and supply chain signals. Yet this invaluable business intelligence, estimated to make up as much as 90% of the data generated by organizations, historically remained dormant because its unstructured nature makes analysis extremely difficult.

But if managed and centralized effectively, this messy and often voluminous data is not only a precious asset for training and optimizing next-generation AI systems, enhancing their accuracy, context, and adaptability, it can also deliver profound insights that drive real business outcomes.

A compelling example of this can be seen in the US NBA basketball team the Charlotte Hornets who successfully leveraged untapped video footage of gameplay—previously too copious to watch and too unstructured to analyze—to identify a new competition-winning recruit. However, before that data could deliver results, analysts working for the team first had to overcome the critical challenge of preparing the raw, unstructured footage for interpretation.

Unstructured data presents inherent difficulties due to its widely varying format, quality, and reliability, requiring specialized tools like natural language processing and AI to make sense of it.

Every organization’s pool of unstructured data also contains domain-specific characteristics and terminology that generic AI models may not automatically understand. A financial services firm, for example, cannot simply use a general language model for fraud detection. Instead, it needs to adapt the model to understand regulatory language, transaction patterns, industry-specific risk indicators, and unique company context like data policies.

The challenge intensifies when integrating multiple data sources with varying structures and quality standards, as teams may struggle to distinguish valuable data from noise.

When the Charlotte Hornets set out to identify a new draft pick for their team, they turned to AI tools including computer vision to analyze raw game footage from smaller leagues, which exist outside the tiers of the game normally visible to NBA scouts and, therefore, are not as readily available for analysis.

“Computer vision is a tool that has existed for some time, but I think the applicability in this age of AI is increasing rapidly,” says Jordan Cealey, senior vice president at AI company Invisible Technologies, which worked with the Charlotte Hornets on this project. “You can now take data sources that you&#39;ve never been able to consume, and provide an analytical layer that&#39;s never existed before.”

By deploying a variety of computer vision techniques, including object and player tracking, movement pattern analysis, and geometrically mapping points on the court, the team was able to extract kinematic data, such as the coordinates of players during movement, and generate metrics like speed and explosiveness to acceleration.

This provided the team with rich, data-driven insights about individual players, helping them to identify and select a new draft whose skill and techniques filled a hole in the Charlotte Hornets’ own capabilities. The chosen athlete went on to be named the most valuable player at the 2025 NBA Summer League and helped the team win their first summer championship title.

Before data from game footage can be used, it needs to be labeled so the model can interpret it. The x and y coordinates of the individual players, seen here in bounding boxes, as well as other features in the scene, are annotated so the model can identify individuals and track their movements through time.

From this successful example, several lessons can be learned. First, unstructured data must be prepared for AI models through intuitive forms of collection, and the right data pipelines and management records. “You can only utilize unstructured data once your structured data is consumable and ready for AI,” says Cealey. “You cannot just throw AI at a problem without doing the prep work.”

For many organizations, this might mean they need to find partners that offer the technical support to fine-tune models to the context of the business. The traditional technology consulting approach, in which an external vendor leads a digital transformation plan over a lengthy timeframe, is not fit for purpose here as AI is moving too fast and solutions need to be configured to a company’s current business reality.

Forward-deployed engineers (FDEs) are an emerging partnership model better suited to the AI era. Initially popularized by Palantir, the FDE model connects product and engineering capabilities directly to the customer’s operational environment. FDEs work closely with customers on-site to understand the context behind a technology initiative before a solution is built.

“We couldn&#39;t do what we do without our FDEs,” says Cealey. “They go out and fine-tune the models, working with our human annotation team to generate a ground truth dataset that can be used to validate or improve the performance of the model in production.”

Second, data needs to be understood within its own context, which requires models to be carefully calibrated to the use case. “You can&#39;t assume that an out-of-the-box computer vision model is going to give you better inventory management, for example, by taking that open source model and applying it to whatever your unstructured data feeds are,” says Cealey. “You need to fine-tune it so it gives you the data exports in the format you want and helps your aims. That&#39;s where you start to see high-performative models that can then actually generate useful data insights.”

For the Hornets, Invisible used five foundation models, which the team fine-tuned to context-specific data. This included teaching the models to understand that they were “looking at” a basketball court as opposed to, say, a football field; to understand how a game of basketball works differently from any other sport the model might have knowledge of (including how many players are on each team); and to understand how to spot rules like “out of bounds.” Once fine-tuned, the models were able to capture subtle and complex visual scenarios, including highly accurate object detection, tracking, postures, and spatial mapping.

Lastly, while the AI technology mix available to companies changes by the day, they cannot eschew old-fashioned commercial metrics: clear goals. Without clarity on the business purpose, AI pilot programs can easily turn into open-ended, meandering research projects that prove expensive in terms of compute, data costs, and staffing.

“The best engagements we have seen are when people know what they want,” Cealey observes. “The worst is when people say ‘we want AI’ but have no direction. In these situations, they are on an endless pursuit without a map.”

            <h2>What new legal challenges mean for the future of US offshore wind</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/08/1130868/legal-challenges-offshore-wind/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For offshore wind power in the US, the new year is bringing new legal battles.

On December 22, the Trump administration announced it would pause the leases of five wind farms currently under construction off the US East Coast. Developers were ordered to stop work immediately.

The cited reason? National security, specifically concerns that turbines can cause radar interference. But that’s a known issue, and developers have worked with the government to deal with it for years.

Companies have been quick to file lawsuits, and the court battles could begin as soon as this week. Here’s what the latest kerfuffle might mean for the struggling offshore wind industry in the US.

This pause affects $25 billion in investment in five wind farms: Vineyard Wind 1 off Massachusetts, Revolution Wind off Rhode Island, Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind off New York, and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind off Virginia. Together, those projects had been expected to create 10,000 jobs and power more than 2.5 million homes and businesses.

In a statement announcing the move, the Department of the Interior said that “recently completed classified reports” revealed national security risks, and that the pause would give the government time to work through concerns with developers. The statement specifically says that turbines can create radar interference (more on the technical details here in a moment).

Three of the companies involved have already filed lawsuits, and they’re seeking preliminary injunctions that would allow construction to continue. Orsted and Equinor (the developers for Revolution Wind and Empire Wind, respectively) told the New York Times that their projects went through lengthy federal reviews, which did address concerns about national security.

This is just the latest salvo from the Trump administration against offshore wind. On Trump’s first day in office, he signed an executive order stopping all new lease approvals for offshore wind farms. (That order was struck down by a judge in December.)

The administration previously ordered Revolution Wind to stop work last year, also citing national security concerns. A federal judge lifted the stop-work order weeks later, after the developer showed that the financial stakes were high, and that government agencies had previously found no national security issues with the project.

There are real challenges that wind farms introduce for radar systems, which are used in everything from air traffic control to weather forecasting to national defense operations. A wind turbine’s spinning can create complex signatures on radar, resulting in so-called clutter.

Previous government reports, including one 2024 report from the Department of Energy and a 2025 report from the Government Accountability Office (an independent government watchdog), have pointed out this issue in the past.

“To date, no mitigation technology has been able to fully restore the technical performance of impacted radars,” as the DOE report puts it. However, there are techniques that can help, including software that acts to remove the signatures of wind turbines. (Think of this as similar to how noise-canceling headphones work, but more complicated, as one expert told TechCrunch.)

But the most widespread and helpful tactic, according to the DOE report, is collaboration between developers and the government. By working together to site and design wind farms strategically, the groups can ensure that the projects don’t interfere with government or military operations. The 2025 GAO report found that government officials, researchers, and offshore wind companies were collaborating effectively, and any concerns could be raised and addressed in the permitting process.

This and other challenges threaten an industry that could be a major boon for the grid. On the East Coast where these projects are located, and in New England specifically, winter can bring tight supplies of fossil fuels and spiking prices because of high demand. It just so happens that offshore winds blow strongest in the winter, so new projects, including the five wrapped up in this fight, could be a major help during the grid’s greatest time of need.

One 2025 study found that if 3.5 gigawatts’ worth of offshore wind had been operational during the 2024-2025 winter, it would have lowered energy prices by 11%. (That’s the combined capacity of Revolution Wind and Vineyard Wind, two of the paused projects, plus two future projects in the pipeline.) Ratepayers would have saved $400 million.

Before Donald Trump was elected, the energy consultancy BloombergNEF projected that the US would build 39 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2035. Today, that expectation has dropped to just 6 gigawatts. These legal battles could push it lower still.

What’s hardest to wrap my head around is that some of the projects being challenged are nearly finished. The developers of Revolution Wind have installed all the foundations and 58 of 65 turbines, and they say the project is over 87% complete. Empire Wind is over 60% done and is slated to deliver electricity to the grid next year.

To hit the pause button so close to the finish line is chilling, not just for current projects but for future offshore wind efforts in the US. Even if these legal battles clear up and more developers can technically enter the queue, why would they want to? Billions of dollars are at stake, and if there’s one word to describe the current state of the offshore wind industry in the US, it’s “unpredictable.”

            <div id="article-text">This is one of the most concerning questions for sales teams at the beginning of 2026: are tech giants killing cold outreach? The answer is that we do not know yet, but here is a perspective from someone working in sales.

Apple and Google have recently introduced two features that show a clear tendency toward the decline of cold outreach.

Apple’s new feature, “Ask Reason for Calling,” is a game changer. It effectively turns cold calling into another form of messaging. No more dynamism, no element of surprise, no offhandedness. Human touch is at the core of sales, but how can that element still exist if interaction is reduced to reading a few short phrases?

The magic of cold calling was always the surprise factor. No expectations for the person answering, no prior knowledge of who is calling or what the subject is, and no immediate cues such as where the caller is from, their accent, or how they pitch.

Does this feature mean that all the books and courses salespeople take to understand psychology, master tone, and capture attention are becoming worthless?

Google has announced a new AI inbox tool that offers personalized summaries of received emails and to-do items. What does this mean? As soon as a decision-maker notices that you are trying to sell something out of the blue, your email may be ignored, deleted, or your sequence may receive the old-fashioned “unsubscribe.”

This feature is not surprising, as Google has been tightening regulations around bulk and cold emails for some time. However, these measures have pushed salespeople toward increasingly extreme tactics, redefining what “off the wall” really means.

At this point, B2B email, Gmail, and LinkedIn are starting to resemble Instagram, TikTok, and WhatsApp. Less focus, less quality content, less valuable information, and more distraction.

While many people, especially decision-makers, blame salespeople for damaging the business landscape, particularly in terms of trust and distraction, and while endless tirades against cold calling and cold emailing continue on LinkedIn, sales and outreach remain fundamental to building a company.

All of us have something valuable to say and worth listening to, regardless of our role or the company we belong to. Time is indeed the most valuable resource, but taking a five-minute call or reading a three-minute email is not an eternity. It can offer more value than expected and open new opportunities.

In a world increasingly driven by AI, with clear shifts across all business sectors, human touch remains at the foundation of every company. Networking, meeting new people, and sharing ideas are the pillars of business.

So, are tech giants really killing cold outreach? Time will tell. For now, the answer is no.

            <h2>ChatGPT Health has arrived</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/chatgpt-health-has-arrived">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">I’ve said this many times: the products we see on the market are rarely visionary leaps. Most of the time, they are mirrors. They reflect people’s habits, shortcuts, fears, and small daily behaviours. Design follows behaviour. Always has.

Think about it. You probably know at least one person who already uses ChatGPT for health-related questions. Not occasionally. Regularly. As a second opinion. As a place to test concerns before saying them out loud. Sometimes even as a therapist, a confidant, or a space where embarrassment does not exist.

When habits become consistent, companies stop observing and start building. At that point, users are no longer just customers. They are co-architects. Their behaviour quietly shapes the product roadmap.

That context matters when looking at what OpenAI announced on January 7, 2026: the launch of ChatGPT Health, a dedicated AI-powered experience focused on healthcare. OpenAI describes it as “a dedicated experience that securely brings your health information and ChatGPT’s intelligence together.”

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Access is limited for now. The company is rolling it out through a waitlist, with gradual expansion planned over the coming weeks. Anyone with a ChatGPT account, Free or paid, can sign up for early access, except users in the European Union, the UK, and Switzerland, where regulatory alignment is still pending.

The stated goal is simple on paper: help people feel more informed, more prepared, and more confident when managing their health. But the numbers behind that decision say more than the press language ever could. According to OpenAI, over 230 million people worldwide already ask health or wellness questions on ChatGPT every week.

That figure raises uncomfortable questions.

Why do so many people turn to an AI for health questions? Is it speed? The promise of an immediate answer? The way our expectations have shifted toward instant clarity, even for complex or sensitive issues? Is it discomfort, the reluctance to speak openly with a doctor about certain topics? Or something deeper, a quiet erosion of trust in human systems, paired with a growing confidence in machines that do not judge, interrupt, or rush?

ChatGPT Health does not answer those questions. It simply formalises the behaviour.

According to OpenAI, the new Health space allows users to securely connect personal health data, including medical records, lab results, and information from fitness or wellness apps. Someone might upload recent blood test results and ask for a summary. Another might connect a step counter and ask how their activity compares to previous months.

The system can integrate data from platforms such as Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, Peloton, AllTrails, and even grocery data from Instacart. The promise is contextual responses, not generic advice. Lab results explained in plain language. Patterns highlighted over time. Suggestions for questions to ask during a medical appointment. Diet or exercise ideas grounded in what the data actually shows.

What ChatGPT Health is careful not to do matters just as much as what it can do.

OpenAI is explicit: this is not medical advice. It does not diagnose conditions. It does not prescribe treatments. It is designed to support care, not replace it. The framing is intentional. ChatGPT Health positions itself as an assistant, not an authority. A tool for understanding patterns and preparing conversations, not making decisions in isolation.

That distinction is crucial. And, frankly, it is one I hope users take seriously.

Behind the scenes, OpenAI says the system was developed with extensive medical oversight. Over the past two years, more than 260 physicians from roughly 60 countries reviewed responses and provided feedback, contributing over 600,000 individual evaluation points. The focus was not only accuracy, but tone, clarity, and when the system should clearly encourage users to seek professional care.

To support that process, OpenAI built an internal evaluation framework called HealthBench. It scores responses based on clinician-defined standards, including safety, medical correctness, and appropriateness of guidance. It is an attempt to bring structure to a domain where nuance matters and mistakes carry weight.

Privacy is another pillar OpenAI insists on emphasising. ChatGPT Health operates in a separate, isolated environment within the app. Health-related conversations, connected data sources, and uploaded files are kept entirely separate from regular chats. Health data does not flow into the general ChatGPT memory, and conversations in this space are encrypted.

OpenAI also states that health conversations are not used to train its core models. Whether that assurance will be enough for all users remains to be seen, but the architectural separation signals an awareness of how sensitive this territory is.

In the United States, the system goes a step further. Through a partnership with b.well Connected Health, ChatGPT Health can access real electronic health records from thousands of providers, with user permission. This allows it to summarise official lab reports or condense long medical histories into readable overviews. Outside the US, functionality is more limited, largely due to regulatory differences.

There are potential downstream effects for healthcare providers as well. If patients arrive at appointments already familiar with their data, already aware of trends, already prepared with focused questions, consultations could become more efficient. Less time decoding numbers. More time discussing decisions.

And inevitably, the question surfaces: should doctors be worried?

AI is not a medical professional. It does not examine patients. It does not carry legal responsibility. It cannot replace clinical judgement, experience, or accountability. ChatGPT Health does not change that. It is not a shortcut to self-diagnosis, and it should not be treated as one.

What it does change is the starting point of the conversation.

Used responsibly, ChatGPT Health can help people engage with their own health information instead of avoiding it. Misused, it could reinforce false certainty or delay necessary care. The responsibility, as always, is shared between the tool and the person using it.

Users should stay aware of privacy implications, seek professional advice when it matters, and treat AI guidance as one input among many, not a final answer.

One thing is clear, though. 2026 did not arrive quietly.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The AI industry has become adept at measuring itself. Benchmarks improve, model scores rise, and every new release arrives with a list of metrics meant to signal progress. And yet, somewhere between the lab and real life, something keeps slipping.

Which model actually feels better to use?
Which answers would a human trust?
Which system would you put in front of customers, employees, or citizens and feel comfortable standing behind it?

That gap is where LMArena has quietly built its business, and why investors just put $150 million behind it at a $1.7 billion valuation, in a Series A round. The lead investors were Felicis and UC Investments, with participation from major venture firms (Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed, The House Fund, Laude Ventures).

For years, benchmarks were the currency of AI credibility: accuracy scores, reasoning tests and standardized datasets. They worked until they didn’t. As models grew larger and more similar, benchmark improvements became marginal. Worse, models began to optimize for the tests themselves rather than real use cases. Static evaluations struggled to reflect how AI behaves in open-ended, messy human interactions.

At the same time, AI systems moved out of labs and into everyday workflows: drafting emails, writing code, powering customer support, assisting with research and advising professionals. The question shifted from “Can the model do this?” to “Should we trust it when it does?”

That’s a different kind of measurement problem.

LMArena’s answer was simple and radical: stop scoring models in isolation. On its platform, users submit a prompt and receive two anonymized responses. No branding. No model names. Just answers. Then the user picks the better one, or neither.

One vote. One comparison. Repeated millions of times.

The result isn’t a definitive “best,” but a living signal of human preference , how people respond to tone, clarity, verbosity and real-world usefulness. When the prompt isn’t clean or predictable, that signal changes. And it captures something benchmarks often miss.

LMArena isn’t about whether a model produces a factually correct answer. It’s about whether humans prefer it when it does. That distinction is subtle but meaningful in practice. Rankings on the Arena leaderboard are now referenced by developers and labs before releases and product decisions. Major models from OpenAI, Google and Anthropic are regularly evaluated there.

Without traditional marketing, LMArena became a mirror the industry watches.

The $150 million round isn’t just a vote of confidence in LMArena’s product. It signals that AI evaluation itself is becoming infrastructure. As the number of models explodes, enterprise buyers face a new question: not how to get AI, but which AI to trust. Vendor claims and classical benchmarks don’t always translate to real-world reliability. Internal testing is expensive and slow.

A neutral, third-party signal, something that sits between model builders and users  is emerging as a critical layer. That’s where LMArena lives. In September 2025, it launched AI Evaluations, a commercial service that turns its crowdsourced comparison engine into a product enterprises and labs can pay to access. LMArena says this service achieved an annualized run rate of about $30 million within months of launch.

For regulators and policymakers, this kind of human-anchored signal matters too. Oversight frameworks need evidence that reflects real usage, not idealized scenarios.

LMArena’s approach isn’t without debate. Platforms that rely on public voting and crowdsourced signals can reflect the preferences of active users, which may not align with the needs of specific professional domains. In response, competitors like Scale AI’s SEAL Showdown have emerged, aiming to offer more granular, representative model rankings across languages, regions and professional contexts.

Academic research also notes that voting-based leaderboards can be susceptible to manipulation if safeguards aren’t in place, and that such systems may favor superficially appealing responses over technically correct ones if quality control isn’t rigorous.

These debates highlight that no single evaluation method captures every dimension of model behavior, but they also underscore the demand for richer, human-grounded signals beyond traditional benchmarks.

There’s a quiet assumption in AI that trust will emerge naturally as models improve. Better reasoning, so the logic goes, will lead to better outcomes. That framing treats alignment as a technical problem with technical solutions.

LMArena challenges that idea. Trust, in real contexts, is social and contextual. It’s built through experience, not claims. It’s shaped by feedback loops that don’t collapse under scale. By letting users, not companies, decide what works, LMArena introduces friction where the industry often prefers momentum. It slows things down just enough to ask, “Is this actually better, or just newer?”

That’s an uncomfortable question in a market driven by constant release cycles. It’s also why LMArena’s rise feels inevitable.

LMArena doesn’t promise safety. It doesn’t declare models good or bad. It doesn’t replace regulation or responsibility. What it does is simpler and more powerful: it keeps score in public. As AI systems become embedded in everyday decisions, tracking performance over time becomes less optional. Someone has to notice regressions, contextual shifts and usability patterns.

In sports, referees and statisticians fill this role. In markets, auditors and rating agencies do. In AI, we’re still inventing that infrastructure.

LMArena’s funding round suggests investors believe this role won’t stay marginal for long. Because when AI is everywhere, the hardest questions aren’t what it can do. They are who we trust when it does it, and how we know we’re right.

            <div id="article-text">For years, the tech industry equated success with scale. Bigger stages, larger crowds, more logos, more panels, more noise. Five thousand people became ten thousand. Ten thousand became the goal.

Somewhere along the way, that stopped making sense.

Founders and executives didn’t announce a boycott. They simply stopped showing up.

What we see today is not a rejection of events, but a correction in how people who actually run companies choose to spend their time. The shift is subtle, but consistent. Fewer large conferences. More small, curated gatherings. More closed rooms. More dinners. More tables of twelve.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Big tech events struggle because they optimize for visibility, not usefulness. A founder does not need three days of generic content, dozens of panels with no real interaction, or networking sessions where relevance is left to chance.

At scale, everything becomes superficial by default. Conversations shorten. Access disappears. The signal is drowned by the format itself.

What founders look for instead is simple. Context. Trust. Direct access. Conversations without performance. The kind of environment where people can speak honestly, not publicly.

Even when larger conferences still make sense, there is a clear psychological ceiling. Around one thousand participants, in exceptional cases. Beyond that point, quality becomes impossible to control. The event stops being a place where decisions are made and turns into a product designed for mass consumption.

And tech, especially at the founder and executive level, no longer behaves like a mass industry. It behaves like a precision one.

This is why smaller, niche conferences outperform larger ones on every meaningful metric. Ten relevant people in a room will always create more value than a thousand irrelevant ones in a hall.

At a small table, access is natural. No one needs to chase anyone. Trust forms faster. Real conversations happen because there is no audience to impress.

The most important discussions in tech have never happened on stage. They happen before the lights turn on and after the microphones are off.

In parallel with this shift, we have been preparing a private community limited to one thousand founders and executives. It is strictly invite only. Not a platform. Not a public group. Not designed for scale. Designed for relevance. Quality is protected precisely by limitation.

One thing we can say publicly is that TNW will return with an event in 2026. Details, format, and the official launch will be announced soon, but not here. What matters is that this return will not mirror the old model. It will reflect how the industry actually operates today.

Big events are not disappearing. They are simply no longer where important decisions are made.

Across the industry, the shift is already happening. Smaller rooms. Sharper conversations. People who actually need to be there.

            <div id="article-text">Five stars used to mean something. People still read reviews before buying software. They just don’t trust them the way they used to. And no, this isn’t about fake reviews or obvious scams. Those are easy to spot. The real problem is more uncomfortable. The review economy didn’t collapse. It slowly drifted away from its original purpose.

User reviews began as authentic buyer guidance, but they’ve morphed into strategic assets for businesses. Scroll through any app store or e-commerce site: everything is “top-rated” and lavished with praise. If every product gleams with a 4.8/5 rating, those stars start to lose their meaning.

Consumers aren’t fooled, in fact, the share of people who trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations plummeted from nearly 80% in 2020 to just 42% in 2025

We read the glowing comments, but we’ve learned to read between the lines.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

It’s not hard to see why trust has eroded. Companies have figured out that great reviews drive sales, so they’ve turned the whole system into a numbers game. High ratings aren’t just social proof now, they’re a growth tactic.  In other words, more stars = more money. So of course businesses are chasing stars like their life depends on it. And in a way, it does.

Behind the scenes, many companies actively engineer their review scores. One common tactic is to time the ask just right. For instance, some businesses send out a Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey to gauge your sentiment “How likely are you to recommend us?”

If you rate them a 9 or 10 (a promoter), you’re immediately nudged to post a public review. If you give a lukewarm or low score, the feedback form quietly thanks you and never mentions writing a review at all.

Only the happiest customers get the gentle push to “Share your experience!” This practice is so widespread it even has a name: “review gating.”

It’s essentially filtering which customers get invited to leave a review based on their initial feedback. Platforms officially frown on it (Google outright forbids “selectively soliciting positive reviews”), but behind closed doors it remains a growth hacker’s favorite trick.

Then there’s the outright incentivization. Perhaps you’ve received an email offering a discount, gift card, or free month of service in exchange for writing a review. It’s framed as a thank-you for your time, of course – “Share your honest feedback and get 10% off your next purchase!” – but the intent is clear.

In an economy of fake praise, even regulators have had to step in to remind everyone that trust isn’t a commodity to be bought. Companies know how to play the game from the other side too: suppressing negativity.

Unhappy customer feedback is quietly diverted to support teams or private channels, where it can be resolved (or simply contained) out of public view. The result is a skewed reality, a glossy wall of five-star testimonials that obscure any hint of dissatisfaction. It’s a great sales tool. It’s terrible for the truth.

Why go to such lengths to manicure the ratings? Because the platforms themselves reward it. The algorithms that sort and highlight products aren’t trying to surface the most truthful review; they’re trying to maximize engagement and conversion.

High ratings and large volumes of reviews make people more likely to click “Buy Now.” That means more conversion for sellers and more commission for the marketplace. In other words, the algorithm is biased toward whatever boosts the platform’s monetization metrics.

A bunch of five-star reviews isn’t just ego bait,  it’s algorithm bait.

Think about it: products with a 4.7-star average and hundreds of reviews tend to appear at the top of search results and recommendation lists. They convert better, so the system pushes them more.

More visibility leads to more sales, which reinforces the high ranking. It’s a feedback loop powered by positive feedback (pun intended). If a vendor can game their way into that virtuous cycle, via perfectly timed prompts or purchased praise, the platform’s code will happily amplify them.

Authenticity doesn’t earn you a top slot; performance does. The incentive is clear: keep it positive, and keep it plentiful. In the review economy, volume and sentiment are king.

Worse, some marketplaces have blurred the line between genuine high-rated listings and paid placement. It’s an open secret that many platforms offer sponsored spots or pay-to-play schemes, think “featured” placements, ads masquerading as top picks, or vendor subscriptions that subtly boost visibility.

Money talks, even if it speaks over the voice of authentic customer feedback. (To be fair, a few holdouts still refuse to monetize their review rankings or sell out their star system, but they’re the exception, not the rule).

Consumers aren’t sitting idly by in this charade. We’ve become savvy at sniffing out over-polished BS. The modern buyer knows how the game is played, and many are adapting their behavior to cope with the broken review system.

First, there’s a migration of trust to private networks and off-platform channels. Instead of relying on the star-average on a marketplace, people turn to friends, colleagues, and niche communities for real advice.

Think about the last time you were unsure about a purchase, maybe you shot a quick message to a group chat, or asked in a private Slack channel, “Hey, has anyone used this product? Is it actually any good?” Personal recommendations feel reliable again, precisely because they’re not part of the public review circus.

Second, savvy consumers cross-check everything. Rather than trusting one site’s reviews, they compare across multiple sources, the product might be 4.8 on the official store, but what’s it rated elsewhere?

Is there a discrepancy between the slick website testimonials and the chatter on Reddit? More often than not, shoppers now triangulate information. In fact, three out of four people use two or more sites when reading reviews, rather than putting all their faith in one platform’s word. We instinctively seek a consensus of truth across the noise.

Finally, many have decided the best judge is themselves. “Try before you buy” has made a comeback as a defense against dubious reviews. Free trials, freemium tiers, generous return policies, consumers leverage them all to test products firsthand.

If a software platform promises the world in its curated testimonials, a savvy buyer will take the 14-day free trial and see if it lives up to the hype. In sectors like enterprise software, where choices are costly and critical, buyers might run a pilot program or proof-of-concept rather than trust glossy case studies. Essentially, experience has become the new review.

All this has serious implications for platforms and software marketplaces. These businesses built their empires on user-generated trust, turning customer opinion into a key part of the shopping experience.

If that trust evaporates, the model cracks. We’re already seeing the early signs: users skipping the review tab, or treating every five-star rating with a healthy dose of skepticism.

If the review economy continues on its current path, platforms risk becoming mere transaction processors rather than trust brokers.

For the marketplaces, this is both a crisis and an opportunity. The crisis is obvious: loss of credibility. If people no longer believe what they read on your platform, they’ll seek validation elsewhere, and your influence over purchase decisions diminishes.

But the opportunity lies in reform. Platforms could double down on authenticity as a feature, verifying purchases, cracking down harder on fraudulent and incentivized reviews, and highlighting more qualitative, nuanced feedback instead of simple star counts.

There’s even a chance to innovate with new trust signals (some are experimenting with things like verified buyer badges, AI analysis for suspicious patterns, or weighted ratings that account for reviewer reputation). The platforms that find ways to genuinely restore faith in their review systems will win back weary consumers. Those that don’t will see their communities drift away, bit by bit.

Importantly, not all platforms have given in to the dark side. A handful still refuse pay-for-play tactics, no paid reviews, no under-the-table boosting of rankings for advertisers.

These holdouts demonstrate that integrity in reviews is possible, even if it means slower growth in the short term.

In the end, the broken review economy is forcing a rebalance of how we decide what to trust. Buyers are adapting, finding new ways to cut through the noise. And the platforms that once thrived on being the ultimate source of truth in purchasing may have to rethink their approach if they want to stay relevant.

Trust, once lost, is hard to regain. The five-star system doesn’t shine as bright as it used to; perhaps it’s time for the next evolution in how we share and earn trust online.

            <div id="article-text">2025 was the year technology stopped being tomorrow’s promise and became today’s anchor. What began as a surge in generative AI and platform innovation two years prior crystallized this year into concrete shifts in how people work, governing bodies legislate, and markets invest. Across continents and industries, the arc of technology bent toward practical impact, regulatory reality, and economic weight!

At the heart of the year’s story was artificial intelligence’s jump from novelty to infrastructure. LLMs and multimodal models moved beyond demos into everyday workflows, influencing how documents are written, campaigns are conceived, products designed, and code generated.

Enterprises that once hesitated began deploying AI tools at scale, with early adopters reporting measurable productivity gains by integrating copilots into core processes, a trend visible in surveys showing widespread adoption among software professionals.

This editorial isn’t a chronicle of every press release.

It’s a reflection on how 2025, at the crossroads of technology, governance, and economic strategy, brought about a series of inflection points that will shape the next era of creation, competition, and control.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

OpenAI’s release of GPT-5 in August pushed the boundaries of what AI could do, delivering notable gains in coding, math, and multimodal understanding. But unlike the jaw-dropping debut of ChatGPT a couple years prior, this new generation of foundation models arrived to a more measured reception.

Tech leaders and investors had begun asking harder questions: beyond impressive demos, could these models drive real products and revenue?

Google’s answer was Gemini 3, launched in November as its “most intelligent model” and immediately woven into Google’s flagship product, Search. For the first time, an AI model upgrade wasn’t just about boastful leaderboard scores, it was about transforming user experience.

Typing a query into Google now often meant receiving an AI-generated synthesis instead of the familiar list of links, a sea change in how information is delivered. Google even unveiled a Gemini “agent” that could execute multi-step tasks like booking travel or organizing email, hinting at a future where AI acts more like a digital butler than a chatbox.

Anthropic’s Claude 4 model, for instance, gained a strong following among developers by expanding how much it could handle at once, processing entire codebases with tens of thousands of lines, rather than by producing viral one-liners.

AI grew up in 2025: it was still improving at breakneck speed, but it also had to earn its keep in real products and justify the billion-dollar bets fueling its rise.

Driving this AI explosion was a parallel leap in hardware. The hunger for AI computers in 2025 was insatiable, and chipmakers raced to deliver.

NVIDIA, whose GPUs had become the era’s essential infrastructure, rolled out its new Blackwell architecture with chips like the B200 that boasted up to 3× the training speed of its predecessor. Cloud data centers around the world scrambled to deploy these to keep up with demand from model training and inference.

Rival chipmakers weren’t idle either: AMD and a cadre of startups pushed innovative AI accelerators, while even Intel signaled ambitions to catch up, reportedly exploring an acquisition of AI chip designer SambaNova.

Perhaps most tellingly, tech giants themselves started designing silicon tailored for AI workloads, recognizing that owning the chip means owning the future of computing.

Beyond AI chips, consumer hardware saw its own milestones. After years of anticipation, augmented reality glasses and mixed-reality headsets finally had their moment, sort of.

Apple’s Vision Pro headset, unveiled in late 2023, reached select markets in 2024; by 2025 developers were crafting the first wave of immersive apps. However, mass adoption lagged due to the device’s sky-high price and bulky format.

Competitors like Meta’s Quest line offered cheaper VR headsets and modest improvements, but the “metaverse” hype of yesteryear largely fizzled out, users and investors had shifted their excitement to generative AI and tangible productivity tools.

Smartphones and laptops in 2025 continued incremental improvements (faster Apple M3/M4 chips, foldable screens becoming more common), yet it was clear the next paradigm shift in personal tech was still on the horizon.

Even so, one hardware frontier made concrete progress: quantum computing. Industry leaders like IBM and Google demonstrated prototype systems with ever-larger qubit counts and made strides in error correction, inching closer to viable quantum machines.

These advances, while esoteric to the public, underscored a broader theme, from AI accelerators to quantum chips, the machinery under the hood of tech was evolving rapidly to enable the software of tomorrow.

If 2025 proved anything, it’s that technology no longer operates above the law. This was the year regulators moved from intent to enforcement, with Europe leading the charge.

After years of debate, the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act came into force, becoming the world’s first complex AI law. From February, certain “unacceptable risk” uses, such as social scoring and real-time biometric surveillance, were banned outright.

By August, transparency rules followed, forcing companies to label AI-generated content and comply with new obligations for general-purpose models. The signal was unmistakable: in Europe, the era of unchecked AI was over.

Companies now face audits, penalties, and real consequences if their systems cross legal or ethical lines, a regulatory moment European officials openly compared to GDPR’s impact on data privacy.

The pressure didn’t stop with AI. In 2025, regulators also went after the gatekeepers. The EU’s Digital Markets Act forced long-resistant changes from Big Tech, most notably when Apple opened the iPhone to third-party app stores and sideloading in Europe, dismantling a 15-year walled garden.

At the same time, enforcement of the Digital Services Act intensified. Platforms were scrutinized for how they handle disinformation, with companies like X warned or penalized during periods of geopolitical tension. In response, social networks expanded moderation teams, adjusted algorithms, and exposed more of their inner workings to researchers.

The US issued an AI executive order and signaled tougher enforcement through agencies like the FTC, while states stepped in, including New York’s law requiring mental-health warnings on addictive social features.

In China, new draft rules targeted AI systems designed for human-like interaction, tightening licensing and ideological oversight. By the end of the year, the freewheeling phase of tech disruption had given way to something more restrained. The question was no longer whether regulation would catch up, but how deeply it would reshape innovation itself.

The platform shake-up that began in 2023 gathered real momentum in 2025, as both companies and users adjusted to a post-pandemic, AI-saturated reality.

Nowhere was this clearer than in social media. Elon Musk’s X, which entered the decade with noise and bravado, found itself on the defensive. Meta’s Threads, initially dismissed after an early spike, steadily closed the gap, nearing parity with X in daily mobile users by mid-year.

X’s audience shrank as policy whiplash and leadership churn eroded confidence, and while its remaining users were still deeply engaged, the era of unquestioned Twitter dominance was over. Disenchanted users scattered across a fragmented landscape, from Meta’s polished Threads to decentralized alternatives like Bluesky and Mastodon, breaking the old Facebook–Instagram–Twitter equilibrium.

The recalibration extended well beyond social feeds.

Major platforms retooled around changing habits: Google reshaped Search around generative answers to fend off AI assistants and algorithmic discovery, while Microsoft pushed its Copilot deeper into Windows, Office, and Bing, betting on “AI inside” as a platform reset.

Everyday behavior shifted too. Smarter voice and chat assistants returned to daily use, handling emails, refunds, and scheduling with little friction. At the same time, screen fatigue set in. Digital-detox travel gained traction, and younger users gravitated toward apps that promised less algorithmic pressure and more human curation. Even streaming came full circle.

After years of fragmentation, providers began rebundling services, offering combined video, music, and gaming packages that looked suspiciously like cable TV reborn, a reminder that while technology moves forward, user preferences often move in cycles.

Amid the gains and momentum, 2025 also became a year of reckoning. As AI systems spread, society began grappling with their cultural and ethical cost. Creators who once marveled at generative tools started pushing back, arguing that their work had been absorbed without consent or compensation.

A wave of lawsuits moved through US courts, with authors accusing companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google of scraping books and articles to train models. By year’s end, the message was unmistakable: if AI is built on human creativity, many believe its rewards can no longer flow in one direction alone.

Public trust in technology was also tested by a rise in malicious uses and misuses. In the financial domain, sophisticated deepfake scams caused real damage. The frequency of such incidents spiked sharply; cybersecurity firms reported a 3000% increase in deepfake-related fraud over two years, and authorities scrambled to educate businesses on new verification practices.

Misinformation continued to be a menace: during elections and conflicts, AI-generated fake images and videos spread on social media, forcing newsrooms to set up rapid-response fact-checking teams.

Encouragingly, 2025 also saw growth in countermeasures, from better deepfake detection algorithms to nascent standards for cryptographic content authentication (the Coalition for Content Provenance, including major publishers and tech platforms, expanded efforts to watermark authentic media).

Still, the information ecosystem remained fraught, as even savvy citizens found it ever harder to tell the truth from fabrication online.

And then there’s the human element: how all this tech is affecting everyday lives and livelihoods. Workplace AI adoption soared this year; tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot and a host of AI assistants became common on office desktops. Studies showed productivity boosts but also raised concerns about workers becoming overly reliant on AI suggestions.

Meanwhile, fears of automation resurfaced in certain sectors, for example, as chatbots took over more customer service and code-generation tools improved, professionals in call centers and junior programming positions wondered about long-term job security.

These anxieties fueled calls for new approaches to education and training, so that the workforce of 2030 will be prepared for more creative, complex tasks that AI can’t easily handle.

Lovable (Stockholm, Sweden) came as one of the most remarkable AI software stories of the year, for me. What began as an open-source project evolved into a commercial platform that lets users build fully functional websites and apps using plain-language prompts, no traditional coding required.

This approach, known in the industry as “vibe coding,” turns ideas into production-ready software simply by describing what you want in natural language.

Lovable’s growth in 2025 was extraordinary by any measure. Eight months after its launch, the company hit over $100 million in annual recurring revenue and raised a $200 million Series A at a roughly $1.8 billion valuation, making it one of Europe’s fastest-growing software startups ever.

By year’s end, Lovable had secured $330 million in Series B funding at about a $6.6 billion valuation, and was rapidly scaling globally.

What makes Lovable meaningful beyond the numbers is what it represents: a shift in how software is built. It demonstrated that AI can democratize development, giving power to non-technical founders, creators, and teams to go from concept to product without traditional engineering barriers.

In an industry long centered on specialized skills and team structures, Lovable’s rise suggested a future where natural language becomes the primary interface to software creation.

On a more hopeful note, 2025 showed signs of a maturing tech culture. Ethical design moved from talking point to practice. Major platforms began experimenting with limits, turning off infinite scroll for teens, adding prompts that nudged users to pause, and treating “time well spent” as a real metric rather than a slogan.

In AI, transparency gained ground. Under pressure from regulators and researchers, companies like OpenAI and Google disclosed more about how their models are trained and where they fall short.

Researchers formed new alliances to share safety techniques, and a second global AI Safety Summit brought dozens of countries together around questions of alignment and control.

None of it amounted to binding rules, but it marked a shift in tone: even the architects of powerful systems openly acknowledged the need for restraint.

Taken together, these moments made 2025 a turning point. For years, technology had surged ahead of the institutions meant to guide it. This year, that gap began to close.

The breakthroughs were real and transformative, but so were the responses to them: laws passed, norms reset, alliances formed. If 2024 was the year the world grasped the power of generative AI, 2025 was the year it began deciding how that power should be used.

The story of technology is no longer just about what can be built, but about how it fits into the lives it shapes, and who gets to decide that fit.
