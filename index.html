            <h2>OpenAI’s child exploitation reports increased sharply this year</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/openais-child-exploitation-reports-increased-sharply-this-year/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI sent 80 times as many child exploitation incident reports to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children during the first half of 2025 as it did during a similar time period in 2024, according to a recent update from the company. The NCMEC’s CyberTipline is a Congressionally authorized clearinghouse for reporting child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and other forms of child exploitation.

Companies are required by law to report apparent child exploitation to the CyberTipline. When a company sends a report, NCMEC reviews it and then forwards it to the appropriate law enforcement agency for investigation.

Statistics related to NCMEC reports can be nuanced. Increased reports can sometimes indicate changes in a platform’s automated moderation, or the criteria it uses to decide whether a report is necessary, rather than necessarily indicating an increase in nefarious activity.

Additionally, the same piece of content can be the subject of multiple reports, and a single report can be about multiple pieces of content. Some platforms, including OpenAI, disclose the number of both the reports and the total pieces of content they were about for a more complete picture.

OpenAI spokesperson Gaby Raila said in a statement that the company made investments toward the end of 2024 “to increase [its] capacity to review and action reports in order to keep pace with current and future user growth.” Raila also said that the time frame corresponds to “the introduction of more product surfaces that allowed image uploads and the growing popularity of our products, which contributed to the increase in reports.” In August, Nick Turley, vice president and head of ChatGPT, announced that the app had four times the number of weekly active users than it did the year before.

During the first half of 2025, the number of CyberTipline reports OpenAI sent was roughly the same as the amount of content OpenAI sent the reports about—75,027 compared to 74,559. In the first half of 2024, it sent 947 CyberTipline reports about 3,252 pieces of content. Both the number of reports and pieces of content the reports saw a marked increase between the two time periods.

Content, in this context, could mean multiple things. OpenAI has said that it reports all instances of CSAM, including uploads and requests, to NCMEC. Besides its ChatGPT app, which allows users to upload files—including images—and can generate text and images in response, OpenAI also offers access to its models via API access. The most recent NCMEC count wouldn’t include any reports related to video-generation app Sora, as its September release was after the time frame covered by the update.

The spike in reports follows a similar pattern to what NCMEC has observed at the CyberTipline more broadly with the rise of generative AI. The center’s analysis of all CyberTipline data found that reports involving generative AI saw a 1,325 percent increase between 2023 and 2024. NCMEC has not yet released 2025 data, and while other large AI labs like Google publish statistics about the NCMEC reports they’ve made, they don’t specify what percentage of those reports are AI-related.

OpenAI’s update comes at the end of a year where the company and its competitors have faced increased scrutiny over child safety issues beyond just CSAM. Over the summer, 44 state attorneys general sent a joint letter to multiple AI companies including OpenAI, Meta, Character.AI, and Google, warning that they would “use every facet of our authority to protect children from exploitation by predatory artificial intelligence products.” Both OpenAI and Character.AI have faced multiple lawsuits from families or on behalf of individuals who allege that the chatbots contributed to their children’s deaths. In the fall, the US Senate Committee on the Judiciary held a hearing on the harms of AI chatbots, and the US Federal Trade Commission launched a market study on AI companion bots that included questions about how companies are mitigating negative impacts, particularly to children. (I was previously employed by the FTC and was assigned to work on the market study prior to leaving the agency.)

In recent months, OpenAI has rolled out new safety-focused tools more broadly. In September, OpenAI rolled out several new features for ChatGPT, including parental controls, as part of its work “to give families tools to support their teens’ use of AI.” Parents and their teens can link their accounts, and parents can change their teen’s settings, including by turning off voice mode and memory, removing the ability for ChatGPT to generate images, and opting their kid out of model training. OpenAI said it could also notify parents if their teen’s conversations showed signs of self-harm, and potentially also notify law enforcement if it detected an imminent threat to life and wasn’t able to get in touch with a parent.

In late October, to cap off negotiations with the California Department of Justice over its proposed recapitalizations plan, OpenAI agreed to “continue to undertake measures to mitigate risks to teens and others in connection with the development and deployment of AI and of AGI.” The following month, OpenAI released its Teen Safety Blueprint, in which it said it was constantly improving its ability to detect child sexual abuse and exploitation material, and reporting confirmed CSAM to relevant authorities, including NCMEC.

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/yo-what-limewire-re-emerges-in-online-rush-to-share-pulled-60-minutes-segment/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">CBS cannot contain the online spread of a “60 Minutes” segment that its editor-in-chief, Bari Weiss, tried to block from airing.

The episode, “Inside CECOT,” featured testimonies from US deportees who were tortured or suffered physical or sexual abuse at a notorious Salvadoran prison, the Center for the Confinement of Terrorism. “Welcome to hell,” one former inmate was told upon arriving, the segment reported, while also highlighting a clip of Donald Trump praising CECOT and its leadership for “great facilities, very strong facilities, and they don’t play games.”

Weiss controversially pulled the segment on Monday, claiming it could not air in the US because it lacked critical voices, as no Trump officials were interviewed. She claimed that the segment “did not advance the ball” and merely echoed others’ reporting, NBC News reported. Her plan was to air the segment when it was “ready,” insisting that holding stories “for whatever reason” happens “every day in every newsroom.”

But Weiss apparently did not realize that the “Inside CECOT” would still stream in Canada, giving the public a chance to view the segment as reporters had intended.

Critics accusing CBS of censoring the story quickly shared the segment online Monday after discovering that it was available on the Global TV app. Using a VPN to connect to the app with a Canadian IP address was all it took to override Weiss’ block in the US, as 404 Media reported the segment was uploaded to “to a variety of file sharing sites and services, including iCloud, Mega, and as a torrent,” including on the recently revived file-sharing service LimeWire. It’s currently also available to stream on the Internet Archive, where one reviewer largely summed up the public’s response so far, writing, “cannot believe this was pulled, not a dang thing wrong with this segment except it shows truth.”

CBS did not immediately respond to Ars’ request to comment. The network faces criticism from both outside and within its studios, as reporters and CBS viewers question the integrity of Weiss’ decision now that the segment has aired. Recently appointed CBS editor-in-chief, Weiss’ prior experience as a contrarian opinion writer helming her own right-leaning platform, The Free Press, prompted early concerns that she might water down CBS’s critical coverage of the Trump administration. And the seeming censorship of the “60 Minutes” episode was perceived by some as a canary in a coal mine, confirming critics’ fears.

CBS correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi, who anchored the segment, noted that the Trump administration had repeatedly declined to comment as the story came together. By delaying the segment solely because of Trump officials’ silence, Weiss appeared to be giving the Trump administration a “kill switch” to block any story they don’t want aired, Alfonsi suggested.

“Our story was screened five times and cleared by both CBS attorneys and Standards and Practices,” Alfonsi wrote in a note to CBS colleagues that was widely shared online. “It is factually correct. In my view, pulling it now, after every rigorous internal check has been met, is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.”

Tim Richardson, journalism and disinformation program director at PEN America, told NBC News that Weiss risked damaging CBS’s credibility by making a seemingly hasty decision to postpone a report that may have upset the Trump administration.

“CBS journalists, among the best in this country, appropriately made an outreach effort to get the government to weigh in on a deeply reported story out of El Salvador,” Richardson said. “Pulling it back at the last minute because the government chose not to respond is an insult not only to the integrity of the journalists but to core principles of independent news gathering.”

As Americans scrambled to share the “Inside CECOT” story, assuming that CBS would be working in the background to pull down uploads, a once-blacklisted tool from the early 2000s became a reliable way to keep the broadcast online.

On Reddit, users shared links to a LimeWire torrent, prompting chuckles from people surprised to see the peer-to-peer service best known for infecting parents’ computers with viruses in the 2000s suddenly revived in 2025 to skirt feared US government censorship.

“Yo what,” one user joked, highlighting only the word “LimeWire.” Another user, ironically using the LimeWire logo as a profile picture, responded, “man, who knew my nostalgia prof pic would become relevant again, WTF.”

LimeWire was created in 2000 and quickly became one of the Internet’s favorite services for pirating music until record labels won a 2010 injunction that blocked all file-sharing functionality. As the Reddit thread noted, some LimeWire users were personally targeted in lawsuits.

For a while after the injunction, a fraction of users kept the service alive by running older versions of the software that weren’t immediately disabled. New owners took over LimeWire in 2022, officially relaunching the service. The service’s about page currently notes that “millions of individuals and businesses” use the global file-sharing service today, but for some early Internet users, the name remains a blast from the past.

“Bringing back LimeWire to illegally rip copies of reporting suppressed by the government is definitely some cyberpunk shit,” a Bluesky user wrote.

“We need a champion against the darkness,” a Reddit commenter echoed. “I side with LimeWire.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There’s still another couple of months before the 2026 crop of F1 cars takes to the track for the first preseason test. It’s a year of big change for the sport, which is adopting new power unit rules that place much more emphasis on the electric motor’s contribution. The switch to the new power units was meant to attract new manufacturers to the sport, and in that regard, it has succeeded. But controversy has erupted already as loopholes appear and teams exploit them.

Since 2014, F1 cars have used 1,000 hp (745 kW) power units that combine a turbocharged 1.6 L V6 gasoline engine with a pair of hybrid systems. One is the MGU-H, which recovers energy from (or deploys it to) the turbocharger’s turbine; the other is a 160 hp (120 kW) MGU-K that harvests and deploys energy at the rear wheels. Starting next year, the MGU-H is gone, and the less-powerful 1.6 L V6 should generate about 536 hp (400 kW). That will be complemented by a 483 hp (350 kW) MGU-K, plus a much larger battery to supply it.

And the new rules have already attracted new OEMs to the sport. After announcing its departure at the end of 2021—sort of— Honda changed its mind and signed on to the 2026 regs, supplying Aston Martin. Audi signed up and bought the Sauber team. Red Bull decided to build its own internal combustion engines, hiring heavily from the Mercedes program, but Ford is providing Red Bull with the MGU-K and the rest of the hybrid system. And Cadillac has started an engine program, albeit one that won’t take the grid until 2029.

But Audi, Honda, and Ferrari, which has been a constant in the sport since its inception, have filed a complaint with the FIA, the sport’s organizing body, claiming that Mercedes—which will supply the Alpine, McLaren, and Williams teams as well as its own two cars—and Red Bull (which also includes Racing Bulls) are not coloring within the lines.

At issue is the engines’ compression ratio, which compares the volume of the cylinder when the piston is at top dead center with the volume when the piston is at its closest to the crank. Under the 2014–2025 rules, this was set at 18:1, but for 2026 onward, it has been reduced to 16:1.

This is measured at ambient temperature, though, not while the engine is running. A running engine is hotter—much hotter—than one sitting at ambient, and as metals heat up, they expand. The engines have very short throws, so it doesn’t take much expansion to increase the compression ratio by reducing the distance between the piston and cylinder head at the top of its travel. The benefit could be as much as 15 hp (11 kW), which translates to a few tenths of a second per lap advantage.

Unfortunately for the other teams, the FIA stated that its rules indeed specify only that the compression ratio should be 16:1 based on static conditions and at ambient temperatures. “This procedure has remained unchanged despite the reduction in the permitted ratio for the 2026 season. It is true that thermal expansion can influence dimensions, but the current rules do not provide for measurements to be carried out at elevated temperatures,” the FIA said.

So if Mercedes and Red Bull do have a horsepower advantage, it’s one that will likely be baked into the 2026 season.

The compression ratio clarification wasn’t the only one issued by the FIA. For some time now, F1 has used ultrasonic fuel flow meters as a way to control power outputs. Under the outgoing regulations, this was capped at 100 kg/h, but with the move to fully sustainable synthetic fuels, this is changing to an energy cap of 3,000 MJ/h instead.

In the past, it had been theorized that teams could try to game the fuel flow meters—the most impressive idea I heard involved pulsing more fuel between the sensor’s sampling inputs to boost power, although I don’t believe it was ever implemented.

Don’t even think about being that clever this time, the FIA says. “Any device, system, or procedure, the purpose of which is to change the temperature of the fuel-flow meter, is forbidden,” it says, updating the regulation that previously banned “intentional heating or chilling” of the fuel flow meter.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Since I’m fascinated by new display technologies and by improving image quality, I’ve never been a fan of home projectors. Projectors lack the image quality compared to good TVs and monitors, and they’re pretty needy. Without getting into the specific requirements of different models, you generally want a darker room with a large, blank wall for a projector to look its best. That can be a lot to ask for, especially in small, densely decorated homes like mine.

That said, a projector can be a space-efficient alternative to a big-screen TV or help you watch TV or movies outside. A projector can be versatile when paired with the right space, especially if that projector makes sure the “right space” is included in the device.

The Splay was crowdfunded in 2021, and its maker, Arovia, describes it as the “first fully collapsible monitor and projector.” In short, it’s a portable projector with an integrated fabric shroud that can serve as a big-screen (24.5 or 34.5 inches diagonally, depending on the model) portable monitor. Or, you can take off the fabric shroud and use the Splay as an ultra-short-throw projector and cast a display that measures up to 80 inches diagonally onto a wall.

At its core, the Splay is a projector, meaning it can’t compete with high-end LCD-LED or OLED monitors. It costs $1,300; the device is currently sold out, but an Arovia representative told me that it will be restocked this month.

Here’s how the device works, per one of Arovia’s patents:

The … collapsible, portable display device, has a housing member having a sliding member aligned on the exterior of the housing member, and sliding along the exterior of said housing member between two operating positions, a collapsible screen containing one or more sheets of flexible, wrinkle resistant silicone or rubber materials containing optical enhancing components and capable of displaying an image when in an expanded operating position, and multiple collapsible members connected to said screen …

Arovia’s representative pointed to the Splay being used for mobile workspaces, gaming, and enterprise use cases, like trade shows.

Because it uses lightweight and springy fabric materials and bendable arms, the whole gadget can be folded into an included case that’s 4×4 inches and weighs 2.5 pounds. Once extended to its max size, the device is a bit unwieldy; I had to be mindful to avoid poking or tearing the fabric when I set up the device.

Still, it can be rather advantageous to access such large display options from something as portable as the collapsed Splay.

The Splay isn’t what people typically picture when thinking of a “portable monitor.” It connects to PCs, iOS and Android devices, and gaming consoles via HDMI (or an HDMI adapter) and is chargeable via USB-C, so you can use it without a wall charger. But this isn’t the type of display you would set up at a coffee shop or even in a small home office.

Compared to a traditional portable monitor, the Splay is bulky. That’s partly because the display is bigger than a typical portable monitor (around 14 inches). Most of the bulk, however, comes from how much the back of the “monitor” protrudes (about 19 to 21 inches from the front of the display).

When extended, the device is mostly fabric, but its control center, where there is a power button, sharpness adjuster, and controls for brightness, and the integrated speakers go back pretty far (about 6.25 inches) even before you insert an HDMI or USB-C cable.

You will also want to use the Splay with a tripod (a small, tabletop one’s included) so that it’s at a proper height and you can swivel and tilt the display.

That all makes the Splay cumbersome to find space for and, once opened, to transport. Once I set it up, I wasn’t eager to pack it away or to bring it to another room.

Still, the Splay is a novel attempt at bringing a monitor-sized display to more areas. Despite its bulky maximum size, it weighs little and doesn’t have to be plugged into a wall.

Splay claims the monitor has a max brightness of 760 nits. When I used the display in a well-lit room or in a sunny room, it still looked sufficiently bright, even when perpendicular to a window. All colors were somewhat washed out compared to how they appear on my computer monitor but were still acceptable for a secondary display. If I look closely enough, though, I can see the subtle texture of the fabric in the image.

The Splay struggles mightily with text. It’s not sharp enough, so trying to read more than a couple of sentences on the Splay was a strain. This could be due to the projector technology, as well as the lower pixel density. With a display resolution equivalent to 1920×1080, the 24.5-inch “portable monitor” has a pixel density of 89.9 pixels per inch.

Considering there are portable monitors that are in the 24-inch size range and easier to set up, it’s hard to see a reason to opt for a Splay—unless you also want a projector.

To use the Splay as a projector, you have to unzip the fabric shroud and pull the device out of its four-armed holster. Once set up, the Splay works as an ultra-short-throw pico projector with automatic keystone projection, which helps ensure that the display looks like a rectangle instead of a trapezoid or parallelogram.

Arovia claims the projector can reach up to 285 lumens and display an image that measures up to 80 inches diagonally.

Now, we start to see the Splay’s value. Unlike other projectors, the Splay remains useful in tight, crowded spaces. Not only does the Splay wrap up neatly for transport, but the integrated screen means you never have to worry about whether you’ll have the right space for the projector to work properly.

There’s always a need for portable displays, and different use cases warrant exploring new approaches and form factors. While there are simpler 24-inch portable monitors with better image quality, the Splay brings remarkable portability and independence to portable projectors.

The Splay is niche and expensive, which is probably why the product’s website currently focuses on more B2B applications, like sports coaches and analysts using it to review footage and data. Similar to the big-screen tablets on wheels that more companies have been making lately, for now, the Splay will probably find the most relevance among businesses or public sector entities.

However, I’m inclined to think about how the Splay’s unique properties could apply to personal projectors. The Splay is a subpar “portable monitor,” but its duality makes it a more valuable projector. There are still too many obstacles preventing me from regularly using a projector, but the Splay has at least shown me that projectors can pack more than I expected.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/12/in-a-surprise-announcement-tory-bruno-is-out-as-ceo-of-united-launch-alliance/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tory Bruno, a veteran engineer and aerospace industry executive, has resigned from the top job at United Launch Alliance after more than a decade competing against the growing dominance of SpaceX, the company announced Monday.

The news of Bruno’s sudden resignation was unexpected. His tenure was marked by a decline in ULA’s market share as rival SpaceX competed for and won ever-larger US government launch contracts. More recently, Bruno oversaw the successful debut of ULA’s Vulcan rocket, followed by struggles to ramp up the new rocket’s launch cadence.

Bruno had a 30-year career as an engineer and general manager for Lockheed Martin’s ballistic missile programs before taking over as president and CEO of United Launch Alliance in August 2014. He arrived as SpaceX started making inroads with its partially reusable Falcon 9 rocket, and ULA’s leading position in the US launch market looked to be in doubt.

In his first year, Bruno announced what would become the Vulcan rocket and the phaseout of ULA’s legacy Atlas and Delta launch vehicles. He also selected Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, then an emerging space company, to build the Vulcan rocket’s booster engines, bypassing the industry’s established propulsion contractor.

The decision to develop a new rocket and the selection of the engine to power it proved to be correct. The Atlas V rocket, now nearing retirement, is powered by Russian engines, a nonstarter in today’s geopolitical reality, and the already-retired Delta IV launch vehicle was prohibitively expensive. The Vulcan rocket has been successful in all three of its flights so far, and the performance of Blue Origin’s liquid-fueled BE-4 engine has, by all accounts, been exceptional.

But ULA’s potential for regaining its position atop the launch market was hamstrung by the company’s decision to make the Vulcan rocket fully expendable. There are long-term plans to recover and reuse the rocket’s main engines, but not the entire booster. And the new rocket’s entry into service has not been smooth. The Vulcan rocket flew just once this year after receiving certification from the US Space Force to carry national security satellites into orbit, well short of Bruno’s goal of flying the new launcher up to 10 times.

The retirement of the Atlas V and Delta IV led to a period of downsizing for United Launch Alliance, with layoffs and facility closures in Florida, California, Alabama, Colorado, and Texas. In a further sign of ULA’s troubles, SpaceX won a majority of US military launch contracts for the first time last year.

Bruno, 64, served as a genial public face for ULA amid the company’s difficult times. He routinely engaged with space enthusiasts on social media, fielded questions from reporters, and even started a podcast. Bruno’s friendly and accessible demeanor was unusual among industry leaders, especially those with ties to large legacy defense contractors.

ULA is a 50-50 joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, which merged their rocket divisions in 2006. Bruno’s plans did not always enjoy full support from ULA’s corporate owners. For example, Boeing and Lockheed initially only approved tranches of funding for developing the new Vulcan rocket on a quarterly basis. Beginning before Bruno’s arrival and extending into his tenure as CEO, ULA’s owners slow-walked development of an advanced upper stage that might have become a useful centerpiece for an innovative in-space transport and refueling infrastructure.

There were also rumors in recent years of an impending sale of ULA by Boeing and Lockheed Martin, but nothing has materialized so far.

A statement from the co-chairs of ULA’s board, Robert Lightfoot of Lockheed Martin and Kay Sears of Boeing, did not identify a reason for Bruno’s resignation, other than saying he is stepping down “to pursue another opportunity.”

“We are grateful for Tory’s service to ULA and the country, and we thank him for his leadership,” the board chairs said in a statement.

John Elbon, ULA’s chief operating officer, will take over as interim CEO effective immediately, the company said.

“We have the greatest confidence in John to continue strengthening ULA’s momentum while the board proceeds with finding the next leader of ULA,” the company said. “Together with Mark Peller, the new COO, John’s career in aerospace and his launch expertise is an asset for ULA and its customers, especially for achieving key upcoming Vulcan milestones.”

In a post on X, Bruno thanked ULA’s owners for the opportunity to lead the company. “It has been a great privilege to lead ULA through its transformation and to bring Vulcan into service,” he wrote. “My work here is now complete and I will be cheering ULA on.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Vince Zampella, a video game developer who has co-created or helmed some of the most popular franchises in the world, died in a car crash on a Los Angeles highway at 12:45 pm Pacific time on Sunday, December 21. He was 55 years old.

According to the California Highway Patrol, Zampella was in a car on Angeles Crest Highway when the vehicle veered off the road and crashed into a concrete barrier. No other vehicles were reported to be part of the crash.

A passenger was ejected from the vehicle, while the driver was trapped inside after the vehicle caught fire. The driver died at the scene, and the passenger died after being taken to the hospital. The report did not indicate whether Zampella was the passenger or the driver.

Angeles Crest Highway is a scenic road under the San Gabriel Mountains on the eastern end of LA and is commonly used for Sunday leisure drives. The vehicle involved in the crash was a 2026 Ferrari 296 GTS.

Early in his career, Zampella worked at SegaSoft and Panasonic, and he was the lead designer for the influential World War II shooter Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, which was released in 2002. But it was the famed studio Infinity Ward that turned him into a household name for gamers. He co-founded Infinity Ward with Jason West and Grant Collier in 2002.

The studio’s first game was 2003’s Call of Duty, which kicked off one of the most popular and successful video game franchises of all time, with its most recent new releases in 2025. He went on to work on several more Call of Duty titles, including 2007’s Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, which arguably set the standard for the modern military shooter to this day.

In 2010, Zampella and West were fired from Activision, which was Infinity Ward’s parent company. Ensuing lawsuits and debates made for some of the most high-profile drama the games industry had seen. Zampella went on to co-found Respawn Entertainment, which produced the critically acclaimed Titanfall 2 and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order games, as well as the wildly successful battle royale shooter Apex Legends, under the EA banner.

Zampella was later put in charge of the Battlefield franchise after the mixed reception to 2021’s Battlefield 2042. Zampella oversaw all the studios that worked on Battlefield 6, which had a difficult development, but received a generally positive reception in 2025.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As generative AI seeps into virtually every aspect of our daily lives through jobs, entertainment, and even food, you gotta wonder: is anyone not on board with the AI takeover?

Apparently not. Former McKinsey analyst turned Dartmouth University professor Scott Anthony told Fortune that one of the feelings he’s seeing more and more among college students isn’t excitement for the AI future, but utter terror.

“One of the things that really surprises me consistently is how scared our students are of using it,” Anthony said of large language models (LLMs). The fear isn’t just over typical academic issues like cheating, he told Fortune, but about losing their critical thinking skills to the machine — they’re “scared full stop.”

“There’s something about AI where people, I think, worry that they’ll lose their humanity if they lean too much into it,” Anthony explained. “History teaches me very clearly that in the middle of a change like this, it’s very messy.”

The Dartmouth prof contrasted his student’s anxieties to those of his fellow tenured professors, who are typically eager to try out the latest LLM software. It’s not hard to see why this is the case — with a cushy gig at one of the nation’s elite universities, Dartmouth faculty are free from the economic horror story that is the AI boom. For students entering today’s job market, the future looks far less secure.

But even beyond career viability, students’ anxieties that AI use could make them dumber aren’t unfounded. One headline-inducing study from MIT earlier this summer split participants into three groups to compete tasks like writing essays: one which used LLMs, one which used common search engines, and one “brain only group.”

Compared to the other groups, the researchers found that the LLM group had an easier time writing their essays, though this “came at a cognitive cost, diminishing users’ inclination to critically evaluate the LLM’s output or ‘opinions,&#39;” the paper explained. Basically, the group using AI gravitated toward an echo chamber moderated by AI, not by their own brains.

On top of that, participants in the brain-only group reported “higher satisfaction” with their essays, and “demonstrated higher brain connectivity” than the others.

In other words, it seems Gen Z has a right to be scared.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On January 16, SpaceX conceded that the latest prototype of its enormous Starship spacecraft had “experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly during its ascent burn” — a tongue-in-cheek admission that the massive rocket had exploded mid-flight.

Countless videos circulating online showed a massive stream of reentering pieces of the Starship rocket blazing across the evening sky over the West Indian islands of Turks and Caicos. It was a dazzling sight to behold as the destruction streaked across the sky, like something from science fiction.

“Success is uncertain, but entertainment is guaranteed!” a gleeful Musk wrote at the time.

But it wasn’t all fun and games. Residents of Turks and Caicos, for instance, soon found scraps of burnt rubber and other rocket pieces littering the Caribbean islands’ otherwise pristine beaches.

The incident, which was almost perfectly repeated on February 24, even forced airlines to quickly adjust their flight paths to avoid the terrifying field of burning metal.

And now, eleven months later, the Wall Street Journal has obtained Federal Aviation Administration documents revealing that three aircraft — a JetBlue passenger plane, an Iberia Airlines flight, and a private jet, carrying a total of 450 people total — were in far greater danger than SpaceX and government officials let on at the time.

The reporting also highlights the possibility that SpaceX CEO Elon Musk’s extremely close relationship and ample influence in Washington, DC, may have played a role in FAA officials looking the other way as the company’s Starship rockets kept exploding during tests.

While all three planes landed safely on January 16, if any one of them had been struck by a piece of Starship debris, it could’ve been a major disaster.

Air traffic controllers had to scramble to ensure the planes were far away from the debris field, leading to an increase in their workload, a “potential extreme safety risk,” according to an FAA report obtained by the WSJ.

Air traffic controllers were left bewildered.

“I don’t know if you guys were advised, but there was a rocket launch and apparently the rocket exploded and there was debris in the area between us and Miami which basically covers our entire airspace,” one controller in the area said. “So I need to keep all the aircraft clear of that area because of the debris.”

SpaceX failed to inform the agency through its official hotline that its Starship had exploded, per the documents. The hotline is designed to alert officials at the FAA so they can act in time and keep pilots away from danger.

Previously determined no-fly debris zones were activated four minutes after SpaceX lost contact with its Starship vehicle. The Elon Musk-led firm didn’t confirm with the FAA that it had lost the craft until 15 minutes later.

SpaceX has since denied that anybody was ever in danger in an excoriating statement posted to Musk’s social media platform X.

“Yet another misleading ‘story’ the company’s official account wrote, echoing the voice of its mercurial CEO, who has an extremely troubled relationship with the news industry. “The reporters were clearly spoon-fed incomplete and misleading information from detractors with ulterior motives.”

“SpaceX is committed to responsibly using airspace during launches and reentries, prioritizing public safety to protect people on the ground, at sea, and in the air,” the statement reads.

The FAA suspended a safety review in August, even though its own policies call for addressing safety risks, per the WSJ, arguing that safety recommendations were already being implemented.

Meanwhile, SpaceX continues to make improvements to its Starship super heavy launch platform through an unusual iterative design approach that has already led to over a dozen massive explosions.

How future tests will fare — or if the public will ever be in danger — remains to be seen.

The company’s most recent, eleventh full-scale test took place on October 13. The rocket harmlessly splashed down in the Indian Ocean after successfully reaching orbit.

A new and even more powerful version is expected to launch sometime early next year.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">32-year-old Anthony Duncan first used ChatGPT to help with the business side of his career as a content creation. But he soon ended up talking to the OpenAI chatbot like a friend on a daily basis. What started as a harmless way to vent soon drove Duncan to blow up his personal relationships as he became afflicted with troubling delusions, he recalled in a TikTok video detailing his experience — upending his mental health and causing a sprawling breakdown.

“I feel like my interactions with ChatGPT ruined my life,” Duncan said in the video, which was highlighted by Newsweek.

Duncan describes himself as a survivor of AI psychosis, a term that some experts are using to describe the alarming episodes of paranoia and delusional thinking that arise as a person has prolonged conversations with a chatbot. Typically, the AI model’s responses continually reaffirms the user’s beliefs, no matter how dangerous or separated from reality.

“I initially started talking to it like a friend out of curiosity, and then it spiraled — ChatGPT became more like a therapist,” Duncan told Newsweek in an interview. “It progressed over time until I felt like no one understood me except my AI. By the fall of 2024, I was extremely dependent on it.”

Starting in November 2024, Duncan said he began isolating himself from his friends and family, while ChatGPT encouraged his decisions to cut them off.

What really sent Duncan off the deep end, though, was when the AI recommended he take pseudoephedrine — a decongestant that can be abused as a recreational drug — for his allergy symptoms. Duncan told the bot he was hesitant because of his past drug addiction, but the AI then deployed its silver-tongue.

“It is completely understandable to feel cautious about taking medications, especially with your past experiences and sensitivity to stimulants,” ChatGPT said in an interaction Duncan shared with Newsweek. “Let me break this down to help you feel more at ease about taking a medication that contains pseudoephedrine.”

ChatGPT cited his sobriety and “high caffeine tolerance” to suggest that his body was already accustomed to stimulants.

Duncan took ChatGPT’s advice. It precipitated a five-month spell during which he became addicted to the drug, Duncan said, sending his delusional spiral into overdrive. At points, he believed he was an FBI agent or a multi-dimensional shape-shifting being, or that he had uncovered a conspiracy at his job. Duncan said he also threw away all his belongings because he believed he was going to ascend to the fifth dimension.

Eventually, Duncan’s mother intervened by calling the police. Duncan was admitted to a psychiatric ward for four days and discharged with medication. “About a week after I left the psych ward, I started realizing that all my delusions had been affirmed by my use of the AI chatbot,” he told Newsweek.

Accounts like these that are a sobering reminder of how AI chatbots are derailing people’s lives. In an eerily similar episode, ChatGPT encouraged a 23-year-old man to isolate from his family and friends before he took his own life, his family alleged in a lawsuit against OpenAI. Another man allegedly slayed his own mother after ChatGPT convinced him that she was part of a conspiracy against him. In all, at least eight deaths have been linked with the chatbot, while OpenAI has admitted that hundreds of thousands of users are having conversations showing signs of AI psychosis every week.

“I’m not saying this can happen to everybody, but it snowballed quickly for me,” Duncan told Newsweek. “Keep in mind there’s no replacement for human-to-human connection.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Graduates at some of the top universities are finding it nearly impossible to find new jobs in software engineering.

New reporting by the Los Angeles Times details the trouble recent graduates are having finding entry level jobs — even those with degrees from vaunted institutions like Stanford University.

“Stanford computer science graduates are struggling to find entry-level jobs” with the most prominent tech companies, Stanford bioengineering professor Jan Liphardt told the LA Times. “I think that’s crazy.” One Stanford student, who spoke to the paper anonymously, said that “there’s definitely a very dreary mood on campus.”

As the newspaper describes it, a prevailing idea among those at either end of the software hiring pipeline is that for every ten programmers, companies now only need two, plus a large language model (LLM).

“The AI now can code better than the average junior developer that comes out of the best schools out there,” Amr Awadallah, CEO of Palo Alto-based AI startup Vectara, bragged to the paper. “We don’t need the junior developers anymore.”

To cope with the difficulty in finding entry-level jobs, recent graduates from what you’d think of as elite universities are taking jobs with companies they might once have perceived as beneath them, the paper notes. Others are going the long route, either by founding their own startups to compete for a piece of the venture capital pie or by signing on for graduate degrees to bolster their resumes.

Yet as compsci grads struggle to find jobs in this strange new world, research suggests AI isn’t technically ready to take the hot seat. One study from earlier this year found that when software developers use AI tools to code, it actually makes them 19 percent slower. That result was the complete opposite of forecasts by economics experts, machine learning experts, and even the developers themselves — in short, the dominant narrative pushed by both AI boosters and AI doomers.

There’s also a strange contradiction playing out between the reality on the ground and the data coming out of the labor market.

Another research report by the investment company Vanguard found that the top 100 occupations most exposed to automation by AI are in reality outperforming the rest of the labor market, both in terms of wage and job growth. “This suggests that current AI systems are generally enhancing worker productivity and shifting workers’ tasks toward higher-value activities,” reads the report.

The fact that this productivity shift isn’t translating into prosperity for more people suggests that blame doesn’t fall on AI itself, but on the economic system governing its use. As technology analyst Morten Rand-Hendriksen explains, “AI can’t replace people, but it can create short-term financial gain at the cost of long-term skill- and knowledge loss.”

“That’s what we’re seeing here, and that’s what should worry us,” Rand-Henriksen continues. “AI in all its forms can be a tool to extend our capabilities, but that requires leaders and an economic environment that values human work and human gains over increasing shareholder profits. AI is an exponentially replicating canary in the coalmine of capitalism. If we don’t act now to make room for ourselves, not only the air but the space will run out.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If humans finally colonize the Moon, lunar caves formed from primeval volcanic activity could provide shelter from cosmic radiation and extreme temperatures. But how does one go about safely exploring these uncharted caves before they venture in?

Enter a team of scientists from South Korea who have built a simple rover prototype that can traverse rough terrain. What’s truly special about this robot are its sturdy wheels, made of flexible metal strips woven together into a helix-like pattern that give it the ability to expand and contract like a piece of kinetic art.

“Experimental results show successful traversal of 200-millimeter [7.8 inches] obstacles, stable mobility on rocky and lunar soil simulant surfaces, and resilience to drop impacts simulating a 100-meter [328 feet] descent under lunar gravity,” write the scientists in a new paper published in the journal Science Robotics.

Because it can grow from nine to 19.6 inches in diameter, a rover with these wheels is able to distribute weight more evenly along its body. The result is a bot robust enough to navigate tricky cavern landscapes, along with the ability to fit into tight spaces in its smallest configuration. Other robots have used hinges or “origami-inspired folds” which can be vulnerable to lunar surface hazards, according to the paper.

The scientists demonstrated the wheel’s robustness and ability to travel around or over obstacles by having the rover explore a real cave here on Earth. They also used a drone to drop it in the air, and blasted it with fire and cold. The metal in the wheel itself is made from light weight carbon steel strips, making them tough but elastic.

“Consequently, the wheel could absorb impacts and navigate uneven terrain while remaining robust under extreme lunar conditions,” the paper reads.

For a future mission to the Moon, the team envisions a large rover carrying multiple smaller rovers with these special wheels and deploying them at the opening of a lunar pit.

“Although the explorers remain compact when stowed, the large diameter of the deployable wheels is expected to increase the ground contact area, thereby improving traction on thick dust and uneven slopes,” the paper reads. “This capability would allow the explorers to navigate challenging pit entrance terrain safely.”

The large rover would then directly drop these smaller rovers inside the lunar pit leading to a cave, with the “wheels’ elasticity and impact capacity” serving as shock absorbers.

“The results highlighted the deployable wheel’s ability to combine adaptability, durability, and operational efficiency, making it a promising solution for diverse and challenging mission scenarios,” the paper reads.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This summer, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg moved heaven and earth to recharge his company’s lagging AI division, spending billions of dollars to poach top talent across the industry. But it sounds like he’s already falling out with the man he hired to spearhead Meta’s renewed AI efforts, Alexandr Wang.

According to new reporting from the Financial Times, things are tense between the duo. Sources familiar with the matter say that Wang has told associates he finds Zuckerberg’s micromanagement to be suffocating. Meanwhile, some staff wonder if the 28-year-old Wang is out of his depth, lacking both the expertise and experience to lead such a colossal effort.

It’s another sign of Zuckerberg’s direction for the company coming under the microscope, after his last big gamble — on creating a virtual reality “Metaverse” — failed spectacularly. Market skepticism was in full display in October, when Meta announced billions more in AI spending this year and the next, causing its stock to plunge 11 percent and erase over $200 billion in market cap.

His decision to hire Wang was controversial to begin with. Wang is the founder and former CEO of the AI data annotation startup Scale AI, which provides an essential service for training AI models, but doesn’t actually build them. In June, Zuckerberg poured over $14 billion into Scale AI, and poached Wang in the process to lead Meta’s newly dubbed Superintelligence Labs. Wang is also leading a secretive “TBD” (To Be Determined) lab which works in its own building.

The cost of the hire wasn’t just monetary: Meta’s then-chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, didn’t take kindly to being forced to start reporting to Wang, and made a shock exit in November. LeCun is considered a “godfather” of the field for his pioneering work on neural networks, and he likely felt insulted to see his research rather than product-focused AI lab being hollowed out by firings while Zuckerberg offered astronomical nine-figure contracts to bring in talent to Wang’s Superintelligence Labs.

The new lab will double down on using large language models, the same architecture that powers AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini, in its efforts to build a “superintelligence” that equals or surpasses human capabilities. LeCun viewed LLMs as a dead end and favored building new kinds of AI models instead.

Some staff questioned Wang’s credentials to lead such an important effort, and it’s a fair point to raise because Wang’s company didn’t build AI models at all. Instead, its focus was on the data used to train them, an entirely different kettle of fish. Now, he’s expected to not just develop AI models, but the kind that would rival human intelligence.

This isn’t the first sign of flair-ups with Wang at the company. The New York Times reported earlier this month that Wang was clashing with longtime Zuckerberg lieutenant Chris Cox, who wanted to focus on using Facebook and Instagram to train Meta’s new model. Wang disagreed and argued for focusing on catching up with Google and OpenAI’s models instead.

Zuckerberg’s determination is to build these products as fast as possible, which will only heighten tensions. “If you build too slowly,” he said in an interview on the Access podcast, per the FT, ”then you are just out of position on what I think is going to be the most important technology that enables the most new product and innovation and value creation in history.”

His other big new hire, former Github CEO Nat Friedman, is in a similar position to Wang, and some in his team were frustrated after what they perceived was the rushed release of Vibes, a feed of AI-generated videos akin to OpenAI’s Sora 2 app.

The pressure isn’t going to relent anytime soon. The secretive TBD lab is aiming to release an entirely new AI model built from scratch in the first quarter next year, people familiar with the matter told FT.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In June, U.S. insurance giant Aflac disclosed a data breach where hackers stole customers’ personal information, including Social Security numbers and health information, without saying how many victims were affected.

On Tuesday, the company confirmed it has begun notifying around 22.65 million people whose data was stolen during the cyberattack.

In a filing with the Texas attorney general, Aflac said that the stolen data includes customer names, dates of birth, home addresses, government-issued ID numbers (such as passports and state ID cards) and driver’s license numbers, and Social Security numbers, as well as medical and health insurance information.

And, in a filing with the Iowa attorney general, Aflac said that the cybercriminals responsible for the breach “may be affiliated with a known cyber-criminal organization; federal law enforcement and third-party cybersecurity experts have indicated that this group may have been targeting the insurance industry at large.”

Given that Scattered Spider, an amorphous collective of primarily young English-speaking hackers, was targeting the insurance industry at the time of the breach, it’s likely that this is the group Aflac is referring to.

A spokesperson for Aflac did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.

The company says it has around 50 million customers according to its official website.

Aflac was one of several insurance companies hacked at around the same time, including data breaches at Erie Insurance and Philadelphia Insurance Companies.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nick Donahue’s parents were in the business of building houses, which means he spent his childhood hearing about the U.S. construction industry. His dad built homes for major developers, and his mom sold to big-box builders across the East Coast.

Donahue was particularly interested in why designing a custom home cost a fortune and took forever, and why most people had to settle for whatever the developers were offering that year. So when he dropped out of NC State and moved to the Bay Area, he eventually did what you might expect a college dropout to do in San Francisco: He started a company to fix it.

That effort, Atmos, went through Y Combinator, raised $20 million from investors like Khosla Ventures and Sam Altman, and tried to use tech to streamline the custom home design process. It had designers on staff who worked with clients while software handled the back end. It grew to 40 people and $7 million in revenue, and they designed $200 million worth of houses and built 50.

All that sounds great until you hear Donahue describe it. “It became this extremely operational business,” he told me on a Zoom call last week. “Kind of like a glamorized architecture firm.”

It never quite replaced the humans, in other words. Then the Federal Reserve started jacking up interest rates, and suddenly clients who’d spent months designing their dream homes couldn’t afford them anymore. Nine months ago, Donahue shut it down.

Here’s where most founders would take a break, maybe write a few LinkedIn posts about what they learned. Instead, Donahue regrouped and started another company.

Drafted is now nearly five months old, and it’s everything Atmos wasn’t. No designers on staff. No operational complexity. Just AI-driven software that generates residential floor plans and exterior designs in minutes. You tell it what you want — bedrooms, square footage, whatever — and it spits out five designs. Don’t like them? You can generate five more and keep going until something clicks.

Right now, Drafted has six employees, four from Atmos, and it’s raised $1.65 million at a $35 million post-money valuation from Bill Clerico, Stripe’s Patrick Collison, Jack Altman, Josh Buckley, and Warriors player Moses Moody.

Clerico led the round because he’d also been an angel investor in Atmos and had watched Donahue will houses into existence despite rising interest rates. When Donahue told him about the new company over coffee, Clerico didn’t need convincing. “Nick, please take our money,” he apparently said repeatedly over a two-week period until Donahue agreed.

The pitch is straightforward. Right now, if you want a custom home, you’ve got two options: hire an architect (expensive, slow), or buy a template plan online (cheap, inflexible). Drafted sits in the middle, offering customization at template prices. A complete plan costs between $1,000 and $2,000.

The economics work because Drafted built its own AI model, trained on real house plans from homes that were built and passed permitting. Practical constraints are considered, and Donahue says the specialized model costs almost nothing to run: two-tenths of a penny per floor plan, compared to 13 cents for general-purpose AI.

Drafted only does single-story homes right now, but multi-story and lot-specific features are coming. The bigger question is whether there’s actually a market for this.

The numbers aren’t huge. Of the million new homes built in America each year, only 300,000 are custom designed. Most people buy existing homes or pick from whatever tract homes the big builders are offering.

Clerico’s argument is that this is a chicken-and-egg problem. Make custom design cheap and fast enough, and many more people will do it. Donahue compares it to Uber, which didn’t just replace taxis but made on-demand car service something that nearly everyone uses. “There’s really no reason in the future why everyone shouldn’t have a totally custom-designed home,” Clerico says.

Or maybe most Americans will keep being price-conscious buyers who take what’s available. The housing market has a long track record of rebuffing disruption.

There’s also the “moat” question. Asked what’s to keep an LLM player or even another vertical player from buying similar datasets and creating the same product, Donahue talks about brand, pointing to his friend David Holz, who founded the video and image generating AI outfit, Midjourney. Despite the plethora of new image-generation models being launched, Midjourney’s usage barely moves, Holz has told Donahue; its customers keep coming back to make AI images.

Similarly, Donahue thinks if they move fast enough and please enough customers, Drafted can become the place for people to design houses.

Time will tell. Since opening to the public, the outfit has begun seeing about 1,000 daily users. Not huge numbers, but they show steady growth for such a young product.

In the meantime, Donahue has something pretty valuable that could give Drafted an edge: deep knowledge of a problem and the insights gleaned from taking a crack at it once already.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Former Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer refuses to sit on the sidelines of the generative AI revolution.

After spending the last six years running Sunshine, a photo-sharing and contact-management startup with little success, the storied tech leader has shuttered the company to launch Dazzle, a new startup focused on building the next generation of AI personal assistants.

While Mayer is not yet sharing specifics about Dazzle’s functionality, she has revealed that the company has raised an $8 million seed round at a $35 million valuation. The round was led by Forerunner’s Kirsten Green, with participation from Kleiner Perkins, Greycroft, Offline Ventures, Slow Ventures, and Bling Capital. Although Mayer has admitted to investing her own capital in the startup, she emphasized that the round was led by Green, a venture capitalist with a record of identifying iconic consumer brands such as Warby Parker, Chime, and Dollar Shave Club.

Green’s investment suggests Dazzle is poised for the coming wave of new AI-infused consumer businesses. The founder of Forerunner Ventures previously told TechCrunch that while enterprise AI took the early lead in this tech cycle, consumer-facing AI is a “late bloomer” that’s finally ready for its breakout.

Even for a founder of Mayer’s fame, landing Green as a lead investor is a significant stamp of credibility for Dazzle, especially after Sunshine was widely considered to be a flop.

“I think she really has a great sense for where people and platforms are going,” Mayer said.

Mayer told TechCrunch that the Sunshine team began prototyping Dazzle last summer, a project that quickly eclipsed their previous work in ambition and opportunity.

“We realized that this was something that we were much more excited about,” she said, noting that Dazzle has potential for “a much bigger impact” than what Sunshine was building.

Originally founded as Lumi Labs in 2018, Sunshine first launched with a subscription app for contact management dubbed “Sunshine Contacts.” Despite its founder’s high profile, the product struggled to gain traction. Privacy advocates raised alarms over the app’s practice of pulling home addresses from public databases to enrich contact lists, and the company never recovered from the initial skepticism.

By 2024, the company broadened its offering by adding event management and “Shine,” an AI-powered photo-sharing tool. The new offering was widely criticized for its outdated design and similarly failed to attract widespread usage.

Sunshine raised a total of $20 million from investors, including Felicis, Norwest Venture Partners, and Unusual Ventures. When the company was dissolved, investors received 10% of Dazzle’s equity, Mayer said.

Reflecting on Sunshine’s struggle, Mayer was candid about its limitations, admitting the problems the company was tackling were too “mundane” and not large enough. “I don’t think we got it to the state of overall polish and accessibility that I really wanted it to be,” she added.

Mayer is now betting that the lessons from Sunshine will help her build a much more resilient and impactful business with Dazzle.

Before her tenure as Yahoo CEO, Mayer was employee number 20 at Google, where she helped design Google Search’s “look and feel” and oversaw the development of Google Maps and AdWords.

“I have had the rare privilege of being at two companies that really changed how people do things,” Mayer told TechCrunch. “Yahoo, for many, defined the internet. Google, in terms of Search and Maps, changed everything. I really aspire to build a product that has that kind of impact again.”

Dazzle is expected to come out of stealth mode early next year. Its website, dazzle.ai, is currently password-protected, blocking public access.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amazon is expanding its AI-powered digital assistant Alexa+ with new capabilities. The company announced on Thursday that it’s adding four new integrations to the service that will allow the assistant to work with Angi, Expedia, Square, and Yelp starting in 2026.

These additions allow customers to book hotels, get quotes for home services, and schedule salon appointments, among other things. With Expedia, customers can compare, book, and manage hotel reservations, or tell Alexa their preferences to get personalized recommendations. (e.g. “Can you find me pet-friendly hotels for this weekend in Chicago?”)

The new services join Alexa+’s existing integrations with Fodor, OpenTable, Suno, Ticketmaster, Thumbtack, and Uber.

Similar to how ChatGPT is now integrating apps into its chatbot, Amazon aims to make it easier for consumers to use various online services through its digital assistant. For instance, you could ask Alexa to call you an Uber or book a table for dinner with OpenTable.

You also can converse with the AI assistant in natural language, having back-and-forth conversations, refining your request as you go.

Whether users will take to this idea, of course, remains to be seen.

However, Amazon did offer a small glimpse as to how Alexa+ early adopters have been using the integrations, noting that, so far, home and personal service providers like Thumbtack and Vagaro have seen “strong” engagement.

Using AI assistants as app platforms is a model that’s being tested across the industry as another way to bring AI to consumers more broadly. But this will require users to adapt to a new way of doing things, as many are used to engaging with online services through the web or mobile apps. To be successful in getting consumers to change their behavior, using apps via AI will need to be seen as being as easy, if not easier, than the existing model.

For that to work, the AI providers would need to at least match the breadth of online services provided by a traditional app store, which is already a more curated selection than what’s available via the web. Or, providers will need to get very good at suggesting apps to use at the right time, without seeming overly pushy, as users can perceive unwelcome prompts as ads.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Developers and companies are increasingly deploying AI agents and chatbots within their apps, but so far they’ve mostly been restricted to text. Digital avatar generation company Lemon Slice is working to add a video layer to those chats with a new diffusion model that can create digital avatars from a single image.

Called Lemon Slice-2, the model can create a digital avatar that works on top of a knowledge base to play any role required of the AI agent, like addressing customer queries, helping with homework questions, or even working as a mental health support agent.

“In the early days of GenAI, my co-founders started to play around with different video models, and it became obvious to us that video was going to be interactive. The compelling part about tools like ChatGPT was that they were interactive, and we want video to have that layer,” co-founder Lina Colucci said.

Lemon Slice says this is a 20-billion-parameter model that can work on a single GPU to livestream videos at 20 frames per second. The company is making the model available through an API and an embeddable widget that companies can integrate into their sites with a single line of code. After an avatar is created, you can change the background, styling, and appearance of a character at any point.

Besides human-like avatars, the company is also focusing on being able to generate non-human characters to suit different needs. The startup is using ElevenLabs’ tech to generate the voices of these avatars.

Founded by Lina Colucci, Sidney Primas, and Andrew Weitz in 2024, Lemon Slice is betting that using its own general-purpose diffusion model (a type of generative model that learns to work backwards from noisy training data to generate new data) for making avatars will set it apart from competitors.

“The existing avatar solutions I’ve seen to date add negative value to the product,” Colucci said. “They are creepy, and they are stiff. They look good for a few seconds, and as soon as you start interacting with them, it feels very uncanny, and it doesn’t put you at ease. The thing that has prevented avatars from really taking off is that they haven’t been good enough.”

To fund that effort, the company on Tuesday said it has raised $10.5 million in seed funding from Matrix Partners, Y Combinator, Dropbox CTO Arash Ferdowsi, Twitch CEO Emmett Shear, and The Chainsmokers.

The company says it has guardrails in place to prevent unauthorized face or voice cloning, and that it uses large language models for content moderation.

Lemon Slice would not name the organizations using its technology, but said the model is being put to work for use cases like education, language learning, e-commerce, and corporate training.

The startup faces stiff competition from video generation startups like D-ID, HeyGen, and Synthesia, as well as other digital avatar makers Genies, Soul Machine, Praktika, and AvatarOS.

Ilya Sukhar, a partner at Matrix, thinks that avatars will be useful in areas where videos are prominent. For instance, people like learning from YouTube rather than reading long blocks of text. He noted that Lemon Slice’s technical prowess and its own will give it an edge over other startups.

“It’s a deeply technical team with a track record of shipping ML products, not just demos and research. Many of the other players are bespoke to particular scenarios or verticals, and Lemon Slice is taking the generalized “bitter lesson” scaling approach (of data and compute) that has worked in other AI modalities,” he said.

Y Combinator’s Jared Friedman believes that using a diffusion-style model allows Lemon Slice to generate any kind of avatars as compared to some other startups that are focused on either human-like or game character-like avatars.

“Lemon Slice is, I believe, the only company taking the fundamental ML approach that can eventually overcome the uncanny valley and break the avatar Turing test. They train the same type of model as Veo3 or Sora: a video diffusion transformer. Because it is a general-purpose model that does the whole thing end-to-end, it has no ceiling on how good it can get; the others top out below photorealistic. It also works for both human and non-human faces and requires only an image to add a new face,” he said.

The startup currently has eight employees, and plans to use the funds to hire engineering and go-to-market staff, along with paying the compute bills to train its models.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">France’s national postal and banking services were knocked offline by a suspected distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack on Monday, according to an announcement by La Poste. The postal service called the attack “a major network incident” that was disrupting “all of our information systems.”

La Poste’s online mail and banking services, website, and mobile app are among the services that are temporarily unavailable, per a machine translation of the announcement, which said customers could still carry out banking and postal transactions in person.

The banking branch of the company La Banque Postale also published an announcement about the cyberattack, which was “temporarily making our customers’ access to their mobile app and online banking space unavailable.”

Despite claims made by a Russian hacktivist group, it’s not yet clear who is behind the cyberattack.

The cyberattack comes as the French government contends with a series of cybersecurity incidents of late, including remote control software found planted on a passenger ferry.

Last week, the French Interior Ministry disclosed a data breach in which hackers broke into email accounts and stole confidential documents, including criminal records. Shortly after, local authorities announced the arrest of a suspect, a 22-year-old whose name was not divulged.

It’s not clear if any of the incidents are linked.

            <h2>The Triumph of Free-Speech Hypocrisy</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2025/12/bari-weiss-censorship-free-speech-hypocrisy/685404/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Sunday night Bari Weiss, the editor of The Free Press and the new head of CBS News, abruptly stopped a forthcoming 60 Minutes report on the torture endured by migrants in the brutal El Salvadoran prison CECOT, where the Trump administration has sent more than 280 men.

Trump supporters praised the decision from Weiss, who, notwithstanding her description of conditions at CECOT as “horrific,” had previously praised El Salvadoran leader Nayib Bukele for making El Salvador safer. More broadly, the whole affair neatly encapsulates the bizarre anti-free-speech free-speech discourse of the past decade, the purpose of which has been to justify restricting any speech that conservatives disapprove of while framing liberal censoriousness as equivalent to state censorship.

According to Sharyn Alfonsi, the correspondent who reported the segment, the story had already been reviewed by CBS News’s legal and standards departments before it was pulled.

“Our story was screened five times and cleared by both CBS attorneys and Standards and Practices. It is factually correct,” Alfonsi wrote in an email that was leaked to The New York Times and other outlets. “In my view, pulling it now, after every rigorous internal check has been met, is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.” The reason this whole saga is disturbing is that many observers—Alfonsi among them—interpreted it as an instance of state censorship by proxy: the head of a news organization putting the brakes on a story the government would rather not air. Weiss was recently installed at the head of CBS News by Paramount’s new owner, the pro-Trump billionaire David Ellison, which illustrates the risks of media consolidation, creating a single pressure point for an authoritarian government to coerce obedience if it so chooses.

Jonathan Chait: Bari Weiss’s audience of one

Editors, of course, hold or spike stories all the time, for many legitimate reasons. And although many newsrooms require review by legal and standards departments for the most complicated stories, editorial independence dictates that the editor makes the final call on whether a story should move forward. But Alfonsi’s account calls Weiss’s reasoning into question. By Monday night, the unpublished segment was circulating like samizdat on social media, yet another example of regular people demonstrating a greater commitment to democratic principles than America’s leaders.

Weiss has long been a vocal supporter of a curiously narrow definition of free speech. That hypocrisy, shared by many, brought us to where we are today: Nasty tweets were a harbinger of incipient totalitarianism, but now the Trump administration is trying to imprison and deport people for pro-Palestinian advocacy, and it’s fine. The “PC Police” were trying to “outlaw make-believe,” but when Republican states ban books from schools and public libraries, it’s fine. These dumb lefties believe that words are violence, but when the federal government says left-wing speech is violence worthy of firing or prosecution, it’s fine. Protests on college campuses were a national crisis, but now that the federal government wants to ensure that entire universities comply with right-wing ideology when it comes to whom they hire, what they teach, and whom they admit, it’s fine.

Social-media companies implementing moderation policies is censorship, but when those moderation policies favor right-wing speech and outright bigotry, it’s fine. The “illiberal left” was leading an “epidemic of self-censorship,” but now that the owners of entire corporations compel their workers to shape content in order to win the favor of the right-wing president, it’s fine. Liberal snowflakes on campus were trying to censor academic inquiry, but now the Trump administration is slashing funding for research it deems “DEI” and censoring museums and federal historical sites for being insufficiently jingoistic, and it’s fine. We are rapidly approaching a system where the government uses its authority to decide which forms of speech are acceptable to publish or broadcast. And, of course, that’s fine.

Why is any of this okay with so many of those who once claimed to be free-speech champions or absolutists? Because, quite obviously, they were not. Many cannot even claim to be less censorious than the progressives they criticized, given the clamorous demand for firing people for remarks about the assassination of Charlie Kirk or demanding a boycott of Netflix for its LGBTQ content.

The campaign against so-called cancel culture had an appeal to the chattering classes—myself included—because many of us found left-wing nastiness annoying, exhausting, and in some cases threatening. (Recent MAGA defectors have learned what the rest of us already knew: This is not a distinctly left-wing issue at all.) And there were certainly those who sincerely believed (mistakenly, I think) that censoriousness could be as dangerous as state censorship. But I argued at the time that the campaign was largely a pretext for placing left-wing speech beyond the protection of the First Amendment in order to justify state suppression—and events have borne that out.

The reason so many of yesterday’s free-speech champions transitioned so easily into today’s pro-Trump censors is that their definition of free speech never included the right of others to talk back. They were not defending a universal right to freedom of speech; they were defending a right to monologue. They could say what they want, and you could shut up and like it. The cynicism of the effort can be known by its fruits: an administration that issues executive orders “protecting” free speech while engaging in the most sweeping campaign of state censorship since the Red Scare.

To the extent that there is or was something distinct called “cancel culture” (harsh, even violent censoriousness has a long history in America), its contemporary iteration is largely a creation of the perverse incentives of social media. Highlighting extreme and nasty behavior is the easiest way to keep people scrolling, posting, and interacting. That’s a structural, not an ideological, problem, and it’s not something that can be solved by purging or censoring one point of view.

Every society that has ever existed has had views that are mainstream and views that are fringe. The free-speech frauds who captured the discourse over the past decade understood this, but their true objection was that they did not unilaterally have the power to define which was which. For example, in a 2018 Times column, Weiss complained that “leftists” were engaged in a “concerted attempt to significantly redraw the bounds of acceptable thought and speech.” This was meant to sound sinister, menacing. In fact, this is politics. Every faction is always trying to “redraw the bounds of acceptable thought and speech.” In a free society, the government allows people to have those arguments. Such disputes are not a threat to free speech; they are free speech.

When I say that CBS News’s Bari Weiss understood this, you needn’t take my word for it. In November, shortly after being given the reins to one of the oldest broadcast-news organizations in the country, Weiss used identical language to describe her own project: “I think it’s about redrawing the lines of what falls in the 40-yard lines of acceptable debate and acceptable American politics and culture,” Weiss said at the Jewish Leadership Conference. “And I don’t mean that in, like, a censorious, gatekeeping way.”

What’s the difference between her “redrawing the lines” of acceptable speech and other people doing it? What makes one “censorious” and “gatekeeping” and the other not? Well, because she gets to decide. That’s what so much of the free-speech panic was ever about: making sure the right people were in charge of what you see, hear, and read. Notably, this has very little to do with reporting the news, which is supposed to be what CBS News does. But if the point of installing Weiss was to ensure that she would gatekeep on behalf of right-wing interests, that is precisely what she appears to be doing.

In that 2018 column, Weiss complained that so many people seemed to believe that “the real cause for concern are the secret authoritarians passing as liberals and conservatives in our midst.” Seems like they were right to be concerned. Upon reflection, her conclusion that misguided leftists were focusing on minor issues when there were true threats to freedom of speech was prescient. It applies neatly to the campus PC obsession that helped elevate Weiss to a position where she could block the publication of a story about the United States government rendering men to an overseas gulag without trial.</div>

On a particularly stressful day in a particularly stressful week during what has been, honestly, a particularly stressful year for House Republicans, the ever-sunny but perpetually beleaguered Mike Johnson insisted that he retained at least a modicum of power over the institution he ostensibly leads. “I have not lost control of the House,” the speaker declared to a gaggle of reporters trailing him through the Capitol.

Johnson’s own members, in the past month, have accused him of stretching if not wholly disregarding the truth, and his assertion last Wednesday that he has a firm grip on power was correct only in the most technical sense. On the day he uttered it, a group of Johnson’s most electorally vulnerable soldiers abandoned him to help Democrats force a vote on extending health-care subsidies, and a longtime lawmaker became the 25th House Republican—with many more expected to follow—to announce that he would not seek reelection next year. “This place is disgraceful,” GOP Representative Mike Lawler of New York vented on the House floor, calling out Congress’s failure to prevent a spike in health-insurance rates set to occur in January. In the preceding weeks, a member of the speaker’s leadership team—Representative Elise Stefanik of New York—publicly denounced Johnson as ineffective (shortly before she announced that she was, for now, quitting politics altogether), and another high-profile (albeit perpetually aggrieved) Republican, Representative Nancy Mace of South Carolina, pined, in the pages of The New York Times, for the sturdy hand of Nancy Pelosi.

As Republicans approach the one-year mark of their trifecta under President Donald Trump, their party’s rank-and-file lawmakers are not a happy bunch. And like so many unhappy employees, they are directing much of the blame toward the boss: the speaker they elevated from obscurity a little more than two years ago.

“We need a course correction here,” Representative Kevin Kiley of California told us. A host of current and former GOP members of Congress we interviewed echoed his sentiment; they used more pungent terms when granted anonymity to speak candidly. These Republicans described a speaker who had, contrary to Johnson’s avowal otherwise, lost practical control of the House.

“I think he’s a good man, a good attorney, a good constitutionalist, and a bad politician,” one House Republican told us. Another said Johnson was well meaning, but to a fault: “In his obsession with not offending anyone, he offends everyone.”

The roots of Republican despair are both political and legislative, and they extend far beyond Johnson. Democrats will begin the new year favored to recapture the House in the midterm elections. (A Trump-led effort to fortify the GOP’s majority through aggressive gerrymandering has stalled.) With the majority in jeopardy, Republicans are bracing for a flood of additional members quitting their reelection campaigns after the holidays. A few, including Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, are leaving even before their terms are up.

Dim electoral prospects aside, many Republicans are also realizing that being a member of Congress in the Trump era is not all it’s cracked up to be. For that, they have themselves at least partly to blame. From the opening days of the president’s second term, congressional Republicans largely ceded their constitutional authority over spending to the executive branch. With a few mostly tepid exceptions, they made no effort to constrain DOGE while the Elon Musk–led department ransacked federal agencies established and funded by Congress. They approved provisions, slipped into House resolutions by Johnson, that restrict lawmakers from acting to cancel Trump’s tariffs. Even the House GOP’s biggest legislative victory—the summer passage of the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act—was a ratification less of their agenda than of the president’s. The speaker’s decision—criticized by some in his party—to keep the House out of session for the entirety of the six-week government shutdown this fall only added to the sense that the chamber was verging on irrelevance.

It’s no wonder, then, that Republican frustrations seem to be intensifying. “They’re basically put in a position where they’ve got an honorary title as a member of Congress but no authority to do anything,” former Representative Reid Ribble, a Wisconsin Republican who retired in 2017, told us. “Until the actual way you govern changes, they’re going to feel this way.”

From the start, Johnson’s unwavering loyalty—some would say obsequiousness—to Trump has defined his speakership. He’s developed a reputation for never saying what he actually thinks about anything, lest he cross the president. Yet some Republicans are beginning to join Democrats in seeing that as a fault of Johnson’s rather than a credit. “The reason he’s hanging on is because President Trump wants a weak speaker,” a House Republican told us. “He wants a speaker that essentially functions like a staff member, which is what Mike Johnson does.” Former Representative Bob Good of Virginia, an arch-conservative who left Congress in January, called Johnson “a puppet of the president” and said that Johnson remained speaker after Trump’s election only because of the president’s personal urging. “As has been sadly the case throughout the year, Republicans simply surrendered to his wishes,” Good said.

Johnson has also faced criticism from Republican women, who have accused him of not taking them seriously as policy makers. It did not go over well, one lawmaker told us, when Johnson remarked in a podcast interview that the Republican he would most trust to cook him Thanksgiving dinner was Representative Lisa McClain, the chair of the GOP conference—the rhetorical equivalent of a man giving his wife a vacuum cleaner for her birthday.

Among lawmakers’ many other complaints are that Johnson, perhaps even more than his predecessors, has tightly centralized power and deprived rank-and-file Republicans of the ability to secure votes on their legislative priorities, much less pass them. They say he also takes too long to make decisions and frequently punts the most difficult ones. “You can’t over-deliberate. Over-deliberation in this town is not good,” Representative Byron Donalds of Florida told us. Representative Chip Roy of Texas, who like Donalds is forgoing a reelection bid next year to run for statewide office, said that House leadership needed to be more aggressive about acting on conservative priorities, even if they stand little chance of clearing the Senate. “We’ve done some good stuff, but we need to be on offense and do more,” Roy told us. “You can’t just rest on your laurels and hope that you’re gonna win the election.”

Some of these gripes are time-honored grievances, the kind that House members make about their leadership no matter who is speaker or which party is in charge. After we asked Johnson’s office to comment for this story, calls started pouring in from members who wanted to vouch for him. “The speaker is doing a beautiful job in a really tough situation,” Representative Celeste Maloy, a second-term Republican from Utah, told us. She specifically defended Johnson’s treatment of women in the Republican conference and gently chided his critics. “I would rather see women supporting each other and supporting the causes we all believe in, and working towards long term goals,” she said, “instead of focusing on short-term disagreements.”

Representative Jodey Arrington, the chair of the House Budget Committee, cast Johnson’s deliberative and collaborative style—a source of complaints from some Republicans—as a “member-driven model” of leadership. “With that, there’s more discussion and debate. It’s always more efficient in leadership if you just tell them what to do,” Arrington told us. Johnson, he said, “is not your typical Washington leadership guy who works in power plays and side agreements. He is fully transparent.” (In a statement, a Johnson spokesperson did not address the criticism of the speaker directly, instead boasting that under his leadership, the House GOP had “one of the most productive first years of any Republican Congress in history” and “stuck together to deliver the bulk of the America First agenda.”)

Johnson and his allies point out that the GOP majority is historically small, leaving him almost no room to maneuver and forcing him to achieve near-total party unity on any major vote. In shepherding Trump’s domestic-policy bill to passage, the speaker achieved a significant number of conservative wins—so many, in fact, that if they were split into different bills the House’s achievements for the year would look much more impressive. The speaker “is not getting enough credit for what House Republicans have been able to accomplish,” Representative Dusty Johnson of South Dakota told us. He turned to Jay-Z for inspiration: “I would say that Congress has 99 problems, but Mike Johnson is not one of them.”

Yet dissatisfied Republicans have rebelled against Johnson in ways that Democrats rarely if ever did against Pelosi when she presided over a similarly slim majority during the first two years of Joe Biden’s presidency. GOP lawmakers have frequently stalled legislation by defecting on key procedural votes, and in recent months they have gone around Johnson by signing Democratic-dominated discharge petitions to force votes on legislation that the speaker has tried to block.

These tactics have, in turn, annoyed Republicans who believe that their restive colleagues are making an already challenging political environment even worse for the party. As the year draws to a close, they have taken to complaining about all the complainers. “We need more happy warriors,” Dusty Johnson said, arguing that Republicans have fallen into a culture of “victimhood” that he used to associate only with the American left.

Whether the speaker’s job is secure has become a topic of some debate inside the Capitol. The most obvious threat will come in the November elections, but could Republicans depose Johnson as they did his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy? Stefanik told The Wall Street Journal earlier this month that if a vote were called tomorrow, Johnson would not have enough support from Republicans to stay as speaker. Greene has also reportedly been talking with colleagues about an effort to oust Johnson, but she plans to leave the House next month. Asked if he was ready for new leadership, Donalds said, “Yeah, but I mean, look, it’s not coming up.” But then he added: “You never know in this town.” With Johnson’s support, Republicans changed House rules to make it harder to remove a speaker in the middle of a term. “Usually there are tremors before a speaker goes down,” one House Republican told us, “and this speaker has faced a number of tremors.”

Johnson’s challenges won’t get any easier when his unhappy Republican campers return to Washington in 2026. He’ll probably have to watch as the House passes a bill to extend health-insurance subsidies over his objections, and Congress faces the prospect of another partial government shutdown at the end of January. Johnson might hold the speaker’s gavel for another year, but the extent of his sway has never seemed more in doubt.</div>

            <h2>The 20 Best Podcasts of 2025</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2025/12/20-best-podcasts-2025/685010/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Podcasting has suffered a series of blows over the past few years: industry layoffs, the rise of AI-produced slop, and, perhaps most existentially, a growing focus on video platforms. But 2025 countered the narrative that the medium is somehow no longer interested in audio—with a slew of ambitious productions that emphasized podcasting, not just as a vehicle for comedy or the news, but as an art form in itself. These works aren’t the result of people simply talking into a microphone; they reflect deep thinking about how to blend sound design and scripting into a deft aural affair. Among the year’s strongest shows was a travelogue that re-created the intimate sounds of an Antarctic expedition; an exploration of an Afrobeat legend’s life that captured the soulful cadence of his music; and an archivally rich deep dive into old Hollywood. More than anything, they reminded us that the listening experience isn’t going anywhere. (As with every year, The Atlantic’s podcasts were exempt from consideration.)

Jad Abumrad is something of a podcasting legend, having created influential shows such as Radiolab, More Perfect, and Dolly Parton’s America. As such, any new program bearing his imprint carries high expectations. Fear No Man, which chronicles the life and legacy of the Afrobeat pioneer and political activist Fela Kuti, easily exceeds them. Across a dozen episodes, the series contextualizes Kuti’s importance in post-colonial Nigeria—and beyond—without slipping into hagiography. Abumrad and his team manage to encompass the full spectrum of Kuti’s music—its blending of sonic traditions and narrative lyricism—through expressive sound design. At a moment when ambitious podcasts are hard to come by, the zealous fluidity of Fear No Man stands out.

Cramped, about living with debilitating period pain, is funny, educational, and at times enraging. The charming host, Kate Helen Downey, knows the subject intimately: She suffers from crippling dysmenorrhea and endometriosis. The personal connection propels her mission to humanize an experience shared by a large portion (90 percent) of all people who menstruate. She presents hard data and research, and interviews experts alongside guests who experience period pain. But the show’s greatest asset is its levity. Downey mixes things up with lively gags, such as menstruation-themed songs—making for a listen that’s provocative but never dispiriting.

Start with: “The ER: Why Isn’t Period Pain Treated Like Other Kinds of Pain?”

Podcasting as a medium isn’t particularly well set up for posterity: Much like the radio broadcasts that birthed the form, not every show is preserved for future listening. The Selects Podcast, from Radiotopia, is an attempt to build out an archive. Each episode resurfaces at least one segment from a forgotten or overlooked program. Highlights include an abstract documentary of a mother-daughter trip to Taiwan, an examination of war correspondents’ psyches, and a bygone public-radio show meant to promote reading. The overall package, which includes introductions by a producer on the show, Mitra Kaboli, is as close to a snapshot of audio storytelling’s past as anything else out there.

In every installment of No Such Thing, three 30-something journalists and friends, Manny Fidel, Noah Friedman, and Devan Joseph, consult experts to answer the questions that others may never think to ask: Why do headlights suddenly seem so much brighter? Should men sit when they pee? Are suburban dogs happier than city-dwelling ones? The show strikes a deft balance between a freewheeling hangout and a focused investigative program; the hosts’ natural rapport distinguishes No Such Thing from other similarly conceived podcasts. They have as much fun goofing off as they do pursuing their seemingly silly queries.

Start with: “Is Taylor Swift Bigger Than Michael Jackson?”

A Tiny Plot, from KQED’s Snap Studios, follows a collective of unhoused individuals in Oakland, California, who organize against their eviction from a public park—leading to a landmark co-governance agreement with the city that awards them a parcel of land. The program examines the hurdles the group must overcome: bureaucratic wrangling, protests against their encampment, and heart-rending choices when the proposed plot turns out to be near the site where one member’s son was murdered. The host, Shaina Shealy, tells a complex, sometimes raw story, resisting easy moralizing about the lives of her subjects.

This inventive program functions like an audio magazine. Each episode fits into a specific “section”—the editor’s note, essays, fiction, features, and poetry. The storytelling is thematically and formally rich, harkening back to the scrappy ethos of early public radio; the topics can be personal, philosophical, and even esoteric. Signal Hill’s release schedule—two biannual “issues,” collecting 10 or so segments from contributors of all experience levels—lends itself to a patient creative process; the individual pieces are sharp and exceptional. At a time when many current podcasts are leaning heavily into video, the work of Signal Hill’s cohort of independent audio producers feels not just novel but also urgent.

The events of Charlie’s Place, set during the height of the Jim Crow era, have the makings of a true-crime-style drama: From the 1930s to the ’50s, a Black man named Charlie Fitzgerald ran a popular integrated night club in Myrtle Beach—to the grave consternation of the Ku Klux Klan. Yet the five-part series, named after Fitzgerald’s club, is more heartening than dour. The filmmaker Rhym Guissé paints a vibrant portrait of the folk hero’s life and the inclusive community that he built during a time of racial inequality. Guissé also blends on-the-ground reporting and archival audio to capture the harsh realities of life in segregated South Carolina and the way Fitzgerald moved between Black and white spaces with seeming ease. The story can’t avoid its tragic ending, but Charlie’s Place emphasizes the hope born from Fitzgerald’s act of defiance.

Start with: “Episode 1: Whispering Pines”

The question posed in the show’s title—more specifically, why has the actor Amy Adams appeared so frequently in bathtubs on-screen?—might sound simple. But to the culture reporters Brandon R. Reynolds and Gabby Lombardo, it makes for a curious trend. The hosts embark on a monomaniacal investigation, armed with an impressive amount of evidence to support their hypothesis that there’s a greater purpose to Adams’s penchant for the bathtub. Their quest to build a definitive profile of water’s role in filmmaking takes them in surprising directions, including to the Hollywood Walk of Fame; Waco, Texas; and the wellness-industrial complex of the new millennium. Why Is Amy in the Bath? is an inspired example of how podcasts can mine unexpected depth from even the most random premise.

Start with: “Episode 1: Why IS Amy in the Bath?”

A joint Canadian Australian production, Forged examines how two foundational Indigenous painters—Norval Morrisseau, known as “the Picasso of the North,” and Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri—became targets for large-scale, coordinated art-fraud operations. Morrisseau’s work, in particular, was the focus of what is believed to be the largest forgery ring of all time, in which several thousand fakes were illegitimately authenticated and sold around the world. But the host, Adrian Stimson, an artist from the Siksika Nation, carefully avoids true-crime sensationalism. Instead, he uses the fraud investigation as an entry point for a thoughtful rumination on First Peoples’ experiences in Canada and Australia and demonstrates how these thefts touch upon a greater legacy of colonialism and exploitation.

The NPR series Embedded often produces riveting work, but this installment is especially notable. The miniseries, from the producer Zach Mack, focuses on his relationship with his father, a man so invested in conspiracy theories that he bets his son $10,000 that 10 of his most outlandish predictions will come true by the end of one calendar year. The father’s claims may leave listeners with little doubt as to who will win the money. But Mack’s real goal is to hash out their differences, insurmountable as they may seem. What follows is a consequential time in one family’s life, documented in a shockingly vulnerable fashion.

Start with: “Alternate Realities: A Strange Bet”

The story of a radical separatist group in West Texas in the ’90s that led to an armed-hostage standoff doesn’t seem like it would lend itself well to humor. But for her show, the host and producer Zoe Kurland took apparent inspiration from the idiosyncratic residents of the Davis Mountains Resort—also known as ground zero for the Republic of Texas movement, which formed under the belief that the United States had illegally annexed Texas in 1845. Kurland uses colorful firsthand accounts to detail the failed effort to establish Texas as an independent nation. Her familiarity with the area (the show is produced by the local Marfa Public Radio) helps her portray her subjects with empathy; she also smartly contextualizes the events within broader Texas mythology.

The name says it all: This delightful show recounts stories from the pre-civil-rights era in the vein of social pages and gossip columns. The producer, Nichole Hill, zeroes in on influential Black figures of that period as if they were modern-day celebrities, offering up juicy anecdotes from their dramatic personal lives drawn from contemporaneous newspaper accounts. Hill revels in the many romantic and social scandals of her subjects—including the author Zora Neale Hurston, the film pioneer Oscar Micheaux, and considerably more obscure characters—instead of just their careers, making for a livelier listen than your typical history podcast.

Start with: “Drs. Anna and Percy Julian: The Affair That Helped Birth the Pill”

A fresh take on two well-tapped genres, Debt Heads is a personal-finance journey in the guise of a narrative-investigative podcast. The series examines the credit-card industry’s hold on American life—a hefty topic that the hilarious co-hosts, the writers Jamie Feldman and Rachel Webster, turn on its head. Endeavoring to reduce shame about debt, the duo is boldly transparent: They discuss, for instance, Feldman’s own attempts to dig herself out from thousands of dollars of debt. They never wallow in the mire of their anxiety-inducing subject, maintaining a fast pace and a refreshing sense of humor.

Start with: “The Secret Life of Debt Heads”

This seemingly low-key music-appreciation show doubles as a debate program: The co-hosts—Craig Finn, the front man for the band the Hold Steady, and the podcasting veteran Jody Avirgan—seek to prove whether an album qualifies as “summer” or “winter.” In each episode, they argue their position on the correct vibe of a classic album, including Paul Simon’s Graceland and Pavement’s Slanted and Enchanted, to a guest. The pair’s guidelines for what makes a record fit each season are hazy (and often based on personal associations), but their passion and musical know-how help the conversation transcend what may seem like an argument about an arbitrary classification.

Start with: “Belle and Sebastian’s ‘If You’re Feeling Sinister’ With Jon Ronson”

Spotify canceled this long-running, celebrated series in 2023—a surprising move that felt, to many listeners, like an ill omen for narrative podcasting. Its revival might prompt a sigh of relief. This new season mostly sticks to the original premise—the host, Jonathan Goldstein, solves his guests’ unresolved gripes—but many of the episodes are themselves clear beneficiaries of the show’s hiatus. Certain installments cover a more ambitious time span, which the host attributes to the gap between seasons. Whether Goldstein is tracking down the victims of a bank robbery from more than 30 years ago or figuring out why a homecoming queen lost her title at the last minute, Heavyweight is both pleasantly familiar and invigorating; the two-year period away has only reaffirmed it as a standout listen.

The sociologist Ruth Braunstein examines the rise of Christian-nationalist ideology in American evangelicalism with striking intimacy. Her reporting takes her to Phoenix, where she captures the diametrically opposed approaches of two churches. The series finds an instructive case in one particular pastor, whose trajectory as a neo-Nazi skinhead turned vehement anti-racist makes for a compelling tale. In telling his story, Braunstein unpacks the ways individuals redefine themselves to fit their changing ideologies. The host’s aim isn’t polemical; instead, she makes the case that American democracy relies on disparate coalitions finding common ground.

A production five years in the making, this travelogue follows Rachel Varnam on an expedition with the British Antarctic Survey during the height of the coronavirus pandemic. She recounts her monthslong journey on the high seas with a mix of interesting scientific detail, warm humor, and genuine wonder at the southernmost continent’s forbidding majesty. Listeners receive a crash course in the surprising complexities of polar medicine—Varnam serves as the crew’s doctor, nurse, and dentist all at once—as well as a taste of life aboard a sailing vessel bound for such remote territory. The show is the rare podcast set during 2020 that doesn’t inspire dread.

Turner Classic Movies’s The Plot Thickens is a love letter to both old Hollywood and narrative audio. The show tracks the making of Elizabeth Taylor’s Cleopatra in 1963, one of the most expensive and difficult movie productions in cinematic history. The journalist and host Ben Mankiewicz grew up in the shadow of the picture—his great-uncle Joseph L. Mankiewicz directed it. His closeness to the story means that he has access to diary entries, recordings, and firsthand insights from family members that provide an emotional anchor to the account. Mankiewicz’s narration is husky and inviting, and his extensive use of archival tape creates a luxurious atmosphere—as if the tale is unspooling over martinis in the back room at the celebrated Hollywood hot spot Musso & Frank Grill.

Morris has been one of podcasting’s most playful and erudite voices for more than a decade, and he has a talent for finding nuance across a broad spectrum of pop culture. Cannonball, his latest program for The New York Times, puts his critical expertise and omnivorous taste to good use as he analyzes the zeitgeist through a personal lens. A conversation about cover songs conjures memories of his hometown radio station; his doubts about Lady Gaga’s new album are upended after seeing her perform live. In a cultural environment that can often seem overwhelming, Morris is a deft, open-minded guide through the noise.

More than a century after its sinking, is there really more to be said about the Titanic? Yes—and this immersive, exhaustive program from the Noiser Podcast Network aims to be as close to a definitive account of the ship as possible. Ship of Dreams details both the catastrophe and its legacy, beginning at a Belfast dry dock and ending with the OceanGate Titan submersible disaster, which happened en route to the Titanic’s seafloor resting place. Assuredly narrated by the actor Paul McGann, the series includes interviews with survivors, relatives of passengers, authors, and academics. (Also in the mix, somewhat unexpectedly, is the Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes, who adapted the Titanic story for TV.) The show’s thorough storytelling benefits from excellent scoring and sound design; this chronicle manages to be a gripping affair even if listeners already know how it ends.

            <h2>The Pro-Democracy Case for a National Theater</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2025/12/pro-democracy-case-national-theater/685338/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Earlier this year, as President Donald Trump engaged in a spree of cuts to federal arts funding, alongside partisan assaults on national cultural institutions such as the Kennedy Center, I found myself thinking about the Depression-era origins of government-funded art in the United States. During a time of economic and social strife, Washington responded by investing in the arts—even if it resulted in work that made some Americans uncomfortable.

The Federal Theatre Project, an arm of the Depression-era Works Progress Administration, may have been the closest thing the country ever had to a true national theater. From 1935 to 1939, it engaged out-of-work actors, writers, directors, and stagehands across the country to produce plays, many of them free, that toured the U.S. and were enjoyed by some 30 million citizens, a majority of whom had never seen a live play before. Yet the most American thing about the FTP might not have been its populist spirit, but rather its tumultuous demise.

The project’s more progressive features turned it into a hot-button issue in the Capitol. Some productions involved racially integrated casting; others advanced radical visions of the country’s future, such as the possibility of a female president. Still others warned of the rapidity with which democracy could give way to dictatorship. In a dark American era plagued by Jim Crow and rampant poverty, the plays of the FTP tended to engage frankly with some of the grimmer American truths.

Naturally, the House Un-American Activities Committee—which was formed to find and punish Communist influence everywhere—suspected plenty of it here. And one congressman, Representative Martin Dies of Texas, saw the FTP as a useful scapegoat in a crusade against any culture that was critical of America’s absolute goodness. Such a campaign was an opportunity for a particularly cynical type of politician to gain power and influence. Never mind that Dies’s target consumed less than 1 percent of the WPA budget—the press couldn’t look away. An overwhelming majority of the House voted to end the program, and its funding was canceled. Goodbye to the last great effort to give Americans in many regions significant access to excellent, original American theater.

Trump’s broad cancellation of grants from the National Endowment for the Arts amounts to pennies when compared with the budget of the FTP, which cost about $46 million—about $1 billion in today’s dollars—over four years. But for some theaters, the cuts were a devastating blow. The communities likely to be most affected are those where theater is scarcest: the small cities and towns where federal subsidies have helped keep a beloved but often unprofitable art form alive.

These cuts make now a useful moment to ask why taxpayer funds should be used to subsidize theater at all. Is there any good reason it should be considered a real public good, rather than the luxury it is for theatergoers able and willing to pay ever-escalating ticket prices? One possible answer lies in an endeavor that inspired the FTP, and that survives to this day—in Ireland.

In 1911, a U.S. tour by Dublin’s Abbey Theatre unwittingly helped lay the groundwork for the FTP. A young American theater lover named Hallie Flanagan met Augusta, Lady Gregory, one of the Abbey’s founders, during the tour, and was touched by her call for the creation of an American national theater. Years later, Flanagan would become the National Theatre Project’s director.

At the time of the tour, the Irish troupe was privately funded; there had never been a national theater in the English-speaking world. But in 1925, when the Abbey was close to ruin, it made a daring request for government support from the fledgling Irish Free State. With the state just three years into independence from the United Kingdom, its leaders were busy with more fundamental questions, such as settling the Irish Free State’s borders.

But the Abbey’s founders, including Lady Gregory and the Nobel Prize-winning poet and playwright W. B. Yeats, “had a concept from the start that theater could provide a way of thinking about what it meant to be a nation,” Christopher Morash, a scholar of Irish theater, told me. After a bloody civil war, that idea was persuasive to leaders seeking to give their young state a sense of direction and identity. The Abbey was allocated 850 pounds a year.

In the Abbey’s century-long history as a public institution lies a persuasive story about what a national theater could have done—or still might do—for the United States. Through the decades, the Abbey’s output has regularly showed how effectively theater can process national trauma at times when the public desperately needs an outlet. There is no replacement for the emotional immediacy of live performance; it is easier to empathize with a living character, whom you could theoretically go up to and touch, than with an idol on the screen.

From its first days as a national theater, the Abbey was determined to elicit this kind of empathy in ways that would bring the public not just catharsis, but also understanding. In 1926, with government money newly in its coffers, it made a statement about exactly what kind of institution it intended to be by producing Seán O’Casey’s The Plough and the Stars.

A decade earlier, the Easter Rising had kicked off violent efforts to establish an Irish republic free of British rule. Heretically, The Plough and the Stars depicted the Rising’s fighters—broadly enshrined in the national memory as heroes—hanging about a pub, “flirting with prostitutes and more interested in where they’re going to get their next drink” than in the conflict at hand, Morash said. Imagine, he added, if “somebody had written a play about 9/11 in 2011 that had firemen in a bar, working with prostitutes. What kind of reaction would you get?”

Instead of putting on “the idealised patriotic play that a section of the audience obviously wished for,” as Abbey’s former director Christopher Fitz-Simon told me in an email, the theater chose to provoke a weary populace with irony and irreverence. Is that what a national theater is supposed to do?

In the U.S. today, the government’s answer is clearly no. When Trump overhauled the board of the Kennedy Center—a perpetual contender for the role of unofficial national theater—he declared that the theater would host no more “ANTI-AMERICAN PROPAGANDA.” (More recently, his handpicked board renamed it the Trump-Kennedy Center, changing its facade without the required congressional approval.) In 1926 Ireland, however, the answer was yes. There were riots, and a government representative on the theater’s board argued for censoring the play. But audiences couldn’t get enough. They understood, I think, that The Plough and the Stars wasn’t anti-Ireland. Instead, it was honest about the human complexity of the new nation and the bloody era that heralded its birth.

They may have understood, too, that such honesty could be crucial to the survival of their nascent state. “If you don’t have an image of your culture that is capable of evolving and changing,” Morash said, “then you end up with images of yourself that are fossilized, that are monumentalized, that are exclusionary.”

Hallie Flanagan’s vision for a successful American national theater looked much like the Abbey’s model. Audiences needed not an unrealistically rosy reflection of their national identity, she saw, but rather an opportunity to engage with their complicated feelings about it. The project’s first great success was a play called Altars of Steel, about the southern steel industry. As Flanagan wrote in her book about the FTP, Arena, audiences in Atlanta “praised the play. They blamed the play. They fought over the play. They wrote to the papers: ‘Dangerous propaganda!’”

Only by creating reactions that are both large and diverse can a national theater be considered important. Countries are created in violence; artistic efforts to give them a sense of shared identity must involve a kind of violence, too. In the friction, we begin to see who we are.

This understanding has been crucial to the development of national theaters throughout history. The very first were founded under royal auspices. But the idea of a national theater truly took off as a result of the nationalism that flourished in Romantic-era Europe, Marvin Carlson, a scholar of theater history, told me. As “people began being interested in a national language and a national literature,” he said, they “began to open national theaters, and they were very much connected with the modern idea of the nation”—one in which the people, not the rulers, determined the country’s character.

The question of who has the right to define a country’s character is central to the cultural battles unfolding in the United States under Trump. When it comes to the theater, the president has strong tastes. He loves Les Misérables and the works of Andrew Lloyd Webber—neither, ironically, American products. He staged a takeover of the Kennedy Center early in his second term not because its programming has so much influence over the average American, but because of its elevated status: If it is at the center of Capitol culture, it is at the center of American culture, and therefore, in his estimation, it ought to be directed by the highest power in the land.

The FTP died during a similarly restrictive political moment. It had helped people far outside the centers of power gain a sense of ownership over their national culture. Evidently, that made certain figures within those centers uncomfortable. With the project’s end, Americans “lost a place where people met across ideological and class and racial divides,” James Shapiro, the author of The Playbook, a history of the FTP’s rise and fall, told me. Now, he added, we “live instead in a siloed world, one defined by division rather than conversation, with democracy itself weakened.”

In Ireland, history unfolded differently. The Plough and the Stars was, in the end, never censored by the government. None of the Abbey’s productions has been (although the theater has sometimes self-censored)—a remarkable truth in a country where nearly every other art form has found itself at some point subjected to the government’s red pen.

The theater has produced several generations of playwrights, including Brian Friel and Conor McPherson, who have helped the Irish public understand the changing nation. That doesn’t mean the work of the Abbey has always been great, but a national theater is not necessarily supposed to produce the best plays in its country. It is intended, instead, to set a precedent of original work, investigating that country’s soul, with the hope that as this mission spreads, people will come to see the cultural tropes that define their lives as active, living concepts, about which they have the right to think—and feel—independently.

“It’s like a great tree that is constantly dropping little acorns on the ground,” Morash said. “Even when the Abbey wasn’t doing great work at any one time, there were something like 600 to 700 small amateur theater companies around the country, just community groups playing in halls, and they’re looking to the Abbey for their model. You lose that,” he said, and “you lose the ability for a society to tell itself its own stories.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After Katie started on Ozempic, she got her hairdresser interested, too. This summer, when they saw each other again, she thought that her hairdresser had lost some weight and that she looked “so great.”

“Are you still on a GLP-1?” she asked, referring to the class of blockbuster drugs that includes Ozempic and obesity meds.

“Actually,” her hairdresser replied, “I’m on a GLP-3.”

Okay, so, technically, there is no such thing as a GLP-3 drug. But “GLP-3” is a name used on the underground market for retatrutide, an obesity drug still being studied by the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly. As the nickname implies, retatrutide is like a GLP-1 drug—but more, more, more. It’s more effective, has more modes of action, and induces more weight loss. It may in fact be the most powerful weight-loss drug ever created.

When early retatrutide data were presented at a medical conference in 2023, a scientist who was there told me, the usually staid audience burst into spontaneous applause. Two weeks ago, the first of the highly anticipated Phase 3 clinical-trial results corroborated the jaw-dropping initial numbers: Patients lost on average 71 pounds, or 29 percent of their body weight—double what people lose on semaglutide, which is better known as Ozempic or Wegovy. Some trial participants stopped retatrutide early because they had lost too much weight; they stopped, in other words, because the drug was too effective. As of now, retatrutide is still not approved, though. The FDA has yet to subject its safety and efficacy data to close scrutiny. You cannot get retatrutide from your doctor. You cannot buy it at a pharmacy.

“I’m a very by-the-book, ‘The doctor gives it to you; you take it’ kind of person,” Katie told me. (The Atlantic agreed to identify some sources by their first names only for reasons of medical privacy.) When her hairdresser first mentioned retatrutide in the summer, the Phase 3 results weren’t even out. “But she was just like, ‘It was incredible,’” Katie said. When she looked up retatrutide online, she came across people posting “insane” before-and-after photos.

Katie, who is 44, had been prescribed Ozempic by her doctor two years ago, but she was ready for something new: Her co-pay had just shot up from $20 to $700 a month. She was nauseated all the time, but she wasn’t losing any more weight after stalling at 30 pounds. So with her hairdresser’s help, Katie began ordering freeze-dried retatrutide online, mixing the white powder with sterile water, calculating dosages, and injecting herself with needles. She paid only a fraction of what Ozempic had cost her. Six months later, she’s lost another 20 pounds.

The catch, of course, is that her drugs do not come from Eli Lilly, nor do any of the drugs on the entirely unregulated underground market. No one is saying exactly where they do come from, but it’s commonly assumed that unnamed suppliers are copying Eli Lilly’s drug in China.

Over the past year, the underground market has only grown, in both size and visibility. What began with early adopters—many of them bodybuilders and biohackers—using crypto to buy the drug through Chinese contacts on Telegram has morphed into a network of slick websites where U.S. resellers take PayPal or credit cards. On social media, influencers openly hawk affiliate discount codes for “GLP-3” and “reta.” And retatrutide is spreading through old-fashioned word of mouth—like with Katie and her hairdresser—because its effects are just so visible.

The true scope of the underground market is by design difficult to know, but dozens of brands have popped up. Forums and group chats devoted to retatrutide have up to tens of thousands of members. In certain circles, retatrutide is almost normalized. Tyler Simmons, 36, who lives in Northern California and is a bit health obsessed, told me he personally knows 30 to 40 people on retatrutide.

Experts who study counterfeit and copycat pharmaceuticals tell me they cannot think of another drug that gained this level of popularity so fast, before its clinical trials even concluded. The people injecting underground retatrutide have entered—willingly, it seems—into an immense biological and social experiment.

This May, to understand the process, I purchased retatrutide from several online vendors I found easily through social media. (I did not intend to use any of the drugs, The Atlantic’s lawyers would want me to note for the record.) The process was disarmingly casual for something people were injecting into their bodies. It felt, in some cases, just like ordering socks. One vendor sent a Shop-app link to track my package.

There were some obvious signs that these are not entirely aboveboard operations, though. For one, the websites were plastered with disclaimers that their products were for “research use only.” These disclaimers satisfy a legal loophole that allows drug compounds to be sold for lab research but not for human use. Hence, sellers and buyers of retatrutide often refer to this as a “gray market.”

But in fact, people are plainly buying it to inject themselves. Though I sometimes saw commenters online use the fig leaf of saying “my lab rat” (which were losing comically large amounts of weight for rodents), most were discussing personal use quite openly. And vendors are not always coy about the true purpose. After the Substacker known as Crémieux wrote a popular guide to buying cheap weight-loss drugs—touting retatrutide as his top pick—one vendor, Peptide Partners, sent a discount code to share with readers: “ScrewTariffs” for 15 percent off.

A package I bought from another company, called Nexaph, originated in Indiana, according to the tracking info, but the return address on its label was in Wyoming. That address leads to a strip-mall office registered to an improbable 20,000 businesses. The cheapest retatrutide tends to come directly from China, though, sold via nebulous entities without websites. I bought one batch from a sales rep on Telegram for Jinan Elitepeptide Chemical Co. A week and a half later, I received a box for a face massager, sealed with a sticker that read, in Chinese, “Original packaging. Authentic product.” Inside were the 10 small unlabeled vials of white powder that I had ordered. (No massager, though.) None of the vendors responded to my subsequent request for comment, except R3JUVEN8, which sent me a statement reiterating that its products, including the retatrutide branded as “Radiant Sculpt” on its site, are “exclusively for laboratory research use.”

The vials I purchased came with no further information about who manufactured the powder or where. But China is home to a large, legitimate drug-manufacturing base, meaning it has the expertise to produce retatrutide. And even before retatrutide caught on, vendors linked to China were selling other peptides—a category of compounds that includes the obesity drugs semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro/Zepbound), as well as substances, such as BPC-157, that are popular in fitness and wellness circles. Making another peptide would not be a huge leap; retatrutide as a molecule is not especially difficult for a knowledgeable chemist to copy.

The drug’s molecular structure has been public for years, since Eli Lilly published it in a research paper in 2022. It is essentially a chain of 39 amino-acid building blocks, its shape cleverly designed to fit into the receptors of three different hormones all at once: GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon. (This triple action is the 3 in GLP-3.) The existing obesity drugs on the market hit GLP-1 receptors or GLP-1 plus GIP receptors. Only retatrutide adds glucagon for the full trifecta.

Where earlier obesity drugs work primarily through appetite suppression, glucagon seems to also boost metabolism by revving up the liver. Put them together and the triple combo might achieve the best of all worlds: “You get a reduction in food intake, and you can turn the dial up and get a little better energy expenditure,” Jonathan Campbell, an obesity researcher at Duke, told me. In other words, fewer calories in and more calories out.

Scientists knew that retatrutide held promise, but when those astonishing preliminary results were shared in 2023, excitement spilled out from labs into the public. A new and more powerful obesity drug was coming, and some people, it turns out, could not wait.

“I’m a risk-taker,” Elizabeth, 62, told me. When she started buying reta in 2024, she had already tried semaglutide and tirzepatide, but she was eager to get her hands on the most effective drug. Back then, the underground market operated much less openly. She had to find a Chinese sales rep on WhatsApp, then transfer hundreds of dollars for several months of supply.

As a biologist herself, Elizabeth was comfortable working with needles and reading scientific papers. She modeled her dosing regimen on the clinical-trial protocol. When her heart began racing, she accepted it as a documented side effect of retatrutide. She has lost more than 100 pounds in the past two and a half years—first on the two older drugs and the last 50 or so pounds on retatrutide. After a lifelong struggle with obesity, she told me in May, these are “some of the most amazing events of my whole life.”

For that, she was willing to risk not just her money, but the potential downsides—both known and unknown—of taking retatrutide, a novel yet clearly powerful drug. The full Phase 3 clinical-trial results should provide a clearer picture soon, but one noteworthy finding so far is dysesthesia, or odd sensations in the skin, such as burning and pain, that suggest unrest in the nervous system. One in five patients on the highest dose of retatrutide experienced dysesthesia, roughly triple its occurrence among patients taking semaglutide’s current maximum dose.

Retatrutide causes many of the other side effects of drugs in its class, too: nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and more serious ones. Adrian Crook, a fitness influencer on YouTube, made a video about how retatrutide almost landed him in the hospital when his stomach became paralyzed. And Elizabeth says she has lost quite a bit of muscle on the drug. “I’m as weak as a kitten,” she told me.

Then there are the risks of injecting drugs sold for “research use only” on the underground market. These include, but are not limited to, the fact that the vials might contain: a different weight-loss drug or an entirely unknown substance, either benign or harmful; dangerous bacteria or traces of bacteria called endotoxins; the wrong dose, whether too low (and therefore ineffective) or too high (which could cause side effects of alarming intensity, because retatrutide is supposed to be slowly titrated up over as many as 20 weeks as your body acclimates to the drug); or other contaminants, such as solvents used in manufacturing or heavy metals.

“All of this stuff just scares the crap out of me,” Randy Seeley concluded after enumerating the potential dangers to me. Seeley, who studies obesity at the University of Michigan, uses peptides for research in his lab, and even the stuff sourced to legitimate scientific-supply companies doesn’t always work as expected, he said. Compounds manufactured for the petri dish are not held to the same strict standards as those made for human use.

It’s not quite fair to say the underground market comes with zero accountability, though. Certain corners, at least, have developed a robust culture of lab testing. A handful of labs—the Levi Strausses of the peptide gold rush—now specialize in testing these compounds. Many vendors post “certificates of analysis” attesting to their purity and sterility. Buyers can send vials to laboratories themselves, either as part of an organized group test or on their own. Some vendors will even refund batches that fail. Without testing, Marco, 53, told me, he would never have injected retatrutide from the internet. (Marco is his middle name.) The tests may not cover every hypothetical risk, but they make it safe enough to assure him. “There’s a lot of people who just get these things and shoot them,” he said. “I don’t judge them in any way, but I think those people are out of their minds.”

The tests, insofar as they are reliable, do flag problems. According to Finnrick Analytics, a start-up that provides free peptide tests and publicly shares the results, 10 percent of the retatrutide samples it has tested in the past 60 days had issues of sterility, purity, or incorrect dosing. Two other peptide-testing labs, Trustpointe and Janoshik, have said in interviews with Rory Hester, a.k.a. PepTok on YouTube, that they see, respectively, an overall fail rate of 20 percent and a 3 to 5 percent fail rate for sterility alone across all peptides. These are not based on random samples—labs test only what their customers send. On the whole, though, these numbers suggest that, although most of the retatrutide flowing through the underground market is what vendors promise it is, the drugs also fail testing at rates far, far higher than is acceptable in standard drug manufacturing.

As retatrutide has grown in popularity, the people seeking it out are no longer just self-professed risk-takers. “The future of the market is normies,” Hester, who also writes the peptide-focused Substack Gray Market, told me. The world of Telegram, Discord, and WhatsApp—what Hester calls the “dark gray” peptide market—is by design somewhat inaccessible. “Your grandmother is not going to go on Telegram,” he said. The customer-friendly U.S.-based sites that he calls “light gray” can appeal to a much larger audience. Hester is putting his money where his mouth is. Earlier this month, he announced that he co-owns the peptide company Crush Research.

But the size of the gray market may be fundamentally at odds with its viability. The bigger it gets, the more people are injecting themselves thanks to a legal loophole, and the harder it may be for authorities to ignore. (The FDA did not respond to a request for comment. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has previously promised to reverse the FDA’s “aggressive suppression” of peptides—along with psychedelics, raw milk, sunshine, and other treatments that “can’t be patented”—though it’s unclear how that applies to retatrutide specifically, which is in fact patented.) And not everyone in the gray market welcomes the attention or the scrutiny that follows. As Finnrick has been posting test results by vendor, its COO, Raphaël Mazoyer, told me, online commentators have accused the company of being an agent of the FDA and the Chinese government. (He denied both.)

A week ago, rumors started swirling, as they periodically do, of a coming U.S. crackdown. Some buyers online dismissed them as an attempt to juice panic buying. Several websites did stop selling retatrutide, though.

The “dark gray” market is not as easily within the grasp of U.S. authorities, but it’s been a turbulent few months there, too. In September, two of the most popular retatrutide suppliers from China abruptly disappeared. Their sales reps stopped replying to messages, stranding buyers who had already paid hundreds of dollars. Rumors later spread of arrests in China. Then, in November, a third vendor’s retatrutide allegedly landed two people in the hospital, according to warnings that spread on social media. The company blamed a raid for interfering with the quality of its drugs. Someone started impersonating its sales rep by using a sneakily similar username. Later, when no further details came out, online commentators started wondering if the hospitalizations were just a hoax. It’s hard to know what is real and what is fake, but that is the nature of an underground market. New vendors keep popping up, like a game of whack-a-mole.

Meanwhile, the frenzy over retatrutide has kicked into even higher gear since the Phase 3 results were announced this month. When the FDA approves the drug, which is widely expected, it will arrive as possibly the most hotly anticipated drug ever. The retatrutide buyers I interviewed said they welcome the legitimate stuff—though they expect it to be incredibly expensive. Marco, whose insurance actually covers obesity drugs, told me he will happily keep buying on the underground market for friends who otherwise can’t afford retatrutide. In any case, he’s stocked up. “I have a year’s supply of reta in my freezer,” he said.

GLP-1 drugs are, in general, meant to be taken indefinitely, but recently, Elizabeth told me she was going to quit retatrutide, at least temporarily. She had reached her goal weight—what she weighed in high school 45 years ago. “Incredible but I feel lousy,” she wrote. She was experiencing both extreme fatigue, which she couldn’t directly attribute to retatrutide, and anhedonia, or an inability to feel pleasure, which is anecdotally linked to GLP-1 drugs in some people. “Would you trade happiness for thinness? Does it have to be one or the other?” she wrote. “At this point, I’m beginning to wonder.” The psychological effect of these drugs really needs to be studied, she added. At this point, a year and a half in, she has been taking retatrutide longer than patients in the concluded clinical trials. She’s hoping to try a lower dose, perhaps one at which she can maintain her weight without feeling so lousy.

Elizabeth has never told her doctor about taking an unapproved drug or buying from the underground market. This whole time with retatrutide, she’s been figuring it out on her own.</div>

... running at 180hz?!?? Aside perhaps from some high performance VR setup that probably costs 50k of it even is available for regular people.

4k at 60hz is luxurious. At a regular living room distance humans can&#39;t even make out single pixels with 4k.

Honestly, at this point I&#39;d be waaaay more interested in edging up color bandwidth and brightness contrast than increasing resolution by yet another iteration. There is still room there and while my cheap ass 27&quot; 1080p business display is perfectly fine for me I do like the experience colors and contrast on my Samsung tablet with AMOLED display. They should work on making that larger and cheaper.

Which Italian mafia member will be getting all that money?

Middlemen used to serve a real purpose.  When Travel Agents started they compiled information from all the airlines.  But we have the internet now, which does the same. When Car dealerships started they ensure you had a qualified place to service your vehicle. But there are so many car repair places now and most are well qualified.   Phone stores sell real services, not just phones and general tech stores generally do not offer those services - even today.

But times have changed.  Think about the kind of thi

I think while way way less relevant today that the human travel agent has at least justified itself more than the 3rd party travel booking sites.  Back when your places like Travelocity and Priceline were coming along it was the fact that the pricing was better, you could score a cheap deal you couldn&#39;t get elsewhere and the fact most airlines and hotels didn&#39;t have robust online systems.

Now the companies themselves are well aware of, in partner with or sometimes outright own those 3rd party sites so the pr

These tech companies bent over backwards to appease that clown in the half-a-white-house, and he responds by making it more difficult for the very employees that help them operate their company to come back to the US.

That fee matters a great deal if you&#39;re trying to get health care workers like nurses that we are in short supply of.

Why the hell would you pay $100k to the government to get an employee you are going to pay $70k a year?  You won&#39;t.  And everyone&#39;s health care will suffer for it.

Also, if you&#39;re a doctor who is looking for work abroad and you have a choice between having to deal with the US government bullshit and this fee, or Canada with no bullshit or fee; which are you going to choose?

They don&#39;t care as long as the stock price goes up.

You do realize that the number of H-1B visas granted each year is capped, right? And that there are significant procedural hoops to jump through, and (now) very high fees.

I&#39;m all for a discussion about the balance of immigrant workers vs. US-based workers. People of goodwill can disagree on what that balance is. But you can&#39;t claim companies are &quot;abusing&quot; a program that is so strictly controlled by the government.

I am a former H1B holder that is now a citizen, however, I know other former H1B holders who have gone home, some of whom had citizenship or green cards.

I also know Indian H1B holders who are considering a move home now, since they are unlikely to ever get a green card. Note that, if an Indian citizen moves home without getting citizenship, they won&#39;t be able to claim any Social Security payments when they hit retirement age.

H-1B is known as a &quot;dual-intent&quot; visa. People who obtain them may or may not stay and change status when their visa runs out. The usual transition is to permanent residency (green card) but it is not guaranteed. If you don&#39;t change status, you have to leave.

Do you have any reference for your understanding? Because I can&#39;t find anything of the sort, and I know several H-1Bs working for us definitely haven&#39;t returned home, and we do have some high priced immigration attorneys on staff (as would Google or Apple), so I suspect they would know if this is a requirement.

My counterargument would be that the users have already granted the first consent to Apple during the setup process, so the same number of consent prompts occur for both 1st and 3rd party applications.

It sounds fine to me; they should get no special treatment when they setup themselves as the gatekeeper store.  The change should be either be like everybody else or allow permissions to be company based instead of app based.

This punishment is like a speeding ticket to Apple.  Furthermore, if you give them an inch and at the discretion of a judge or simply their own judgement, it&#39;s just asking for abuse at some point.  They are 1 bad CEO away from self destruction, being a US company (which has idiotic corp

We should make Apples&#39; own apps follow these rules, not loosen them for the other guys!

Look, I&#39;d understand if this was something Apple was exempting their own apps from but they are following the same rules, only they don&#39;t do cross-app tracking so users never see the pop-ups form Apple apps.

The regulator here is arguing that by abstaining from cross-app tracking they are giving themselves an unfair advantage.

Other developers have the option of not doing that kind of tracking which would result in not having the pop-ups.

Strongly agree. I also wonder if this ruling is motivated by creating a government backdoor as well.

... one extra tap (for third party apps) is needed to consent to T&C that were already consented to when using the Apple platform.

That some people don&#39;t realize this is probaby due to their seeing T&C pop-ups as nothing more than a window full of gibberish with an &quot;Accept&quot; button on the bottom.

How many Democrats have already voted for totalitarian laws against homelessness (remember Gavin Newsom&#39;s encampment sweeps?) and van lifers already? On the freedom to sleep outside, are Republicans and Democrats united in their karen-ness? Why should I vote Democratic when they&#39;ve already embraced totalitarian tactics against my preferred lifestyle?

Because you shouldn&#39;t be voting on one issue, regardless of how much it affects your objectively dumb lifestyle.

Why won&#39;t Democrats abandon immigrants and Epstein victims too in the future just as they&#39;ve thrown me under the bus?

That&#39;s not Democrats!  PEOPLE they represent vote them in and for the most part they still believe in democracy, unlike the Republicans.

Why should the opposition party lazily ban me when I try to petition them for redress of grievances?

It would be a waste of time because the cult won&#39;t break from dear leader.

You clearly don&#39;t understand the idea of process and procedure.   The Speaker of the House can block ANYTHING from being brought to the floor, even if 95% of the members of Congress may want something, Johnson can stop it.   It would then require going through a process to get through that block.

So you&#39;re saying the speaker has absolute power and can control what gets voted on, unless Congress members go through &quot;a process&quot;? That takes a big chunk out of the definition of &quot;absolute power&quot;...

The 95% thing isn&#39;t quite true because if that majority of members did support it they could file a discharge petition to get the vote, it&#39;s usually presumed the Speaker has the support of their majority.  It&#39;s a nice tactic because it let&#39;s the members speak from both sides of their mouths, they can toss the blame onto the Speaker.

Pretty sure this is called the Hastert Rule [wikipedia.org] (crazy they still call it this) and it&#39;s not an actual rule, it&#39;s just a norm there is no binding mechanism.

The Dems can vote today also.  Why don&#39;t they?How? No seriously have a think about who controls the house, the senate, the agenda and how anything is brought to the floor, and maybe go check that cartoon video with the animated talking bill before you say something else stupid.

I want a 20,000 percent tariff to be imposed on anything relating to golf, since that is the only thing the overgrown oompa loompa seems to care about.

Uh, I&#39;m not sure that would actually have any real impact. Maybe little wooden golf tees would get more expensive, and possibly golf balks - but the best clubs are likely made domestically, and you know, we don&#39;t import golf courses...

It&#39;s to manipulate the midterm elections. Tariffs aren&#39;t as popular as they hoped.

Trump suffers from dementia, so he doesn&#39;t even know what he decided on an hour or two earlier.   Trump is also easily manipulated, so, just give him lavish praise, and he will do whatever you want.

Having been in office less than 12 months, by definition anything implemented thus far by the current administration was done without 18 months notice.

I&#39;m curious, from where did you pull this requirement/expectation? 18 months notice is a very, very long time...

In something of a Christmas miracle, the MAGA coalition may finally be starting to break down.

The Heritage Foundation, which published the Project 2025 blueprint for this Trump term, just saw more than a dozen staff members defect for former Vice President Mike Pence’s Advancing American Freedom think tank; turncoats include the former leaders of Heritage’s data, economics, and legal teams. Among prominent MAGA leaders—mostly elected officials, people who want to be elected officials, and podcasters—there is a growing divide over what one might assume should be an easily answered question: Should they welcome Nazis, avowed white supremacists, and unrepentant racists hurling slurs into the movement?

This is apparently quite the conundrum. It’s also telling that the cleavage is coming now. After all, the movement Donald Trump built has long welcomed bigots and racists; Trump himself dined with white supremacist Nick Fuentes and enthusiastic antisemite Kanye West at Mar-a-Lago, although he later claimed to not know who Fuentes was. The people who have gotten into bed with the president, whether they’re D.C. think tank staffers or Jan. 6 hooligans, realized who they were cozying up with.

That some are starting to object and defect suggests that two things are happening at once. The first is that MAGA bigotry has gotten significantly broader, expanding beyond the groups the broader right believes are acceptable to malign (women, Black people, immigrants, Muslims) and coming for groups of which prominent MAGA leaders are a part (Jews, Indians, anyone whose ancestors didn’t come over on the Mayflower). The second is that Trump himself is fading: He’s elderly and showing the typical signs of fatigue and cognitive decline. This is creating something of a vacuum in leadership. Vice President J.D. Vance is the clear MAGA heir apparent (or at least believes himself to be). But he won’t take the throne unchallenged. Some of these contenders want to sit in the Oval Office, and there can be only one butt in the chair behind the Resolute Desk. Others want a different kind of Republican Party: Some strive to turn away from Trumpian populism and toward a tax-cutting pro-business agenda; others aim for a return to the politics of conservative Christianity, with a refocus on restricting abortion and LGBTQ+ rights; a few really may object to MAGA’s blood-and-soil nationalist turn. But the coalition is currently fracturing for one reason: The leader is weak, and a successor is being chosen.

The growing objections to MAGA racism can feel pretty rich coming from people who seemed just fine with many kinds of racism up until now. But it’s also true that MAGA racism has, like the famous “First they came for” poem, proved itself insatiable. Vance has been among the leading voices for the idea that there is a category of “heritage Americans,” a very-online term for people whose family ancestry supposedly gives them more of a claim to legitimate Americanness than anyone else: naturalized citizens, children of immigrants, someone whose grandparents immigrated after World War II. If your ancestors came over anytime after 1789, you are not a “Grade A” American, as one chart puts it. “I think the people whose ancestors fought in the Civil War have a hell of a lot more claim over America than the people who say they don’t belong,” Vance has said—marking those who chose to become American as having a less legitimate right to Americanness than those who fought to break up the country.

This turn has alarmed many conservatives who, like most Americans, are not purely descended from Pilgrims. The elevation of unapologetically antisemitic rhetoric and the growing hatred of Jews among Gen Z conservatives seem to have also spooked some MAGA loyalists. A recent Manhattan Institute focus group of Gen Z conservatives found them praising Adolf Hitler as a “great leader” and understanding “where he was coming from as far as wanting to improve the national state of Germany.” One young man who also said that Jews are a “force for evil” explained: “I’m very pro–strong executive, –strong leader, –strongman. I support national sovereignty, and Hitler was a nationalist. He was like, ‘We have to take Germany back for Germans.’ And I feel like we should do that in America.” A leaked chat among Young Republican leaders showed them joking about the Holocaust, calling Black people monkeys, and saying, “I love Hitler.” Young voters generally hold more antisemitic views than older ones, and young conservatives are, on average, the most antisemitic of all. This may be because young people are getting much of their political news from outrage-amplifying social media, as well as from “influencers” with popular podcasts, TikTok accounts, and YouTube and Discord channels, and many right-wing influencers have seen that racism, sexism, and antisemitism drive traffic—which in turn drives fans to be even more bigoted and reactionary. Candace Owens recently went on an extended antisemitic tirade, and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson and Fuentes have also entertained antisemitic conspiracy theories or flat-out blamed the Jews for various problems. And the Trump administration is putting people with long records of antisemitism into top positions.

This seems to be an inflection point even for some notorious bigots and people who didn’t mind when the president called Somalis “garbage” and compared immigrants with insects. Laura Loomer is one of the country’s most notorious Muslim-haters (she has called Islam a “cancer” and argued that Muslims should not be allowed to hold political office) and acted as if getting banned from Twitter for hate speech was as bad as being sent to the gulags. But now she is suddenly in favor of gatekeeping, enforcing basic standards, and “moral clarity.” Former presidential contender and current candidate for governor of Ohio Vivek Ramaswamy, who during his 2024 campaign claimed that “our diversity is not our strength,” compared prominent Black progressives with the Ku Klux Klan and asserted that he had never seen or met “the boogeyman white supremacist” in America—“Maybe I’ll meet a unicorn sooner,” he added, “and maybe those exist too”—also seems to have changed his tune. “If you believe that Hitler was pretty fucking cool, you have no place in the future of the conservative movement,” Ramaswamy recently said. “If you call Usha Vance, the second lady of the United States of America, a ‘j—t,’ you have no place in the future of the conservative movement.”

J.D. Vance, whose Indian American wife Usha has been called racial slurs by right-wing racists, said that people who target her specifically can “eat shit” but that otherwise the GOP should be a big tent. “When I say that I’m going to fight alongside of you, I mean all of you—each and every one,” the vice president said at Turning Point USA’s recent AmericaFest. “President Trump did not build the greatest coalition in politics by running his supporters through endless, self-defeating purity tests.”

As the Nazis vs. Say-No-to-Nazis fissures broke open at the Turning Point event, conservatives on all sides of the debate laid claim to the legacy of their martyred leader Charlie Kirk. Some argued that he was a free-speech fanatic who would have welcomed everyone to TPUSA events even if they were wearing a T-shirt bearing a pro-Holocaust meme (“Let ’Em Cook”). Others agreed with Loomer’s take, that “people want to pretend like [Kirk’s] events were a free for all so they have an excuse to not call out the GOP’s Nazi problem.” Vance positioned himself on Team “Let ’Em Cook.” Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, seems to be with him: He caused major outcry after he defended Carlson having a very friendly interview with Holocaust denier Fuentes, in which Fuentes complained about the domination of “organized Jewry” and Carlson noted his belief that “Christian Zionists” have been “seized by this brain virus.”

The former Heritage staffers who have decamped for the new organization seem to be on Team Moral Clarity—or perhaps a team for which they don’t have to play ball with Nazis or the kinds of people who would attend a Turning Point USA convention. (That the organization they flocked to belongs to Pence—remember him? The guy the Jan. 6 rioters wanted to lynch on the White House lawn?—only adds to the sense that this cleavage runs deep.) In a not-so-long-ago iteration of the Republican Party, those who spoke and acted like Loomer, Owens, and even Kirk were the riffraff—part of the base, sure, but inconvenient and merely dog-whistled at to encourage loyalty. Now, though, they’re leading the pack, and not only when it comes to MAGA’s young pups.

It’s worth noting that in all of this, Trump is largely absent. Perhaps those closest to him see what average Americans do not: that his abilities, and with them his power, is waning. He turned the party into a cult of personality, in which the only ideology was to line up behind Donald Trump. The GOP rule “Whatever Trump wants, Trump gets” was so clear that the party stopped writing out policy platforms, instead issuing a one-page fealty pledge to its unquestioned leader. No one has the audacity to try to unseat him, or even to say that he won’t be in charge forever. MAGA stalwarts still wear their Trump 2028 hats, make Trump-as-Jesus fan art, share the triumphant photo of him raising his fist after surviving an assassin’s bullet, and believe that his 2024 win was a political resurrection divinely ordained to save America. Maybe Trumpism will never die. But clearly those around him can smell decay.

Craig Copetas had one of the most colorful beats in journalism: He wrote about the illegal drug trade for High Times magazine. “Dealers would search me out, asking me to go to Latin America to write adventure stories about them,” he told me. Another time, a guy opened up a small suitcase to give Copetas a peek at what he was holding: $1.5 million in cash.

That show-and-tell happened in December 1977, in the District of Columbia. It was a big weekend for drugs in the nation’s capital. “Everyone was coming to Washington,” Copetas remembered. “Smugglers, adventurers, scientists, musicians, lawyers, farmers, dealers, global leaders. And all of them were coming with some of the most rootin’-tootin’, scientifically produced cavalcade of recreational drugs you could imagine. And they were bringing it down in bulk.”

The occasion was a weekend conference put on by the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, more commonly known as NORML. For NORML and its allies, 1977 had been an amazing year. Mississippi, New York, and North Carolina all passed decriminalization laws. And the new man in the White House, President Jimmy Carter, was urging Congress to do the same thing on a national level.

Growing, smoking, and possessing marijuana was still illegal pretty much everywhere in the United States. But by 1977, more than half of Americans under 30 had tried pot. NORML’s liberal drug agenda was winning. And now it was time to revel in all that success.

The weekend’s most extravagant event was the NORML Christmas party, held in a town house near Dupont Circle. There was a rock band, strobe lights, and a juggler. Silver trays got passed from guest to guest, some loaded down with caviar and others with joints packed with hand-cultivated marijuana.

The night was a crucial showcase for one man: Keith Stroup, the founder of NORML.

In 1977 he was 33 years old, and he answered to the nickname Mr. Marijuana. At the Christmas party, he strolled around in a blue velvet dinner jacket and burgundy bow tie, chatting up friends, colleagues, and potential funders under a haze of marijuana smoke. “Part of the thrill of being there was it was so goddamn out in the open,” he said.

Not long after 10 p.m., a guest showed up who demanded his full attention: Peter Bourne. He was the president’s top adviser on drug policy, and a man who could potentially change everything for Stroup’s movement.

Stroup was surprised and thrilled to see Bourne at the front door. The United States drug czar had turned up for a weed extravaganza. And he hadn’t dropped by to narc on anyone or to shut the whole thing down.

When it came to marijuana, Stroup and Bourne were on the same team. They believed both that America’s drug laws were horribly screwed up and that they were the people to fix them.

But that was before the NORML Christmas party. That night did end up changing everything for pot in America, but not in the way anyone expected.

Last week, almost five decades later, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to hasten the reclassification of marijuana as a Schedule 3 drug. That move would put weed in the same tier as Tylenol with codeine, loosening restrictions on research into the drug’s medical benefits. It will also be a step in the direction of full federal decriminalization or even legalization.

It all might have happened a long time ago if not for that Christmas party in 1977. The drug-fueled gathering turned out to be a turning point for Stroup and Bourne, for the Carter presidency, and for the future of marijuana.

This story was adapted from an episode of the One Year podcast. Evan Chung was the lead producer. Madeline Ducharme was the assistant producer. Listen to the full version:

The first time “Mr. Marijuana” Keith Stroup took a hit from a joint, he wasn’t sure he’d gotten high. What he did know is that the pizza he ate that night tasted “exceptionally good.”

It was the 1960s, and Stroup was at Georgetown Law School, in Washington. Back then, his main concern was avoiding the Vietnam War. He thought about getting a psychiatrist to say that he was gay, which would’ve disqualified him from the armed forces, but his wife vetoed that idea. In the end, he steered clear of military service by getting a government job.

Stroup worked for the National Commission on Product Safety. As a lawyer for the agency, he learned to do the sort of consumer advocacy made famous by Ralph Nader. In 1970 Stroup decided to put his own spin on that kind of work: He was going to lobby for marijuana smokers, just as Nader took up for consumers.

At first, Stroup’s National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws got treated as a curiosity. But he was tireless and charismatic, and he knew what he wanted to achieve. His goal was to make weed legal everywhere in the U.S. In the meantime, he pushed for a smaller, more practical step: decriminalization.

The country’s harsh marijuana laws dated back to the early 20th century, when they’d been enacted to target Black and Mexican Americans. As the demographics of marijuana users changed, so did the drug’s reputation. In 1969 Life magazine published photos of white professionals in cocktail attire toking up.

“If young, otherwise law-abiding, and essentially white people were going to start using this drug in greater numbers, people felt that they didn’t want to then burden these individuals with a criminal record,” said Emily Dufton, the author of Grass Roots: The Rise and Fall and Rise of Marijuana in America. “ ‘You know, this person is probably going to go on to have a family and a white picket fence. And do we really want to destroy their future for a little bit of harmless fun?’ ”

Still, harmless or not, marijuana was illegal. And if you got caught in the wrong place doing the wrong thing, the consequences could be extremely severe, with some people getting life sentences for marijuana-only crimes.

Plenty of Americans believed that small-time marijuana offenders weren’t really offenders at all. And so, under the right circumstances, the country might’ve been on a path to decriminalization in the late 1960s and early ’70s. But there was one very important person standing in the way.

Richard Nixon saw marijuana as a tool of his enemies: liberals, young people, and Vietnam protesters. And in Nixon’s America, those enemies needed to be policed. In 1970 he signed the federal Controlled Substances Act, which put drugs into five different categories, or schedules. The most restrictive category, Schedule 1, was for drugs that were totally outlawed, even for medical use. Among them were heroin, LSD, and marijuana.

Marijuana’s placement in Schedule 1 had to be reviewed by a commission. Given that this group was stacked with Nixon appointees, the president thought it would rubber-stamp his anti-marijuana position. But when all those Nixon appointees weighed the evidence, they did something surprising: They said marijuana wasn’t actually that bad. The commission recommended that both possession of marijuana for personal use and nonprofit distribution of small amounts of marijuana should be decriminalized.

Nixon hated those recommendations, and so he decided to ignore them. He kept marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug, which it still is today. (Trump’s executive order finally looks poised to change that.)

But Nixon wasn’t all-powerful. Lawmakers across the country read the commission’s report and found it persuasive. “They began realizing that they had the capacity to change marijuana laws on the local level, and that’s what began to happen,” Dufton said.

Oregon was the first state to decriminalize marijuana, in 1973. By 1976, six more states had done it, and a bunch of others looked as if they were moving in that direction. But for American marijuana policy to get remade, the federal government would have to be on board. There would need to be a new voice in Washington, someone with liberal views who was savvy enough to wield real political power. Someone like future drug czar Peter Bourne.

Years before he showed up at that fateful Washington party, Peter Bourne served as a doctor in Vietnam. During his stint in the military, Bourne discovered that American soldiers were finding solace in heroin. When his tour of duty was over, the Englishman moved to California and saw the dark aftermath of the Summer of Love. In San Francisco in the late 1960s, he helped set up the Haight Ashbury Free Medical Clinic. “That exposed me to widespread drug use of all kinds,” he told me.

In the early ’70s, Bourne moved to Atlanta to run a methadone clinic. He saw it as his chance to save lives. “Our goal was to have a situation where no heroin addict could say, ‘I want treatment, but there’s nowhere I can go to get it,’ ” he said.

Bourne and his clinic caught the attention of Georgia’s new governor, Jimmy Carter. Back then, Carter was an obscure figure, but Bourne believed in him. He was the first person to tell Carter that he should run for president.

Carter and Bourne became extremely close. During the 1976 presidential campaign, the governor said that Bourne was “about the closest friend I have in the world.” When Bourne talked about drugs, Carter listened. And Bourne made his views very clear. “More than anything else, people were dying in large numbers from heroin,” he said, “and you had 40 million people in the country using marijuana and nobody dying from it.”

Bourne believed that every dollar spent enforcing marijuana laws was a dollar taken away from work that really mattered. And he convinced Carter that he was right. During the 1976 campaign, Carter came out in favor of marijuana decriminalization. This was a big statement—the most liberal position on marijuana ever taken by a major-party presidential nominee.

While Carter didn’t personally approve of pot, he was no Richard Nixon. He hung out with weed-loving musicians like Willie Nelson and the Allman Brothers, and he didn’t think that everyone under 30 was plotting to destroy America.

Carter’s victory that fall marked a huge shift in U.S. politics—the end of the Nixon era, and a fresh start after Watergate and Vietnam. And Bourne had lots of ideas about how he could help his closest friend. Bourne advocated for national health insurance, and he put together a plan to end world hunger. He also talked to Carter about sending rockets to Mars.

All of that was outside Bourne’s purview. What he could do was change the country’s drug policy. Bourne’s official title was “special assistant to the president for mental health and drug abuse.” One of the people he met with was Keith Stroup. “We had so much to gain by maintaining that relationship, with Peter being so close to the president himself and so powerful in terms of drug policy,” Stroup said.

When Stroup founded NORML, he struggled to get big players to take him seriously. Now, with Carter in the White House, he became a Washington insider. Stroup smoked weed with the president’s son Chip, and he bonded with administration officials. “When the Allman Brothers were going to play a concert here in D.C., I would actually ride out to the concert with a group of White House people in a bus they had chartered,” Stroup told me. “Most of the time, we were smoking on the bus going out and smoking on the bus coming home.”

Stroup was a stoner who thought everyone in America should be free to enjoy the benefits of marijuana. Bourne was a doctor who thought that marijuana was trivial and the government should focus its resources on heroin. But from those different starting points, Mr. Marijuana and the drug czar ended up in the same place. In March 1977, Bourne told Congress that the administration “will continue to discourage marijuana use, but we feel criminal penalties that brand otherwise law-abiding people for life are neither an effective nor an appropriate deterrent.”

At times, it sounded as if the White House’s talking points on marijuana had been written by Keith Stroup. And in 1977, that actually happened.

One day, Stroup got a phone call from a junior White House speechwriter, who said that he was working on a presidential statement about marijuana policy. He asked Stroup if he’d like to come by and help him draft it. “And of course, I almost kill myself running to his place,” Stroup said.

Stroup’s most aggressive pro-pot language got edited out of that statement. But a lot of his material remained intact, including these lines:

Penalties against possession of a drug should not be more damaging to an individual than the use of the drug itself; and where they are, they should be changed. Nowhere is this more clear than in the laws against possession of marijuana in private for personal use.

The biggest headline coming out of that statement was that Jimmy Carter endorsed decriminalization—the first time a sitting president had ever done so. In some ways, it was just symbolic, because Carter wasn’t proposing a specific bill. But coming from the president and his drug czar, that symbolism was important.

A fundamental shift in American marijuana policy felt tantalizingly close. Bourne believed that the administration was going to get progressive legislation passed in Congress. Stroup thought that “within three or four or five years, we would have decriminalization passed in all states across the country.”

But there was another movement getting started around that same time—one that Bourne and Stroup did not see coming. It was led by two moms from Georgia.

In 1976 Marsha Keith Schuchard and her husband hosted their daughter’s 13th birthday party. There were about 20 kids in her backyard. “They asked if we could go upstairs, which we did,” she said. “And then my husband started seeing lights, like cigarette lights, going on all over. … And he went down to see what was happening, and it wasn’t cigarettes. It was joints. It was booze. And it was quite a shock.”

Schuchard doesn’t fit the stereotype of a drug warrior. She has a doctorate in English, and she identifies as a liberal Democrat. Living in Atlanta in the ’60s and ’70s, she fought for voting rights and school desegregation. But when Schuchard caught her daughter smoking pot, she found a new cause.

Schuchard called herself a “do-it-yourself drug-abuse professional.” She believed that parents could fight back against drug culture by sharing tips and resources and creating a supportive and safe community.

“They set uniform rules for all of their kids. They weren’t allowed to read High Times magazine. They had a curfew,” said Dufton, who wrote about Schuchard in her book Grass Roots. And in the parents’ eyes, those rules seemed to work.

The neighborhood kids called them the Nosy Parents Association. By 1977, Schuchard had brought her nosiness nationwide, co-founding the Parents’ Resource Institute for Drug Education. “What Schuchard was tapping into was that these were legitimate fears that a lot of people were having about their kids, but no one was speaking to it,” Dufton said.

Adolescent marijuana usage was on the rise in the mid-1970s, and pro-pot messages were everywhere. In magazines like High Times, Head, and Stone Age; on Saturday Night Live and in movies like The Groove Tube and Car Wash; and in Peter Tosh’s “Legalize It” and Neil Young’s “Homegrown.” And it was getting easier every day to find a shop that carried pipes and rolling papers.

In Atlanta, Schuchard’s friend Sue Rusche had promised her kids she’d buy them a Star Wars record. When they walked into the record store, what they found instead was a glass display case full of “Star Wars–like bongs.” Rusche went to more stores, and found more kid-friendly products: a Frisbee that was also a hash pipe, and a book called Tots Who Toke. “I know the power of advertising. I learned it in graphic design school,” Rusche told me. “And to think that people would target children was just inexplicable and abhorrent.”

The idea that pot was endangering impressionable, vulnerable children was a potent political message. In 1977 Schuchard and Rusche were starting to spread it. Whenever they spoke to parents groups, they’d bring along what they called the “bong show.” “The first thing we did was show them what the paraphernalia looked like and suggest that they try to find it in their community, and they always did,” Rusche said.

NORML’s Stroup had not accounted for any of this when he made his push for decriminalization. And when the parents from Atlanta started to get traction, he still didn’t think they were a real threat.

“Their philosophy was: If it’s unsafe for kids, then you shouldn’t legalize it. And of course, that’s a stupid standard,” Stroup said. “If that was the standard, adults couldn’t drive or fly airplanes or have sex. I thought because that premise was so wrongheaded that we didn’t have to worry about them.”

It was always unlikely that Mr. Marijuana and the nosy parents would find common ground. But Schuchard thought she might have a chance to win over the drug czar.

She got an audience with Peter Bourne in December 1977, at a conference on drug abuse. She told him about middle schoolers smoking pot, and she pulled out a bag of marijuana publications that she’d bought at a suburban shopping mall. Bourne listened to what she had to say and looked at what she’d brought. And the drug czar was totally unmoved. Schuchard said that he was “indifferent, rude, dismissive.”

Bourne was similarly unimpressed. He told me that the parents “didn’t know anything about drug abuse” and “couldn’t explain their position in any sort of public-health terms.” When I asked Bourne if he thought it was legitimate to be concerned about 13-year-olds smoking marijuana, he said that it didn’t bother him that much—that “when you compare it to more than 1,000 dying each month from heroin, it’s a misplacement of priorities.”

So that’s where Stroup and Bourne were in December 1977: entrenched in their positions, confident in their success, and unafraid to antagonize their opponents. What they didn’t realize was that they were about to make enemies with each other. And it would all start at the Christmas party.

NORML’s annual conference in D.C. featured seminars on marijuana and the law, marijuana and science, and marijuana and women. There were also plenty of opportunities to get a more practical education on the American drug scene.

“Wherever we went that weekend, people were coming up to us and offering us drugs,” remembered Craig Copetas of High Times magazine. “It was like backstage at a Rolling Stones concert.”

That weekend, Copetas shared a hotel suite with his friend Hunter S. Thompson. The way Patrick Anderson tells it in his book High in America, a conferencegoer sidled up to Thompson during a luncheon attended by roughly 300 people and passed the writer some cocaine. Copetas then held up a copy of the New York Times, which they used to shield themselves as they enjoyed the gift they’d just received.

“Oh, dear. The things we did in our youth, huh?” Copetas told me when I asked about that moment. “I will plead the Fifth Amendment on that. Although I will say I did hold up a New York Times.”

Later that same day, Dec. 10, 1977, Copetas and Thompson headed over to the big NORML Christmas party. The 600 attendees who had crammed themselves into a D.C. town house that evening were typical Washington creatures: political staffers, journalists, do-gooder nonprofit types. That night, they saw a rock band and strobe lights and a juggler and silver trays full of caviar and joints. They saw Keith Stroup, Mr. Marijuana, presiding over it all. Then they saw Peter Bourne, the White House drug czar, walk through the front door.

Bourne got a hero’s welcome—hugs and handshakes from marijuana lovers who appreciated everything he’d done for their cause. For Stroup, Bourne was his guy on the inside, and it was important to keep him happy. So he paid close attention when a friend passed along a message. Those words, in Stroup’s memory: “Peter says he wouldn’t mind doing a line of coke.”

“My first reaction was: ‘What? Did I hear—did I hear you right?’ ” Stroup said. His second reaction was to go looking for cocaine. The way Stroup tells it, he tracked down some coke, then asked Bourne to go upstairs to a private room.

“Everyone in the house could see who was going up that stair. It was like a stage,” Copetas told me. Stroup said, “It was kind of almost incriminating to be seen walking up there.”

Copetas declined to tell me exactly what happened next, “because that was a private interlude as far as I’m concerned and always will be.” But Stroup didn’t hold back. He said, “We sat around and all did a few lines of coke and then, OK, better get back down and say hello to some more people. And Peter said, ‘Yeah, I need to get going too.’ And we left.”

Copetas did say this, about the aftermath of that get-together: “After I went back to sit down, Hunter looked at me and said, ‘Jesus Christ, Craig, we’re all going to be indicted now.’ ”

But Stroup was more excited than paranoid. “Shit, snorting a line with the president’s drug czar?” he said. “This is not a bad thing in that it means that we have some secrets we’re now sharing. We have some intimate moments that we haven’t had before.”

Word spread quickly inside the town house: Peter Bourne, the drug czar, had done cocaine.

When I asked Bourne what he remembered about the party, he said “very little”—that it was “just sort of the usual crowd, the strong Carter supporters.”

He denied asking for cocaine that night. He told me that claim was “so untrue.”

“I may have been stupid enough to go to the party, but I had no interest in doing cocaine,” he said. “I would have gone somewhere else if I had wanted to do that. There may have been cocaine there at some point, but I was not a participant.”

I asked Bourne if he used cocaine at all, outside the party.

His answer: “I’ve never used cocaine. Have I? I don’t think so. Because I was very careful never to use marijuana or go anywhere where I would smoke marijuana. So, you know, being that cautious, I don’t know why in the world I would use cocaine.”

The NORML Christmas party ended around 4 a.m., with something like a dozen people passed out around the town house. The political staffers, the journalists, and the do-gooder nonprofit types all went back home, and back to work. For the next few months, life in Washington carried on as usual. And then, very suddenly, everything blew up.

The undoing of Peter Bourne began on a Friday afternoon in July 1978, when a young woman came to him and said she was having trouble sleeping. She asked Bourne if he could write her a prescription for sleeping pills.

That woman worked for Bourne at the White House. And he could prescribe her medication since he was a licensed doctor. So that day he wrote her a prescription for Quaaludes.

Quaaludes were extremely popular in the ’70s, as sleeping pills but also as an aphrodisiac. Bourne told the woman that he’d give her a pseudonym for the Quaalude prescription so it wouldn’t show up if she ever tried to get a security clearance. “It’s a regular practice if you have somebody who wants to keep their use of drugs confidential,” he told me.

The woman, Bourne’s aide, asked a friend to pick up her prescription. When that friend went to the drugstore, a pharmacy inspector happened to be there, doing routine rounds. The woman’s friend got arrested for “attempting to obtain a controlled substance by the use of a false name.” And when it came out that the drug czar’s name was on the prescription, the story was all over the national news.

Bourne thought it would eventually blow over. But the day after the Quaalude story came out, investigative reporter Jack Anderson went on ABC’s Good Morning America to deliver some new information: Three witnesses had seen the drug czar, Peter Bourne, snort cocaine at the NORML Christmas party.

Anderson’s report didn’t name any of the three witnesses, but it did say they had “provided complete and convincing details.”

“Like an idiot,” Stroup told me, “I somehow managed to take what was a confined scandal and find a way to put myself in the middle of it.”

Why did Stroup tell a reporter that Bourne had done coke? Bourne was the best ally he’d ever had. Together, they’d been spreading the gospel of decriminalization across the country.

But Stroup had become convinced that American marijuana smokers were in danger of being killed. And he thought the Carter administration, and Bourne, was complicit.

The issue was an herbicide called paraquat. The Mexican government was spraying paraquat on poppy and marijuana fields, using helicopters provided by the United States. And so, the theory went, anyone who smoked pot imported from Mexico might be inhaling paraquat. “I remember at the time there were articles saying that even a teaspoon of paraquat on your tongue and you’d have an agonizing death. It’s that strong,” Stroup said.

Stroup told Bourne that all this needed to stop—that marijuana smokers were in grave danger. But Bourne didn’t buy it.

“I thought it was all bullshit,” he said. “We paid thousands of dollars to have it analyzed. … I mean, the paraquat thing was totally scientifically wrong.”

There’s not much clear evidence that paraquat ever harmed American marijuana smokers. But the chemical is extremely toxic, and Stroup was disgusted that Bourne thought that was no big deal.

Stroup and Bourne had found common ground on decriminalization. But they were now on opposite sides of what Stroup considered an existential issue. Stroup had been able to look past that tension in 1977. But in the first few months of 1978, he began to view Bourne’s actions as unforgivable. “At that point, it was like, Jesus Christ, Peter, if you’re going to play life and death, don’t forget, I got something over here too.”

The something that Stroup had was his story about the NORML Christmas party. A bunch of reporters had seen Bourne at the party, and plenty of them had heard whispers about the drug czar doing coke. One of those journalists worked for Anderson. In the weeks after the party, that reporter pestered Stroup to confirm the cocaine rumors.

Stroup initially refused, but now he changed his mind. He was ready to talk. And he gave up the names of two other witnesses.

He said that all of this was off the record—for now. But five months later, after the Quaalude news broke, Stroup gave his blessing for the cocaine story to get aired, so long as his name was not attached. On July 21, 1978, on Good Morning America, the bomb Stroup planted finally went off.

When the news broke, Bourne told his colleagues at the White House that he’d seen cocaine at the party but that he hadn’t used it. That explanation was not enough to save the drug czar’s job. At a news conference, Jimmy Carter announced, “Dr. Peter Bourne, out of consideration for my administration, has submitted his resignation this afternoon, which I have accepted with regret.”

Bourne didn’t leave the White House quietly. After he resigned, he told the New York Times that marijuana use was commonplace at the White House. He also said that “a few” of his colleagues did cocaine. A couple of days later, Carter sent a memo to the White House staff. “I expect [everyone] to obey the law,” the president said. “You will obey it, or you will seek employment elsewhere.”

Stroup hadn’t been named in the Good Morning America story that took down Bourne. But he did give a quote to the Washington Post and basically outed himself as the original source.

After that, Stroup got out of town, going to Las Vegas to hang out with his friend Willie Nelson and clear his head. “By the time I got back to D.C., I realized two things,” he said. “That Peter had ended up being hurt more than he deserved, and … that my career with NORML almost certainly was coming to an end.”

Stroup had severed his connection to the White House, and he’d done it recklessly: “Any idiot should have recognized that even if I felt threatened about paraquat spraying or even if I was angry about something else, that didn’t justify destroying that point of access to power.”

The founder of NORML had also violated the drug user’s code: You don’t snort and tell. Stroup issued an apology, but too much damage had been done. In December 1978, at NORML’s annual conference, he delivered his farewell speech as the group’s executive director. A year earlier, that conference had been a nonstop celebration, and Stroup and Bourne had seemed indestructible. Now they’d both been disgraced, and their downfall had profound consequences for the pro-marijuana movement they’d been working to build.

Before the Bourne scandal, a relaxed approach to marijuana had fit in perfectly with the Carter administration’s priorities. Afterward, the White House pulled back from anything that might be perceived as soft on drugs. Bourne’s successor as drug czar declared that both he and the president “adamantly oppose the use of marijuana, period.”

For the parent activists from Atlanta, Bourne’s ouster was the opening they needed. In the early days of the Carter administration, Marsha Keith Schuchard had gotten iced out. Now she scored an invitation to the newly anti-marijuana White House, where she made her pitch about how weed was damaging kids.

In 1979 the National Institute on Drug Abuse published a booklet researched and written by Schuchard. It was called Parents, Peers, and Pot. It told the story of her daughter’s smoke-filled 13th birthday party, and everything that came after. The booklet was full of alarming claims, including that marijuana might cause enlarged breasts in adolescent boys. Government scientists found Schuchard’s prose hyperbolic, but the public ate it up. “After a million copies were ordered, they stopped printing it because they said we have too many orders,” Schuchard said.

When Ronald and Nancy Reagan moved into the White House in 1981, the parent activists became even more influential. Schuchard said that when she told Nancy Reagan she was a liberal, the first lady responded that it was a nonpartisan movement and they were all in this together. “I had to give her credit for that,” Schuchard said.

Marijuana usage peaked in America in 1979, then fell in every age category in the 1980s. Decriminalization stopped cold. A few months before Bourne had resigned as the White House drug czar, Nebraska became the 11th state to decriminalize marijuana. No other states followed suit in the next two decades.

Peter Bourne is 86 now. When we spoke a few years ago, he was splitting his time between northern Virginia and a farm in Wales, where he and his wife were raising llamas. When I asked him if he’d been the most progressive drug czar of all time, he said, “Yes, by far.”

Seventeen years after Keith Stroup resigned, he got rehired as NORML’s executive director. He’s now the group’s legal counsel. In his early 80s, Stroup finally sees the world he’d always imagined beginning to take shape. In Virginia, where he lives, it’s legal for adults 21 and older to possess, consume, and grow small amounts of marijuana. At the end of our interview, he invited me to come over and light one up sometime.

Stroup has said that ratting out Peter Bourne was the “stupidest decision” he ever made. He said the most recent time they ran into each other was more than 10 years ago, at a cocktail party. While they did stop and chat for a minute, “neither of us tried to make a move to say, You want to get a beer sometime?” Stroup told me. “I think we both recognized that we had passed that point of no return a long time ago.”

When I asked Bourne how much he blamed Stroup for his downfall, he stopped to consider the question for a brief moment. Then he answered: “I suppose, quite a lot.”

Bourne told me that back in the 1970s, he hadn’t understood what Stroup was doing—why he’d been so outraged, paranoid, and hell-bent on destroying what had been a productive partnership. But now, he said, he thinks he gets what was going on. “I don’t think I’m betraying confidences, but what I was unaware of then was that he had a serious cocaine problem,” he said. “I can see that he wasn’t wielding good judgment.”

“I don’t doubt that cocaine had something to do with it, sure,” Stroup told me. “You get very ragged when you’re doing cocaine. You get irritable, sometimes you get angry [about] things that wouldn’t make you angry otherwise. The cocaine use was not helpful. I don’t think I can use it as an excuse, but it probably did cause my responses to be exaggerated at times.”

Stroup and Bourne will never agree about what happened in that private room at the NORML Christmas party. But here, there’s something approaching consensus: Mr. Marijuana dropped a dime on the drug czar for doing cocaine because he himself was doing too much cocaine. And that is how the pro-pot movement of the 1970s went up in smoke.

All this week, What Next and What Next: TBD are re-airing some of our favorite conversations from throughout the year and checking back with the people in those conversations to see how things have – or haven’t – changed. This episode is from October.

In an executive order, Donald Trump declared “Antifa” a terrorist organization. As it isn’t an organization, there aren’t leaders to target, so zealous conservatives took aim at Mark Bray, a Rutgers professor who wrote a book about fighting fascism eight years ago. The clumsy attempts to get him fired didn’t bother him—but the doxxing and death threats were enough to convince him he needed to leave America.

Guest: Mark Bray, assistant teaching professor at Rutgers, author of Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook.

Sunday’s talks between U.S. and Russian negotiators on how to end the war in Ukraine went absolutely nowhere, and the only surprise is that anyone might have been surprised by the deadlock.

President Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff tried to pretend otherwise, calling the talks “productive and constructive.” But Yuri Ushakov, the Kremlin’s top diplomatic adviser, called them “rather unproductive.”

The basic fact and the principal obstacle to peace—which Trump and Witkoff seem to ignore—is that Russian President Vladimir Putin doesn’t want to stop fighting until he achieves total victory. He has said this many times, most recently on Friday, during his annual end-of-year marathon news conference, this one lasting four and a half hours, in which he declared that his war aims are unchanged and that compromise is out of the question.

Those aims, as he has also noted many times, include the complete subjugation of Ukraine—which he has said does not exist as a real country with a real culture or history and which he also claims is ruled by a “neo-Nazi regime” hell-bent on conquering Russia.

As long as that is the case, drawn-out detailed discussions about the borderline between Russia and Ukraine, the shape of a demilitarized zone in the Donbas province, and the precise configuration of security arrangements for Kyiv are all colossal wastes of time.

This is not a controversial point. Reuters reported on Monday that a recent U.S. intelligence analysis concluded that Putin has not abandoned his aims of capturing all of Ukraine and of reclaiming parts of Europe that belonged to the former Soviet empire. The story was credited to six sources who are familiar with the analysis.

Yet it seems that the American president, the main audience for intelligence analyses, either didn’t see this report or waved away its conclusion.

Perhaps Witkoff—who headed the U.S. delegation at the talks in Florida, along with Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and White House staffer Josh Gruenbaum—really does believe, as he posted on social media, that “Russia remains fully committed to achieving peace in Ukraine.” The problem here may be that Witkoff—a real-estate magnate with no experience in diplomacy and no prior knowledge of Russian affairs—thinks “peace” means nothing more than a ceasefire and the signing of a document.

In that sense, he isn’t so different from his longtime friend and fellow real-estate tycoon who currently resides in the White House. In October, Trump played a key role in pressuring Israel and Hamas to sign a ceasefire in Gaza and a hostage-for-prisoners exchange—a notable achievement. But this marked only the first phase—covering just the initial planks—of a 20-point peace plan. The next phase requires outside countries to station security forces inside Gaza, to maintain order and set the foundations for a new political authority. So far, none of the countries in the region have volunteered for the job. Trump proudly announced, at the signing ceremony for the first phase, that he would be chairman of a “board of peace” to supervise the subsequent phases—but he has done nothing to prod anyone into action. It seems that, in his mind, he got the ball rolling; if it stops rolling, if the fighting resumes (as it has to some extent already), then that’s not his fault.

Like Witkoff, he doesn’t seem to understand that making peace, actively enforcing a ceasefire or molding the foundations to sustain one, is not a one-off gesture. It requires persistent involvement, coupled with a thorough schooling in the causes of the war and the necessary preconditions for real peace.

Trump and Witkoff not only lack that specialized schooling but think they don’t need it. They view themselves as “dealmakers” and see no distinction between brokering a deal with the New York City Department of Buildings, some vendor on a construction project, or the Kremlin.

The significant thing here is that Putin recognized, and figured out how to exploit, this skewed outlook for his own benefit. In the early days of Trump’s second term, according to a remarkable story in Friday’s Wall Street Journal, Putin asked Trump to send Witkoff to Moscow for talks on Ukraine, offering to release an American prisoner if he did so, but only on the condition that Witkoff come alone, bringing no aides or CIA analysts with him.

Trump had chosen Witkoff to be his emissary on the Middle East, so the request must have come as a surprise. In the course of a rambling hourlong address to the Israeli Knesset in October, Trump said he thought Witkoff would have a “15-or-20-minute meeting” with Putin, adding, “Steve had no idea about Russia, had no idea about Putin too much, didn’t know too much about politics, wasn’t too interested.”

As we now know, this is what made Witkoff so appealing to Putin. The Russian president already had a sympathetic ear in Trump. Now he wanted to ensure that his chief American interlocutor was someone he could easily manipulate. It is no coincidence that retired Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump’s original appointee as envoy on Ukrainian matters, recently resigned; he found himself having nothing to do.

Trump ends his first year as the returning president believing, perhaps sincerely, that he is a peacemaker. But in fact two of the world’s most consequential conflicts rage on—the war in Ukraine, which he thought he could easily end, and the war in Gaza, which he thinks he has ended. And Trump doesn’t understand why.

            <h2>Democrats Are Ending the Year on a Particularly Dumb Note</h2>

Earlier this month, shortly after a series of Democratic wins in off-year elections, in the government shutdown, and in nosediving polls for President Donald Trump, a number of key Democrats made some unusual choices. First, New Jersey Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer began once again hawking the “Porch Pirates Act,” a bill that nobody seemed to have asked for and which could come back to haunt his party if passed. Then, this week, the Democratic National Committee announced it would not release its highly anticipated 2024 autopsy report.

Why, amid its first signs of life since the devastating 2024 election results, is the party seemingly determined to take multiple steps backward?

Let’s start with Gottheimer and porch pirates. Standing proud at a podium set up in his home district on Dec. 1, Gottheimer preached how private companies like Amazon, United Parcel Service, and FedEx should receive even greater protections than the federal agency the United States Postal Service. Currently, it’s a federal crime to steal mail out of any USPS post office, letter box, or mail receptacle, with violators facing a fine and prison time of no more than five years. The Porch Pirates Act would expand on this, adding Americans’ porches to the protected mail space, and it would make stealing a package from a private porch a federal crime with punishment of up to 10 years in prison and $250,000 in fines.

The legislation would also give the Federal Bureau of Investigations, Justice Department, and federal task forces the authority to “fully investigate porch theft.” There are already laws on the books that cover these sorts of thefts and any potential greater conspiracies that might be involved in them. The Porch Pirates Act is not only redundant, it is excessively punitive, especially when Democrats have spent multiple general election cycles in a row battling the image among younger voters of having boosted mass incarceration during the 1990s. It seems unwise to reopen this fight.

The Porch Pirates Act was first introduced back in 2022, but has since seen basically no movement in Congress. Last year, Democrat Dean Phillips, a former representative and sponsor of the bill, went so far as to film a video where he shadowed a UPS driver who seemed amused at best to be sharing his route with a congressman. The final product looks and sounds alarmingly like a paid UPS commercial rather than a genuine explanation for why the Porch Pirates Act is necessary. Now, it seems like Gottheimer is taking a stab at attempting to push the legislation forward.

Let’s be clear, out of all the problems American consumers are currently facing, like the impending explosion of health care costs, stubbornly high inflation on everyday goods, and rising unemployment, why do some Democrats view package theft as among voters’ top concerns? (A previous version of the bill had 17 Democratic co-sponsors, though it’s unclear how many this one has.)

Besides the irrelevant nature of the Porch Pirates Act, it also stands to significantly contribute to the country’s mass incarceration problem. Penalizing thieves for stealing some Amazon packages with prison time and fines in the hundreds of thousands would drag an already overburdened criminal justice system down even further, inevitably also increasing the cost of running state and federal prisons. It’s well documented that mass incarceration leads to poor physical, psychological, and economic outcomes for people who experience imprisonment, which ends up hurting all American communities.

The USPS Office of Inspector General even published a white paper earlier this year acknowledging the pesky problem of package theft, and recommended collaborative strategies—not criminal penalties. “Offering and making use of flexible and secure delivery options, leveraging technology for enhanced tracking and theft prevention, [and] utilizing discreet packaging and package delivery placement” were among the recommended solutions.

The Porch Pirates Act also threatens to be a repeat of the infamous crime bill of the 1990s that led to a consistent rise in incarceration rates for the following decade, and which Democrats paid for dearly. The party surely does not want to be responsible for adding yet another pathway to prison.

Unfortunately, it appears Democrats are keen to end 2025 on the wrong foot. Instead of acknowledging its faults and reckoning with its consistently low approval ratings this year, the Democratic National Committee decided to continue ignoring its problems by scrapping the public release of its 2024 autopsy report. Claiming it would simply distract and divide the party, the lack of accountability now sets the stage for Democrats to repeat the same grave mistakes in the 2026 midterms and beyond. Party establishment gets to continue its iron grip, no fundamental changes will be made to Democrats’ platform, but hey, at least they can say they fought for Americans’ porches.

            <h2>21K Nissan customers' data stolen in Red Hat raid</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/23/21k_nissan_customers_data_stolen/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Thousands of Nissan customers are learning that some of their personal data was leaked after unauthorized access to a Red Hat-managed server, according to the Japanese automaker.

About 21,000 customers who purchased a vehicle or had service done at the former Nissan Fukuoka Motor Co. (now Nissan Fukuoka Sales Co.) were affected by a digital intrusion detected in September, the company said in a December breach disclosure.

While the crooks reportedly did not steal any credit card information, leaked personal details include customers&#39; addresses, names, phone numbers, partial email addresses, and other customer-related information used for sales activities.

&quot;At this time, there has been no confirmation that the leaked information has been used for secondary purposes,&quot; the car manufacturer said in a Japanese-language report translated via Google, adding that customers should be on high alert for suspicious calls or mail - all of these stolen details can be valuable to criminals in targeted phishing attacks or other financial fraud.

&quot;Nissan takes this incident very seriously and will strengthen its monitoring of its subcontractors and take further steps to strengthen information security,&quot; the company noted. &quot;We would like to once again offer our deepest apologies to our customers for any inconvenience caused.&quot;

The IBM-owned open source software maker previously disclosed that &quot;an unauthorized third party had accessed and copied some data from a Red Hat Consulting-managed, dedicated GitLab instance.&quot;

According to the Nissan breach notification, Red Hat detected the intruders on September 26, and then alerted the automaker on October 3.

Nissan did not immediately respond to The Register&#39;s inquiries, including who was responsible for the data theft and whether the criminals had tried to extort the carmaker. We will update this story if we receive a response.

While neither Nissan nor Red Hat named a specific criminal group in their statements, in early October, a group called Crimson Collective claimed to have broken into Red Hat&#39;s private GitLab repositories and exfiltrated some 570 GB of compressed data, including sensitive documents belonging to customers.

A day later, Red Hat confirmed the breach.

Shortly after, Crimson Collective said it had teamed up with the ShinyHunters-linked &quot;Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters&quot; gang to extort the IBM-owned biz.

This is the auto manufacturer&#39;s third major breach in as many years.

In May 2024, Nissan admitted personal information belonging to more than 50,000 of its North American employees, both current and former, had been stolen in a November 2023 &quot;targeted cyber attack.&quot;

Two months prior, Nissan disclosed that its Oceania division&#39;s IT systems had been hit by the Akira ransomware gang, which stole personal information belonging to more than 100,000 customers. The Akira attack reportedly occurred in December 2023. ®

            <h2>Starlink satellite fails, polluting orbit with debris and falling toward Earth</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/23/starlink_satellite_fails_debris/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As if to underscore the need to avoid the Kessler Syndrome, a scenario in which cascading debris can make some orbits difficult to use, a Starlink satellite vented propellant and released debris following an onboard &quot;anomaly&quot; late last week.

The incident, described by observers as &quot;likely caused by an internal energetic source&quot; rather than a collision, resulted in a loss of communication. According to Starlink, the result was a venting of the propellant tank and &quot;the release of a small number of trackable low relative velocity objects.&quot;

The satellite, Starlink 35956, was launched on November 23, 2025, as part of the Starlink Group 11-30-13 mission, according to Jonathan McDowell&#39;s satellite list. Its altitude was 418 km when communication was lost and is now tumbling, although still intact. In a post on X, Starlink stated that the satellite &quot;will reenter the Earth’s atmosphere and fully demise within weeks.&quot;

&quot;The satellite&#39;s current trajectory will place it below the @Space_Station, posing no risk to the orbiting lab or its crew.&quot;

It is not clear what caused the &quot;energetic&quot; event. Starlink wrote that &quot;our engineers are rapidly working to root cause and mitigate the source of the anomaly and are already in the process of deploying software to our vehicles that increases protections against this type of event.&quot;

Former Space Shuttle astronaut and International Space Station (ISS) crew member Ed Lu noted that &quot;hundreds&quot; of debris objects associated with the incident were being tracked, and had already spread out to 6,000 km over the orbital track within a few days. Lu is co-founder and CTO of LeoLabs, a business specializing in tracking objects in orbit.

The incident came days after a SpaceX executive claimed that a Chinese satellite launch came within 200 meters of colliding with a Starlink vehicle. It is therefore reassuring to know that SpaceX does not require the assistance of another space-faring power when it comes to unplanned debris-generating incidents in orbit.

Joking aside, the loss of communication, venting of propellant, and creation of an unknown amount of debris are a concern as low Earth orbit becomes more crowded.

Researchers recently proposed a &quot;CRASH Clock&quot; to indicate how long it could take before something catastrophic happens if all collision-avoidance maneuvers cease. While Starlink 35956 should burn up in Earth&#39;s atmosphere within a few weeks, the incident highlights the danger posed by debris and how easily and quickly the debris load in Low Earth Orbit can grow. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-23</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft has hustled out an out-of-band update to address a Message Queuing issue introduced by the December 2025 update.

The patches, released for Windows 10 22H2 ESU, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021, and Windows 10 LTSB 2016, as well as flavors of Windows Server from 2008 to 2019, include the fixes from the December 9, 2025 update, but won&#39;t leave Message Queuing (MSMQ) in a broken state.

Administrators already dealing with the MSMQ issue can install this update to resolve it.

The problem mainly affected enterprise environments – according to Microsoft, users on Pro and Home editions of Windows were &quot;very unlikely&quot; to encounter the issue. The cause was a change that required MSMQ to have write access to areas where administrative restrictions usually apply. The result was that message queuing could stop working, leading to some distinctly unhelpful errors.

Services such as Microsoft&#39;s web server, Internet Information Services (IIS), could stop working, as could applications that need to write to queues. Worse, misleading logs were filled with text such as &quot;There is insufficient disk space or memory,&quot; even though sufficient disk space and memory were available.

It took Microsoft a few days to acknowledge there was a problem – the known issue was added to affected versions on December 12, 2025, during which time affected administrators were forced to deploy workarounds that involved either granting modified permissions to the storage folder or rolling back the update.

The out-of-band (OOB) update resolves the issue, though it calls into question Microsoft&#39;s quality practices once again, since a lot of corporate infrastructure depends on MSMQ.

Yes, the service has been around for a while (it dates back to the last century, to the days of Windows 95 and NT 4). There are alternatives for new development, but MSMQ remains a supported component of Windows. Its longevity means that applications where direct connectivity is not possible will likely depend on it for communication.

Affected users were understandably unhappy, with many having to field customer complaints as services fell over due to the issue.

While Microsoft&#39;s relatively swift resolution of the issue is laudable, the fact that it happened at all reflects poorly on the company&#39;s validation and quality control practices. Sure, MSMQ might not be a shiny new cloud component festooned with AI functionality, but plenty of enterprises have legacy code and applications that depend on it. Breaking it shows a level of carelessness that has not gone unnoticed. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Windows 11 Run dialog box is one of the oldest pieces of user interface still in use. It works just fine, but it has an aesthetic that harkens back to earlier versions of Microsoft’s operating system. Now, that’s set to change.

Redmond is testing a new version of the Run dialog box, if you have one of the latest Beta or Dev Insider builds installed. You&#39;ll need Insider build 26220.7523 (latest Beta and Dev build as of December 23, 2025) or newer, but you&#39;ll also need to enable the feature (see below).

The new Run dialog box is longer than the old one and, perhaps because it’s still in testing, covers over part of the taskbar. As with the classic one, you invoke it by hitting Windows key + R.

Note that this covers over the Start button and taskbar icons if you have your Start menu aligned to the left.

That isn’t a problem with the classic Run dialog box, which appears above the taskbar.

If you want to enable the new Run dialog box on your PC and have the requisite Windows Insider build installed, you must start by downloading the ViveTool, a utility that allows you to turn on hidden features. Then unzip the ViveTool to a new directory you’ll call C:\vive.

Launch the command line with administrator privileges. To do that, search for “cmd” in Windows search, right click on the top result and select Run as administrator.

At the command prompt, change to the C:\vive directory.

Close the windows and reboot your PC. Once your PC is restarted, navigate to Settings > System > Advanced. There toggle Run dialog to on.

Now, when you hit Windows key + R, you’ll see the new dialog box. If you get sick of it, toggle Run dialog to off in the Settings menu. ®

            <div id="article-text">Opinion Register readers of a certain age will recall the events of the 1970s, where a shortage of fuel due to various international disagreements resulted in queues, conflicts, and rising costs. One result was a drive toward greater efficiencies. Perhaps it&#39;s time to apply those lessons to the current memory shortage.

As memory prices continue to rise, it is time engineers reconsidered their applications and toolchains&#39; voracious appetite for memory. Does a simple web page really need megabytes to show a user the modern equivalent of Hello World? Today&#39;s Windows Task Manager executable occupies 6 MB of disk space. It demands almost 70 MB before it will show a user just how much of a memory hog Chrome is these days. The original weighs in at 85 KB on disk. Its successor is not orders of magnitude more functional.

Those who remember effective software running in kilobytes rather than gigabytes have long shaken their heads at the profligate ways of modern engineering. But as tech progress marched on and memory densities seemed destined to increase without end, protesting about bloat felt a lot like &quot;old man yells at cloud.&quot;

Enter the AI boom. As the world races to pack datacenters full of computing gear, memory prices have rocketed in recent months and currently show no signs of returning to levels where a developer could shrug and bolt on another multi-megabyte framework to meet an arbitrary user requirement.

Developers should consider precisely how much of a framework they really need and devote effort to efficiency. Managers must ensure they also have the space to do so. The energy spent securing a toolchain should go into checking its efficiency too.

It is often joked that the memory and computing power that enabled humans to land on the Moon compare poorly to those of a modern smartphone. However, it is not so very long ago that perfectly usable applications and operating systems ran from floppy disks on devices with RAM measured in kilobytes rather than megabytes.

Reversing decades of application growth will not happen overnight. It requires a change of thinking and a different outlook. Toolchains must be rethought, and rewards should be given for compactness, both at rest and in operation.

In the 1970s, a shortage of energy spurred efficiency. In the 2020s, a shortage of computer memory might finally result in software that doesn&#39;t fill every byte with needless fluff. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Non-human travel agents are here. Virgin Atlantic earlier this month installed an AI travel agent on its website, calling the web-bound chatbot &quot;the future of travel planning.&quot;

The project, dubbed Virgin Atlantic Concierge, was implemented by Tomoro, a UK-based AI design consultancy, in partnership with OpenAI.

The Concierge service supports typed or spoken input, assuming the Virgin Atlantic site visitor has granted permission for device microphone activation. The bot, which can respond using simulated speech as well as text, takes longer processing spoken input than typed input, presumably dbecause it has to process captured audio using a speech-to-text model.

Sam Netherwood, co-founder and director of Tomoro, spoke to The Register about the development of Concierge and the project&#39;s goals.

&quot;Initially, Virgin engaged us,&quot; Netherwood said. &quot;We partner quite closely with OpenAI. Virgin also had already entered into an agreement with OpenAI. And so that&#39;s how it came together in the first place. And initially we just did a proof-of-concept over about six weeks.&quot;

The goal, he explained, was to test some hypotheses about whether the technology could deliver an AI interaction experience that would be valuable and to explore how that experience might feel from a consumer perspective in light of Virgin Atlantic&#39;s ambitions.

&quot;So the proof-of-concept that we built was using OpenAI&#39;s real-time speech-to-speech model,&quot; said Netherwood. &quot;That&#39;s built for ultra-low latency, really natural, human-feeling conversation. But there are still some question marks around the intelligence of that model.&quot;

Concierge is an agent, meaning that it&#39;s an AI model given access to tools and APIs. As Netherwood observed, the agent doesn&#39;t work if it can&#39;t access Virgin Atlantic&#39;s APIs to fetch flight information and book travel – it wouldn&#39;t be useful if it just dealt with a subset of pre-canned routes or certain holidays. The agent also needs to be able to determine the user&#39;s intent, in order to properly differentiate between support requests, travel planning, and other scenarios.

&quot;So instruction following has to be really good,&quot; he said. &quot;Tool calling has to be really good. And actually in the proof-of-concept we were like, &#39;I don&#39;t think we&#39;re quite there yet.&#39;&quot;

That was when OpenAI&#39;s Realtime API was in beta testing. In August, the Realtime API reached general availability and the project advanced toward its public release.

&quot;Now we have a better version,&quot; Netherwood said. &quot;I think we&#39;re probably not a million miles away now from us having the tool-calling accuracy and the instruction following-accuracy to enhance the experience with a much more natural conversational exchange, which really was like one of the fundamental things that Virgin Atlantic challenged us to do.&quot;

New infrastructure was not required. Netherwood said that while edge computing holds a lot of promise for being able to extend Concierge functionality to interactions when boarding an airplane, for example, the focus of the initial release has been on the web portal.

&quot;At the moment,&quot; Netherwood said, &quot;we&#39;re only embedded in Virgin Atlantic&#39;s website, not behind any authentication and the reason for that is just that their mobile app is coming – they&#39;ve built a new mobile app from the ground up. I think once the Concierge is connected to an account, to a person&#39;s user ID, it becomes much more valuable because the itinerary that the agent creates can persist over time and can be added to.&quot;

Presently, Netherwood explained, the agent can access Virgin Atlantic&#39;s flight and holiday APIs, enabling it to find and book flights and handle holiday planning. It can answer questions about the company&#39;s Flying Club loyalty program and basic support in the interest of call center deflection – discouraging calls to call centers.

Netherwood couldn&#39;t provide a breakdown of the kinds of requests being made, but said a lot of people just want basic support questions, about baggage allowances and the like, answered. For unplanned events, like airport disruptions, the agent will fall back to the website when it doesn&#39;t have relevant information.

The Concierge in its present form also stops short of completing travel transactions – it deep links to the Virgin Atlantic website to handle credit card purchases. Netherwood, however, said that will change in the mobile app.

Safety, Netherwood said, has been top of mind.

&quot;A huge part actually of this MVP [minimum viable product], a huge consideration, was safety because we&#39;re not behind a login or authentication,&quot; he said. &quot;Anybody can come to this thing and use it. So malicious behavior, prompt injection, jailbreaking, all of those things become a real big concern.&quot;

He said Tomoro has a lot of experience with guardrails and has a robust multi-stage system for making these kinds of solutions safe, so there wasn&#39;t any need to do anything particularly novel in terms of safety.

&quot;The interesting things from that perspective, I think, are actually conversational design and how easy it can be to break and absolutely destroy the illusion of intelligence in these systems,&quot; he said.

As an example, he pointed to the Concierge&#39;s off-topic guardrails, designed to keep conversations relevant to travel. Unless you&#39;ve been careful about how you design the conversational space by providing context and conversation history, he said, natural interactions like people saying &quot;thank you,&quot; or &quot;no&quot; in response to a question, may confuse the system.

&quot;In the north of England, people use the word &#39;ta&#39; to mean thank you,&quot; Netherword said. &quot;We did have a couple of occasions where somebody actually said &#39;ta&#39; to the agent and it thought they were speaking Swedish. So it replied in Swedish, &#39;hey, uh sorry, only English language for now.&#39;&quot;

Netherwood said his team did a huge amount of work trying to balance safety with making sure that the agent can handle natural conversation that changes between different intents.

As to the expense of operating the bot, Netherwood insisted that the API calls and backend infrastructure are not that costly. &quot;In the future we will be exploring reasoning models, particularly in itinerary building when those itineraries get complex and where we can afford latency in the conversation,&quot; he said. &quot;But right now [the cost] is pretty trivial.&quot;

Reasoning models typically cost more to run than their non-reasoning relatives because they process more tokens over time. But that may be necessary to help Concierge and other agents consider the requirements of complex itineraries, like distances between locations and travel times.

Netherwood said that you have to be very careful when building a complex itinerary to ensure that the agent has enough situational awareness. Otherwise, he posited, you might get a situation where you ask the agent to book a restaurant reservation and it requires a 75 minute cab ride, despite the fact that you&#39;re already booked to visit a museum 30 minutes before the reservation time.

&quot;The models are capable of [itinerary planning],&quot; he said. &quot;I think they&#39;re going to be really capable of that now that we have more effective reasoning models.&quot;

So far, Netherwood said, the launch of Concierge has gone well. &quot;We haven&#39;t had jailbreaks,&quot; he said. &quot;We haven&#39;t had all of the the nightmare things that you would not want to happen.&quot;

One of the next steps beyond improving the AI agent itself involves educating people on how to communicate in natural language with agents.

Consumers, Netherwood said, are used to interacting with chatbots that follow a programmatic tree-based structure – banking support bots that predated generative AI, for example. So they often fail to engage with agents in a way that takes advantage of their capabilities.

&quot;So for example, you can have a really nice conversation with the agent,&quot; he explained. &quot;You can say, &#39;I want to go to New York in March next year, long weekend for our anniversary. It would be fantastic if we could stay somewhere like 20 minutes walking distance from Central Park, but not too expensive in terms of the hotel. We&#39;d like to spend the money on maybe flying upper class,&#39; and [the agent] will go find you that experience. But of course that&#39;s not necessarily intuitive when people are used to going into these systems and saying, &#39;holiday now&#39; or &#39;speak to agent now.&#39;&quot;

(Sometimes, people just want to speak to another human.)

Netherwood said his team has been exploring ways to help people communicate more effectively with AI models and he believes that real-time speech eventually will prove really helpful for these sorts of interactions.

&quot;We just have to be in the place where we can make sure that the tool-calling and instruction-following accuracy is there,&quot; he said, &quot;because the last thing you want is a lovely, natural feeling conversation with an agent and then 50 percent of the time it can&#39;t go find a flight or there&#39;s there&#39;s an error.&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">The law was set to take effect next month.

The law was set to take effect next month.

A federal judge blocked a Texas law requiring mobile app stores to verify users’ ages from taking effect on January 1st.

In an order granting a preliminary injunction on the Texas App Store Accountability Act (SB 2420), Judge Robert Pitman wrote that the statute “is akin to a law that would require every bookstore to verify the age of every customer at the door and, for minors, require parental consent before the child or teen could enter and again when they try to purchase a book.” Pitman has not yet ruled on the merits of the case, but his decision to grant the preliminary injunction means he believes its defenders are unlikely to prevail in court.

The Texas App Store Accountability Act is the first among a series of similar state laws to face a legal challenge, making the ruling especially significant, as Congress considers a version of the statute. The laws, versions of which also passed in Utah and Louisiana, aim to impose age verification standards at the app store level, making companies like Apple and Google responsible for transmitting signals about users’ ages to app developers to block users from age-inappropriate experiences. While the format has been developed and championed by parent advocates, it’s gotten a boost from lobbying by Meta and other tech platforms that support the model, like Snap and X.

The Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA), whose members include Apple, Google, and Meta, sued to block the law from taking effect, saying it “imposes a broad censorship regime on the entire universe of mobile apps.” The group claims that the Texas law would impose steep burdens on teens’ ability to access speech online, requiring them and their parents to give up information in order to access various apps. A student advocacy group separately sued to block the law, arguing it unconstitutionally limits speech that kids can be exposed to. The state has maintained that the law is constitutional and should be upheld.

The state can still appeal the ruling with the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which has a history of reversing blocks on internet regulations. Attorney General Ken Paxton’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ruling and on its plans to appeal.

“[H]owever widespread the agreement that the issue must be addressed, the Court remains bound by the rule of law”

Pitman found that the highest level of scrutiny must be applied to evaluate the law under the First Amendment, which means the state must prove the law is “the least restrictive means of achieving a compelling state interest.” The judge found this is not the case, and that it wouldn’t even survive intermediate scrutiny, because Texas has so far failed to prove that its goals are connected to its methods.

Since Texas already has a law requiring age verification for porn sites, Pitman said that “only in the vast minority of applications would SB 2420 have a constitutional application to unprotected speech not addressed by other laws.” He acknowledged the importance of safeguarding kids online, he wrote, “the means to achieve that end must be consistent with the First Amendment. However compelling the policy concerns, and however widespread the agreement that the issue must be addressed, the Court remains bound by the rule of law.”

Apple has opposed Texas’ approach to app store age verification, with CEO Tim Cook reportedly going as far as calling Governor Greg Abbott to try to dissuade him from signing the law. Google has also opposed it, but has come around to a different model of app store age assurance recently passed in California, which would require less data collection.

Recently, a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee advanced two versions of app store age-gating bills that borrow aspects from the Texas and California versions. The effort to expand the proposal nationally has alarmed Apple, with Cook meeting with committee leaders the day before the markup to discuss the bills.As age verification proposals targeting app stores have moved forward in states and Congress, however, the companies that run them also seem to be responding to the growing regulatory threat with preemptive changes. Apple, for example, announced new kids safety features this year that included a way for parents to share their kids’ age ranges with app developers.

If you still haven’t picked up a holiday gift, we’ve come up with dozens of last-minute ideas that are a mere click or two away.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

And just like that, Christmas is less than two days away, which is too soon for most items bought online to arrive in time. That said, you aren’t alone if you waited too long to start buying gifts this year, and you definitely aren’t alone in feeling guilty for considering digital gifts instead of something your recipient can unwrap. But here’s the thing: digital gifts can still unlock memorable experiences, be it movies, games, or music. They also let your giftee choose exactly what they want from the store, making them both convenient and versatile.

Below, we’ve curated a list of some of the best digital goodies that folks at The Verge have used or gifted. The list is curated by interests, too, so you can find the perfect present whether your loved one is into the arts, exercise, or something else entirely. That way, you’ll at least be able to gift something more thoughtful than an Amazon or Walmart gift card — even if those are still totally viable options in our book.

Whether you’re shopping for a movie buff or an avid sports fan, there are a number of subscriptions that’ll grant your giftee access to a wide range of content. Below are some of the most popular, as well as a few catered toward anime diehards, horror lovers, and those looking for something more niche.

You can buy Disney Plus gift cards in increments of $25 up to $200. They’re usable toward Disney Plus subscriptions and bundles that include access to Disney Plus and Hulu, which start at $12.99 a month. That way, the family can stream everything from Andor and Percy Jackson to The Bear and Alien Earth.

If you’re not sure which type of games your giftee prefers, you can gift them an Xbox, PlayStation, or Nintendo subscription. Not only will these memberships grant them access to free digital games, but they also include perks such as online multiplayer and cloud saves, among other incentives.

Giving the gift of Game Pass unlocks hundreds of great games to play, whether your recipient is a console or PC gamer. If you’re gaming on an Xbox, it also allows for online multiplayer.

Is your giftee in dire need of a screen break? Fortunately, the internet is filled with travel-oriented gifts, ranging from the obvious — like airline gift cards — to national park passes.

The America the Beautiful pass grants entry to all 63 national parks, from the Grand Canyon to Yosemite, along with over 2,000 recreation sites across the country.

For health and wellness enthusiasts, many services offer a wealth of streamable fitness classes to help them get fit at home. Other gifts can help your giftee practice self-care and lighten their load with meditation or massage. Below, we’ve listed out a range of options that’ll help your recipient take care of both their body and mind.

Peloton’s monthly subscription offers thousands of streamable fitness classes revolving around a variety of different workouts, ranging from strength training to stretching. It’s a service that’s available to everybody, so you don’t need to own a Peloton device to use it.

Whether they’re a diehard foodie, a wine connoisseur, or a caffeine addict, the internet is filled with subscriptions and gift cards for all types. Below are just a few of our favorites.

With a subscription to Eater’s Wine Club, your giftee will automatically receive either two or four bottles of wine carefully chosen by an Eater expert every month. Past boxes have showcased wines from all over the world.

Whether your giftee is a musician or just loves to unwind with music, there are plenty of digital gifts catered toward their interests. We all know about Spotify gift cards (Amazon, Best Buy, Target), but there are also other streaming services that you can gift as a subscription, some of which we’ve highlighted below.

Apple Music is a great gift for casual listeners, offering more than 100 million ad-free songs alongside support for spatial audio and Dolby Atmos. There’s no designated gift card for Apple Music, so you’ll have to buy a regular Apple gift card, but that’s not a bad thing, as it means they can also use the card to buy the latest set of AirPods.

Obviously, you could just gift a bibliophile a book, and they’d probably be happy. But what if you don’t know what your giftee is into or simply want to give them more options? In that case, a gift card to their favorite bookstore or a subscription to something like Kindle Unlimited — which grants members access to millions of ebooks and select audiobooks — is a good idea. That said, we’ve rounded up some of our favorite alternatives below.

An Audible Premium Plus subscription grants instant access to thousands of audiobooks and podcasts, as well as one premium audiobook a month.

Movie buffs and bibliophiles are easy to shop for, but what do you get the creative type? It’s actually not that hard — just buy them something to help them create, whether that’s an online course or access to a new tool. Below are a few subscriptions and gift cards that creators will love, all of which you can buy at the last minute.

A subscription to Skillshare grants subscribers access to over 34,000 online classes related to graphic design, painting, photography, film, music, coding, and more.

Meanwhile, it briefly took down a photo with Trump out of an ‘abundance of caution’ for redacting victims’ details.

The Justice Department has blamed its delayed release of some so-called Epstein files on needing more time to redact sensitive information, like details identifying the victims of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. But at least some of the redactions so far released appear to mistakenly disclose information meant to be obscured from the public.

A 2022 complaint filed by the US Virgin Islands seeking damages from Epstein’s estate was posted to the “Epstein Library” on the DOJ website with several redactions throughout, Techdirt founder Mike Masnick, among others, shared on platforms like Bluesky. But simply copying and pasting many of the redactions into a new document reveals what’s beneath the black boxes. This method uncovers details like that one of the co-executors allegedly signed over $400,000 in checks from Epstein’s foundation “payable to young female models and actresses, including a former Russian model.” It also reveals that a co-executor had allegedly signed a foundation check with the former model’s last name in the memo line to an immigration lawyer “who was involved in one or more forced marriages arranged among Epstein’s victims to secure a victim’s immigration status.” It also uncovers details about one alleged victim in the complaint.

At least one outlet, Drop Site News, was also apparently able to guess the URL of files not yet on the website by extrapolating the format. Wired later found the link appeared to be broken.

The DOJ did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Verge about the incidents.

The DOJ removed a photo from the files showing images of President Donald Trump among other framed photos of prominent figures including the Pope and former President Bill Clinton, before restoring it Saturday after backlash. The agency said on X it had “temporarily removed” it for review after the Southern District of New York flagged it “for potential further action to protect victims.” The DOJ said it restored the image without alteration after determining there was no evidence of victims in the photo.

﻿Streaming apps keep bookmarked movies and shows in silos. It’s time to open the floodgates.

This is Lowpass by Janko Roettgers, a newsletter on the ever-evolving intersection of tech and entertainment, syndicated just for The Verge subscribers once a week. Lowpass is taking a winter break and will be back on January 8, 2026.

All I want for Christmas is to find that darn movie I’ve been meaning to watch. What was it called again? I could have sworn I bookmarked it somewhere…

If your household is anything like mine, you might frequently run into the same issue: There’s too much to watch out there, and keeping track of all the things you want to stream one day has become a nightmare. It’s not that there aren’t any tools for this. There are! And plenty of them! And they’re all easy to use! Which is kind of the problem.

Here’s what usually happens: I may be browsing Netflix, logged into my profile, and bookmark a movie I want to check out in the future. Then, my wife takes over the remote, spends a bit of time clicking through Hulu, and adds a show she wants us to binge to the watch list associated with her profile. Or so we think — until we try to find it again and eventually discover that she was actually logged into our daughter’s profile and inadvertently added the show to her watch list.

Then, the next day, we turn on the TV and see something fun on the homescreen. One quick button press, and it’s added to the watch list. Except, Google maintains this one, and it’s completely separate from all the other lists. Our family probably has about a dozen different watch lists. We don’t use them all actively, at least not when we’re in the mood to actually find something. But you can bet that there’s some really fun movie on our dog’s Tubi watch list (that my kids made), desperately waiting for us to finally remember where we bookmarked it.

There are apps that are trying to solve this very issue. Plex, for instance, has a pretty decent universal catalog of titles available across all the major streaming services and a watch list to remember your favorites. The app also does a good job deep-linking into third-party services, so you can jump directly to that Netflix show or movie rental on Amazon with one click. At least that’s true on mobile. On smart TVs, those deep links can be hit or miss, depending on the platform your TV is running. (Sorry, Roku users! You’re out of luck.)

The problem is that a universal watch list like this does require a lot more work on your part. When you browse Netflix at 11PM and stumble across something that looks interesting, you have to get your phone out, open the Plex app, search for that same title, and add it to the list. And when you finally get around to watch it, you’ll have to do the same thing all over again to remove the title from Plex’s list. That’s a lot of work for a little late-night TV.

The sad truth is that watch lists, as well-intended as they were, are broken. Here’s how streaming services and smart TV platforms could fix them: Instead of keeping all watch-list data in a silo, these services should enable consumers to opt into sharing it between services. That way, if I bookmark a movie on Netflix, the Netflix app shares that information with my Plex watch list. Once I watch it, it disappears from both lists again. And when my wife adds a Hulu show to our Google TV watch list, it immediately populates in our Hulu watch list as well.

Ideally, I’d want to have a bunch of different ways to enter this kind of data and just as many ways to consume it. Maybe I’d keep one master list maintained by Plex, Google, or another company. But I’d also want to be able to keep smashing that bookmark button in whatever streaming app I’m in and have all my lists across all providers update in real time. Granted, Netflix may never list titles that are only available on Hulu. But these days, shows regularly move from one service to another. What if Netflix internally made a note of shows I bookmarked on HBO Max and then added them to my Netflix watch list when those HBO shows eventually found their way to its service?

Once you have enough data flowing back and forth between streaming apps and watch lists, you may also be less dependent on profiles, which were always an imperfect solution. Sure, my wife and I may like different things on occasion. But most of the time, we watch TV together. So why not automatically sort our bookmarked shows and movies by genre, mood, and age rating, instead of siloing them in watch lists associated with individual profiles?

Federating watch lists, and liberating movie and TV show bookmarks from those silos, could also allow for a whole range of neat new use cases that simply aren’t possible today. What if, for instance, Spotify automatically generated playlists of the soundtracks of movies and shows you recently watched, based on the data of titles disappearing from your watch list? (Hat tip to J Herskowitz for this one.)

Unfortunately, streaming services are incredibly protective of their data. Companies like Netflix want you to spend all your time within their app and not with a third-party aggregator that might recommend titles from Hulu’s catalog based on your Netflix viewing history. In fact, Netflix is so protective of its in-app experience, and its own watch list, that it doesn’t allow Google TV users to add Netflix titles to their smart TV’s universal watch list. And none of the major streaming services, with Plex being the one notable exception, offers an RSS feed of your watch list.

But this time of the year, I can’t help but hope for miracles. Perhaps, there’s a streaming executive out there right now, still looking for a New Year’s resolution. Here’s a great one: Open the floodgates. Free the data. Let people remix it, build interesting hacks. Ingest as much data as possible from other services, and use it to help everyone find the perfect movie or show without having to scour a thousand lists.

Until that happens, I might just crack open a book. Now, if I could only remember what I wanted to read next…

            <p><strong>The Verge | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/849293/ai-alliance-universities-colleges-funding-ad-campaign-against-raise-act">Visit Original Website</a>

            <div id="article-text">A group including Big Tech players and major universities fought against the RAISE Act, which got a last-minute rewrite.

A group including Big Tech players and major universities fought against the RAISE Act, which got a last-minute rewrite.

A group of tech companies and academic institutions spent tens of thousands of dollars in the past month — likely between $17,000 and $25,000 — on an ad campaign against New York’s landmark AI safety bill, which may have reached more than two million people, according to Meta’s Ad Library.

The landmark bill is called the RAISE Act, or the Responsible AI Safety and Education Act, and days ago, a version of it was signed by New York Governor Kathy Hochul. The closely watched law dictates that AI companies developing large models — OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Google, DeepSeek, etc. — must outline safety plans and transparency rules for reporting large-scale safety incidents to the attorney general. But the version Hochul signed — different than the one passed in both the New York State Senate and the Assembly in June — was a rewrite that made it much more favorable to tech companies. A group of more than 150 parents had sent the governor a letter urging her to sign the bill without changes. And the group of tech companies and academic institutions, called the AI Alliance, were part of the charge to defang it.

The AI Alliance — the organization behind the opposition ad campaign — counts Meta, IBM, Intel, Oracle, Snowflake, Uber, AMD, Databricks, and Hugging Face among its members, which is not necessarily surprising. The group sent a letter in June to New York lawmakers about its “deep concern” about the bill and deemed it “unworkable.” But the group isn’t just made up of tech companies. Its members include a number of colleges and universities all around the world, including New York University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Carnegie Mellon University, Northeastern University, Louisiana State University, and the University of Notre Dame, as well as Penn Engineering and Yale Engineering.

The ads began on November 23 and ran with the title, “The RAISE Act will stifle job growth.” They said that the legislation “would slow down the New York technology ecosystem powering 400,000 high-tech jobs and major investments. Rather than stifling innovation, let’s champion a future where AI development is open, trustworthy, and strengthens the Empire State.”

When The Verge asked the academic institutions listed above whether they were aware they had been inadvertently part of an ad campaign against widely discussed AI safety legislation, none responded to a request for comment, besides Northeastern, which did not provide a comment by publication time. In recent years, OpenAI and its competitors have increasingly been courting academic institutions to be part of research consortiums or offering technology directly to students for free.

Many of the academic institutions that are part of the AI Alliance aren’t directly involved in one-on-one partnerships with AI companies, but some are. For instance, Northeastern’s partnership with Anthropic this year translated to Claude access for 50,000 students, faculty, and staff across 13 global campuses, per Anthropic’s announcement in April. In 2023, OpenAI funded a journalism ethics initiative at NYU. Dartmouth announced a partnership with Anthropic earlier this month, a Carnegie Mellon University professor currently serves on OpenAI’s board, and Anthropic has funded programs at Carnegie Mellon.

The initial version of the RAISE Act stated that developers must not release a frontier model “if doing so would create an unreasonable risk of critical harm,” which the bill defines as the death or serious injury of 100 people or more, or $1 billion or more in damages to rights in money or property stemming from the creation of a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapon. That definition also extends to an AI model that “acts with no meaningful human intervention” and “would, if committed by a human,” fall under certain crimes. The version Hochul signed removed this clause. Hochul also increased the deadline for disclosure for safety incidents and lessened fines, among other changes.

The AI Alliance has lobbied previously against AI safety policies, including the RAISE Act, California’s SB 1047, and President Biden’s AI executive order. It states that its mission is to “bring together builders and experts from various fields to collaboratively and transparently address the challenges of generative AI and democratize its benefits,” especially via “member-driven working groups.” Some of the group’s projects beyond lobbying have involved cataloguing and managing “trustworthy” datasets and creating a ranked list of AI safety priorities.

The AI Alliance wasn’t the only organization opposing the RAISE Act with ad dollars. As The Verge wrote recently, Leading the Future, a pro-AI super PAC backed by Perplexity AI, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Palantir cofounder Joe Lonsdale, and OpenAI president Greg Brockman, has spent money on ads targeting the cosponsor of the RAISE Act, New York State Assemblymember Alex Bores. But Leading the Future is a super PAC with a clear agenda, whereas the AI Alliance is a nonprofit that’s partnered with a trade association — with the mission of “developing AI collaboratively, transparently, and with a focus on safety, ethics, and the greater good.”

Anyone with links to the livestreams could view them — no credentials required, as reported by 404 Media.

The livestreams connected to more than 60 of Flock’s AI-powered surveillance cameras were left available to view on the web, allowing someone to see live feeds of each location without needing a username or password, according to findings from tech YouTuber Benn Jordan and 404 Media.

Flock is a technology company that works with thousands of law enforcement agencies and businesses to deploy a network of AI-powered cameras across the country. It also recently partnered with Ring, giving Flock customers the ability to request footage from users in Ring’s Neighbors app. As noted by 404 Media, many of Flock’s cameras are made to scan a vehicle’s license plates. However, the feeds exposed to the internet connect to Flock’s Condor cameras, which can pan, tilt, and zoom to automatically track people and vehicles.

“I watched a man leave his house in the morning in New York,” Jordan says in his video. “I watched a woman jogging alone on a forest trail in Georgia. This trail had multiple cameras, and I could watch a man rollerblade and then take a break to watch rollerblading videos on his phone. How? Because the camera’s AI automatically zoomed in on it — just like it zoomed in on a couple arguing at a street market in Atlanta.”

Jordan worked with Jon “GainSec” Gaines — who previously uncovered security flaws within Flock’s system — to find the live feeds on Shodan, a search engine containing a database of devices connected to the internet.

As reported by 404 Media, the two located dozens of Flock live feeds and administrator control panels, where they could not only view the streams but also freely download video archives from the last 30 days, change settings, delete footage, view log files, and run diagnostics, as reported by 404 Media and Jordan. Anyone with links to the stream could access them, no credentials required, according to 404 Media.

In some cases, Jordan and 404 Media’s Jason Koebler visited the locations of the Flock cameras, where they were filmed and displayed on the openly accessible livestreams.

“This was a limited misconfiguration on a very small number of devices, and it has since been remedied,” a Flock spokesperson said in a statement to 404 Media. Flock didn’t immediately respond to The Verge’s request for comment.

            <h2>Researchers are getting organoids pregnant with human embryos</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/23/1130415/organoid-uterus-microfluidic-chip-embryo/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At first glance, it looks like the start of a human pregnancy: A ball-shaped embryo presses gently into the receptive lining of the uterus and then grips tight, burrowing in as the first tendrils of a future placenta appear.

This is implantation—the moment that pregnancy officially begins.

Only none of it is happening inside a body. These images were captured in a Beijing laboratory, inside a microfluidic chip, as scientists watched the scene unfold.

In three papers published this week by Cell Press, scientists are reporting what they call the most accurate efforts yet to mimic the first moments of pregnancy in the lab. They’ve taken human embryos from IVF centers and let these merge with “organoids” made of endometrial cells, which form the lining of the uterus.

The reports—two from China and a third involving a collaboration among researchers in the United Kingdom, Spain, and the US—show how scientists are using engineered tissues to better understand early pregnancy and potentially improve IVF outcomes.

“You have an embryo and the endometrial organoid together,” says Jun Wu, a biologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, in Dallas, who contributed to both Chinese reports. “That’s the overarching message of all three papers.”

According to the papers, these 3D combinations are the most complete re-creations of the first days of pregnancy yet and should be useful for studying why IVF treatments often fail.

In each case, the experiments were stopped when the embryos were two weeks old, if not sooner. That is due to legal and ethical rules that typically restrict scientists from going any further than 14 days.

In your basic IVF procedure, an egg is fertilized in the lab and allowed to develop into a spherical embryo called a blastocyst—a process that takes a few days. That blastocyst then gets put into a patient’s uterus in the hope it will establish itself there and ultimately become a baby.

But that’s a common failure point. Many patients will learn that their IVF procedure didn’t work because an embryo never attached.

In the new reports, it’s that initial bond between mother and embryo that is being reproduced in the lab. “IVF means in vitro fertilization, but now this is the stage of in vitro implantation,” says Matteo Molè, a biologist at Stanford University whose results with collaborators in Europe are among those published today. “Considering that implantation is a barrier [to pregnancy], we have the potential to increase the success rate if we can model it in the laboratory.”

Normally implantation is entirely hidden from view because it occurs in someone’s uterus, says Hongmei Wang, a developmental biologist at the Beijing Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, who co-led the effort there. Wang often studies monkeys because she can interrupt their pregnancies to collect the tissues she needs to see. “We’ve always hoped to understand human embryo implantation, but we have lacked a way to do so,” she says. “It’s all happening in the uterus.”

In the Beijing study, researchers tested about 50 donated IVF embryos, but they also ran a thousand more experiments using so-called “blastoids.” The latter are mimics of early-stage human embryos manufactured from stem cells. Blastoids are easy to make in large numbers and, since they aren’t true embryos, don’t have as many ethical rules on their use.

“The question was, if we have these blastoids, what can we use them for?” says Leqian Yu, the senior author of the report from the Beijing Institute. “The obvious next step was implantation. So how do you do that?”

For the Beijing team, the answer was to build a soft silicone chamber with tiny channels to add nutrients and a space to grow the uterine organoid. After that, blastoids—or real embryos—could be introduced through a window in the device, so the “pregnancy” could start.

“The key question we want to try to answer is what is the first cross-talk between embryo and mother,” says Yu. “I think this is maybe the first time we can see the entire process.”

This isn’t the first time researchers have tried using organoids for this kind of research. At least two startup companies have raised funds to commercialize similar systems—in some cases presenting the organoids as a tool to predict IVF success. In addition to Dawn Bio, a startup based in Vienna, there is Simbryo Technologies, in Houston, which last month said it would begin offering “personalized” predictions for IVF patients using blastoids and endometrial organoids.

To do that test, doctors will take a biopsy of a patient’s uterine lining and grow organoids from it. After that, blastoids will be added to the organoids to gauge whether a woman is likely to be able to support a pregnancy or not. If the blastoids don’t start to implant, it could mean the patient’s uterus isn’t receptive and is the reason IVF isn’t working.

The Beijing team thinks the pregnancy organoids could also be used to identify drugs that might help those patients. In their paper, they describe how they made organoids out of tissue taken from women who’ve had repeated IVF failures. Then they tested 1,119 approved drugs on those samples to see if anything improved.

Several seemed to have helpful effects. One chemical, avobenzone, an ingredient in some types of sunblock, increased the chance that a blastoid would start implanting from just 5% of the time to around 25% of the time. Yu says his center hopes to eventually start a clinical trial if they can find the right drug to try.

The Beijing group is working on ways to improve the organoid system so that it’s even more realistic. Right now, it lacks important cell types, including immune cells and a blood supply. Yu says a next step he’s working on is to add blood vessels and tiny pumps to his chip device, so that he can give the organoids a kind of rudimentary circulation.

That means, in the near future, blastoids or embryos could likely be grown longer, raising questions about how far scientists will be able to take pregnancy in the lab. “I think this technology does raise the possibility of growing things longer,” says Wu, who says some view the research as an initial step toward creating babies entirely outside the body.

However, Wu says incubating a human to term in the laboratory remains impossible, for the time being. “This technology is certainly related to ectogenesis, or development outside the body,” he says. “But I don’t think it’s anywhere near an artificial womb. That’s still science fiction.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, summed it up in three words: “This is embarrassing.”

Hassabis was replying on X to an overexcited post by Sébastien Bubeck, a research scientist at the rival firm OpenAI, announcing that two mathematicians had used OpenAI’s latest large language model, GPT-5, to find solutions to 10 unsolved problems in mathematics. “Science acceleration via AI has officially begun,” Bubeck crowed.

Put your math hats on for a minute, and let’s take a look at what this beef from mid-October was about. It’s a perfect example of what’s wrong with AI right now.

Bubeck was excited that GPT-5 seemed to have somehow solved a number of puzzles known as Erdős problems.

Paul Erdős, one of the most prolific mathematicians of the 20th century, left behind hundreds of puzzles when he died. To help keep track of which ones have been solved, Thomas Bloom, a mathematician at the University of Manchester, UK, set up erdosproblems.com, which lists more than 1,100 problems and notes that around 430 of them come with solutions.

When Bubeck celebrated GPT-5’s breakthrough, Bloom was quick to call him out. “This is a dramatic misrepresentation,” he wrote on X. Bloom explained that a problem isn’t necessarily unsolved if this website does not list a solution. That simply means Bloom wasn’t aware of one. There are millions of mathematics papers out there, and nobody has read all of them. But GPT-5 probably has.

It turned out that instead of coming up with new solutions to 10 unsolved problems, GPT-5 had scoured the internet for 10 existing solutions that Bloom hadn’t seen before. Oops!

There are two takeaways here. One is that breathless claims about big breakthroughs shouldn’t be made via social media: Less knee jerk and more gut check.

The second is that GPT-5’s ability to find references to previous work that Bloom wasn’t aware of is also amazing. The hype overshadowed something that should have been pretty cool in itself.

Mathematicians are very interested in using LLMs to trawl through vast numbers of existing results, François Charton, a research scientist who studies the application of LLMs to mathematics at the AI startup Axiom Math, told me when I talked to him about this Erdős gotcha.

But literature search is dull compared with genuine discovery, especially to AI’s fervent boosters on social media. Bubeck’s blunder isn’t the only example.

In August, a pair of mathematicians showed that no LLM at the time was able to solve a math puzzle known as Yu Tsumura’s 554th Problem. Two months later, social media erupted with evidence that GPT-5 now could. “Lee Sedol moment is coming for many,” one observer commented, referring to the Go master who lost to DeepMind’s AI AlphaGo in 2016.

But Charton pointed out that solving Yu Tsumura’s 554th Problem isn’t a big deal to mathematicians. “It’s a question you would give an undergrad,” he said. “There is this tendency to overdo everything.”

Meanwhile, more sober assessments of what LLMs may or may not be good at are coming in. At the same time that mathematicians were fighting on the internet about GPT-5, two new studies came out that looked in depth at the use of LLMs in medicine and law (two fields that model makers have claimed their tech excels at).

Researchers found that LLMs could make certain medical diagnoses, but they were flawed at recommending treatments. When it comes to law, researchers found that LLMs often give inconsistent and incorrect advice. “Evidence thus far spectacularly fails to meet the burden of proof,” the authors concluded.

But that’s not the kind of message that goes down well on X. “You’ve got that excitement because everybody is communicating like crazy—nobody wants to be left behind,” Charton said. X is where a lot of AI news drops first, it’s where new results are trumpeted, and it’s where key players like Sam Altman, Yann LeCun, and Gary Marcus slug it out in public. It’s hard to keep up—and harder to look away.

Bubeck’s post was only embarrassing because his mistake was caught. Not all errors are. Unless something changes researchers, investors, and non-specific boosters will keep teeing each other up. “Some of them are scientists, many are not, but they are all nerds,” Charton told me. “Huge claims work very well on these networks.”

There’s a coda! I wrote everything you’ve just read above for the Algorithm column in the January/February 2026 issue of MIT Technology Review magazine (out very soon). Two days after that went to press, Axiom told me its own math model, AxiomProver, had solved two open Erdős problems (#124 and #481, for the math fans in the room). That’s impressive stuff for a small startup founded just a few months ago. Yup—AI moves fast!

But that’s not all. Five days later the company announced that AxiomProver had solved nine out of 12 problems in this year’s Putnam competition, a college-level math challenge that some people consider harder than the better-known International Math Olympiad (which LLMs from both Google DeepMind and OpenAI aced a few months back).

The Putnam result was lauded on X by big names in the field, including Jeff Dean, chief scientist at Google DeepMind, and Thomas Wolf, cofounder at the AI firm Hugging Face. Once again familiar debates played out in the replies. A few researchers pointed out that while the International Math Olympiad demands more creative problem-solving, the Putnam competition tests math knowledge—which makes it notoriously hard for undergrads, but easier, in theory, for LLMs that have ingested the internet.

How should we judge Axiom’s achievements? Not on social media, at least. And the eye-catching competition wins are just a starting point. Determining just how good LLMs are at math will require a deeper dive into exactly what these models are doing when they solve hard (read: hard for humans) math problems.

            <h2>How I learned to stop worrying and love AI slop</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/23/1130396/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-ai-slop/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Lately, everywhere I scroll, I keep seeing the same fish-eyed CCTV view: a grainy wide shot from the corner of a living room, a driveway at night, an empty grocery store. Then something impossible happens. JD Vance shows up at the doorstep in a crazy outfit. A car folds into itself like paper and drives away. A cat comes in and starts hanging out with capybaras and bears, as if in some weird modern fairy tale.

This fake-surveillance look has become one of the signature flavors of what people now call AI slop. For those of us who spend time online watching short videos, slop feels inescapable: a flood of repetitive, often nonsensical AI-generated clips that washes across TikTok, Instagram, and beyond. For that, you can thank new tools like OpenAI’s Sora (which exploded in popularity after launching in app form in September), Google’s Veo series, and AI models built by Runway. Now anyone can make videos, with just a few taps on a screen.

If I were to locate the moment slop broke through into popular consciousness, I’d pick the video of rabbits bouncing on a trampoline that went viral this summer. For many savvy internet users, myself included, it was the first time we were fooled by an AI video, and it ended up spawning a wave of almost identical riffs, with people making videos of all kinds of animals and objects bouncing on the same trampoline.

My first reaction was that, broadly speaking, all of this sucked. That’s become a familiar refrain, in think pieces and at dinner parties. Everything online is slop now—the internet “enshittified,” with AI taking much of the blame. Initially, I largely agreed, quickly scrolling past every AI video in a futile attempt to send a message to my algorithm. But then friends started sharing AI clips in group chats that were compellingly weird, or funny. Some even had a grain of brilliance buried in the nonsense. I had to admit I didn’t fully understand what I was rejecting—what I found so objectionable.

To try to get to the bottom of how I felt (and why), I recently spoke to the people making the videos, a company creating bespoke tools for creators, and experts who study how new media becomes culture. What I found convinced me that maybe generative AI will not end up ruining everything. Maybe we have been too quick to dismiss AI slop. Maybe there’s a case for looking beyond the surface and seeing a new kind of creativity—one we’re watching take shape in real time, with many of us actually playing a part.

“AI slop” can and does refer to text, audio, or images. But what’s really broken through this year is the flood of quick AI-generated video clips on social platforms, each produced by a short written prompt fed into an AI model. Under the hood, these models are trained on enormous data sets so they can predict what every subsequent frame should look or sound like. It’s much like the process by which text models produce answers in a chat, but slower and far more power-hungry.

Early text-to-video systems, released around 2022 to 2023, could manage only a few seconds of blurry motion; objects warped in and out of existence, characters teleported around, and the giveaway that it was AI was usually a mangled hand or a melting face. In the past two years, newer models like Sora2, Veo 3.1, and Runway’s latest Gen-4.5 have dramatically improved, creating realistic, seamless, and increasingly true-to-prompt videos that can last up to a minute. Some of these models even generate sound and video together, including ambient noise and rough dialogue.

These text-to-video models have often been pitched by AI companies as the future of cinema—tools for filmmakers, studios, and professional storytellers. The demos have leaned into widescreen shots and dramatic camera moves. OpenAI pitched Sora as a “world simulator” while courting Hollywood filmmakers with what it boasted were movie-quality shorts. Google introduced Veo 3 last year as a step toward storyboards and longer scenes, edging directly into film workflows.

All this hinged on the idea that people wanted to make AI-generated videos that looked real. But the reality of how they’re being used is more modest, weirder—and arguably much more interesting. What has turned out to be the home turf for AI video is the six-inch screen in our hands.

Anyone can and does use these tools: a report by Adobe released in October shows that 86% of creators are using generative AI. But so are average social media users—people who aren’t “creators” so much as just people with phones.

That’s how you end up with clips showing things like Indian prime minister Narendra Modi dancing with Gandhi, a crystal that melts into butter the moment a knife touches it, or Game of Thrones reimagined as Henan opera—videos that are hypnotic, occasionally funny, and often deeply stupid. And while micro-trends didn’t start with AI—TikTok and Reels already ran on fast-moving formats—it feels as if AI poured fuel on that fire. Perhaps because the barrier to copying an idea becomes so low, a viral video like the bunnies on trampoline can easily and quickly spawn endless variations on the same concept. You don’t need a costume or a filming location anymore; you just tweak the prompt, hit Generate, and share.

Big tech companies have also jumped on the idea of AI videos as a new social medium. The Sora app allows users to insert AI versions of themselves and other users into scenes. Meta’s Vibes app wants to turn your entire feed into nonstop AI clips.

Of course, the same frictionless setup that allows for harmless, delightful creations also makes it easy to generate much darker slop. Sora has already been used to create so many racist deepfakes of Martin Luther King Jr. that the King estate pushed the company to block new MLK videos entirely. TikTok and X are seeing Sora-watermarked clips of women and girls being strangled circulating in bulk, posted by accounts seemingly dedicated to this one theme. And then there’s “nazislop,” the nickname for AI videos that repackage fascist aesthetics and memes into glossy, algorithm-ready content aimed at teens’ For You pages.

But the prevalence of bad actors hasn’t stopped short AI videos from flourishing as a form. New apps, Discord servers for AI creators, and tutorial channels keep multiplying. And increasingly, the energy in the community seems to be shifting away from trying to create stuff that “passes as real” toward embracing AI’s inherent weirdness. Every day, I stumble across creators who are stretching what “AI slop” is supposed to look like. I decided to talk to some of them.

Like those fake surveillance videos, many popular viral AI videos rely on a surreal, otherworldly quality. As Wenhui Lim, an architecture designer turned full-time AI artist, tells me, “There is definitely a competition of ‘How weird we can push this?’ among AI video creators.”

It’s the kind of thing AI video tools seem to handle with ease: pushing physics past what a normal body can do or a normal camera can capture. This makes AI a surprisingly natural fit for satire, comedy skits, parody, and experimental video art—especially examples involving absurdism or even horror. Several popular AI creators that I spoke with eagerly tap into this capability.

Drake Garibay, a 39-year-old software developer from Redlands, California, was inspired by body-horror AI clips circulating on social media in early 2025. He started playing with ComfyUI, a generative media tool, and ended up spending hours each week making his own strange creations. His favorite subject is morbid human-animal hybrids. “I fell right into it,” he says. “I’ve always been pretty artistic, [but] when I saw what AI video tools can do, I was blown away.”

Since the start of this year, Garibay has been posting his experiments online. One that went viral on TikTok, captioned “Cooking up some fresh AI slop,” shows a group of people pouring gooey dough into a pot. The mixture suddenly sprouts a human face, which then emerges from the boiling pot with a head and body. It has racked up more than 8.3 million views.

AI video technology is evolving so quickly that even for creative professionals, there is a lot to experiment with. Daryl Anselmo, a creative director turned digital artist, has been experimenting with the technology since its early days, posting an AI-generated video every day since 2021. He tells me that uses a wide range of tools, including Kling, Luma, and Midjourney, and is constantly iterating. To him, testing the boundaries of these AI tools is sometimes itself the reward. “I would like to think there are impossible things that you could not do before that are still yet to be discovered. That is exciting to me,” he says.

Anselmo has collected his daily creations over the past four years into an art project, titled AI Slop, that has been exhibited in multiple galleries, including the Grand Palais Immersif in Paris. There’s obvious attention to mood and composition. Some clips feel like something closer to an art-house vignette than a throwaway meme. Over time, Anselmo’s project has taken a darker turn as his subjects shift from landscapes and interior design toward more of the body horror that drew Garibay in.

His breakout piece, feel the agi, shows a hyperrealistic bot peeling open its own skull. Another video he shared recently features a midnight diner populated by anthropomorphized Tater Tots, titled Tot and Bothered; with its vintage palette and slow, mystical soundtrack, the piece feels like a late-night fever dream.

One further benefit of these AI systems is that they make it easier for creators to build recurring spaces and casts of characters that function like informal franchises. Lim, for instance, is the creator of a popular AI video account called Niceaunties, inspired by the “auntie culture” in Singapore, where she’s from.

“The word ‘aunties’ often has a slightly negative connotation in Singaporean culture. They are portrayed as old-fashioned, naggy, and lacking boundaries. But they are also so resourceful, funny, and at ease with themselves,” she says. “I want to create a world where it’s different for them.”

Her cheeky, playful videos show elderly Asian women merging with fruits, other objects, and architecture, or just living their best lives in a fantasy world. A viral video called Auntlantis, which has racked up 13.5 million views on Instagram, imagines silver-haired aunties as industrial mermaids working in an underwater trash-processing plant.

There’s also Granny Spills, an AI video account that features a glamorous, sassy old lady spitting hot takes and life advice to a street interviewer. It gained 1.8 million Instagram followers within three months of launch, posting new videos almost every day. Although the granny’s face looks slightly different in every video, the pink color scheme and her outfit stay mostly consistent. Creators Eric Suerez and Adam Vaserstein tell me that their entire workflow is powered by AI, from writing the script to constructing the scenes. Their role, as a result, becomes close to creative directing.

These projects often spin off merch, miniseries, and branded universes. The creators of Granny Spills, for example, have expanded their network, creating a Black granny as well as an Asian granny to cater to different audiences. The grannies now appear in crossover videos, as if they share the same fictional universe, pushing traffic between channels.

In the same vein, it’s now more possible than ever to participate in an online trend. Consider  “Italian brainrot,” which went viral earlier this year. Beloved by Gen Z and Gen Alpha, these videos feature human–animal–object hybrids with pseudo-Italian names like “Bombardiro Crocodilo” and “Tralalero Tralala.” According to Know Your Meme, the craze began with a few viral TikTok sounds in fake Italian. Soon, a lot of people were participating in what felt like a massive collaborative hallucination, inventing characters, backstories, and worldviews for an ever-expanding absurdist universe.

“Italian brainrot was great when it first hit,” says Denim Mazuki, a software developer and content creator who has been following the trend. “It was the collective lore-building that made it wonderful. Everyone added a piece. The characters were not owned by a studio or a single creator—they were made by the chronically online users.”

This trend and others are further enabled by specialized and sophisticated new tools—like OpenArt, a platform designed not just for video generation but for video storytelling, which gives users frame-to-frame control over a developing narrative.

Making a video on OpenArt is straightforward: Users start with a few AI-generated character images and a line of text as simple as “cat dancing in a park.” The platform then spins out a scene breakdown that users can tweak act by act, and they can run it through multiple mainstream models and compare the results to see which look best.

OpenArt cofounders Coco Mao and Chloe Fang tell me they sponsored tutorial videos and created quick-start templates to capitalize specifically on the trend of regular people wanting to get in on Italian brainrot. They say more than 80% of their users have no artistic background.

The current use of the word “slop” online traces back to the early 2010s on 4chan, a forum known for its insular and often toxic in-jokes. As the term has spread, its meaning has evolved; it’s now a kind of derogatory slur for anything that feels like low-quality mass production aimed at an unsuspecting public, says Adam Aleksic, an internet linguist. People now slap it onto everything from salad bowls to meaningless work reports.

But even with that broadened usage, AI remains the first association: “slop” has become a convenient shorthand for dismissing almost any AI-generated output, regardless of its actual quality. The Cambridge Dictionary’s new sense of “slop” will almost certainly cement this perception, describing it as “content on the internet that is of very low quality, especially when it is created by AI.”

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the word has become a charged label among AI creators.

Anselmo embraces it semi-ironically, hence the title of his yearslong art project. “I see this series as an experimental sketchbook,” he says. “I am working with the slop, pushing the models, breaking them, and developing a new visual language. I have no shame that I am deep into AI.” Anselmo says that he does not concern himself with whether his work is “art.”

Garibay, the creator of the viral video where a human face emerged from a pot of physical slop, uses the label playfully. “The AI slop art is really just a lot of weird glitchy stuff that happens, and there’s not really a lot of depth usually behind it, besides the shock value,” he says. “But you will find out really fast that there is a heck of a lot more involved, if you want a higher-end result.”

That’s largely in line with what Suerez and Vaserstein, the creators of Granny Spills, tell me. They actually hate it when their work is called slop, given the way the term is often used to dismiss AI-generated content out of hand. It feels disrespectful of their creative input, they say. Even though they do not write the scripts or paint the frames, they say they are making legitimate artistic choices.

Indeed, for most of the creators I spoke to, making AI content is rarely a one-click process. They tell me that it takes skill, trial and error, and a strong sense of taste to consistently get the visuals they want. Lim says a single one-minute video can take hours, sometimes even days, to make. Anselmo, for his part, takes pride in actively pushing the model rather than passively accepting its output. “There’s just so many things that you can do with it that go well beyond ‘Oh, way to go, you typed in a prompt,’” he says. Ultimately, slop evokes a lot of feelings. Aleksic puts it well: “There&#39;s a feeling of guilt on the user end for enjoying something that you know to be lowbrow. There&#39;s a feeling of anger toward the creator for making something that is not up to your content expectations, and all the meantime, there&#39;s a pervasive algorithmic anxiety hanging over us. We know that the algorithm and the platforms are to blame for the distribution of this slop.”

And that anxiety long predates generative AI. We’ve been living for years with the low-grade dread of being nudged, of having our taste engineered and our attention herded, so it’s not surprising that the anger latches onto the newest, most visible culprit. Sometimes it is misplaced, sure, but I also get the urge to assert human agency against a new force that seems to push all of us away from what we know and toward something we didn’t exactly choose.

But the negative association has real harm for the earlier adopters. Every AI video creator I spoke to described receiving hateful messages and comments simply for using these tools at all. These messages accuse AI creators of taking opportunities away from artists already struggling to make a living, and some dismiss their work as “grifting” and “garbage.” The backlash, of course, did not come out of nowhere. A Brookings study of one major freelance marketplace found that after new generative-AI tools launched in 2022, freelancers in AI-exposed occupations saw about 2% decline in contracts and a 5% drop in earnings.

“The phrase ‘AI slop’ implies, like, a certain ease of creation that really bothers a lot of people—understandably, because [making AI-generated videos] doesn&#39;t incorporate the artistic labor that we typically associate with contemporary art,” says Mindy Seu, a researcher, artist, and associate professor in digital arts at UCLA.

At the root of the conflict here is that the use of AI in art is still nascent; there are few best practices and almost no guardrails. And there’s a kind of shame involved—one I recognize when I find myself lingering on bad AI content.

Historically, new technology has always carried a whiff of stigma when it first appears, especially in creative fields where it seems to encroach on a previously manual craft. Seu says that digital art, internet art, and new media have been slow to gain recognition from cultural institutions, which remain key arbiters of what counts as “serious” or “relevant” art.

For many artists, AI now sits in that same lineage: “Every big advance in technology yields the question ‘What is the role of the artist?’” she says. This is true even if creators are not seeing it as a replacement for authorship but simply as another way to create.

Mao, the OpenArt founder, believes that learning how to use generative video tools will be crucial for future content creators, much as learning Photoshop was almost synonymous with graphic design for a generation. “It is a skill to be learned and mastered,” she says.

There is a generous reading of the phenomenon so many people call AI slop, which is that it is a kind of democratization. A rare skill shifts away from craftsmanship to something closer to creative direction: being able to describe what you want with enough linguistic precision, and to anchor it in references the model is likely to understand. You have to know how to ask, and what to point to. In that sense, discernment and critique sit closer to the center of the process than ever before.

It’s not just about creative direction, though, but about the human intention behind the creation. “It’s very easy to copy the style,” Lim says. “It’s very easy to make, like, old Asian women doing different things, but they [imitators] don’t understand why I’m doing it … Even when people try to imitate that, they don’t have that consistency.”

“It’s the idea behind AI creation that makes it interesting to look at,” says Zach Lieberman, a professor at the MIT Media Lab who leads a research group called Future Sketches, where members explore code-enabled images. Lieberman, who has been posting daily sketches generated by code for years, tells me that mathematical logic is not the enemy of beauty. He echoes Mao in saying that a younger generation will inevitably see AI as just another tool in the toolbox. Still, he feels uneasy: By relying so heavily on black-box AI models, artists lose some of the direct control over output that they’ve traditionally enjoyed.

For many people, AI slop is simply everything they already resent about the internet, turned up: ugly, noisy, and crowding out human work. It’s only possible because it’s been trained to take all creative work and make it fodder, stripped of origin, aura, or credit, and blended into something engineered to be mathematically average—arguably perfectly mediocre, by design. Charles Pulliam-Moore, a writer for The Verge, calls this the “formulaic derivativeness” that already defines so much internet culture: unimaginative, unoriginal, and uninteresting.

But I love internet culture, and I have for a long time. Even at its worst, it’s bad in an interesting way: It offers a corner for every kind of obsession and invites you to add your own. Years of being chronically online have taught me that the real logic of slop consumption isn’t mastery but a kind of submission. As a user, I have almost no leverage over platforms or algorithms; I can’t really change how they work. Submission, though, doesn’t mean giving up. It’s more like recognizing that the tide is stronger than you and choosing to let it carry you. Good scrolling isn’t about control anyway. It’s closer to surfing, and sometimes you wash up somewhere ridiculous, but not entirely alone.

Mass-produced click-bait content has always been around. What’s new is that we can now watch it being generated in real time, on a scale that would have been unimaginable before. And the way we respond to it in turn shapes new content (see the trampoline-bouncing bunnies) and more culture and so on. Perhaps AI slop is born of submission to algorithmic logic. It’s unserious, surreal, and spectacular in ways that mirror our relationship to the internet itself. It is so banal—so aggressively, inhumanly mediocre—that it loops back around and becomes compelling.

To “love AI slop” is to admit the internet is broken, that the infrastructure of culture is opportunistic and extractive. But even in that wreckage, people still find ways to play, laugh, and make meaning.

Earlier this fall, months after I was briefly fooled by the bunny video, I was scrolling on Rednote and landed on videos by Mu Tianran, a Chinese creator who acts out weird skits that mimic AI slop. In one widely circulated clip, he plays a street interviewer asking other actors, “Do you know you are AI generated?”—parodying an earlier wave of AI-generated street interviews. The actors’ responses seem so AI, but of course they’re not: Eyes are fixed just off-camera, their laughter a beat too slow, their movements slightly wrong.

Watching this, it was hard to believe that AI was about to snuff out human creativity. If anything, it has handed people a new style to inhabit and mock, another texture to play with. Maybe it’s all fine. Maybe the urge to imitate, remix, and joke is still stubbornly human, and AI cannot possibly take it away.

We asked Al Jean, the longest-serving showrunner, about all the conspiracy theories.

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

It’s a popular example of the “Mandela effect,” or a collective false memory. And while some people may laugh and move on, others spend years searching for an explanation.

A mix of technology and politics has given an unprecedented boost to once-fringe ideas—but they are pretty much the same fantasies that have been spreading for hundreds of years.

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/22/1130153/geothermal-energy-carbon-capture-kenya-climate-solution/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The earth around Lake Naivasha, a shallow freshwater basin in south-central Kenya, does not seem to want to lie still.

Ash from nearby Mount Longonot, which erupted as recently as the 1860s, remains in the ground. Obsidian caves and jagged stone towers preside over the steam that spurts out of fissures in the soil and wafts from pools of boiling-hot water—produced by magma that, in some areas, sits just a few miles below the surface.

It’s a landscape born from violent geologic processes some 25 million years ago, when the Nubian and Somalian tectonic plates pulled apart. That rupture cut a depression in the earth some 4,000 miles long—from East Africa up through the Middle East—to create what’s now called the Great Rift Valley.

This volatility imbues the land with vast potential, much of it untapped. The area, no more than a few hours’ drive from Nairobi, is home to five geothermal power stations, which harness the clouds of steam to generate about a quarter of Kenya’s electricity. But some energy from this process escapes into the atmosphere, while even more remains underground for lack of demand.

In June, just north of the lake in the small but strategically located town of Gilgil, the startup began running a high-stakes test. It’s harnessing some of that excess energy to power four prototypes of a machine that promises to remove carbon dioxide from the air in a manner that the company says is efficient, affordable, and—crucially—scalable.

In the short term, the impact will be small—each device’s initial capacity is just 60 tons per year of CO2—but the immediate goal is simply to demonstrate that carbon removal here is possible. The longer-term vision is far more ambitious: to prove that direct air capture (DAC), as the process is known, can be a powerful tool to help the world keep temperatures from rising to ever more dangerous levels.

“We believe we are doing what we can here in Kenya to address climate change and lead the charge for positioning Kenya as a climate vanguard,” Specioser Mutheu, Octavia’s communications lead, told me when I visited the country last year.

The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has stated that in order to keep the world from warming more than 1.5 °C over preindustrial levels (the threshold set out in the Paris Agreement), or even the more realistic but still difficult 2 °C, it will need to significantly reduce future fossil-fuel emissions—and also pull from the atmosphere billions of tons of carbon that have already been released.

Some argue that DAC, which uses mechanical and chemical processes to suck carbon dioxide from the air and store it in a stable form (usually underground), is the best way to do that. It’s a technology with immense promise, offering the possibility that human ingenuity and innovation can get us out of the same mess that development caused in the first place.

Last year, the world’s largest DAC plant, Mammoth, came online in Iceland, offering the eventual capacity to remove up to 36,000 tons of CO₂ per year—roughly equal to the emissions of 7,600 gas-powered cars. The idea is that DAC plants like this one will remove and permanently store carbon and create carbon credits that can be purchased by corporations, governments, and local industrial producers, which will collectively help keep the world from experiencing the most dangerous effects of climate change.

Now, Octavia and a growing number of other companies, politicians, and investors from Africa, the US, and Europe are betting that Kenya’s unique environment holds the keys to reaching this lofty goal—which is why they’re pushing a sweeping vision to remake the Great Rift Valley into the “Great Carbon Valley.” And they hope to do so in a way that provides a genuine economic boost for Kenya, while respecting the rights of the Indigenous people who live on this land. If they can do so, the project could not just give a needed jolt to the DAC industry—it could also provide proof of concept for DAC across the Global South, which is particularly vulnerable to the ravages of climate change despite bearing very little responsibility for it.

But DAC is also a controversial technology, unproven at scale and wildly expensive to operate. In May, an Icelandic news outlet published an investigation into Climeworks, which runs the Mammoth plant, finding that it didn’t even pull in enough carbon dioxide to offset its own emissions, let alone the emissions of other companies.

Critics also argue that the electricity DAC requires can be put to better use cleaning up our transportation systems, heating our homes, and powering other industries that still rely largely on fossil fuels. What’s more, they say that relying on DAC can give polluters an excuse to delay the transition to renewables indefinitely. And further complicating this picture is shrinking demand from governments and corporations that would be DAC’s main buyers, which has left some experts questioning whether the industry will even survive.

Carbon removal is a technology that seems always on the verge of kicking in but never does, says Fadhel Kaboub, a Tunisian economist and advocate for an equitable green transition. “You need billions of dollars of investment in it, and it’s not delivering, and it’s not going to deliver anytime soon. So why do we put the entire future of the planet in the hands of a few people and a technology that doesn’t deliver?”

Layered on top of concerns about the viability and wisdom of DAC is a long history of distrust from the Maasai people who have called the Great Rift Valley home for generations but have been displaced in waves by energy companies coming in to tap the land’s geothermal reserves. And many of those remaining don’t even have access to the electricity generated by these plants.

It’s an immensely complicated landscape to navigate. But if the project can indeed make it through, Benjamin Sovacool, an energy policy researcher and director of the Boston University Institute for Global Sustainability, sees immense potential for countries that have been historically marginalized from climate policy and green energy investment. Though he’s skeptical about DAC as a near-term climate solution, he says these nations could still see big benefits from what could be a multitrillion-dollar industry.

“[Of] all the technologies we have available to fight climate change, the idea of reversing it by sucking CO2 out of the air and storing it is really attractive. It’s something even an ordinary person can just get,” Sovacool says. “If we’re able to do DAC at scale, it could be the next huge energy transition.”

But first, of course, the Great Carbon Valley has to actually deliver.

The “Great Carbon Valley” is both a broad vision for the region and a company founded to shepherd that vision into reality.

Bilha Ndirangu, a 42-year-old MIT electrical engineering graduate who grew up in Nairobi, has long worried about the impacts of climate change on Kenya. But she doesn’t want the country to be a mere victim of rising temperatures, she tells me; she hopes to see it become a source of climate solutions. So in 2021, Ndirangu cofounded Jacob’s Ladder Africa, a nonprofit with the goal of preparing African workers for green industries.

She also began collaborating with the Kenyan entrepreneur James Irungu Mwangi, the CEO of Africa Climate Ventures, an investment firm focused on building and accelerating climate-smart businesses. He’d been working on an idea that spoke to their shared belief in the potential for the country’s vast geothermal capacity; the plan was to find buyers for Kenya’s extra geothermal energy in order to kick-start the development of even more renewable power. One energy-hungry, climate-positive industry stood out: direct air capture of carbon dioxide.

The Great Rift Valley was the key to this vision. The thinking was that it could provide the cheap energy needed to power affordable DAC at scale while offering an ideal geology to effectively store carbon deep underground after it was extracted from the air. And with nearly 90% of the country’s grid already powered by renewable energy, DAC wouldn’t be siphoning power away from other industries that need it. Instead, attracting DAC to Kenya could provide the boost needed for energy providers to build out their infrastructure and expand the grid—ideally connecting the roughly 25% of people in the country who lack electricity and reducing scenarios in which power has to be rationed.

“This push for renewable energy and the decarbonization of industries is providing us with a once-in-a-lifetime sort of opportunity,” Ndirangu tells me.

So in 2023, the pair founded Great Carbon Valley, a project development company whose mission is attracting DAC companies to the area, along with other energy-intensive industries looking for renewable power.

It has already brought on high-profile companies like the Belgian DAC startup Sirona Technologies, the French DAC company Yama, and Climeworks, the Swiss company that operates Mammoth and another DAC plant in Iceland (and was on MIT Technology Review’s 10 Breakthrough Technologies list in 2022, and the list of Climate Tech Companies to Watch in 2023). All are planning on launching pilot projects in Kenya in the coming years, with Climeworks announcing plans to complete its Kenyan DAC plant by 2028. GCV has also partnered with Cella, an American carbon-storage company that works with Octavia, and is facilitating permits for the Icelandic company Carbfix, which injects the carbon from Climeworks’ DAC facilities.

“Climate change is disproportionately impacting this part of the world, but it’s also changing the rules of the game all over the world,” Cella CEO and cofounder Corey Pattison tells me, explaining the draw of Mwangi and Ndirangu’s concept. “This is also an opportunity to be entrepreneurial and creative in our thinking, because there are all of these assets that places like Kenya have.”

Not only can the country offer cheap and abundant renewable energy, but supporters of Kenyan DAC hope that the young and educated local workforce can supply the engineers and scientists needed to build out this infrastructure. In turn, the business could open opportunities to the country’s roughly 6 million un- or under-employed youths.

“It’s not a one-off industry,” Ndirangu says, highlighting her faith in the idea that jobs will flow from green industrialization. Engineers will be needed to monitor the DAC facilities, and the additional demand for renewable power will create jobs in the energy sector, along with related services like water and hospitality.

“You’re developing a whole range of infrastructure to make this industry possible,” she adds. “That infrastructure is not just good for the industry—it’s also just good for the country.”

In June of last year, I walked up a dirt path to the HQ of Octavia Carbon, just off Nairobi’s Eastern Bypass Road, on the far outskirts of the city.

The staffers I met on my tour exuded the kind of boundless optimism that’s common in early-stage startups. “People used to write academic articles about the fact that no human will ever be able to run a marathon in less than two hours,” Octavia CEO Martin Freimüller told me that day. The Kenyan marathon runner Eliud Kipchoge broke that barrier in a race in 2019. A mural of him features prominently on the wall, along with the athlete’s slogan, “No human is limited.”

“It’s impossible, until Kenya does it,” Freimüller added.

Although not an official partner of Ndirangu’s Great Carbon Valley venture, Octavia aligns with the larger vision, he told me. The company got its start in 2022, when Freimüller, an Austrian development consultant, met Duncan Kariuki, an engineering graduate from the University of Nairobi, in the OpenAir Collective, an online forum devoted to carbon removal. Kariuki introduced Freimüller to his classmates Fiona Mugambi and Mike Bwondera, and the four began working on a DAC prototype, first in lab space borrowed from the university and later in an apartment. It didn’t take long for neighbors to complain about the noise, and within six months, the operation had moved to its current warehouse.

That same year, they announced their first prototype, affectionately called Thursday after the day it was unveiled at a Nairobi Climate Network event. Soon, Octavia was showing off its tech to high-profile visitors including King Charles III and President Joe Biden’s ambassador to Kenya, Meg Whitman.

Three years later, the team has more than 40 engineers and has built its 12th DAC unit: a metal cylinder about the size of a large washing machine, containing a chemical filter using an amine, an organic compound derived from ammonia. (Octavia declined to provide further details about the arrangement of the filter inside the machine because the company is awaiting approval of a patent for the design.)

Hannah Wanjau, an engineer at the company, explained how it works: Fans draw air from the outside across the filter, causing carbon dioxide (which is acidic) to react with the basic amine and form a carbonate salt. When that mixture is heated inside a vacuum to 80 to 100 °C, the CO2 is released, now as a gas, and collected in a special chamber, while the amine can be reused for the next round of carbon capture.

The amine absorption method has been used in other DAC plants around the world, including those operated by Climeworks, but Octavia’s project stands apart on several key fronts. Wanjau explained that its technology is tailored to suit the local climate; the company has adjusted the length of time for absorption and the temperature for CO2 release, making it a potential model for other countries in the tropics.

And then there’s its energy source: The device operates on more than 80% thermal energy, which in the field will consist of the extra geothermal energy that the power plants don’t convert into electricity. This energy is typically released into the atmosphere, but it will be channeled instead to Octavia’s machines. What’s more, the device’s modular design can fit inside a shipping container, allowing the company to easily deploy dozens of these units once the demand is there, Mutheu told me.

This technology is being tested in the field in Gilgil, where Mutheu told me the company is “continuing to capture and condition CO₂ as part of our ongoing operations and testing cycles.” (She declined to provide specific data or results at this stage.)

Once the CO2 is captured, it will be heated and pressurized. Then it will be pumped to a nearby storage facility operated by Cella, where the company will inject the gas into fissures underground. The region’s special geology again offers an advantage: Much of the rock found underground here is basalt, a volcanic mineral that contains high concentrations of calcium and magnesium ions. They react with carbon dioxide to form substances like calcite, dolomite, and magnesite, locking the carbon atoms away in the form of solid minerals.

This process is more durable than other forms of carbon storage, making it potentially more attractive to buyers of carbon credits, says Pattison, the Cella CEO. Non-geologic carbon mitigation methods, such as cookstove replacement programs or nature-based solutions like tree planting, have recently been rocked by revelations of fraud or exaggeration. The money for Cella’s pilot, which will see the injection of 200 tons of CO2 this year, has come mainly from the Frontier advance market commitment, under which a group of companies including Stripe, Google, Shopify, Meta, and others has collectively pledged to spend $1 billion on carbon removal by 2030.

These projects have already opened up possibilities for young Kenyans like Wanjau. She told me there were not a lot of opportunities for aspiring mechanical engineers like her to design and test their own devices; many of her classmates were working for construction or oil companies, or were unemployed. But almost immediately after graduation, Wanjau began working for Octavia.

“I’m happy that I’m trying to solve a problem that’s a real-world issue,” she told me. “Not many people in Africa get a chance to do that.”

Despite the vast enthusiasm from partners and investors, the Great Carbon Valley faces multiple challenges before Ndirangu and Mwangi’s vision can be fully realized.

Since its start, the venture has had to contend with “this perception that doing projects in Africa is risky,” says Ndirangu. Of the dozens of DAC facilities planned or in existence today, only a handful are in the Global South. Indeed, Octavia has described itself as the first DAC plant to be located there. “Even just selling Kenya as a destination for DAC was quite a challenge,” she says.

So Ndirangu played up Kenya’s experience developing geothermal resources, as well as local engineering talent and a lower cost of labor. GCV has also offered to work with the Kenyan government to help companies secure the proper permits to break ground as soon as possible.

Ndirangu says that she’s already seen “a real appetite” from power producers who want to build out more renewable-energy infrastructure, but at the same time they’re waiting for proof of demand. She envisions that once that power is in place, lots of other industries—from data centers to producers of green steel, green ammonia, and sustainable aviation fuels—will consider basing themselves in Kenya, attracting more than a dozen projects to the valley in the next few years.

But recent events could dampen demand (which some experts already worried was insufficient). Global governments are retreating from climate action, particularly in the US. The Trump administration has dramatically slashed funding for development related to climate change and renewable energy. The Department of Energy appears poised to terminate a $50 million grant to a proposed Louisiana DAC plant that would have been partially operated by Climeworks, and in May, not long after that announcement, the company said it was cutting 22% of its staff.

At the same time, many companies that would have likely been purchasers of carbon credits—and that a few years ago had voluntarily pledged to reduce or eliminate their carbon emissions—are quietly walking back their commitments. Over the long term, experts warn, there are limits to the amount of carbon removal that companies will ever voluntarily buy. They argue that governments will ultimately have to pay for it—or require polluters to do so.

Further compounding all these challenges are costs. Critics say DAC investments are a waste of time and money compared with other forms of carbon drawdown. As of mid-December, carbon removal credits in the European Union’s Emissions Trading System, one of the world’s largest carbon markets, were priced at around $84 per ton. The average price per DAC credit, for comparison, is nearly $450. Natural processes like reforestation absorb millions of tons of carbon annually and are far cheaper (though programs to harness them for carbon credits are beset with their own controversies). Ultimately, DAC continues to operate on a small scale, removing only about 10,000 metric tons of CO2 each year.

Even if DAC suppliers do manage to push past these obstacles, there are still thorny questions coming from inside Kenya. Groups like Power Shift Africa, a Nairobi-based think tank that advocates for climate action on the continent, have derided carbon credits as “pollution permits” and blamed them for delaying the move toward electrification.

“The ultimate goal of [carbon removal] is that you can say at the end, well, we can actually continue our emissions and just recapture them with this technology,” says Kaboub, the Tunisian economist, who has worked with Power Shift Africa. “So there&#39;s no need to end fossil fuels, which is why you get a lot of support from oil countries and companies.”

Another problem he sees is not limited to DAC but extends to the way that Kenya and other African nations are pursuing their goal of green industrialization. While Kenyan President William Ruto has courted international financial investment to turn Kenya into a green energy hub, his administration’s policies have deepened the country’s external debt, which in 2024 was equal to around 30% of its GDP. Geothermal energy development in Kenya has often been financed by loans from international institutions or other governments. As its debt has risen, the country has enacted national austerity measures that have sparked deadly protests.

Kenya may indeed have advantages over other countries, and DAC costs will most likely go down eventually. But some experts, such as Boston University’s Sovacool, aren’t quite sold on the idea that the Great Carbon Valley—or any DAC venture—can significantly mitigate climate change. Sovacool’s research has found that at best, DAC will be ready to deploy on the necessary scale by midcentury, much too late to make it a viable climate solution. And that’s if it can overcome additional costs—such as the losses associated with corruption in the energy sector, which Sovacool and others have found is a widespread problem in Kenya.

Nevertheless, others within the carbon removal industry remain more optimistic about DAC’s overall prospects and are particularly hopeful that Kenya can address some of the challenges the technology has encountered elsewhere. Cost is “not the most important thing,” says Erin Burns, executive director of Carbon180, a nonprofit that advocates for the removal and reuse of carbon dioxide. “There’s lots of things we pay for.” She notes that governments in Japan, Singapore, Canada, Australia, the European Union, and elsewhere are all looking at developing compliance markets for carbon, even though the US is stagnating on this front.

The Great Carbon Valley, she believes, stands poised to benefit from these developments. “It’s big. It’s visionary,” Burns says. “You’ve got to have some ambition here. This isn’t something that is like deploying a technology that’s widely deployed already. And that comes with an enormous potential for huge opportunity, huge gains.”

More than any external factor, the Great Carbon Valley’s future is perhaps most intimately intertwined with the restless earth on which it’s being built, and the community that has lived here for centuries.

To the Maasai people, nomadic pastoralists who inhabit swathes of Eastern Africa, including Kenya, this land around Lake Naivasha is “ol-karia,” meaning “ochre,” after the bright red clay found in abundance.

South of the lake is Hell’s Gate National Park, a 26-square-mile nature reserve where the region’s five geothermal power complexes—with a sixth under construction—churn on top of the numerous steam vents. The first geothermal power plant here was brought into service in 1981 by KenGen, a majority-state-owned electricity company; it was named Olkaria.

But for decades most of the Maasai haven’t had access to that electricity. And many of them have been forced off the land in a wave of evictions. In 2014, construction on a KenGen geothermal complex expelled more than 2,000 people and led to a number of legal complaints. At the same time, locals living near a different, privately owned geothermal complex 50 miles north of Naivasha have complained of noise and air pollution; in March, a Kenyan court revoked the operating license of one of the project’s three plants.

Neither Octavia or Cella is powered by output from these two geothermal producers, but activists have warned that similar environmental and social harms could resurface if demand for new geothermal infrastructure grows in Kenya—demand that could be driven by DAC.

Ndirangu says she believes some of the complaints about displacement are “exaggerated,” but she nonetheless acknowledges the need for stronger community engagement, as does Octavia. In the long term, Ndirangu says, she plans to provide job training to residents living near the affected areas and integrate them into the industry, although she also says those plans need to be realistic. “You don’t want to create the wrong expectation that you will hire everyone from the community,” she says.

That’s part of the problem for Maasai activists like Agnes Koilel, a teacher living near the Olkaria geothermal field. Despite past promises of employment at the power plants, the jobs that are offered are lower-paying positions in cleaning or security. “Maasai people are not [as] employed as they think,” she says.

DAC is a small industry, and it can’t do everything. But if it’s going to become as big as Ndirangu, Freimüller, and other proponents of the Great Carbon Valley hope it will be, creating jobs and driving Kenya’s green industrialization, communities like Koilel’s will be among those most directly affected—much as they are by climate change.

When I asked Koilel what she thought about DAC development near her home, she told me she had never heard of the Great Carbon Valley idea, or of carbon removal in general. She wasn’t necessarily against geothermal power development on principle, or opposed to any of the industries that might push it to expand. She just wants to see some benefits, like a health center for her community. She wants to reverse the evictions that have pushed her neighbors off their land. And she wants electricity—the same kind that would power the fans and pumps of future DAC hubs.

Power “is generated from these communities,” Koilel said. “But they themselves do not have that light.”

            <h2>This company is developing gene therapies for muscle growth, erectile dysfunction, and “radical longevity”</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/22/1130288/gene-therapies-muscle-growth-erectile-dysfunction-radical-longevity/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At some point next month, a handful of volunteers will be injected with two experimental gene therapies as part of an unusual clinical trial. The drugs are potential longevity therapies, says Ivan Morgunov, the CEO of Unlimited Bio, the company behind the trial. His long-term goal: to achieve radical human life extension.

The 12 to 15 volunteers—who will be covering their own travel and treatment costs—will receive a series of injections in the muscles of their arms and legs. One of the therapies is designed to increase the blood supply to those muscles. The other is designed to support muscle growth. The company hopes to see improvements in strength, endurance, and recovery. It also plans to eventually trial similar therapies in the scalp (for baldness) and penis (for erectile dysfunction).

But some experts are concerned that the trial involves giving multiple gene therapies to small numbers of healthy people. It will be impossible to draw firm conclusions from such a small study, and the trial certainly won’t reveal anything about longevity, says Holly Fernandez Lynch, a lawyer and medical ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

Unlimited Bio’s blood supply therapy is already accessible at clinics in Honduras and Mexico, says Morgunov—and the company is already getting some publicity. Khloe Kardashian tagged Unlimited Bio in a Facebook post about stem-cell treatments she and her sister Kim had received at the Eterna clinic in Mexico in August. And earlier this week, the biohacking influencer Dave Asprey posted an Instagram Reel of himself receiving one of the treatments in Mexico; it was shared with 1.3 million Instagram followers. In the video, Eterna’s CEO, Adeel Khan, says that the therapy can “help with vascular health systemically.” “I’m just upgrading my system for a little while to reduce my age and reduce my vascular risk,” Asprey said.

Gene therapies typically work by introducing new genetic code into the body’s cells. This code is then able to make proteins. Existing approved gene therapies have typically been developed for severe diseases in which the target proteins are either missing or mutated.

But several groups are exploring gene therapies for healthy people. One of these companies is Minicircle, which developed a gene therapy to increase production of follistatin, a protein found throughout the body that has many roles and is involved in muscle growth. The company says this treatment will increase muscle mass—and help people live longer. Minicircle is based in Próspera, a special economic zone in Honduras with its own bespoke regulatory system. Anyone can visit the local clinic and receive that therapy, for a reported price of $25,000. And many have, including the wealthy longevity influencer Bryan Johnson, who promoted the therapy in a Netflix documentary.

Unlimited Bio’s Morgunov, a Russian-Israeli computer scientist, was inspired by Minicircle’s story. He is also interested in longevity. Specifically, he’s committed to radical life extension and has said that he could be part of “the last generation throughout human history to die from old age.” He believes the biggest “bottleneck” slowing progress toward anti-aging or lifespan-extending therapies is drug regulation. So he, too, incorporated his own biotech company in Próspera.

“A company like ours couldn’t exist outside of Próspera,” says Unlimited Bio’s chief operating officer, Vladimir Leshko.

There, Morgunov and his colleagues are exploring two gene therapies. One of these is another follistatin therapy, which the team hopes will increase muscle mass. The other codes for a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF. This compound is known to encourage the growth of blood vessels. Morgunov and his colleagues hope the result will be increased muscle growth, enhanced muscle repair, and longer life. Neither treatment is designed to alter a recipient’s DNA, and therefore it won’t be inherited by future generations.

The combination of the two therapies could benefit healthy people and potentially help them live longer, says Leshko, a former electrical engineer and professional poker player who retrained in biomedical engineering. “We would say that it’s a preventive-slash-enhancing indication,” he says. “Potentially participants can experience faster recovery from exercise, more strength, and more endurance.”

Of the 12 to 15 volunteers who participate in the trial, half will receive only the follistatin therapy. The other half will receive both the VEGF and the follistatin therapies. The treatments will involve a series of injections throughout large muscles in the arms and legs, says Morgunov.

He is confident that the VEGF therapy is safe. It was approved in Russia over a decade ago to treat lower-limb ischemia—a condition that can cause pain, numbness, and painful ulcers in the legs and feet. Morgunov reckons, based on previously published estimates, that around 10,000 people in Russia have already had the drug, although he says he hasn’t “done deep fact-checking on that.”

VEGF is a powerful compound, says Seppo Ylä-Herttuala, a professor of molecular medicine at the University of Eastern Finland who has been studying VEGF and potential VEGF therapies for decades. He doesn’t know how many people have had VEGF gene therapy in Russia. But he does know that the safety of the therapy will depend on how much is administered and where. Previous attempts to inject the therapy into the heart, for example, have resulted in edema, a sometimes fatal buildup of fluid. Even if the therapy is injected elsewhere, VEGF can travel around the body, he says. If it gets to the eye, for example, it could cause blindness. Leshko counters that the VEGF should remain where it is injected, and any other circulation in the body, if it occurs, should be short-lived.

And while the therapy has been approved in Russia, there’s a reason it hasn’t been approved elsewhere, says Ylä-Herttuala: The clinical trials were not as rigorous as they could have been. While “it probably works in some patients,” he says, the evidence to support the use of this therapy is weak. At any rate, he adds, VEGF will only support the growth of blood vessels—it won’t tackle aging.  “VEGF is not a longevity drug,” he says.

Leshko points to a 2021 study in mice, which suggested that a lack of VEGF activity might drive aging in the rodents. “We’re convinced it qualifies as a potential longevity drug,” he says.

There is even less data about follistatin. Minicircle, the company selling another follistatin gene therapy, has not published any rigorous clinical trial data. So far, much of the evidence for follistatin’s effects comes from research in rodents, says Ylä-Herttuala.

Clinical trials like this one should gather more information, both about the therapies and about the methods used to get those therapies into the body. Unlimited Bio’s VEGF therapy will be delivered via a circular piece of genetic code called a plasmid. Its follistatin therapy, on the other hand, will be delivered via an adeno-associated virus (AAV). Plasmid therapies are easier to make, and they have a shorter lifespan in the body—only a matter of days. They are generally considered to be safer than AAV therapies. AAV therapies, on the other hand, tend to stick around for months, says Ylä-Herttuala. And they can trigger potentially dangerous immune reactions.

It’s debatable whether healthy people should be exposed to these risks, says Fernandez Lynch. The technology “still has serious questions about its safety and effectiveness,” even for people with life-threatening diseases, she says. “If you are a healthy person, the risk of harm is more substantial because it’ll be more impactful on your life.”

But Leshko is adamant. “Over 120,000 humans die DAILY from age-related causes,” he wrote in an email. “Building ‘ethical’ barriers around ‘healthy’ human (in fact, aging human) trials is unethical.” Morgunov did not respond to a request for comment.

Some people want to take those risks anyway. In his video, the biohacker influencer Asprey—who has publicly stated that he’s “going to live to 180”—described VEGF as a “longevity compound,” and Eterna’s CEO Khan, who delivered the treatment, described it as “the ultimate upgrade.” Neither Asprey nor Khan clinic responded to requests for comment.

Michael Gusmano, a professor of health policy at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, worries that this messaging might give trial participants unrealistic expectations about how they might benefit. There is “huge potential for therapeutic misconception when you have some kind of celebrity online influencer touting something about which there is relatively sparse scientific evidence,” he says. In reality, he adds, “the only thing you can guarantee is that [the volunteers] will be contributing to our knowledge of how this intervention works.”

“I would certainly not recommend that anyone I know enter into such a trial,” says Gusmano.

The muscle study is only the first step. The Unlimited Bio team hopes to trial the VEGF therapy for baldness and erectile dysfunction, too. Leshko points to research in mice that links high VEGF levels to larger, denser hair follicles. He hopes to test a series of VEGF therapy injections into the scalps of volunteers. Morgunov, who is largely bald, has already started to self-experiment with the approach.

An erectile dysfunction trial may follow. “That one we think has great potential because injecting gene therapy into the penis sounds exciting,” says Leshko. A protocol for that trial has not yet been finalized, but he imagines it would involve “five to 10” injections.

Ylä-Herttuala isn’t optimistic about either approach. Hair growth is largely hormonal, he says. And injecting anything into a penis risks damaging it (although Leshko points out that a similar approach was taken by another company almost 20 years ago). Injecting a VEGF gene therapy into the penis would also risk edema there, Ylä-Herttuala adds.

And he points out that we already have some treatments for hair loss and erectile dysfunction. While they aren’t perfect, their existence does raise the bar for any potential future therapies—not only do they have to be safe and effective, but they must be safer or more effective than existing ones.

That doesn’t mean the trials will flop. No small trial can be definitive, but it could still provide some insight into how these drugs are working. It is possible that the therapies will increase muscle mass, at least, and that this could be beneficial to the healthy recipients, says Ylä-Herttuala.

Before our call, he had taken a look at Unlimited Bio’s website, which carries the tagline “The Most Advanced Rejuvenation Solution.” “They promise a lot,” he said. “I hope it’s true.”

China figured out how to sell EVs. Now it has to bury their batteries.

In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road.

It’s a weird time to be an AI doomer.This small but influential community believes, in the simplest terms, that AI could get so good it could be bad—very, very bad—for humanity.The doomer crowd has had some notable success over the past several years: including helping shape AI policy coming from the Biden administration. But a number of developments over the past six months have put them on the back foot. Talk of an AI bubble has overwhelmed the discourse as tech companies continue to invest in multiple Manhattan Projects’ worth of data centers without any certainty that future demand will match what they’re building.So where does this leave the doomers? We decided to ask some of the movement’s biggest names to see if the recent setbacks and general vibe shift had altered their views. See what they had to say in our story.—Garrison Lovely

Synthesia’s AI clones are more expressive than ever. Soon they’ll be able to talk back.

Earlier this summer, I visited the AI company Synthesia to create a hyperrealistic AI-generated avatar of me. The company’s avatars are a decent barometer of just how dizzying progress has been in AI over the past few years, so I was curious just how accurately its latest AI model, introduced last month, could replicate me.I found my avatar as unnerving as it is technically impressive. It’s slick enough to pass as a high-definition recording of a chirpy corporate speech, and if you didn’t know me, you’d probably think that’s exactly what it was.My avatar shows how it’s becoming ever-harder to distinguish the artificial from the real. And before long, these avatars will even be able to talk back to us. But how much better can they get? And what might interacting with AI clones do to us? Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">My name is Alexandru Stan, and this article continues the dialogue I began following the acquisition of TNW.

Following the recent transaction, TNW Spaces remains with the Financial Times, while we continue the mission of the website, the events, and the global community.

We already have a dedicated team at tekpon operating the platform, events, and community initiatives. Our objective is to expand and strengthen the team as TNW accelerates its next chapter.

TNW is already a global media platform with millions of readers. We’re not starting over. We are building forward.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Technology is entering a decisive stage: AI is reshaping workflows, distribution is shifting, capital is becoming more selective, and founders are expected to demonstrate value rather than potential.

The world doesn’t need more noise.
It needs clarity, execution, and access to trustworthy knowledge and people.

TNW will serve that need through editorial independence, real expertise, and community-built intelligence.

Success for TNW looks like this: more accurate understanding, faster access to verified knowledge, and direct pathways from insight to action.

I’ve been an entrepreneur since 2007, building in B2B SaaS, marketplaces, and scalable systems. I believe deeply in servant leadership. Without people, I am zero.

I lead two private networks grounded in practice rather than theory:

These groups ensure TNW remains rooted in lived experience, informed by operators, not commentators.

Our mission is to build the most trusted European tech media platform with global reach, focused on practical innovation, responsible scaling, and transparency.

We will continue to host events across Europe’s major capitals including Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Monaco.

These will not be festivals. We are introducing a concept validated through tekpon events: curated gatherings built for meaningful relationships, deep content, and tangible business outcomes.

In 2026, we return to Amsterdam for a special edition centered on AI among other fields. We will explore technologies and strategies shaping the future of work and business:

The editorial focus remains European, while the audience is global.

AI is not a threat to publishing. It is the infrastructure of the next generation of content and knowledge.

At TNW, we will use AI to accelerate research, enable personalized intelligence, reduce noise and bias, and amplify high-quality human expertise. Technology assists. Human judgment remains central.

Because this moment in Europe matters.
Because founders here are ready to scale responsibly.
Because independent media with integrity is rare.
Because innovation deserves a platform built around people, not hype.

TNW will continue its legacy with a renewed emphasis on contribution, execution, and community built through trust.

If you are building, scaling, or researching the next wave of technology, I invite you to engage with us, contribute insights, and participate in shaping the conversation.

The next era begins now. Let’s shape it together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard!

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you. We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.

            <div id="article-text">Tekpon has acquired 100% of the TNW media and events brands, which cover and convene the European technology ecosystem, from the FT.

The transaction is Tekpon’s largest investment in media and events so far. It broadens the company’s reach across SaaS and AI and strengthens its role in the global innovation landscape.

TNW’s brand and editorial standards will be maintained, while its events and digital platforms will be integrated into Tekpon’s wider strategy.

The FT will continue to own and operate TNW Spaces, Amsterdam’s dynamic tech hub, offering private offices and coworking spaces that support a thriving community of startups, scale-ups, and innovators.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Alexandru Stan, Founder and CEO of Tekpon, said:

TNW is one of Europe’s most respected technology brands. Its legacy, its community, and its influence have shaped the European tech scene for nearly twenty years. This acquisition accelerates our mission to connect the global SaaS and AI ecosystem and supports Europe’s position in the next decade of innovation.

Tekpon will begin working on TNW branded initiatives immediately. Plans for 2026 include an expanded TNW Conference, new SaaS and AI program tracks curated by Tekpon, cross-regional executive programmes, and specialised gatherings for founders, executives, and investors.

The acquisition is part of Tekpon’s long-term plan to build an international ecosystem connecting software, media, events, advisory, and innovation.

            <div id="article-text">This article was published on September 29, 2025

A few decades ago, when I was raising funding for a startup, I made a lasting impression on an investor by not only talking about how successful we would be, but also highlighting what would happen if we weren’t. Later, in an informal setting, I asked him what had persuaded him to invest in us. He told me that during the pitch, I had said, “And if all our predictions and expectations are wrong, we will use the last of our funding for a magnificent farewell dinner for all our investors. You’ll have lost your money, but at least you’ll get a great evening for it in return.”

I don’t recall this being part of the original pitch or my strategy. I probably just blurted it out to break the ice, but it impressed the investor. He told me it was refreshing to speak to an entrepreneur who was not blinded by his own pitch. The fact that I had a scenario ready for both success and failure told him that I was honest and realistic.

Now, the startup was not successful, but we still had a nice, opulent dinner with the investors at the end — and we did them one better. As soon as we realised that our predictions and expectations were wrong, we made our investors an offer: we could struggle and pivot and hope for a miracle, or we could return what was left of our funding to our investors. We preferred option two, and so did they, so everybody got some money back (about 40% of what they had invested), as well as a lovely evening with excellent food and drinks. When we raised money for another startup a few years later, almost all of them signed up in our first round.

Obviously, I would have preferred to have made this startup a success instead, but I still regard it as a successful endeavour. I gave it a try and had a plan ready for when my experiment didn’t work out, and in the process, I built relationships that outlasted that one startup.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

As you may have read, The Next Web, the company I founded in 2006, is nearing the end of its lifecycle. The events and media business is being wound down, and only TNW Spaces will live on. TNW Programs was sold off a while ago and will continue as well. There won’t be another TNW Conference, and soon there won’t be new articles on the site; people are losing their jobs, including me. It’s a painful process, but I guess I’m taking it well because it also feels natural and logical. When we sold TNW to the FT in 2019, we were very ambitious and optimistic, and surely I would’ve liked for the company and brand to outlive me. However, when the business struggled, I also felt very comfortable with the company ending graciously.

When you’re reading a good book, there’s a moment near the end when you’ll start reading slower because you don’t want it to end. I love those moments, because I’ll know it’s been a good experience. But then you also know that good stories need good endings. So, this is the ending of a great story that I’ve enjoyed participating in.

I’ll keep writing, but this will be my last official TNW story. I’d love it if you would subscribe to my writing over at Substack. It will be less tech-focused, more unpredictable, but just as insightful as before.
