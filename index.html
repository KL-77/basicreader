            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Jared Isaacman, a pilot and financial tech billionaire, has commanded two groundbreaking spaceflights, including leading the first private spacewalk.

But his most remarkable flying has occurred over the last year. And on Wednesday, he stuck the landing by earning formal Senate approval to become NASA’s 15th administrator.

With a final tally of 67 to 30, Wednesday’s Senate confirmation came 377 days after President Trump first nominated Isaacman to serve as NASA administrator. Since that time, Isaacman had to navigate the following issues:

One of the biggest questions about Isaacman after his nomination in late 2024 was whether he had the political gamesmanship to run NASA. Few questioned his interest in space, knowledge of the industry, or flight experience. But he had no political experience. Could he handle the rigors of managing a tempestuous White House and fractured Congress?

The answer after he navigated the last year appears to be, quite clearly, yes.

The 42-year-old private astronaut becomes the youngest person to lead NASA. He has waited more than a year to take on the job, subjecting himself to scrutiny of his financial dealings, divesting himself of conflicts of interest, and answering question after question from lawmakers.

Now, finally, he will get a chance to act, rather than react to everyone else.

As the Project Athena plan clearly demonstrates, Isaacman has a good handle on the problems besetting NASA, an aging and increasingly bureaucratic agency. NASA can still do great things, but it has become almost infinitely harder since the heady days of Apollo six decades ago.

Isaacman has ideas to shake things up, but not to the extent of wanton change for the sake of change. It is clear from the interviews he has given to others, and in talking to him myself, that Isaacman is also a good listener. He wants to understand problems to he can work with others to apply thoughtful solutions.

Perhaps most importantly for NASA, unlike some other Trump administration nominees, he appears to be a builder, not a leveler.

Isaacman is coming into a beleaguered and bruised agency that has faced an extraordinarily difficult year. Thanks in part to Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, about 20 percent of the agency’s 17,500 employees took buyouts or early retirements. There have been significant layoffs at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and there are concerns about the future of Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. Moreover, the agency is locked into a high-stakes race with China to return humans to the Moon, which, over the last 12 months, has swung in China’s favor.

NASA’s administrator is responsible for carrying out the administration’s policies and working with Congress to secure funding to do so. In this, Isaacman finds himself between a Trump administration that sought to cut NASA’s budget by 24 percent, and a House and Senate that rejected the vast majority of those cuts in budget bills.

Looking over the last year, it would be easy to say NASA and Isaacman have lost more than half a year because of the withdrawal of Isaacman’s nomination in late May, when he was within days of bipartisan Senate approval. However, in the intervening months, Isaacman has made strong contacts within the US Senate and the White House. As part of the campaign to build support for his renomination, Isaacman emerges with considerably more political experience, a much closer relationship with Trump, and a deeper roster of contacts in his phone.

All of which is good, because for all of the fancy flying Isaacman has done to reach this point, his most difficult sorties lie ahead of him.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Physicists at the University of Amsterdam came up with a really cool bit of Christmas decor: a miniature 3D-printed Christmas tree, a mere 8 centimeters tall, made of ice, without any refrigeration equipment or other freezing technology, and at minimal cost. The secret is evaporative cooling, according to a preprint posted to the physics arXiv.

Evaporative cooling is a well-known phenomenon; mammals use it to regulate body temperature. You can see it in your morning cup of hot coffee: the hotter atoms rise to the top of the magnetic trap and “jump out” as steam. It also plays a role (along with shock wave dynamics and various other factors) in the formation of “wine tears.” It’s a key step in creating Bose-Einstein condensates.

And evaporative cooling is also the main culprit behind the infamous “stall” that so frequently plagues aspiring BBQ pit masters eager to make a successful pork butt. The meat sweats as it cooks, releasing the moisture within, and that moisture evaporates and cools the meat, effectively canceling out the heat from the BBQ. That’s why a growing number of competitive pit masters wrap their meat in tinfoil after the first few hours (usually when the internal temperature hits 170° F).

Ice-printing methods usually rely on cryogenics or on cooled substrates. Per the authors, this is the first time evaporative cooling principles have been applied to 3D printing. The trick was to house the 3D printing inside a vacuum chamber using a jet nozzle as the printing head—something they discovered serendipitously when they were trying to get rid of air drag by spraying water in a vacuum chamber.  “The printer’s motion control guides the water jet layer-by-layer, building geometry on demand,” the authors wrote in a blog post for Nature, adding:

At very low pressure, water molecules at the liquid surface escape continuously as vapor. Each departing molecule carries the latent heat of vaporization, thus cooling the water jet. The very fine jet we use for printing has a very high surface-to-volume ratio, making heat extraction very efficient: the bulk liquid cools rapidly, dropping tens of Kelvin over a fraction of a second. When the jet reaches the substrate or a previously deposited ice layer, it freezes just after its impact.

And when the holidays are over, just turn off the vacuum pump and watch your tree melt back into its watery state, “no residue, no post-processing waste.”

The applications aren’t limited to Christmas trees. The purity of the ice makes it ideal for biological applications such as scaffolding for tissue: any branching ice form can be cast in resin or polymer and when it melts, it will leave behind hollow channels. It can also be used to create custom fluid networks for microfluidics applications. And if you have plans to camp out on Mars with its cold temperatures and thin atmosphere, the method could enable 3D printed structures out of water ice, with no need for heavy and expensive cryogenic equipment.

            <h2>OpenAI’s new ChatGPT image generator makes faking photos easy</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/12/openais-new-chatgpt-image-generator-makes-faking-photos-easy/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For most of photography’s roughly 200-year history, altering a photo convincingly required either a darkroom, some Photoshop expertise, or, at minimum, a steady hand with scissors and glue. On Tuesday, OpenAI released a tool that reduces the process to typing a sentence.

It’s not the first company to do so. While OpenAI had a conversational image-editing model in the works since GPT-4o in 2024, Google beat OpenAI to market in March with a public prototype, then refined it to a popular model called Nano Banana image model (and Nano Banana Pro). The enthusiastic response to Google’s image-editing model in the AI community got OpenAI’s attention.

OpenAI’s new GPT Image 1.5 is an AI image synthesis model that reportedly generates images up to four times faster than its predecessor and costs about 20 percent less through the API. The model rolled out to all ChatGPT users on Tuesday and represents another step toward making photorealistic image manipulation a casual process that requires no particular visual skills.

GPT Image 1.5 is notable because it’s a “native multimodal” image model, meaning image generation happens inside the same neural network that processes language prompts. (In contrast, DALL-E 3, an earlier OpenAI image generator previously built into ChatGPT, used a different technique called diffusion to generate images.)

This newer type of model, which we covered in more detail in March, treats images and text as the same kind of thing: chunks of data called “tokens” to be predicted, patterns to be completed. If you upload a photo of your dad and type “put him in a tuxedo at a wedding,” the model processes your words and the image pixels in a unified space, then outputs new pixels the same way it would output the next word in a sentence.

Using this technique, GPT Image 1.5 can more easily alter visual reality than earlier AI image models, changing someone’s pose or position, or rendering a scene from a slightly different angle, with varying degrees of success. It can also remove objects, change visual styles, adjust clothing, and refine specific areas while preserving facial likeness across successive edits. You can converse with the AI model about a photograph, refining and revising, the same way you might workshop a draft of an email in ChatGPT.

Fidji Simo, OpenAI’s CEO of applications, wrote in a blog post that ChatGPT’s chat interface was never designed for visual work. “Creating and editing images is a different kind of task and deserves a space built for visuals,” Simo wrote. To that end, OpenAI introduced a dedicated image creation space in ChatGPT’s sidebar with preset filters and trending prompts.

The release’s timing seems like a direct response to Google’s technical gains in AI, including a massive growth in chatbot user base. In particular, Google’s Nano Banana image model (and Nano Banana Pro) became popular on social media after its August release, thanks to its ability to render text relatively clearly and preserve faces consistently across edits.

OpenAI’s previous token-based image synthesis model could make some targeted edits based on conversational prompts, but it often changed facial details and other elements that users might have wanted to keep. GPT Image 1.5 appears designed to match the editing features that Google already shipped. But if you happen to prefer the older ChatGPT image generator, OpenAI says the previous version will remain available as a custom GPT (for now) for users who prefer it.

GPT Image 1.5 is not perfect. In our brief testing, it didn’t always follow prompting directions very well. But when it does work, the results seem more convincing and detailed than OpenAI’s previous multimodal image model. For a more detailed comparison, a software consultant named Shaun Pedicini has put together an instructive site (“GenAI Image Editing Showdown”) that conducts A/B testing of various AI image models.

And while we’ve written about this a lot over the past few years, it’s probably worth repeating that barriers to realistic photo editing and manipulation keep dropping. This kind of seamless, realistic, effortless AI image manipulation may prompt (pun intended) a cultural recalibration of what visual images mean to society. It can also feel a little scary, for someone who grew up in an earlier media era, to see yourself put into situations that didn’t really happen.

For most of photography’s history, a convincing forgery required skill, time, and resources. Those barriers made fakery rare enough that we could treat many photographs as a reasonable proxy for truth, although they could be manipulated (and often were). That era has ended due to AI, but GPT Image 1.5 seems to remove yet more of the remaining friction.

The capability to preserve facial likeness across edits has obvious utility for legitimate photo editing and equally obvious potential for misuse. Image generators have already been used to create non-consensual intimate imagery and impersonate real people.

With those hazards in mind, OpenAI’s image generators have always included a filter that usually blocks sexual or violent outputs. But it’s still possible to create embarrassing images of people without their consent (even though it violates OpenAI’s terms of service) while avoiding those topics. The company says generated images include C2PA metadata identifying them as AI-created, though that data can be stripped by resaving the file.

Speaking of fakes, text rendering has been a long-standing weakness in image generators that has slowly gotten better. By prompting some older image synthesis models to create a sign or poster with specific words, the results often come back garbled or misspelled.

OpenAI says GPT Image 1.5 can handle denser and smaller text. The company’s blog post includes a demonstration where the model generated an image of a newspaper with a multi-paragraph article, complete with headlines, a byline, benchmark tables, and body text that remains legible at the paragraph level. Whether this holds up across varied prompts will require broader testing.

While the newspaper in the example looks fake now, it’s another step toward the potential erosion of the public’s perception of the pre-Internet historical record as image synthesis becomes more realistic.

OpenAI acknowledged in its blog post that the new model still has problems, including limited support for certain drawing styles and mistakes when generating images that require scientific accuracy. But they think it will get better over time. “We believe we’re still at the beginning of what image generation can enable,” the company wrote. And if the past three years of progress in image synthesis are any indication, they may be correct.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Back in October, word started making the rounds of an AI startup called Doublespeed. Backed by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, Doublespeed offers customers a unique service: access to a massive phone farm that could be used to operate hundreds of AI-generated social media accounts.

Now, 404 Media reports in an explosive scoop that Doublespeed has been hacked. This wasn’t just one account associated with the startup, but the entire backend used to manage its phone farm — so it provides an extraordinary glimpse at how the service is actually being used to manipulate social media at scale.

Speaking to 404 on condition of anonymity, the hacker said they can “see the phones in use, which manager [computers controlling the phones] they had, which TikTok accounts they were assigned, proxies in use (and their passwords), and pending tasks. As well as the link to control devices for each manager.”

The hacker also shared a list of over 400 TikTok accounts operated by Doublespeed’s phone farm, about half of which were actively promoting products. Most of them, the publication reports, did so without disclosing that the posts were ads — a direct violation of TikTok’s terms of use, not to mention the Federal Trade Commission’s digital advertising regulations.

While undisclosed ads might seem like small potatoes in the grand scheme of things, the speak to a bleak trend. Not only is Doublespeed a possible breeding ground for disinformation campaigns or financial scams, but they seem to be getting away with their phone farm operation without any pushback from TikTok.

Doublespeed’s TikTok accounts ran a gamut of different cons, promoting language learning apps, supplements, massage products, dating apps and more. One account, operating under the unambiguously human-sounding name of Chloe Davis, had uploaded some 200 posts featuring an AI-generated woman hawking a massage roller for a company called Vibit, 404 reported.

Though the hacker says he reported the vulnerability to Doublespeed on October 31, he notes that he still had access to the company’s back end as recently as today.

So far, Doublespeed is only active on TikTok, though it has plans to expand to Instagram, Reddit, and X-formerly-Twitter. When it does, it seems all bets are off — with social media engagement, and all the influence it entails, being relegated to the highest bidder.

            <h2>AI Sends School Into Lockdown After It Mistook a Student’s Clarinet for a Gun</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-17</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Students at Lawton Chiles Middle School in Florida were sent scrambling into lockdown last week, after an alert from an AI surveillance system detected a student carrying a gun.

There’s just one issue: the “gun” was actually a band student’s clarinet.

The whole thing unraveled quickly, according to local reporting. When the alert went out, it triggered an automatic “code red,” giving administrators no choice but to react to the AI system’s decision.

Luckily nobody was hurt, and local police soon declared the lockdown over. “The code red was a precaution and the children were never in any danger,” local police wrote in a Facebook post.

In a message to parents, school Principal Dr. Melissa Laudani said the district has “multiple layers of school safety, including an automated system that detects potential threats. A student was walking in the hallway, holding a musical instrument as if it were a weapon, which triggered the code red to activate.” (It’s not known what exactly constitutes a “code red,” as it isn’t mentioned in the school’s latest Parent Student handbook.)

Rather than blame the faulty AI system for the commotion — without which the fiasco never would have happened in the first place — the school blamed the young clarinetist.

“While there was no threat to campus, I’d like to ask you to speak with your student about the dangers of pretending to have a weapon on a school campus,” Laudani wrote.

It’s not known what particular system Lawton Chiles has on overwatch, but the fact that it can’t differentiate between a clarinet with 17 keys and a rifle with none is concerning.

The Lawton Chiles incident comes soon after another similar case, in which AI led to the violent detention of a 16-year old teen in Baltimore by at least eight officers with guns drawn. In that case, the school’s AI had somehow misidentified a small bag of Doritos for a handgun, prompting a heavily armed response from city police.

Like the story from Lawton Chiles, the Baltimore false positive could’ve easily been prevented had a human being been in the loop. Instead, it seems both systems allowed the AI to make the call without any challenge from a human being.

Omniilert, the company behind the Dorito incident, insisted that its AI system “functioned as intended: to prioritize safety and awareness through rapid human verification.”

It all underscores just how important it is that these AI school surveillance systems actually work before they’re forced into schools — because when it comes to identifying students with guns, false positives can be just as deadly as a false negatives.

            <h2>Sam Altman Uses His New Image Generator to Show Himself As a Jacked Fireman With Washboard Abs… With an Absolutely Hilarious Error</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Not using AI to pretend you have the hot bod of your dreams? Then clearly you’re not the CEO of a half-trillion-dollar AI company.

On Tuesday, OpenAI head honcho Sam Altman posted a holiday themed simulacrum of himself as a hunky firefighter with chiseled abs. Christmas lights are dangled around his neck like a bandolier, while he stands in front of an oversaturated smear that’s supposed to represent a decorated living room in the background. Shoved at the bottom is a calendar for the month of December.

The image was generated with the just-released new version of ChatGPT Images, GPT Image 1.5. OpenAI claims the new model “adheres to your intent more reliably,” allowing users to better fine-tune their images across multiple prompts “while keeping elements like lighting, composition, and people’s appearance consistent.”

The new model comes as Google dominates the conversation with its own image model released last month, Nano Banana Pro, which can generate astonishingly life-like images akin to what you’d see taken by a smartphone. That’s in addition to Google’s other recent showstopping AI release, Gemini 3 Pro, which together have largely dispelled the aura of invincibility OpenAI once possessed in the AI arms race. OpenAI has apparently been so rattled by Google’s massive leapfrog that Altman declared a “code red” behind the scenes.

He’s presenting a much different face to the world, though. The firefighter image of himself that looks ripped from the cover of a $8.99 smut paperback is another example of how Altman is willing to sacrifice whatever vestiges of self-respect he yet possess on the altar of hype through memes and cultural trends.

When OpenAI released Sora 2 this September, Altman allowed fans to use his likeness to generate deepfakes of himself. And the gamble paid off. AI corners of social media, not to mention the Sora 2 app itself, were drowning in a flood of videos showing Altman in all kinds of bizarre and absurd scenarios, like Altman wearing a dress and riding a horse through New York while firing a gun that dispenses money, and begging for GPUs through a doorbell camera, and even grilling a dead Pikachu.

That trend didn’t spawn out of nowhere. To kick off Sora 2’s launch, OpenAI posted a deepfaked video of Altman announcing the new AI app, and shared another promotional video generated with Sora that showed him on a slapstick quest to get to Sora’s launch on time.

Now Altman’s seemingly trying to recapture some of that viral potential with this latest debasement of himself created with his own tech, which is a little sad. It’s clearly a coordinated effort at the company, since another meme-ready AI image of Altman, wearing what appears to be at least five shirts, was posted by the official OpenAI account, too.

Unfortunately for Altman, his AI parody doesn’t look like it’s doing great numbers at the box office. In fact, many instead pointed out something in his firefighter image even more embarrassing than the fact that he was peddling AI thirst traps of himself: the December calendar at the bottom is straight-up inaccurate, showing dates that don’t align with the days of the week. Or at least, not this year; if he’d posted it in 2022 or 2033 instead, it would’ve been on the money.

            <h2>Instacart’s AI-driven pricing tool attracted attention — now the FTC has questions</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/instacarts-ai-driven-pricing-tool-attracted-attention-now-the-ftc-has-questions/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">According to Reuters, Instacart is currently getting the regulatory equivalent of a throat-clearing from the FTC, which has sent the grocery delivery platform a civil investigative demand regarding its AI-powered pricing tool, Eversight. Put another way, the agency wants to know why some people are paying substantially more for their organic granola than others.

The issue came to light after a study revealed that shoppers are seeing fairly different prices for identical groceries from the same stores — up to 23% higher prices in some cases. Instacart says these price tests were randomized, not tied to an algorithm that targets customers based on their browsing history. But when people are already anxious about affording eggs, that distinction probably doesn’t mean much.

Dynamic pricing isn’t new or necessarily nefarious. Harvard Business School will tell you it’s how digital platforms stay competitive. Airlines use it, hotels use it, Uber famously uses it. Companies argue that it helps balance supply and demand, maximizes profitability, and creates win-win scenarios.

But there’s a difference between paying surge pricing for a ride home from the bar and paying extra for groceries (food isn’t optional). So while the investigation doesn’t prove wrongdoing, it’s hardly shocking that the FTC — which has investigated data-driven pricing strategies by other companies — is reportedly asking questions. In an economy where everyone’s feeling squeezed, AI-driven price testing of kitchen essentials was bound to attract attention.

For its part, Instacart says the market misunderstands this particular initiative. “Much of what’s been reported has mischaracterized how pricing works on Instacart,” a spokesperson for the company tells TechCrunch. “First, our retail partners control their pricing strategies, and we work with them to align their online and in-store pricing wherever possible. Second, these tests are not dynamic pricing nor surveillance pricing – prices on Instacart do not change in real time nor are they based on supply or demand, and we never use personal, demographic, or user-level behavioral data to set item prices. These tests are a form of randomized A/B testing, similar to the way retailers have long run pricing tests between different stores.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Like pretty much every other tech company in existence, Adobe has leaned heavily into AI over the past several years. The software firm has launched a number of different AI services since 2023, including Firefly — its AI-powered media-generation suite. Now, however, the company’s full-throated embrace of the technology may have led to trouble, as a new lawsuit claims it used pirated books to train one of its AI models.

A proposed class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of Elizabeth Lyon, an author from Oregon, claims that Adobe used pirated versions of numerous books — including her own — to train the company’s SlimLM program.

Adobe describes SlimLM as a small language model series that can be “optimized for document assistance tasks on mobile devices.” It states that SlimLM was pre-trained on SlimPajama-627B, a “deduplicated, multi-corpora, open-source dataset” released by Cerebras in June of 2023. Lyon, who has written a number of guidebooks for non-fiction writing, says that some of her works were included in a pretraining dataset that Adobe had used.

Lyon’s lawsuit, which was originally reported on by Reuters, says that her writing was included in a processed subset of a manipulated dataset that was the basis of Adobe’s program: “The SlimPajama dataset was created by copying and manipulating the RedPajama dataset (including copying Books3),” the lawsuit says. “Thus, because it is a derivative copy of the RedPajama dataset, SlimPajama contains the Books3 dataset, including the copyrighted works of Plaintiff and the Class members.”

“Books3” — a huge collection of 191,000 books that have been used to train GenAI systems — has been an ongoing source of legal trouble for the tech community. RedPajama has also been cited in a number of litigation cases. In September, a lawsuit against Apple claimed the company had used copyrighted material to train its Apple Intelligence model. The litigation mentioned the dataset and accused the tech company of copying protected works “without consent and without credit or compensation.” In October, a similar lawsuit against Salesforce also claimed the company had used RedPajama for training purposes.

Unfortunately for the tech industry, such lawsuits have, by now, become somewhat commonplace. AI algorithms are trained on massive datasets and, in some cases, those datasets have allegedly included pirated materials. In September, Anthropic agreed to pay $1.5 billion to a number of authors who had sued it and accused it of using pirated versions of their work to train its chatbot, Claude. The case was considered a potential turning point in the ongoing legal battles over copyrighted material in AI training data, of which there are many.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman has been confirmed by the U.S. Senate as the next administrator of NASA. The private astronaut and founder of the Shift4 payments processing platform will now be in charge of an agency that faces great uncertainty under President Trump.

Isaacman’s confirmation comes a little over a year after Trump nominated him. It was a volatile year for Isaacman, though, as Trump pulled his nomination in June after becoming concerned about the billionaire’s “prior associations.” (Isaacman had previously donated to Democrats, something Trump was reportedly aware of when he first nominated the entrepreneur.)

That led to months of sniping between Trump’s camp and people more closely aligned with Isaacman, like SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who publicly attacked the credibility of acting NASA administrator Sean Duffy. Trump ultimately flipped in November and re-nominated Isaacman.

The billionaire will now oversee a trimmed-down space agency that Trump has tasked with returning to the moon. SpaceX has a contract to land astronauts on the lunar surface, though Duffy had threatened to revoke that contract, and encouraged Jeff Bezos’ rival company Blue Origin to try to beat Musk’s effort.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The president of the United States just barged into America’s living rooms like an angry, confused grandfather to tell us all that we are ungrateful whelps.

When a president asks for network time, it’s usually to announce something important. But tonight, Donald Trump did not give anything like a normal speech or address. He was clearly working from a prepared text, but it sounded like one he’d written—or dictated angrily—himself, because it was full of bizarre howlers that even Trump’s second-rate speech-writing shop would probably have avoided, such as his assertion that inflation when he took office was the worst it had been in 48 years. (Why did he pick 1977 as a benchmark? Who knows. But he’s wrong.) He read the speech quickly, his voice rising in frustration as he hurled one lie after another into the camera.

We could take apart Trump’s fake facts, as checkers and pundits will do in the next few days. But perhaps more important than false statements—which for Trump are par for the course—was his demeanor. Americans saw a president drenched in panic as he tried to bully an entire nation into admitting he’s doing a great job. For 20 minutes, he vented his hurt feelings without a molecule of empathy or awareness. Economic concerns? Shut up, you fools, the economy is doing fine. (And if it isn’t, it’s not his fault—it’s Joe Biden’s.) Foreign-policy jitters? Zip it, you wimps, America is strong and respected.

In effect, Trump took to the airwaves, pointed his finger, and said: Quiet, piggy.

I consider myself a connoisseur of Trump’s speeches. I’ve watched them and live-tweeted them for years because I think Americans need to see what kind of man sits in the Oval Office. But even by Trump’s standards, this was an unnerving display of fear. I can only imagine America’s enemies in Moscow and Beijing and Tehran smiling with pleasure as they watched a president losing his bearings, berating his own people, and demanding that they absolve him of any blame when things get worse.

His rant contained no news, other than an example of his contempt for the U.S. military, whose loyalty he thinks he can purchase with a onetime $1,776 bonus check. This is projection: Trump has shown his willingness to be bought off with gold bars and trinkets, and he may think that the men and women of the armed forces are people of equally low character.

This was not a holiday address from the leader of a great democracy to its citizens. This was a desperate tin-pot leader yelling into a microphone while cornered in his palace redoubt. The president has been unraveling for weeks, and his speech tonight, like Trump himself, was unworthy of America and its people.</div>

Last week, the Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado made a daring escape from her home country to Norway, where she was honored as winner of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize. The team that extracted her had several worries—including the risk that American forces in the Caribbean would strike the boats used in the operation, members told The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times.

Luckily, Machado avoided F-16s and drones on her way to Oslo, but the outcome her rescuers feared would have been remarkable: the man who campaigned frantically to win the Nobel Peace Prize inadvertently killing the woman who did, as part of a likely illegal series of boat strikes that may climax with a land war in South America.

Yesterday, Trump—who has deemed himself the “peace president”—escalated his belligerence against Venezuela, announcing a blockade of sanctioned oil tankers and demanding that the government “return to the United States of America all of the Oil, Land, and other Assets that they previously stole from us.” This is difficult to parse, but the Trump aide Stephen Miller suggests that it refers to past nationalization of the petroleum industry. In any case, a blockade could be an act of war under international law.

This past Friday, Trump said the United States would launch land strikes within Latin America. “We knocked out 96 percent of the drugs coming in by water, and now we’re starting by land, and by land is a lot easier, and that’s going to start happening,” Trump said in the Oval Office on Friday. The 96 percent mark is unrealistic and backed by no evidence, as is the notion that land wars are easier than drone strikes at sea.

Congress has neither authorized nor been asked to authorize these actions. The White House has relied on the tortured argument that because it has deemed that U.S. troops are not in active danger, the law doesn’t apply. Nor is it clear what the strategic rationale for such a strike on sovereign countries would be—much less the legal justification. (The administration insists its boat strikes are legal, but officials have been vague about their legal arguments and experts disagree.) Trump has claimed that drug interdiction is a goal, and said Friday that strikes might hit countries other than Venezuela.

But he has also been moving to force Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro out of power, as White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles told Vanity Fair in an article published this week. Although Trump claims that Maduro is a drug kingpin, American intelligence assessments contradict him, and my Atlantic colleagues have reported that the administration’s real goal is to gain access to oil and rare earth minerals. This apparent drift toward a 19th-century-style imperialist war is notable for a president who ran in 2016 criticizing both parties’ embrace of foreign military interventions. (Trump has said for years, however, that the U.S. should have taken Iraq’s oil—whatever that means.)

In the places where Trump is not on the verge of starting a new war, some of the many conflicts he claims to have resolved stubbornly refuse to stop. On the border between Thailand and Cambodia, both countries continue to fight, part of hostilities that have killed at least two dozen people and forced half a million to flee. Although Trump announced a cease-fire this past Friday, both governments said no such agreement has been struck.

In Africa, fighting also persists between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and a rebel group understood to be backed by neighboring Rwanda. In that case, Trump did manage to bring together the leaders of the DRC and Rwanda for a ceremony two weeks ago. The problem is that the peace hasn’t held; instead the rebel group has continued fighting. Secretary of State Marco Rubio described its actions as “a clear violation” of the cease-fire. A cease-fire in Gaza, achieved this fall, is also very tenuous. Israeli air strikes have continued sporadically, and Palestinian officials have said that at least 391 Palestinians have been killed since the agreement. The Israeli and U.S. governments sometimes question those figures, but Axios reports that the White House scolded the Israeli government for a strike over the weekend, which it said was a violation of the cease-fire.

Meanwhile, an end to the war in Ukraine, which Trump seems to want badly, remains elusive. On Monday, American officials said that the United States, Europe, and Ukraine have agreed to security guarantees for Ukraine, though it’s not clear whether Russia will accept the cease-fire plan. The larger problem is still land: As part of a deal, Trump is reportedly pressuring Ukraine to surrender territory that Russia has not managed to capture through its yearslong, grinding war of aggression involving frequent war crimes. For obvious reasons, that’s a nonstarter for Ukraine. But Russia—which knows that Trump likes and often caves to President Vladimir Putin—shows little interest in concessions.

There’s no shame in a president failing to resolve every conflict around the globe. Trump shouldn’t be expected to find solutions that have eluded previous leaders or bedeviled the world for decades—though he should be celebrated if he does; the Abraham Accords and the Gaza cease-fire are positive achievements. The problem is claiming to have resolved conflicts that aren’t over and announcing agreements that aren’t real. Trump doesn’t want to do the work, but he still wants the world to recognize his putative achievements with a Nobel Peace Prize. That honor seems out of reach barring some major developments, but at least he’s got the FIFA Peace Prize.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

In a quiet, almost empty part of Venice stands a Renaissance palazzo with an unusually large garden. The garden is invisible from the outside, blocked by a high brick wall that I recognized when I saw it. In The Aspern Papers, a novella serialized in The Atlantic in 1888, Henry James lets the narrator, a literary scholar whose name we never learn, describe the wall. “It was figured over with the patches that please a painter, repaired breaches, crumblings of plaster, extrusions of brick that had turned pink with time,” he writes. “It suddenly occurred to me that if it did belong to the house I had my pretext” …

I arrived in Venice with a similar goal: to get access to that same garden.

President Donald Trump’s prime-time address tonight included an Oprah-style You get a car! And you get a car! reveal for members of the U.S. military. Specifically, he said that he was giving troops a “war dividend,” a onetime bonus check pegged to a sum with deep patriotic significance: $1,776.

“The checks are already on the way,” Trump said during his address, promising them to more than 1.4 million troops.

The announcement was in keeping with the sort of grand gestures the president often favors. As the host of NBC’s The Apprentice, he savored dramatic twists and tense cliffhangers, and as a Manhattan developer, he reveled in emblazoning his name in big, bold (often gold) letters on his properties, a trend that has continued into his presidency. In his first term, Trump included his full name (“President Donald J. Trump”) just below the words “Economic Impact Payment” on stimulus checks, and his Treasury Department recently confirmed that a portrait of him—the image of him raising his fist following the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, and the words Fight. Fight. Fight.—may be featured on a commemorative $1 coin pegged to America’s 250th birthday next summer.

The $1,776 checks—which will go to every service member from the rank of private to colonel, or their equivalents—come at a moment when Trump’s relationship with the military is particularly complicated. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth—or secretary of war, as he prefers—prompted widespread ridicule when he summoned hundreds of commanders from around the world to Washington for a bellicose speech unveiling new physical-fitness standards for the military. Despite running as an “America First” isolationist, Trump seems to be inching ever closer to a war with Venezuela, as he and his team authorize military strikes on suspected drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean. He said yesterday that the United States will conduct a “blockade” to stop sanctioned oil tankers from entering Venezuela. Critics have argued that the more than two dozen boat strikes, which have so far killed 95 people, are illegal. And six Democratic lawmakers, all of whom served in either the intelligence community or the military, said that they were hearing so much uncertainty and concern from the rank and file that they felt compelled to release a video reminding service members that they are required to refuse illegal orders. (In response, Trump accused the lawmakers of sedition.)

Trump supporters will almost certainly celebrate the bonuses as yet another sign of a commander in chief who appreciates the men and women of the military. But a more cynical interpretation is that the money, although welcome, represents an attempt by Trump to buy loyalty. The bonuses will cost roughly $2.4 billion based on the figures the president provided. The money will come out of the defense budget, but officials have not said what they will cut in order to pay for the checks. The Pentagon referred requests for comment to the White House.

Generals and admirals are notably excluded from receiving the bonuses. Although they occupy the highest pay grades, they often draw the disdain of the defense secretary, who has fired or forced out more than two dozen top officers over the past year.

Read: Pete Hegseth is seriously testing Trump’s ‘no scalps’ rule

Earlier today, the president met with the relatives of two members of the Iowa National Guard and an interpreter killed in Syria as they arrived at Dover Air Force Base, in Delaware, for a dignified-transfer ceremony.

A $1,776 bonus is roughly the same as one month of base pay for a new Army private, not counting allowances for housing and meals. The administration has already given troops a 3.8 percent pay raise as part of the Senate bill that passed today, which allots more than $900 billion for defense. That legislation also increases the amount of additional pay that members of the military receive when they are separated from their family for more than 30 days. And the bill bans transgender women from participating in women’s sports at military-service academies.

The Atlantic reported earlier today that Trump was considering the idea of $1,776 bonuses, but the president did not officially settle on the decision until just hours before his speech.</div>

Yes, this is not knew.  I look at my son&#39;s games on his desktop, with his RTX4070, 32 gig of ram, his 2K monitor, & I just do not see the graphics much better, if at all, than 15 years ago.   I was playing one of the Wolfenstein games, a game that cost me around $20, & my nephew was amazed over the graphics & wanted to know what I was playing.

$1000 for a video card one would expect that the graphics would be advancing better.  Fallout 4 was choppy using a RTX970.  Upgrading it to a 2070 made it

24 out of those 32 gigs of ram is probably needed to run Windows alone

All the games I want for the next 10 years are available on the PS4.  A long time ago I realized that used video game consoles were still as good as the day they were released yet they are a quarter of the price.  My kids buy new games yet when they saw me playing my 10 year old game they complemented on how nice the game was.  I guess graphics haven&#39;t come that far.Similar to TV that way. Graphics are overblown.
When digital and hi-def TV came out, I was like &quot;eh, seeing the actors&#39; pores isn&#39;t going to improve anything. Good plots and characterization would.&quot; And so it is with games as well.

Dual Shock 4 controllers are getting quite expensive though, a friend of mine is looking to buy a new one and they are twice the price as I saw them a few months ago.

The key is th way a long time beteeen upgrades. We just got a PS5 (not hooked up yet). My last console was a PS2. In comparison, the graphics and everything else should be amazing.

Anyone remember the fact that video games cause violence?

Have you noticed how much video games Koreans play?

With the AI sucking all GPUs first and now RAM and SSD chips, hardware will get more expensive. And software pricing does not help. Yesterday I was browsing my Steam wrapped, and I only played 2% of games released in 2025. With new AAA games costing 80â or more (because of game passes and the like), I prefer playing grames from my backlog or buying good old games in sale.

There&#39;s just a stack of pressures against hardware sales. The press has been brutal.

- Higher hardware prices- Microsoft seeming to lose interest in the XBox- High profile flops- Triple-A cancellations- 5 year into current hardware for PS5/XBox - if you want one you probably have it- Rising economic and financial uncertainty- Incoming generations used to small format gaming- Cost of living already too high for Gen Z, and not getting better.

I&#39;ve got a Series X, and I suspect it&#39;s the last console I&#39;ll own. And I&#39;ve had consoles since I used a Coleco Telstar to burn bars into the phosphor on a TV in the late 70s. I&#39;m aging out - and I&#39;m taking my money with me.

And honestly, I really bailed a couple of years ago. I had the MS Game Pass for a while, but I haven&#39;t bought a major title in at least three years, and I haven&#39;t spent a dime on XBox-related anything in 2025. The last thing I actually played on Game Pass was a 15 year old platformer called &quot;Limbo&quot;.

The only reason why we need new hardware these days is because the game studios are prioritising the speed of development and can&#39;t be arsed optimising their code.

- Hey, our engine is laggy.- Just bump the requirements, mate.

In the old times, video games were art - both in terms of ingenuity, art and code. The developers of old would try to squeeze as much as they could out of available hardware, and make their games run on as little resources as possible.

These days, no one gives a crap. It&#39;s all about dish

I&#39;m guessing this has something to do with the announcement of the GabeCube.

Several times more games than I&#39;ve ever bought before in my life.

China can&#39;t really be expected to innovate because they lack the per-capita capital of the west which has a 100 year lead on technology vs. China. However Chinese immigrants educated in the West can innovate. For example every modern CPU uses a transistor type called &quot;FinFET&quot; which was invented by a person of Chinese descent. That&#39;s one example, there&#39;s of course many others.

What do &quot;facts&quot; like the Tiananmen Square democracy protests matter, right?

How is China being micromanaged when there are now multiple independent starship competitors? Because they aren&#39;t independent.

Not an actual starship clone. Minor detail, but not insignificant.

They forgot to add blockchain to the term &quot;AI rocket&quot;.

That would have increased their funding by at least 20%.

Maybe the next rocket startup which is copying SpaceX will mention that as well. /j

Didn&#39;t you claim that he was in Singapore? He&#39;d have to have pretty good aim to hit someone at MIT from there.

What&#39;s this BS lately where people can freely shoot others and there&#39;s no camera coverage whatsoever, no video of any suspects .. nothing. Brown university has no cameras and apparently neither do &quot;affluent&quot; suburbs in Boston. I hope the privacy lunatics are happy.

What are you talking about? They have certainly photos and video of the Brown University shooter - some have even been released.

Living in a fishbowl robs you of the ability to truly discover and become yourself. As such, public surveillance should be restricted to areas of high crime and critical infrastructure. Neither you nor the police are owed a 24/7 visual history of all locations in which a crime might occur.

I&#39;m sure the residents of his neighborhood can answer that question.

Brown university has plenty of cameras, it&#39;s just that the perp was wrapped up like a burrito, making it hard to see his face.

Ok, what car was he driving? Where did he go?

Brown University proudly advertises they have 800 cameras watching campus.

The press conferences the University administration and Police Department have been giving are a disorganized disaster.  They&#39;re hiding something.

Eh? Trump is after solar and wind, not hot fusion.  He might have pulled some funding here and there but nobody&#39;s trying to actively halt fusion research in the MAGA camp.

Canadian engineer Gerald Bull and quite a few Iranian nuclear scientists have been assassinated by the Israeli government. I&#39;d probably turn my attention for a killing like this first to Israel, or maybe Russia.  As far as I know, nobody has come up with any credible evidence that China is running hit squads targeting scientists and engineers in other countries.  They&#39;re more about letting you develop the tech, then stealing it.

When I started to listen to the much-hyped new podcast from Katie Miller, I’d hoped to learn something, anything, to justify the many irreplaceable hours of my life I had already committed to it. I wanted a salacious tidbit or quote from one of the nearly 20 episodes that have dropped since August. I wanted moments that might help me understand the kind of person who would be married to Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff and architect of many of the Trump administration’s harshest and darkest policies.

I did not get any of these things. The podcast, I’m afraid, is eye-wateringly boring—void of a single revelatory moment. House Speaker Mike Johnson is asked why he recently changed his style of glasses. Vice President J.D. Vance is asked to settle a debate as to whether a hot dog can be considered a sandwich. “Secretary of War” Pete Hegseth, appearing alongside his wife, is asked whether he prefers drumsticks, flats, or boneless wings. Sen. Katie Britt is asked how she passes time on airplanes. (Spoiler: she works.) And on it goes with Elon Musk, with “MAHA” influencer Vani Hari aka “Food Babe,” with actress Cheryl Hines, who is married to RFK Jr., and even with Attorney General Pam Bondi. Miller has access to a who’s who of high-profile MAGA figures, and she uses that time to ask them the most banal questions imaginable.

So that’s it? Skip the podcast and close this tab? Not so fast.

Yes, the podcast is dull in the extreme, and it seems to hinge in part on a bizarre assumption that the public is desperate for an inside glimpse of these people’s lives, in the vein of “Stars: They’re just like us.” But there’s something fascinating about it too: a bigger project with massive political and cultural ambitions, and one that we can’t afford to ignore. And the key to understanding that project is understanding Miller herself—where she came from and where she wants to go. In between listening to episodes of the show, I was talking to people who knew Miller growing up in Florida, and that’s when it all started to make more sense.

At a time when the military is bombing Venezuelan boats, National Guard troops are patrolling the streets of Washington, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are snatching parents off the streets in front of their children, Miller’s podcast—and her persona—is aimed at adding a patina of softness over a hard-right policy agenda. Surely the administration could not be as extreme or evil or fascist as its critics say if its members are chatting casually about raising their own children and picking new eyewear. The obvious audience for the podcast is white women, considered a swing demographic. (They favored Donald Trump by 4 points in 2024, according to Pew research, while white men went for Trump over Kamala Harris by a full 20 points. The divide is even larger among young women: Miller shared a graphic on her X account showing the widening partisan gulf between young men and women. “We aren’t talking to conservative women,” she wrote.)

So Miller announced her podcast in a video shared to X in August. In the video, Miller sits cross-legged in a gray armchair, wearing jeans and a white tank top, surrounded by soft lamps and plants, a copy of The Great Gatsby peeking out from a bookshelf behind her. “As a mom of three kids, who eats healthy, goes to the gym, works full time, I know there isn’t a podcast for women like myself,” Miller tells the camera. Bringing white women closer in line to their male counterparts would sharply reorient our politics and, if durable, could lead to something that looks like a permanent MAGA majority.

On some level, Miller is a strange choice for America’s trad-wife in chief. She married Stephen in 2020 at the Trump International Hotel, with the president himself in attendance. She too was a political player: She fell in love with Stephen over family-separation policies while she was working as a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security. (During her tenure at DHS, officials sent her to the southern border in the hopes that what she saw there might make her a little more compassionate. By her own telling, speaking to journalist Jacob Soboroff, “it didn’t work.”) Following her stint at DHS, she joined Vice President Mike Pence’s office as a spokesperson, later making it clear where her loyalties lay amid the bitter fallout between Pence and Trump over the Capitol riot. Earlier this year, she worked for DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency, under Musk.

And so Miller’s new position—in which she emphasizes her role as a wife and mother to three young children—has entailed a bit of a rebrand, shedding the image of a government attack dog in favor of a softer archetype. “When society told women that our value was derived from our ability to make an income instead of derived from the joy of motherhood we all failed,” Miller wrote online in October. “Make babies. Raise those babies. It’s our highest and best value.”

When I started talking to people who knew Miller before she was a retrofitted, would-be MAGA icon—before she ever met Donald Trump—they described a person with some altogether different ambitions. Through their eyes, the entire public project of the Millers takes on added dimensions. And it all helps explain why, if you look closely, it’s clear something has gone awry with the fantasy Katie Miller is trying to sell.

Before she was the bride of Stephen Miller, Katie Miller was 15-year-old Katie Waldman, attending the first debate class for the 10th grade of Cypress Bay High School, in Broward County, Florida. During the class, which was held in a portable trailer due to overcrowding, students were tasked with a graded assignment to give a short speech about themselves.

Miller’s address was particularly memorable: “She got up and said, ‘My father is a litigator, and my mom is a MILF. She does nothing but drive up and down the highway in her SUV until it’s time to pick me up from school,’ ” one former classmate told me. “What she meant was, ‘My dad is a rich guy, and my mom’s hot. That’s who I am, and that’s where I come from.’ She was super proud.”

Miller was raised in Weston, a suburban fever dream spread across 10,500 acres of what, before being drained for development, was once Everglades wetland. Weston was built by Arvida, the same company that designed Disney World and Celebration, the Disney-owned planned community. It’s meticulously organized perfection: Its various neighborhoods, gated communities, parks, and street are pristine and feature shallow lagoons and golf courses, palm trees and hibiscus, blue skies and backyard swimming pools. One comparison kept coming up when I interviewed people for this story: It was like The Stepford Wives, a place where rich dads go to work and hot moms pick up the kids in nice cars.

Weston was developed all at once in the 1990s and quickly cemented a reputation as a haven for “white flight,” only instead of white people fleeing Black people in inner cities, they were escaping the influx of immigration from Latino and Caribbean countries into Miami. In an interview with the Washington Post in 1998, Weston’s developers described the new suburb as “Our Home Town.” “It’s more like America,” one of them said.

Glenn J. Waldman and his wife, Sheryl, left their 2,000-square-foot home in northern Miami in 1994, after their daughter Katie was born, and bought a property in the neighborhood of Weston Hills, one of the most prestigious gated communities in Weston, where homes are painted in mandatory hues such as Champagne Dance and Grandma’s Linen. The Waldmans, who are Jewish, had three children in total, and Katie was the middle. Glenn Waldman was a longtime donor to Republican lawmakers, bucking the overwhelming liberal slant in Weston, which is currently represented in Congress by Democrat Debbie Wasserman Schultz.

As for Miller, former classmates remember her as having broadly conservative politics, but they say she was fairly liberal on social issues. Ryan Terrell was the captain of the debate team at Cypress Bay High School and coached her in debate for a semester. Terrell was one of the few openly gay kids at Cypress Bay. “When she got married to Stephen Miller and got more involved in conservative circles, I thought it was interesting, because we had this whole social culture-war issue and I never saw Katie advocating for banning it,” Terrell said. “We had political discussions back then, and she never seemed to be homophobic or having issues with the LGBTQ community.”

Miller was popular in the sense that she was part of a clique and had social status, but her former classmates said that popularity shouldn’t be confused with being well liked. “She was someone who was very interested in befriending others for status, more so than being a friend,” one classmate recalled. “She would drift towards whoever was in control or popular or whatever. A friend to many, but not really a good friend to any.” Former classmates remember her as wearing Juicy Couture tracksuits over a white top, poker-straight hair tied up in a ponytail. “She was very Valley Girl–ish,” Terrell said, “a teenage girl from an upper-income family in a wealthy neighborhood. She kind of talked like that, just without the California accent.”

She worked as a photo editor for the award-winning student newspaper the Circuit, which was featured in an MTV reality show, The Paper. She left there with plenty of critics: “You’re never surprised when you hear about something bad that Katie Waldman did,” said Emmi Weiner, who was an entertainment editor at the Circuit.

Miller was apparently happy to court controversy even as a teen. A 2020 feature in Vanity Fair about the Millers’ engagement resurfaced an incident involving Katie and a widely respected English teacher, Simone Waite—one of the school’s few Black faculty members. Waite had been teaching Toni Morrison’s Beloved, which provoked discussions about slavery. When Waite said that one of the many sins of slavery was that it erased Black people of their history, Miller objected. “Couldn’t they just tell each other about their history?” she asked, according to the Vanity Fair report. She wouldn’t let it go and, after Waite suggested they “agree to disagree,” left the class and drafted a petition accusing Waite of psychological damage, calling the teacher “sickening.” The issue was eventually resolved following a meeting involving Miller, her father, and Waite—during which they agreed to take Miller out of the class.

The world that shaped Miller’s early years was one of suburban perfection and sheltered artifice, a nostalgic ideal so far removed from reality that it shares a developer with Disney World. In many ways, it’s a fantasy that’s not far from the promises of MAGA.

Aug. 11, 2025, was a difficult day to soften the Trump administration’s rough edges. It was the same day that the president announced a de facto takeover of law enforcement in the District of Columbia, complete with National Guard troops in the streets and armored vehicles parked in front of Union Station. Although executed under the auspices of fighting “rising crime,” despite violent crime rates having decreased in D.C. since 2023, the maneuver also functioned as a declaration of MAGA dominance over a blue city.

Aug. 11 was also the airdate of Miller’s podcast’s first episode, featuring none other than Vice President J.D. Vance. The lighting in the video version was soft, and the topic was domestic bliss. Vance, an unapologetic apostle of Trump’s far-right agenda, spent much of the 45-minute interview playing a jolly sitcom dad who impersonates an “ogre” at Disneyland, makes cheesecake on weekends, and insists upon the whole family gathering for dinner at the dining table each night. Other topics mentioned included Vance’s fandom of Magic: The Gathering, his opinions on cargo shorts, his “dad icks,” his preferred memes, and his “secret to keeping his marriage solid.” (He and Usha read the same book and discuss it.)

The interview is utterly anodyne, a doddering exchange of pleasantries and carefully selected humanizing anecdotes. If you were to watch it in a vacuum, you’d have no sense of a country in a time of mass transformation. There’s no probing of Vance’s real views on domestic life, including his position that well-educated women who prioritize careers over starting families are choosing a “path to misery.”

Miller likes to conclude her interviews by asking her subject which three people, living or dead, they’d invite to dinner. Vance’s answer: Isaac Newton, Abraham Lincoln, and Donald Trump.

After Weston, Miller went to the University of Florida, her father’s alma mater, and pledged to the Alpha Omicron Pi sorority. She joined the ruling party of Florida’s student government, which presided over some 60,000 students, in an initial foray into politics that was, to say the least, eventful.

Back then, Florida’s student government had a reputation of operating a little like an autocracy. The governing party—which has changed its name over the years but was known as the Unite Party at the time Miller joined—was ruled by the iron fists of privileged frat boys and sorority girls, who controlled the school’s spending and were tapped for access to the exclusive Florida Blue Key society. After graduation, they were funneled into elected office and law clerkships.

Miller, typically seen on campus in the sorority girl’s uniform of Nike shorts and a sorority-branded raincoat, quickly established herself as a power player in this world and operated like a “henchman” for the ruling party, said one former student. Members of opposing parties in student government typically were collegial with one another, socializing together despite disagreements. Not Miller.

“Katie’s a very tenacious, self-assured individual,” recalled Jordan Ball, who was a senator for the opposition party. “She looked down on people she didn’t agree with.” Another former member of the student government described Miller’s approach to politics as “tribal.” “Most people in student government would be cordial and nice and would try to work together,” they said. “I feel like it was Katie’s whole life. She took it all very personally.”

Multiple people I spoke to said that the Unite Party, which was overwhelmingly white, had a pattern of punishing Black and Hispanic affinity groups financially if they didn’t rally behind them during campaigns. “It was an open secret, but it still seemed strange on the outside, like, Why are these groups kowtowing to sororities and frats which were mostly white?” recalled one former member of student government. “Those groups would end up endorsing a bunch of frat bros.” (In 2016 those claims were among the many grievances that drove the student-led #NotMySystem movement, which called out the elitist and even corrupt practices of majority student government.)

In 2012, her sophomore year, while serving on the rules and ethics committee of student government, Miller was embroiled in a scandal. The head football coach had endorsed a candidate from the opposition Students Party, and the Independent Florida Alligator, the college paper, ran a front-page story publicizing it. Two people—later revealed to be Miller and former Student Government President Pro Tempore Jason Tiemeier—were spotted dumping 268 copies of the newspaper on the eve of student elections.

“Especially after stealing the newspapers, she had a reputation, not just with us, but throughout the whole school, of being unethical,” said Ford Dwyer, who was a senator for the opposition party. Some people who knew her told me that they were a little scared of her back then, pointing to what they saw as a vindictive streak. Despite this reputation, Miller continued to rise through the ranks of the Unite Party, acquiring more and more power and responsibility, including being appointed to chair the allocations committee.

Her ascent after all this was the subject of numerous editorials in the Independent Florida Alligator, including one with the headline “Katie Waldman Should Resign.” “Sen. Katie Waldman’s appointment to the position of allocations chairwoman is an affront to the students of UF,” wrote Max Stein, who was part of the opposition party. “I do not question her qualifications, passion or work ethic. I question her ethical and moral fiber.”

The paper’s editorial board didn’t pull any punches either. “With the recommendation that Waldman head a committee, bad behavior is being rewarded and the corruption continues to seep deeper into the fabric” of student government, the board wrote.

The Unite Party went on the attack against the student newspaper. “They have thrown away journalist integrity,” candidate TJ Villamil said in a video posted to YouTube. “Misrepresenting facts, inaccurate quotes, and completely falsified stories are just some of the few ways they’ve attempted to skew my message to the voters.”

After a tenure in the senate that was defined by scandal, Miller was not invited by party leadership to run for her seat again. Departing senators are typically invited to get up and give goodbye speeches, and Miller’s was, by all accounts, memorable. She was bitter about not being asked to run again and felt betrayed. She delivered a glowering, chaotic speech that was full of tacit threats. “The sense that everyone got was that they’d better all be careful or else, because she had information on them, and she better be respected because she had secrets that she might or might not reveal,” Dwyer recalled.

The circumstances surrounding party leadership’s decision to ultimately remove her from power in 2013 remain a mystery and were subject to much speculation and gossip, particularly as those leaders were seen as her closest friends. But Miller’s fiery speech also got people talking: “It left a very big impression,” Dwyer said. “I think she felt like a victim.”

Narratives of victimhood, disenfranchisement, and persecution have been foundational to the collective identity of the MAGA movement. Trump has regularly cast himself as the ultimate martyr, routinely claiming that the system is rigged against him and his supporters by all manner of nefarious forces. “There has never been a president who was so evilly and illegally treated as I,” Trump declared after a New York judge scheduled sentencing for his criminal hush money conviction on Jan. 10, 10 days prior to his inauguration.

And Trump’s disciples, including Katie Miller, insist they are being persecuted by the very same forces.

By the time Pam Bondi appeared on Miller’s podcast on Sept. 15, MAGA victimhood was cresting. It was five days after the shooting of Charlie Kirk, and the administration was determined to forge the killing into a broader narrative of anti-conservative persecution. There was discussion of the rising threat of antifa and left-wing political violence, of how Bondi survives “ugly, hateful” comments online and from in-person protesters, and of the LGBTQ agenda coming for America’s Christian children. “I think a lot of moms have come forward now, since they were putting this crazy ideology in our schools, these transgender books for elementary schools,” Bondi said. “They’re mama bears, and they’re coming out, and they’re going to run for office, and they’re going to become more vocal.” (Miller has also talked about how she pulled her daughter out of day care after the kids read a children’s book about gay penguins in New York’s Central Park Zoo.)

“Victimhood is currency for women on the far right,” said Seyward Darby, author of Sisters in Hate: American Women on the Front Lines of White Nationalism. “Women in this space hide when they play the victim. They hide their complicity. They play the ‘I’m just a nice woman or wife or mother or all of the above’ card and suggest that criticism of them is unwarranted because of that. They try to make themselves untouchable.”

Miller has played that card herself. During a panel appearance on Piers Morgan’s show this fall, she got into an argument with Turkish American commentator Cenk Uygur after he criticized her husband for lying. “Piers, quite frankly, I’m really sick and tired of this racist bigoted rhetoric that can come from people like you against my husband, against my family and my children,” Miller said in a raised voice. “I am raising Jewish children in this country.”

She continued: “You better check your citizenship application that everything was legal and correct,” she said. “Because you’ll be just like Ilhan Omar coming next.”

After college, Miller rose quickly through the ranks of the Republican Party, working for senators and the first Trump administration, where she met her future husband. The pair married in 2020. During the Biden years, Miller served as a senior adviser for P2 Public Affairs, a firm linked to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. At the time that Miller joined the firm, DeSantis was Trump’s main competitor for the 2024 Republican nomination. “It was not lost on others in Mr. Trump’s circle that the Miller family seemed well hedged for any outcome,” a report in the New York Times noted. After Trump clinched victory in the 2024 election, Miller came aboard his transition team as the media contact for Health and Human Services nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr. She told Politico that she had no plans to join the Trump administration and would remain at P2.

That soon changed. Elon Musk, who credited himself for Trump’s win, had become a near-constant fixture at Mar-a-Lago (much to the chagrin of Trump insiders) and was mapping out an expansive role for himself in the new administration. That role ended up being the head of the Department of Government Efficiency. The president wanted Miller involved. “Katie Miller will soon be joining DOGE!” Trump posted on Truth Social. “She has been a loyal supporter of mine for many years.” Miller became Musk’s henchwoman, and Musk regularly spent time at the Millers’ residence. When Trump and Musk’s relationship inevitably imploded—their high-profile breakup playing out over a string of caustic posts online—Miller reportedly demurred from taking sides, and even had plans at one point to continue working for Musk in his private projects after he left the government.

She never followed through with those plans. But she did have Musk on her podcast earlier this month. Though it’s a low bar, the Musk episode is perhaps the most compelling of the bunch. He’s without question her biggest-name guest, someone whose daily habits, internal life, and personal tastes could be of genuine interest to the viewer. They discuss a range of subjects, such as Musk’s frustration that fashion isn’t evolving quickly enough, his views on DOGE’s legacy, and A.I.

But before long, Miller’s interview style arrives to once again flatten the proceedings. “Cheeseburgers are amazing,” Musk declares at one point. “A genius invention.”

The paradox of many content creators in the womanosphere is that they promote traditional gender roles—telling women that their main priorities should be to take care of their families—all while pursuing lucrative careers of their own. Miller is no exception: She may be out of politics, but her own effort to ascend in the right-wing media complex is plenty ambitious.

“There is an imperative on the far right that women, even ones who are successful in business, politics, or other worldly spaces, must be traditionally feminine and care about traditionally feminine things,” said Darby. “They must purport to believe that their highest calling is being a wife and mother. They must embrace that calling as not just a personal one but also one in service of a nationalist agenda. Katie Miller is playing her part—or trying, anyway.”

That part was on full display when Miller hosted Katie Britt, the 43-year-old Republican senator from Alabama. Britt is, by any standard, ambitious and accomplished. In 2022, at age 40, she became the youngest GOP woman elected to the Senate—and the first female senator from Alabama. She has a law degree, which she got while a mother to two young children. She was elected president of the student’s government association while at the University of Alabama. She was invited to deliver the GOP rebuttal to Joe Biden’s State of the Union last year—and did so from her kitchen, of all places. “This is where our family has tough conversations,” Britt said. “It’s where we hold each other’s hands and pray for God’s guidance.”

But the podcast episode with Miller seems to be an opportunity for Britt to downplay her ambition, to remind everyone that she’s a mom and a wife first and foremost. It’s filmed in Britt’s home, and the two women sit on white floral armchairs in a Southern-style sunroom. Britt is, by her own description, a “Patriot wife” because she’s married to Wesley Britt, whom she met at the University of Alabama and who was a tackle for three seasons for the New England Patriots.

Britt tells Miller that her decision to run for Senate was a religious calling, and that when her son was 10 years old, he came to her and asked to speak privately. He then presented her with a list of reasons for why she needed to run. “I want people to know how much you love Jesus,” he told her. “I want them to know what a good mom you are.” Then he added: “Mom, I definitely think they need to know about your passion for small business.”

Miller talks to Britt about her weekly schedule, which generally requires senators to be in D.C. Monday through Thursday. “Do you cook Sunday nights for family dinner?” Miller asks Britt. Britt stammers in response: “I don’t always—you know, yes, I cook Sunday nights for dinner, but I was about to say, I don’t always crush it.”

There is one more thing to know about Miller’s podcast, and that is that so far it’s a flop.

The podcast was supposed to be soft-lit counterprogramming to the second Trump administration’s daily horrors. And Miller keeps bagging major guests—veritable Trump-orbit superstars, such as Pete Hegseth and Mike Johnson and their spouses, to say nothing of Musk. And yet, despite it all, its numbers have flatlined. Most of her YouTube episodes get mired in the 10,000-view mark, with a couple of exceptions. (The Musk interview racked up half a million views.) At least for now, her metrics put her far behind the likes of other conservative women podcasters: Influencers like Brett Cooper, Pearl Davis, and Allie Beth Stuckey easily get hundreds of thousands of views on their YouTube videos. Unlike Miller, they’ve been toiling in the proverbial content mines for years, and they now have the audience to show for it.

“Despite what she said when she launched the show, she isn’t filling a gap in the cultural space,” said Darby. “There is already plenty of content out there for MAGA moms.”

If I’ve learned anything about Miller through talking to the people who’ve known her throughout her life, it’s that she cannot be happy about all this. (Miller did not respond to requests for comment.)

Where is she going wrong? Why, with her pick of MAGA world for a guest list, is Miller finding a relatively puny audience?

It’s hard to say for certain. As is probably clear by now, Miller herself is neither a particularly compelling interviewer nor one who produces the types of viral moments that political podcasts thrive on in the current era. But the project’s faults may run deeper than that. The podcast seems engineered around highlighting the softer side of this administration’s figures. And that task may be impossible for half of Miller’s potential audience and not desired by the other.

For right-leaning MAGA skeptics, who could be won over by Hegseth’s wing choices at a time when he’s reveling in obliterating small ships off the coast of Venezuela? Who’s going to believe that Bondi is an aggrieved figure at a time when her Justice Department is openly, proudly serving as Trump’s personal score-settler?

And for the MAGA faithful, are they really looking for these figures to be softened? What about this movement, born of mass rage and now on a four-year vengeance tour, suggests that the base is looking for any sort of cover?

It is, after all, a podcast aimed at making MAGA approachable to the center—and in Trump’s America, it has long been clear that the center cannot hold.

The most recent episode of the podcast features FBI Director Kash Patel and his girlfriend, country-music artist Alexis Wilkins. It begins with the disclaimer that the episode was recorded prior to the mass shooting at Brown University that left two dead, nine injured, and the shooter at large. The episode is full of idle chatter: Wilkins explains that she’s had to change her posting habits since getting booed up with the head of the FBI. Patel defends using a private jet to go see her, and discloses their shared love of a “surf and turf” night of lobster and steak.

It’s not that antisemitism ever went away, but it’s still jarring to watch people spread its oldest and most vile tropes on social media in a way that would’ve been unthinkable ten years ago.

            <h2>React2Shell exploitation spreads as Microsoft counts hundreds of hacked machines</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/18/react2shell_exploitation_spreads_as_microsoft/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft says attackers have already compromised &quot;several hundred machines across a diverse set of organizations&quot; via the React2Shell flaw, using the access to execute code, deploy malware, and, in some cases, deliver ransomware.

In a blog post this week, Redmond said attackers are actively exploiting CVE-2025-55182, better known as React2Shell, a critical flaw in React Server Components that can be abused to run arbitrary code on vulnerable servers.

According to Microsoft&#39;s threat intelligence team, exploitation has already spread well beyond the proof-of-concept stage, with hundreds of compromised systems confirmed across multiple sectors and regions.

The company said attackers are abusing the flaw to run arbitrary commands, drop malware, and pivot deeper into victim environments, often blending the activity into legitimate-looking application traffic.

React2Shell first burst into the open earlier this month, when researchers warned the React Server Components bug could be exploited to execute attacker-controlled code. The bug was quickly chained to other weaknesses and misconfigurations, with early campaigns linked to China and Iran-nexus threat activity that probed exposed servers at scale. A separate wave of disclosures days later revealed additional &quot;SecretLeak&quot; bugs in React tooling, further rattling developers who had only just begun to understand the blast radius of React2Shell.

Microsoft&#39;s latest findings suggest exploitation attempts ramped up rapidly after public disclosure, with attackers using successful exploits to push malware – including memory-based downloaders and cryptominers – onto exposed JavaScript application backends.

Other threat intelligence teams are seeing the same thing on the ground. Security firm S-RM said it has already responded to a real-world intrusion in which React2Shell was used as the initial access vector to breach a corporate network and deploy ransomware.

&quot;This is the first time S-RM has observed this vulnerability being used by financially motivated threat actors to facilitate a cyber extortion attack, and highlights an escalation in the known impact of this vulnerability compared to other public reporting, which has so far primarily documented instances of the vulnerability being used to introduce backdoor malware or cryptominers,&quot; the company said.

Telemetry also points to industrial-scale abuse. Andrew Morris, founder of GreyNoise, wrote on LinkedIn that exploitation remains intense weeks after disclosure.

&quot;React2Shell continues to pop off by our count at GreyNoise Intelligence,&quot; Morris said. &quot;We continue to stack a pretty hefty number of distinct malware payloads. Exploitation is still very high with the number of cumulative networks exploiting this vuln reaching all-time highs almost every single day since disclosure.&quot;

The scale reflects how widely React Server Components have been adopted. Designed to offload rendering work to the server to improve performance, the technology is now embedded in countless production apps, with one estimate suggesting that 39 percent of cloud environments are vulnerable to the React2Shell flaw.

The exact number of known React2Shell victims is not yet known, but Palo Alto Networks has confirmed that more than 50 organizations have so far been compromised. However, the true figure is likely much higher, as researchers warned last week that half of the systems vulnerable to the bug remain unpatched.

For organizations still scrambling to respond, Microsoft urged teams to apply available patches, audit exposed React Server Component deployments, and monitor for signs of exploitation. With exploitation still surging and patching incomplete, React2Shell remains wide open for abuse. ®

            <h2>BBC tapped to stop Britain being baffled by AI</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-18</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The UK government wants the BBC to help Brits understand AI and develop basic technology skills as part of the public broadcaster&#39;s next charter period.

In its charter review published on December 16, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) says it wants the Beeb to become a &quot;trusted guide&quot; in navigating technological change.

&quot;In particular, we want the BBC to support basic and universal skills on the one hand, and on the other to help the public understand AI, engage with it constructively and understand its impacts.&quot;

This could include teaching people to recognize AI-generated content, assess its reliability, and learn basic prompting skills.

The aims echo the BBC&#39;s Computer Literacy Project, which launched in 1979, contributing to the UK&#39;s home computing boom of the 1980s. That initiative produced a series of programmes to educate people about software and hardware, including The Computer Programme, Making the Most of the Micro, and Micro Live.

The project led to co-development of the BBC Microcomputer, which Cambridge-based computer maker Acorn launched in 1981, selling more than 1.5 million units. Acorn developed the Arm processor in 1985, and in 1990 set up Arm as a joint venture with Apple and VLSI Technology. The tech has since been included in more than 325 billion devices.

DCMS also wants the BBC to explain how it uses AI internally – something the corporation has already committed to through transparency principles published last year.

The broadcaster is using generative AI to write text for the BBC Sounds app, based on its live radio commentary of some football matches, though its research has found that AI chatbots often can&#39;t reliably summarize BBC news stories.

The charter review, which will shape the BBC&#39;s goals for the decade from January 2028, explores alternative funding models including advertising on its UK website or across all platforms, subscriptions for some content, and increased commercial revenues.

DCMS wants to work with the BBC on whether its archives could be used to train AI to generate revenue, and suggests the corporation could use AI to lower its costs as well as supporting smaller public service media organizations in negotiating with AI companies. ®

            <h2>DVSA's clapped-out booking system gets bot slapped as new boss rides in</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/18/dvsa_bot_booking/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The UK&#39;s Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) has appointed a new chief exec to tackle spiraling waits for practical driving tests with bots overrunning its aging booking system.

Beverley Warmington will join the agency on January 5. &quot;I have every confidence she will grip the driving test backlog and robustly oversee the reforms needed to ensure learners can get on the road when they are truly ready and safe to do so,&quot; said roads and buses minister Simon Lightwood.

Most practical driving test slots at DVSA centers are snapped up immediately after release – 24 weeks in advance. The National Audit Office (NAO) found that 198 (70 percent) of the agency&#39;s 240 permanent test centers reported a 24-week wait in September. The average wait is 22 weeks, with DVSA not expecting to meet a seven-week target until November 2027.

Much of the demand comes from two types of paid bot services. Cancellation checkers alert candidates to newly released slots, sometimes booking on their behalf. Resellers tell candidates to book any nationwide slot, then charge them to swap it for a bot-booked test at their preferred location and date.

A DVSA survey of 21,656 candidates found 31 percent of candidates used third-party resellers, with some paying up to £500 versus the £62 official weekday fee.

The NAO said DVSA has struggled to tackle bots due to technical issues and staffing shortages. Its booking system is almost 18 years old and has what the report called &quot;significant security and operational limitations,&quot; with high levels of demand making it unstable at peak times.

It handled 50 million web requests a day through bot protection in September 2025, up from around 10 million a day in September 2024, with one day seeing more than 94 million requests.

When the DVSA fights back, the bots often win. &quot;Third parties develop bots at pace, quickly overcoming any new protection measures,&quot; the NAO said. &quot;For example, DVSA&#39;s introduction of a key anti-bot measure was neutralized by bot developers within one day.&quot;

The agency has no dedicated in-house staff working to defend it against bots, relying instead on existing staff developing expertise and support from suppliers. DVSA said it has automated some bot protection work and is continuing to look for ways to protect itself better. Its webpages on GOV.UK include specific instructions on what to do if specific error messages appear during booking.

As well as the impact on candidates, bot bookings hamper DVSA&#39;s ability to establish actual demand for tests, particularly by area given bookings made purely to swap for other ones. Maps in the report show bookings for DVSA&#39;s Inverness center made from addresses in southern England and bookings for Launceston in Cornwall made from northern Scotland, although it says there may be reasons in some cases, including students living away from home.

The agency allows instructors and businesses to book then swap tests between candidates they are teaching, with 327,000 swapped in 2024 (17 percent of the total). This year, DVSA closed 880 business accounts used for excessive booking and swapping, and limited swaps per driver from 30 to 10.

From spring 2026, only candidates can book practical tests, with two changes to a booking allowed and even then only to a test center near the original booking.

Overall, the NAO saw low examiner numbers as the main issue. &quot;We recommend that DVSA reviews what is driving the increased demand for tests and looks at what is needed to scale up the examiner workforce for increased test delivery,&quot; said report director Lee Summerfield.

Slot-booking bots have just made things worse. ®

It will also allow third-party payment processing and web purchases, though with new fees to compensate.

Apple has announced the changes it’s making to the iOS App Store in Japan in order to comply with recent legislation in the country. It will allow third-party app stores and payment processing options, though is introducing new commission fees for those transactions.

Developers in Japan will now be able to distribute apps on alternative app stores, much like in the EU, with AltStore PAL already expecting to launch in the country before the year’s end. As in Europe, Apple will collect a 5 percent commission for in-app purchases made in third-party stores.

App Store apps will also now be permitted to use alternative payment options alongside Apple’s, or link out to websites where users can make purchases. Apple will still charge up to 21 percent per transaction for in-app purchases, with a 15 percent commission for digital goods bought through a website linked from the app.

Apple will include warnings to users when using third-party stores or alternative payment options. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney pointed to those warnings, and Apple’s commission fees, when confirming that Fortnite won’t yet return to iOS in Japan. Similar warnings and fees have been at issue in the US, where Apple recently lost an appeal in its ongoing antitrust dispute with Epic.

            <h2>Kuxiu’s S3 MagSafe power bank is bigger and better and probably won’t explode</h2>
            <p><strong>The Verge | 2025-12-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/846094/kuxiu-s3-solid-state-power-bank-review">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Its semi-solid state chemistry is less prone to thermal runaway and should last longer.

Kuxiu is back with a new S3 portable battery that addresses most of the issues I had during my review of the S2, aka the “world’s first” semi-solid state power bank. It also introduces a few new ones, while adding useful features like a kickstand and integrated USB-C cable.

As a reminder, these are not true “solid state power banks” despite the marketing hype. The 10,000mAh Kuxiu S3 uses the same solid-liquid mixed electrolyte found in the S2, making it less prone to thermal runaway than the all-liquid Lithium-ion batteries found in most power banks. Kuxiu says its unique semi-solid state chemistry also lasts twice as long, making it good for about 1,000 charging cycles before the battery capacity drops to 80 percent.

The S3 is more expensive to purchase than other 10,000mAh power banks, typically rated for 300-500 cycles. It lists for $149.98 but is frequently discounted, selling for less than $70 at the time of this writing. At that price, it should be cheaper to own over its longer lifetime.

While it’s easy to discount the safety claim — don’t. In September, Anker issued a recall of 481,000 power banks due to the risk of fire and explosion. And just last week, INIU recalled 210,000 power banks sold on Amazon that were implicated in 11 fires causing over $380,000 in property damage. It’s been a busy year for power bank recalls.

Safety aside, Kuxiu has also fitted the S3 with lots of useful upgrades. In addition to twice the battery capacity, you get a folding metal kickstand, digital display, and detachable USB-C cable that tucks into the perimeter when not in use. You also get faster 30W charging input and Qi2 output up to 25W for devices that support the latest wireless charging standard.

On paper, this all sounds great — and it is — but that larger battery is heavy when used as a MagSafe charger, and it’s far less pocketable. At 106.9 x 71 x 22.15mm (4.20 × 2.79 × 0.87 inches) and a weight of 245.3g (8.65oz), the S3 adds considerable bulk and heft to my 187-gram / 6.6-ounce iPhone 15 Pro. Fortunately, the S3’s stronger array of 18 N52 magnets does a good job of holding everything together and properly aligned for charging.

To test the unit’s 10,000mAh (5,000mAh at 7.7V, or 38.5Wh) rated capacity, I plugged the S3’s integrated USB-C cable into a ChargerLAB POWER-Z C240 power meter, which then slotted into the USB-C jack on my iPhone 15 Pro. I was able to charge the iPhone from 0 to 100 percent once, and then again from 0 to 92 percent before the S3 power bank was empty. I measured 31.12Wh of useful output capacity for 80.83 percent efficiency from the DC/DC circuit, which is typical.

The flat, integrated USB-C cable that tucks into the S3’s perimeter is super useful. Power banks are getting all kinds of unnecessary features these days, but the value of having a cable always at the ready should not be underestimated. While the S3 can’t fully charge my MacBook Pro’s larger battery, it can provide a few extra hours of runtime. The maximum charging speed of the S3 is just 35W, however, which is on par with this class of batteries.

Kuxiu still sells the more portable 5,000mAh S2, which is currently available for $49.99. The bigger S3 currently lists for $68.99 and offers double the battery capacity, a display showing percent remaining, more powerful wired and wireless charging, and the convenience of a kickstand and USB-C cable always available.

Compared to power banks sold by the likes of Anker, EcoFlow, and hundreds of alphabet-soup brands like, um, Kuxiu, the S2 and new S3 semi-solid-state chemistry should be safer and cheaper to own, making them very hard to beat if you’re currently in the market.

            <h2>Cowboy saddles up with a new owner</h2>
            <p><strong>The Verge | 2025-12-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/847097/cowboy-acquired-by-rebirth-recycles-bankruptcy">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Brussels-based electric bike company has officially closed its deal to be acquired by ReBirth Group Holding, which also owns cycling brands Peugeot, Gitane, and Solex. The transaction includes new, undisclosed funding from ReBirth as well as €15 million ($17.6 million) from existing shareholders. The funding will be used to restart production and deal with a backlog of spare parts, the companies say.

Rebirth is the parent of Re-cycles, the French manufacturer of traditional bicycles that took over responsibility for Cowboy’s e-bike assembly operations earlier this year. Cowboy was plagued by issues in 2025, including delayed deliveries and repairs, as well as a costly frame recall (caused by a previous manufacturing partner) that brought the company within weeks of bankruptcy.

Cowboy, and its in-house design, engineering, and software teams, will continue to operate independently from Brussels. But Cowboy founder and CEO Adrien Roose has left the company. “My hope is that this new partnership will make Cowboy more reliable for riders in the long term. To keep them on the road and supported in the best way possible,” said Roose in a press release.

With the deal done, priorities include the production of 1,500 new bikes in January to help clear the backlog of orders. Customers waiting on their e-bike will receive updated delivery timelines “in the coming weeks.” Lead times should be considerably reduced by Spring 2026.

The deal should also give Cowboy a greater presence in France by leveraging ReBirth’s 95 Oxygen and 10 Ovelo bike stores, in addition to its network of 500 independent bike dealers.

Longer term, we can expect to see Cowboy’s e-bike smarts come to ReBirth’s other brands. “Cowboy’s digital expertise and platform capabilities will also support innovation across other ReBirth brands, applying the same data-driven systems and tools that have defined Cowboy’s approach to connected mobility,” reads the press release.

“I would like to thank Cowboy’s founders for their vision, ambition, and the remarkable company they have built in a difficult market,” said Grégory Trébaol, CEO of ReBirth Group Holding. “This transaction opens a new chapter for Cowboy.”

Cowboy — like all bicycle makers — has suffered from the covid-era boom-bust cycle that wreaked havoc on the industry. A costly frame recall announced in May was nearly disastrous. Cowboy had to take on short-term financing in August just to keep the lights on. Fortunately, it managed to avoid bankruptcy unlike VanMoof and, just yesterday, Rad Power Bikes. Other boutique e-bike makers like Ampler and GoCycle managed to find buyers before the clock ran out.

With Cowboy acquired, the glory days of independent, direct-to-consumer, e-bike startups that injected excitement and innovation into the bicycle industry are now well and truly over.

            <div id="article-text">Welcome to our annual list of the worst, least successful, and simply dumbest technologies of the year.

This year, politics was a recurring theme. Donald Trump swept back into office and used his executive pen to reshape the fortunes of entire sectors, from renewables to cryptocurrency. The wrecking-ball act began even before his inauguration, when the president-elect marketed his own memecoin, $TRUMP, in a shameless act of merchandising that, of course, we honor on this year’s worst tech list.

We like to think there’s a lesson in every technological misadventure. But when technology becomes dependent on power, sometimes the takeaway is simpler: it would have been better to stay away.

That was a conclusion Elon Musk drew from his sojourn as instigator of DOGE, the insurgent cost-cutting initiative that took a chainsaw to federal agencies. The public protested. Teslas were set alight, and drivers of his hyped Cybertruck discovered that instead of a thumbs-up, they were getting the middle finger.

On reflection, Musk said he wouldn’t do it again. “Instead of doing DOGE, I would have, basically … worked on my companies,” he told an interviewer this month. “And they wouldn’t have been burning the cars.”

Regrets—2025 had a few. Here are some of the more notable ones.

Imagine a metal butler that fills your dishwasher and opens the door. It’s a dream straight out of science fiction. And it’s going to remain there—at least for a while.

That was the hilarious, and deflating, takeaway from the first reviews of NEO, a 66-pound humanoid robot whose maker claims it will “handle any of your chores reliably” when it ships next year.

But as a reporter for the Wall Street Journal learned, NEO took two minutes to fold a sweater and couldn’t crack a walnut. Not only that, but the robot was teleoperated the entire time by a person wearing a VR visor.

Still interested? Neo is available on preorder for $20,000 from startup 1X.

It’s been said that San Francisco is the kind of place where no one will tell you if you have a bad idea. And its biggest product in a decade—ChatGPT—often behaves exactly that way.

This year, OpenAI released an especially sycophantic update that told users their mundane queries were brilliantly incisive. This electronic yes-man routine isn’t an accident; it’s a product strategy. Plenty of people like the flattery.

But it’s disingenuous and dangerous, too. Chatbots have shown a willingness to indulge users’ delusions and worst impulses, up to and including suicide.

In April, OpenAI acknowledged the issue when the company dialed back a model update whose ultra-agreeable personality, it said, had the side effect of “validating doubts, fueling anger, urging impulsive actions, or reinforcing negative emotions.”

Don’t you dare agree the problem is solved. This month, when I fed ChatGPT one of my dumbest ideas, its response began: “I love this concept.”

When you tell a lie, tell it big. Make it frolic and give it pointy ears. And make it white. Very white.

That’s what the Texas biotech concern Colossal Biosciences did when it unveiled three snow-white animals that it claimed were actual dire wolves, which went extinct more than 10 millennia ago.

To be sure, these genetically modified gray wolves were impressive feats of engineering. They’d been made white via a genetic mutation and even had some bits and bobs of DNA copied over from old dire wolf bones. But they “are not dire wolves,” according to canine specialists at the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Colossal’s promotional blitz could hurt actual endangered species. Presenting de-extinction as “a ready-to-use conservation solution,” said the IUCN, “risks diverting attention from the more urgent need of ensuring functioning and healthy ecosystems.”

In a statement, Colossal said that sentiment analysis of online activity shows 98% agreement with its furry claims. “They’re dire wolves, end of story,” it says.

Save the world, and this is the thanks you get?

During the covid-19 pandemic, the US bet big on mRNA vaccines—and the new technology delivered in record time.

But now that America’s top health agencies are led by the antivax wackadoodle Robert F. Kennedy Jr., “mRNA” has become a political slur.

In August, Kennedy abruptly canceled hundreds of millions in contracts for next-generation vaccines. And shot maker Moderna—once America’s champion—has seen its stock slide by more than 90% since its Covid peak.

The purge targeting a key molecule of life (our bodies are full of mRNA) isn’t just bizarre. It could slow down other mRNA-based medicine, like cancer treatments and gene editing for rare diseases.

In August, a trade group fought back, saying: “Kennedy’s unscientific and misguided vilification of mRNA technology and cancellation of grants is the epitome of cutting off your nose to spite your face.”

Wikipedia has editions in 340 languages. But as of this year, there’s one less: Wikipedia in Greenlandic is no more.

Only around 60,000 people speak the Inuit language. And very few of them, it seems, ever cared much about the online encyclopedia. As a result, many of the entries were machine translations riddled with errors and nonsense.

Perhaps a website no one visits shouldn’t be a problem. But its existence created the risk of a linguistic “doom spiral” for the endangered language. That could happen if new AIs were trained on the corrupt Wikipedia articles.

In September, administrators voted to close Greenlandic Wikipedia, citing possible “harm to the Greenlandic language.”

There’s a reason we’re late to the hate-fest around Elon Musk’s Cybertruck. That’s because 12 months ago, the polemical polygon was the #1 selling electric pickup in the US.

Nope. Tesla is likely to sell only around 20,000 trucks this year, about half last year’s total. And a big part of the problem is that the entire EV pickup category is struggling. Just this month, Ford decided to scrap its own EV truck, the F-150 Lightning.

With unsold inventory building, Musk has started selling Cybertrucks as fleet vehicles to his other enterprises, like SpaceX.

Donald Trump launched a digital currency called $TRUMP just days before his 2025 inauguration, accompanied by a logo showing his fist-pumping “Fight, fight, fight” pose.

This was a memecoin, or shitcoin, not real money. Memecoins are more like merchandise—collectibles designed to be bought and sold, usually for a loss. Indeed, they’ve been likened to a consensual scam in which a coin’s issuer can make a bundle while buyers take losses.

The White House says there’s nothing amiss. “The American public believe[s] it&#39;s absurd for anyone to insinuate that this president is profiting off of the presidency,” said spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt in May.More: Donald and Melania Trump’s Terrible, Tacky, Seemingly Legal Memecoin Adventure (Bloomberg), A crypto mogul who invested millions into Trump coins is getting a reprieve (CNN), How the Trump companies made $1 bn from crypto (Financial Times), Staff Statement on Meme Coins (SEC)

In 2023, Apple announced its “first-ever carbon-neutral product,” a watch with “zero” net emissions. It would get there using recycled materials and renewable energy, and by preserving forests or planting vast stretches of eucalyptus trees.

Critics say it’s greenwashing. This year, lawyers filed suit in California against Apple for deceptive advertising, and in Germany, a court ruled that the company can’t advertise products as carbon neutral because the “supposed storage of CO2 in commercial eucalyptus plantations” isn’t a sure thing.

Apple’s marketing team relented. Packaging for its newest watches doesn’t say “carbon neutral.” But Apple believes the legal nitpicking is counterproductive, arguing that it can only “discourage the kind of credible corporate climate action the world needs.”

The sunshine vitamin could affect your immune system and heart health.

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you’ll see it’s a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

            <div id="article-text">Judging from headlines and social media posts in recent years, one might reasonably assume that AI is going to fix the power grid, cure the world’s diseases, and finish my holiday shopping for me. But maybe there’s just a whole lot of hype floating around out there.

This week, we published a new package called Hype Correction. The collection of stories takes a look at how the world is starting to reckon with the reality of what AI can do, and what’s just fluff.

One of my favorite stories in that package comes from my colleague David Rotman, who took a hard look at AI for materials research. AI could transform the process of discovering new materials—innovation that could be especially useful in the world of climate tech, which needs new batteries, semiconductors, magnets, and more.

But the field still needs to prove it can make materials that are actually novel and useful. Can AI really supercharge materials research? What could that look like?

For researchers hoping to find new ways to power the world (or cure disease or achieve any number of other big, important goals), a new material could change everything.

The problem is, inventing materials is difficult and slow. Just look at plastic—the first totally synthetic plastic was invented in 1907, but it took until roughly the 1950s for companies to produce the wide range we’re familiar with today. (And of course, though it is incredibly useful, plastic also causes no shortage of complications for society.)

In recent decades, materials science has fallen a bit flat—David has been covering this field for nearly 40 years, and as he puts it, there have been just a few major commercial breakthroughs in that time. (Lithium-ion batteries are one.)

Could AI change everything? The prospect is a tantalizing one, and companies are racing to test it out.

Lila Sciences, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is working on using AI models to uncover new materials. The company can not only train an AI model on all the latest scientific literature, but also plug it into an automated lab, so it can learn from experimental data. The goal is to speed up the iterative process of inventing and testing new materials and look at research in ways that humans might miss.

At an MIT Technology Review event earlier this year, I got to listen to David interview Rafael Gómez-Bombarelli, one of Lila’s cofounders. As he described what the company is working on, Gómez-Bombarelli acknowledged that AI materials discovery hasn’t yet seen a big breakthrough moment. Yet.

Gómez-Bombarelli described how models Lila has trained are providing insights that are “as deep [as] or deeper than our domain scientists would have.” In the future, AI could “think” in ways that depart from how human scientists approach a problem, he added: “There will be a need to translate scientific reasoning by AI to the way we think about the world.”

It’s exciting to see this sort of optimism in materials research, but there’s still a long and winding road before we can satisfyingly say that AI has transformed the field. One major difficulty is that it’s one thing to take suggestions from a model about new experimental methods or new potential structures. It’s quite another to actually make a material and show that it’s novel and useful.

You might remember that a couple of years ago, Google’s DeepMind announced it had used AI to predict the structures of “millions of new materials” and had made hundreds of them in the lab.

But as David notes in his story, after that announcement, some materials scientists pointed out that some of the supposedly novel materials were basically slightly different versions of known ones. Others couldn’t even physically exist in normal conditions (the simulations were done at ultra-low temperatures, where atoms don’t move around much).

It’s possible that AI could give materials discovery a much-needed jolt and usher in a new age that brings superconductors and batteries and magnets we’ve never seen before. But for now, I’m calling hype.

            <h2>This Nobel Prize–winning chemist dreams of making water from thin air</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/17/1129259/omar-yaghi-chemist-nobel-prize-crystals-water-air/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Omar Yaghi was a quiet child, diligent, unlikely to roughhouse with his nine siblings. So when he was old enough, his parents tasked him with one of the family’s most vital chores: fetching water. Like most homes in his Palestinian neighborhood in Amman, Jordan, the Yaghis’ had no electricity or running water. At least once every two weeks, the city switched on local taps for a few hours so residents could fill their tanks. Young Omar helped top up the family supply. Decades later, he says he can’t remember once showing up late. The fear of leaving his parents, seven brothers, and two sisters parched kept him punctual.

Yaghi proved so dependable that his father put him in charge of monitoring how much the cattle destined for the family butcher shop ate and drank. The best-­quality cuts came from well-fed, hydrated animals—a challenge given that they were raised in arid desert.

Specially designed materials called metal-organic frameworks can pull water from the air like a sponge—and then give it back.

But at 10 years old, Yaghi learned of a different occupation. Hoping to avoid a rambunctious crowd at recess, he found the library doors in his school unbolted and sneaked in. Thumbing through a chemistry textbook, he saw an image he didn’t understand: little balls connected by sticks in fascinating shapes. Molecules. The building blocks of everything.

“I didn’t know what they were, but it captivated my attention,” Yaghi says. “I kept trying to figure out what they might be.”

That’s how he discovered chemistry—or maybe how chemistry discovered him. After coming to the United States and, eventually, a postdoctoral program at Harvard University, Yaghi devoted his career to finding ways to make entirely new and fascinating shapes for those little sticks and balls. In October 2025, he was one of three scientists who won a Nobel Prize in chemistry for identifying metal-­organic frameworks, or MOFs—metal ions tethered to organic molecules that form repeating structural landscapes. Today that work is the basis for a new project that sounds like science fiction, or a miracle: conjuring water out of thin air.

When he first started working with MOFs, Yaghi thought they might be able to absorb climate-damaging carbon dioxide—or maybe hold hydrogen molecules, solving the thorny problem of storing that climate-friendly but hard-to-contain fuel. But then, in 2014, Yaghi’s team of researchers at UC Berkeley had an epiphany. The tiny pores in MOFs could be designed so the material would pull water molecules from the air around them, like a sponge—and then, with just a little heat, give back that water as if squeezed dry. Just one gram of a water-absorbing MOF has an internal surface area of roughly 7,000 square meters.

Yaghi wasn’t the first to try to pull potable water from the atmosphere. But his method could do it at lower levels of humidity than rivals—potentially shaking up a tiny, nascent industry that could be critical to humanity in the thirsty decades to come. Now the company he founded, called Atoco, is racing to demonstrate a pair of machines that Yaghi believes could produce clean, fresh, drinkable water virtually anywhere on Earth, without even hooking up to an energy supply.

That’s the goal Yaghi has been working toward for more than a decade now, with the rigid determination that he learned while doing chores in his father’s butcher shop.

“It was in that shop where I learned how to perfect things, how to have a work ethic,” he says. “I learned that a job is not done until it is well done. Don’t start a job unless you can finish it.”

Most of Earth is covered in water, but just 3% of it is fresh, with no salt—the kind of water all terrestrial living things need. Today, desalination plants that take the salt out of seawater provide the bulk of potable water in technologically advanced desert nations like Israel and the United Arab Emirates, but at a high cost. Desalination facilities either heat water to distill out the drinkable stuff or filter it with membranes the salt doesn’t pass through; both methods require a lot of energy and leave behind concentrated brine. Typically desal pumps send that brine back into the ocean, with devastating ecological effects.

I was talking to Atoco executives about carbon dioxide capture earlier this year when they mentioned the possibility of harvesting water from the atmosphere. Of course my mind immediately jumped to Star Wars, and Luke Skywalker working on his family’s moisture farm, using “vaporators” to pull water from the atmosphere of the arid planet Tatooine. (Other sci-fi fans’ minds might go to Dune, and the water-gathering technology of the Fremen.) Could this possibly be real?

It turns out people have been doing it for millennia. Archaeological evidence of water harvesting from fog dates back as far as 5000 BCE. The ancient Greeks harvested dew, and 500 years ago so did the Inca, using mesh nets and buckets under trees.

Today, harvesting water from the air is a business already worth billions of dollars, say industry analysts—and it’s on track to be worth billions more in the next five years. In part that’s because typical sources of fresh water are in crisis. Less snowfall in mountains during hotter winters means less meltwater in the spring, which means less water downstream. Droughts regularly break records. Rising seas seep into underground aquifers, already drained by farming and sprawling cities. Aging septic tanks leach bacteria into water, and cancer-causing “forever chemicals” are creating what the US Government Accountability Office last year said “may be the biggest water problem since lead.” That doesn’t even get to the emerging catastrophe from microplastics.

So lots of places are turning to atmospheric water harvesting. Watergen, an Israel-based company working on the tech, initially planned on deploying in the arid, poorer parts of the world. Instead, buyers in Europe and the United States have approached the company as a way to ensure a clean supply of water. And one of Watergen’s biggest markets is the wealthy United Arab Emirates. “When you say ‘water crisis,’ it’s not just the lack of water—it’s access to good-quality water,” says Anna Chernyavsky, Watergen’s vice president of marketing.

In other words, the technology “has evolved from lab prototypes to robust, field-deployable systems,” says Guihua Yu, a mechanical engineer at the University of Texas at Austin. “There is still room to improve productivity and energy efficiency in the whole-system level, but so much progress has been steady and encouraging.”

MOFs are just the latest approach to the idea. The first generation of commercial tech depended on compressors and refrigerant chemicals—large-scale versions of the machine that keeps food cold and fresh in your kitchen. Both use electricity and a clot of pipes and exchangers to make cold by phase-shifting a chemical from gas to liquid and back; refrigerators try to limit condensation, and water generators basically try to enhance it.

That’s how Watergen’s tech works: using a compressor and a heat exchanger to wring water from air at humidity levels as low as 20%—Death Valley in the spring. “We’re talking about deserts,” Chernyavsky says. “Below 20%, you get nosebleeds.”

That still might not be good enough. “Refrigeration works pretty well when you are above a certain relative humidity,” says Sameer Rao, a mechanical engineer at the University of Utah who researches atmospheric water harvesting. “As the environment dries out, you go to lower relative humidities, and it becomes harder and harder. In some cases, it’s impossible for refrigeration-based systems to really work.”

So a second wave of technology has found a market. Companies like Source Global use desiccants—substances that absorb moisture from the air, like the silica packets found in vitamin bottles—to pull in moisture and then release it when heated. In theory, the benefit of desiccant-­based tech is that it could absorb water at lower humidity levels, and it uses less energy on the front end since it isn’t running a condenser system. Source Global claims its off-grid, solar-powered system is deployed in dozens of countries.

But both technologies still require a lot of energy, either to run the heat exchangers or to generate sufficient heat to release water from the desiccants. MOFs, Yaghi hopes, do not. Now Atoco is trying to prove it. Instead of using heat exchangers to bring the air temperature to dew point or desiccants to attract water from the atmosphere, a system can rely on specially designed MOFs to attract water molecules. Atoco’s prototype version uses an MOF that looks like baby powder, stuck to a surface like glass. The pores in the MOF naturally draw in water molecules but remain open, making it theoretically easy to discharge the water with no more heat than what comes from direct sunlight. Atoco’s industrial-scale design uses electricity to speed up the process, but the company is working on a second design that can operate completely off grid, without any energy input.

Yaghi’s Atoco isn’t the only contender seeking to use MOFs for water harvesting. A competitor, AirJoule, has introduced MOF-based atmospheric water generators in Texas and the UAE and is working with researchers at Arizona State University, planning to deploy more units in the coming months. The company started out trying to build more efficient air-­conditioning for electric buses operating on hot, humid city streets. But then founder Matt Jore heard about US government efforts to harvest water from air—and pivoted. The startup’s stock price has been a bit of a roller-­coaster, but Jore says the sheer size of the market should keep him in business. Take Maricopa County, encompassing Phoenix and its environs—it uses 1.2 billion gallons of water from its shrinking aquifer every day, and another 874 million gallons from surface sources like rivers.

“So, a couple of billion gallons a day, right?” Jore tells me. “You know how much influx is in the atmosphere every day? Twenty-five billion gallons.”

“Just the greater Phoenix area gets influx of about 25 billion gallons of water in the air,” he says. “If you can tap into it, that’s your source. And it’s not going away. It’s all around the world. We view the atmosphere as the world’s free pipeline.”

Besides AirJoule’s head start on Atoco, the companies also differ on where they get their MOFs. AirJoule’s system relies on an off-the-shelf version the company buys from the chemical giant BASF; Atoco aims to use Yaghi’s skill with designing the novel material to create bespoke MOFs for different applications and locations.

“Given the fact that we have the inventor of the whole class of materials, and we leverage the stuff that comes out of his lab at Berkeley—everything else equal, we have a good starting point to engineer maybe the best materials in the world,” says Magnus Bach, Atoco’s VP of business development.

Yaghi envisions a two-pronged product line. Industrial-scale water generators that run on electricity would be capable of producing thousands of liters per day on one end, while units that run on passive systems could operate in remote locations without power, just harnessing energy from the sun and ambient temperatures. In theory, these units could someday replace desalination and even entire municipal water supplies. The next round of field tests is scheduled for early 2026, in the Mojave Desert—one of the hottest, driest places on Earth.

“That’s my dream,” Yaghi says. “To give people water independence, so they’re not reliant on another party for their lives.”

Both Yaghi and Watergen’s Chernyavsky say they’re looking at more decentralized versions that could operate outside municipal utility systems. Home appliances, similar to rooftop solar panels and batteries, could allow households to generate their own water off grid.

That could be tricky, though, without economies of scale to bring down prices. “You have to produce, you have to cool, you have to filter—all in one place,” Chernyavsky says. “So to make it small is very, very challenging.”

Difficult as that may be, Yaghi’s childhood gave him a particular appreciation for the freedom to go off grid, to liberate the basic necessity of water from the whims of systems that dictate when and how people can access it.

“That’s really my dream,” he says. “To give people independence, water independence, so that they’re not reliant on another party for their livelihood or lives.”

Toward the end of one of our conversations, I asked Yaghi what he would tell the younger version of himself if he could. “Jordan is one of the worst countries in terms of the impact of water stress,” he said. “I would say, ‘Continue to be diligent and observant. It doesn’t really matter what you’re pursuing, as long as you’re passionate.’”

I pressed him for something more specific: “What do you think he’d say when you described this technology to him?”

Yaghi smiled: “I think young Omar would think you’re putting him on, that this is all fictitious and you’re trying to take something from him.” This reality, in other words, would be beyond young Omar’s wildest dreams.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard.

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you.  We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tekpon has acquired 100% of the TNW media and events brands, which cover and convene the European technology ecosystem, from the FT.

The transaction is Tekpon’s largest investment in media and events so far. It broadens the company’s reach across SaaS and AI and strengthens its role in the global innovation landscape.

TNW’s brand and editorial standards will be maintained, while its events and digital platforms will be integrated into Tekpon’s wider strategy.

The FT will continue to own and operate TNW Spaces, Amsterdam’s dynamic tech hub, offering private offices and coworking spaces that support a thriving community of startups, scale-ups, and innovators.

Alexandru Stan, Founder and CEO of Tekpon, said:

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

TNW is one of Europe’s most respected technology brands. Its legacy, its community, and its influence have shaped the European tech scene for nearly twenty years. This acquisition accelerates our mission to connect the global SaaS and AI ecosystem and supports Europe’s position in the next decade of innovation.

Tekpon will begin working on TNW branded initiatives immediately. Plans for 2026 include an expanded TNW Conference, new SaaS and AI program tracks curated by Tekpon, cross-regional executive programmes, and specialised gatherings for founders, executives, and investors.

The acquisition is part of Tekpon’s long-term plan to build an international ecosystem connecting software, media, events, advisory, and innovation.
