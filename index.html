            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Having a health insurance plan with a high deductible could not only cost you—it could also kill you.

A new study in JAMA Network Open found that people who faced those high out-of-pocket costs as well as a cancer diagnosis had worse overall survival and cancer-specific survival than those with more standard health plans.

The findings, while perhaps not surprising, are a stark reminder of the fraught decisions Americans face as the price of health care only continues to rise, and more people try to offset costs by accepting insurance plans with higher deductibles—that is, higher out-of-pocket costs they have to pay before their health insurance provider starts paying its share.

The issue is particularly critical right now for people who have insurance plans through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Prices for those plans have skyrocketed this year after Congress failed to extend critical tax credits. Without those credits, monthly premiums for ACA plans have, on average, more than doubled. Early data on ACA enrollments for 2026 not only suggests that fewer people are signing up for the plans, but also that those who are enrolling are often choosing bronze plans, which are high-deductible plans.

In the study, researchers considered plans to be “high-deductible health plans” (HDHPs) if their deductibles were at least $1,200 to $1,350 for individuals or $2,400 to $2,700 for families between 2011 and 2018 (with the cutoffs increasing within the ranges during that time). For context, the average individual deductible for an ACA bronze plan in 2026 is about $7,500, according to KFF.

Based on previous data, such high out-of-pocket costs are known to lead people to delay or decrease health care—they may skip doctor visits, put off diagnostics, and avoid treatments. But for the new study, researchers led by Justin Barnes at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, wanted to know, more directly, if the plans were linked to lower survival— specifically for cancer patients, who obviously need more care than others.

The study used health survey data from a nationally representative group of over 147,000 people. In all, nearly 9,800 had been diagnosed with cancer, and of those, around 2,300 had HDHPs. Another group of over 37,000 who had not been diagnosed with cancer also had HDHPs. Adjusting for demographic factors and health status, cancer patients on an HDHP had a lower overall survival rate (46 percent higher risk of death) and lower cancer-specific survival rate (34 percent higher risk of death) than people on standard-deductible plans. In further analyses, the researchers found that, for cancer patients, whether their HDHP had a health savings accounts (HSAs) did not make a difference. In survey responses, cancer patients on HDHPs reported more financial worry than people on standard plans.

In contrast, people on an HDHP who did not have a cancer diagnosis did not have lower survival rates than people on other plans, suggesting that the plans might not affect your survival as long as you don’t have any serious health conditions, such as cancer.

Barnes and his colleagues conclude that “In the current political environment, in which there may be proliferation of HDHPs, these results suggest that HDHP proliferation could exacerbate adverse cancer outcomes. These data underscore the importance of educating patients with cancer about potential (increased) need for health care utilization, educating the public about potential risks of HDHPs, identifying policy solutions to decrease costs of care, and optimizing health policies to avoid disincentives for seeking what may turn out to be necessary and lifesaving or life-prolonging care.”</div>

            <h2>US spy satellite agency declassifies high-flying Cold War listening post</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/us-spy-satellite-agency-declassifies-high-flying-cold-war-listening-post/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The National Reconnaissance Office, the agency overseeing the US government’s fleet of spy satellites, has declassified a decades-old program used to eavesdrop on the Soviet Union’s military communication signals.

The program was codenamed Jumpseat, and its existence was already public knowledge through leaks and contemporary media reports. What’s new is the NRO’s description of the program’s purpose, development, and pictures of the satellites themselves.

In a statement, the NRO called Jumpseat “the United States’ first-generation, highly elliptical orbit (HEO) signals-collection satellite.”

Eight Jumpseat satellites launched from 1971 through 1987, when the US government considered the very existence of the National Reconnaissance Office a state secret. Jumpseat satellites operated until 2006. Their core mission was “monitoring adversarial offensive and defensive weapon system development,” the NRO said. “Jumpseat collected electronic emissions and signals, communication intelligence, as well as foreign instrumentation intelligence.”

Data intercepted by the Jumpseat satellites flowed to the Department of Defense, the National Security Agency, and “other national security elements,” the NRO said.

The Soviet Union was the primary target for Jumpseat intelligence collections. The satellites flew in highly elliptical orbits ranging from a few hundred miles up to 24,000 miles (39,000 kilometers) above the Earth. The satellites’ flight paths were angled such that they reached apogee, the highest point of their orbits, over the far northern hemisphere. Satellites travel slowest at apogee, so the Jumpseat spacecraft loitered high over the Arctic, Russia, Canada, and Greenland for most of the 12 hours it took them to complete a loop around the Earth.

This trajectory gave the Jumpseat satellites persistent coverage over the Arctic and the Soviet Union, which first realized the utility of such an orbit. The Soviet government began launching communication and early-warning satellites into the same type of orbit a few years before the first Jumpseat mission launched in 1971. The Soviets called the orbit Molniya, the Russian word for lightning.

The name Jumpseat was first revealed in a 1986 book by the investigative journalist Seymour Hersh on the Soviet Union’s 1983 shoot-down of Korean Air Lines Flight 007. Hersh wrote that the Jumpseat satellites could “intercept all kinds of communications,” including voice messages between Soviet ground personnel and pilots.

“The historical significance of Jumpseat cannot be understated,” said James Outzen, NRO director of the Center for the Study of National Reconnaissance. “Its orbit provided the US a new vantage point for the collection of unique and critical signals intelligence from space.”

Jumpseat was “perhaps the most mysterious” of the NRO’s high-altitude surveillance satellites in its era, space historians Dwayne Day and Nicholas Watkins wrote in a 2020 article published in the Space Review. Day and Watkins wrote that the Jumpseat satellites “pushed the state of the art in terms of payloads, antennas, and satellite design.”

Now, we know exactly what the satellites looked like. They were built by Hughes Aircraft company, which specialized in producing satellites using spin motion to stabilize themselves. Therefore, the drum-like shape of the Jumpseat satellites in the newly declassified photos is no big surprise. The exact appearance of the antenna structure on the upper deck of the Jumpseat spacecraft was not public knowledge. The upper deck had a device to counter the satellite’s spin, allowing the antennas to point toward radio sources.

An illustration released by the NRO shows that the satellites carried a 13-foot antenna to intercept radio signals, somewhat smaller than prior open source estimates of the antenna’s size. The NRO has not disclosed precisely what kinds of signals the Jumpseat satellites intercepted, but Day and Watkins wrote in 2020 that an early justification for the program was to monitor Soviet radars, which some analysts might have interpreted as part of a secret anti-ballistic missile system to guard against a US strike.

The authors presented evidence that the Jumpseat also likely hosted infrared sensors to monitor Soviet missile tests and provide early warning of a potential Soviet missile attack. The NRO did not mention this possible secondary mission in the Jumpseat declassification memo.

Chris Scolese, director of the NRO, formally declassified “certain limited facts” associated with the Jumpseat program in December. The NRO made the information public in a press release on Wednesday. Scolese wrote that the declassification was “consistent with provisions” of an executive order signed by former President Barack Obama in 2009 that set guidelines for how and when to classify and declassify national security information.

“I have concluded that publicly acknowledging limited facts will not cause harm to our current and future satellite systems,” Scolese wrote in the Jumpseat declassification memorandum, dated December 4. “Additionally, acknowledging the program is consistent with our obligation to the American public to be both open and transparent where possible through declassification of historic programs.”

The NRO will evaluate a more complete declassification for the Jumpseat program “as time and resources permit,” Scolese wrote. He acknowledged that unclassified commercial ventures now operate signals intelligence, or SIGINT, satellites “whose capabilities are comparable if not superior to Jumpseat.”

The Jumpseat satellites were developed in partnership with the Air Force through a program called Project Earpop. The government’s first electronic surveillance satellites flew in low-Earth orbit, where they spent less than 15 minutes in range of Soviet territory on each pass.

The NRO and the Air Force launched the Jumpseat satellites aboard Titan IIIB rockets from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. The agency said Jumpseat was a “foundational program” for the NRO’s subsequent highly elliptical orbit satellite programs. According to public sources, the NRO began launching a new generation of high-altitude eavesdropping satellites called Trumpet in 1994, but details remain classified.

The NRO has also launched a separate series of eavesdropping satellites in geosynchronous orbit over the equator with enormous mesh antennas, along with bus-sized Earth-pointing telescopes capable of viewing any location in the world. These satellites are among the largest in orbit, requiring heavy-lift rockets to get them to their observation posts.

Jumpseat satellites were much smaller, weighing between half a ton and one ton at launch.

The disclosure of the Jumpseat program follows the declassification of several other Cold War-era spy satellites. They include the CIA’s Corona series of photo reconnaissance satellites from the 1960s, which the government officially acknowledged 30 years later. The NRO declassified in 2011 two more optical spy satellite programs, codenamed Gambit and Hexagon, which launched from the 1960s through the 1980s. Most recently, the NRO revealed a naval surveillance program called Parcae in 2023.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Complaining about Windows 11 is a popular sport among tech enthusiasts on the Internet, whether you’re publicly switching to Linux, publishing guides about the dozens of things you need to do to make the OS less annoying, or getting upset because you were asked to sign in to an app after clicking a sign-in button.

Despite the negativity surrounding the current version of Windows, it remains the most widely used operating system on the world’s desktop and laptop computers, and people usually prefer to stick to what they’re used to. As a result, Windows 11 has just cleared a big milestone—Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on the company’s most recent earnings call (via The Verge) that Windows 11 now has over 1 billion users worldwide.

Windows 11 also reached that milestone just a few months quicker than Windows 10 did—1,576 days after its initial public launch on October 5, 2021. Windows 10 took 1,692 days to reach the same milestone, based on its July 29, 2015, general availability date and Microsoft’s announcement on March 16, 2020.

That’s especially notable because Windows 10 was initially offered as a free upgrade to all users of Windows 7 and Windows 8, with no change in system requirements relative to those older versions. Windows 11 was (and still is) a free upgrade to Windows 10, but its relatively high system requirements mean there are plenty of Windows 10 PCs that aren’t eligible to run Windows 11.

It’s hard to gauge how many PCs are still running Windows 10 because public data on the matter is unreliable. But we can still make educated guesses—and it’s clear that the software is still running on hundreds of millions of PCs, despite hitting its official end-of-support date last October.

Statcounter, one popularly referenced source that collects OS and browser usage stats from web analytics data, reports that between 50 and 55 percent of Windows PCs worldwide are running Windows 11, and between 40 and 45 percent of them run Windows 10. Statcounter also reports that Windows 10 and Windows 7 usage have risen slightly over the last few months, which highlights the noisiness of the data. But as of late 2025, Dell COO Jeffrey Clarke said that there were still roughly 1 billion active Windows 10 PCs in use, around 500 million of which weren’t eligible for an upgrade because of hardware requirements. If Windows 11 just cleared the 1 billion user mark, that suggests Statcounter’s reporting of a nearly evenly split user base isn’t too far from the truth.

Although Windows 11’s reputation could be part of the reason for Windows 10’s tenacity, it’s easy to explain away the older OS’s continuing popularity in other ways. Just a few years ago, Windows 10 was the most ubiquitous version of Windows since XP, and when Windows 11 launched, its requirements mostly excluded PCs older than three or four years.

Because it would be catastrophic if all of those Windows 10 PCs completely stopped getting security patches or anti-malware protection, Microsoft has built a three-year off-ramp for the operating system—one year of free (but opt-in) security updates for consumer PCs, up to three years of paid security updates for businesses and other large institutions, and updates to and basic support for core apps like Windows Defender, Microsoft Office, and Microsoft Edge through at least 2028.

Microsoft executives are at least paying lip service to Windows 11’s real and perceived reputational issues. Pavan Davuluri, Microsoft’s president of Windows and devices, said in a statement to The Verge that the company would be “swarming” engineers over the next few months to “urgently fix Windows 11’s performance and reliability issues” and to modernize more of the barely buried parts of the operating system that still look a lot like they did in Windows 7, or XP, or NT.

Assuming those issues are addressed—and that Microsoft can fix them without adding fun new bugs along the way—it would fix some of what ails Windows 11. But Davuluri didn’t acknowledge the aspects of Windows 11 that make it annoying even when it’s working as designed: the mandatory Microsoft account sign-in prompts, the continual reminders and upsell notifications about OneDrive, Game Pass, and other Microsoft services, and the periodic reminders to use Edge and Bing that come back no matter how many times they’re dismissed.

People are definitely switching to and using Windows 11. For people already used to Windows 10, it’s still the software update of least resistance. What Microsoft needs to do now is ensure that Windows 11 doesn’t frustrate people so much that it’s the last version of Windows they use.</div>

            <div id="article-text">At this point, we’ve all heard plenty of stories about AI chatbots leading users to harmful actions, harmful beliefs, or simply incorrect information. Despite the prevalence of these stories, though, it’s hard to know just how often users are being manipulated. Are these tales of AI harms anecdotal outliers or signs of a frighteningly common problem?

Anthropic took a stab at answer ingthat question this week, releasing a paper studying the potential for what it calls “disempowering patterns” across 1.5 million anonymized real-world conversations with its Claude AI model. While the results show that these kinds of manipulative patterns are relatively rare as a percentage of all AI conversations, they still represent a potentially large problem on an absolute basis.

Disempowerment Patterns in Real-World LLM Usage,” researchers from Anthropic and the University of Toronto try to quantify the potential for a specific set of “user disempowering” harms by identifying three primary ways that a chatbot can negatively impact a user’s thoughts or actions:

To figure out when a chatbot conversation has the potential to move a user along one of these lines, Anthropic ran nearly 1.5 million Claude conversations through Clio, an automated analysis tool and classification system (tested to make sure it lined up with a smaller subsample of human classifications). That analysis found a “severe risk” of disempowerment potential in anything from 1 in 1,300 conversations (for “reality distortion”) to 1 in 6,000 conversations (for “action distortion”).

While these worst outcomes are relatively rare on a proportional basis, the researchers note that “given the sheer number of people who use AI, and how frequently it’s used, even a very low rate affects a substantial number of people.” And the numbers get considerably worse when you consider conversations with at least a “mild” potential for disempowerment, which occurred in between 1 in 50 and 1 in 70 conversations (depending on the type of disempowerment).

What’s more, the potential for disempowering conversations with Claude appears to have grown significantly between late 2024 and late 2025. While the researchers couldn’t pin down a single reason for this increase, they guessed that it could be tied to users becoming “more comfortable discussing vulnerable topics or seeking advice” as AI gets more popular and integrated into society.

In the study, the researcher acknowledged that studying the text of Claude conversations only measures “disempowerment potential rather than confirmed harm” and “relies on automated assessment of inherently subjective phenomena.” Ideally, they write, future research could utilize user interviews or randomized controlled trials to measure these harms more directly.

That said, the research includes several troubling examples where the text of the conversations clearly implies real-world harms. Claude would sometimes reinforce “speculative or unfalsifiable claims” with encouragement (e.g., “CONFIRMED,” “EXACTLY,” “100%”), which, in some cases, led to users “build[ing] increasingly elaborate narratives disconnected from reality.”

Claude’s encouragement could also lead to users “sending confrontational messages, ending relationships, or drafting public announcements,” the researchers write. In many cases, users who sent AI-drafted messages later expressed regret in conversations with Claude, using phrases like “It wasn’t me” and “You made me do stupid things.”

While harmful patterns in Claude’s outputs are a big problem, the researchers also point out that the users most likely to be affected are “not being passively manipulated.” On the contrary, the researchers suggest disempowered users are usually actively asking Claude to take over for their own reasoning or judgment and often accepting Claude’s suggestions “with minimal pushback.”

The researchers identified four major “amplifying factors” that can make users more likely to accept Claude’s advice unquestioningly. These include when a user is particularly vulnerable due to a crisis or disruption in their life (which occurs in about 1 in 300 Claude conversations); when a user has formed a close personal attachment to Claude (1 in 1,200); when a user appears dependent on AI for day-to-day tasks (1 in 2,500); or when a user treats Claude as a definitive authority (1 in 3,900).

Anthropic is also quick to link this new research to its previous work on sycophancy, noting that “sycophantic validation” is “the most common mechanism for reality distortion potential.” While Anthropic says its models have been getting less sycophantic overall, many of the worst “disempowerment” examples they found are a direct result of the “most extreme cases” of sycophancy in the dataset.

That said, the researchers also try to make clear that, when it comes to swaying core beliefs via chatbot conversation, it takes two to tango. “The potential for disempowerment emerges as part of an interaction dynamic between the user and Claude,” they write. “Users are often active participants in the undermining of their own autonomy: projecting authority, delegating judgment, accepting outputs without question in ways that create a feedback loop with Claude.”</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/01/google-project-genie-lets-you-create-interactive-worlds-from-a-photo-or-prompt/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last year, Google showed off Genie 3, an updated version of its AI world model with impressive long-term memory that allowed it to create interactive worlds from a simple text prompt. At the time, Google only provided Genie to a small group of trusted testers. Now, it’s available more widely as Project Genie, but only for those paying for Google’s most expensive AI subscription.

World models are exactly what they sound like—an AI that generates a dynamic environment on the fly. They’re not technically 3D worlds, though. World models like Genie 3 create a video that responds to your control inputs, allowing you to explore the simulation as if it were a real virtual world. Genie 3 was a breakthrough in world models because it could remember details of the world it was creating for a much longer time. But in this context, a “long time” is a couple of minutes.

Project Genie is essentially a cleaned-up version of Genie 3, which plugs into updated AI models like Nano Banana Pro and Gemini 3. Google has a number of pre-built worlds available in Project Genie, but it’s the ability to create new things that makes it interesting. You can provide an image for reference or simply tell Genie what you want from the environment and the character.

The system first generates a still image, and from that you can generate the world. This is what Google calls “world sketching.” If you don’t like the reference image created by Nano Banana Pro, you can make changes before handing it off to Genie.

The resulting video is 720p, rendering at around 24 frames per second. As you move your character around with WASD, Genie renders the path ahead in something approaching real time.

If that 60-second jaunt into the AI world isn’t enough, you can just run the prompt again. Because this is generative AI, the results will be a little different each time. Google also lets you “remix” its pre-built worlds with new characters and visual styles. The video generated of your exploration is available for download as well.

Google stresses that Project Genie is still just a research prototype, and there are, therefore, some notable limitations. As anyone who has used Google Veo or OpenAI Sora to create AI videos will know, it takes a few seconds to create even a short clip. So, it’s impressive that Genie can make it feel interactive at all. However, there will be some input lag, and you can only explore each world for 60 seconds. In addition, the promotable events feature previously demoed for Genie 3, which allows inserting new elements into a running simulation, is not available yet.

While Google has talked up Genie’s ability to accurately model physics, the company notes that testers will probably see examples of worlds that don’t look or behave quite right. Testers may also see changing restrictions on content. The Verge was able to test Project Genie, and initially, it was happy to generate knockoffs of Nintendo games like Super Mario and The Legend of Zelda. By the end of the test, The Verge reports that some of those prompts were being blocked due to “interests of third-party content providers.”

Project Genie is only accessible from a dedicated web app—it won’t be plugged into the Gemini app or website. You can only access this tool for the time being with an AI Ultra subscription, which runs $250 per month. Generating all this AI video is expensive, so it makes sense to start with the higher tier. Google says its goal is to open up access to Project Genie over time.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/comcast-keeps-losing-customers-despite-price-guarantee-and-unlimited-data/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In April 2025, Comcast President Mike Cavanagh bemoaned that the company’s cable broadband division was “not winning in the marketplace” amid increased competition from fiber and fixed wireless Internet service providers.

Cavanagh identified some problems that had been obvious to Comcast customers for many years: Its prices aren’t transparent enough and rise too frequently, and dealing with the company is too difficult. Comcast sought to fix the problems with a five-year price guarantee, one year of free Xfinity Mobile service for home Internet customers, and plans with unlimited data instead of punitive data caps. But the company is still losing broadband customers at a higher-than-expected rate.

In Q4 2025 earnings announced today, Comcast reported a net loss of 181,000 residential and business broadband customers in the US. The loss consists of 178,000 residential Internet customers and 3,000 business customers.

The Q4 net loss is more than the 176,000 loss predicted by analysts, although not as bad as the 199,000-customer loss that spurred Cavanagh’s comment about Comcast “not winning in the marketplace” nine months ago. The Q4 2025 loss reported today is also worse than the 139,000-customer loss in Q4 2024 and the 34,000-customer loss in Q4 2023.

“Subscriber losses were 181,000, as the early traction we are seeing from our new initiatives was more than offset by continued competitive intensity,” Comcast CFO Jason Armstrong said during an earnings call today, according to a Motley Fool transcript.

Comcast’s residential broadband customers dropped to 28.72 million, while business broadband customers dropped to 2.54 million, for a total of 31.26 million.

Armstrong said that average revenue per user grew 1.1 percent, “consistent with the deceleration that we had previewed reflecting our new go-to-market pricing, including lower everyday pricing and strong adoption of free wireless lines.” Armstrong expects average revenue per user to continue growing slowly “for the next couple of quarters, driven by the absence of a rate increase, the impact from free wireless lines, and the ongoing migration of our base to simplified pricing.”

Comcast Connectivity & Platforms chief Steve Croney said the firm is facing “a more competitive environment from fiber” and continued competition from fixed wireless. “The market is going to remain intensely competitive,” he said.

Cavanagh said that over the past year, Comcast “made the most significant go-to-market shift in our company’s history. We have simplified our broadband offering by moving away from short-term promotions toward a clear, transparent value proposition.” But more changes are needed, he said.

“Looking ahead, 2026 is about building on the changes we made in 2025… This will be the largest broadband investment year in our history, focused squarely on customer experience and simplification, with the goal of migrating the majority of residential broadband customers to our new simplified pricing and packaging by year-end,” Cavanagh said.

Comcast’s domestic broadband revenue was $6.32 billion, down from $6.38 billion a year ago. Cable TV revenue was $6.36 billion, down from $6.74 billion year over year. Mobile revenue rose from $1.19 billion to $1.40 billion year over year, buoyed by 1.5 million new mobile lines added during the full year of 2025.

Comcast said it now has over 9 million total mobile lines and aims to get more of its broadband customers into bundles of Internet and wireless service. Comcast offers consumer mobile service through an agreement with Verizon and struck a deal with T-Mobile to deliver mobile services to business customers this year.

As the owner of NBCUniversal, Comcast has a lot more going on than cable and mobile. Strong results in the Peacock streaming service and Universal Studios theme parks helped Comcast meet analysts’ revenue projections and exceed profit estimates. Peacock paid subscribers increased 22 percent year over year to 44 million, and revenue grew 23 percent to 1.6 billion in the quarter, Comcast said.

Total Q4 2025 revenue was $32.31 billion, up 1.2 percent year over year. Net income was $2.17 billion, a 54.6 percent drop compared to a profit of $4.78 billion in Q4 2024. Comcast indicated the drop isn’t as bad as it sounds because it reflects “an unfavorable comparison to the prior year period, which included a $1.9 billion income tax benefit due to an internal corporate reorganization.” Comcast’s stock price was up about 3 percent today but has fallen about 16 percent in the past 12 months.

Comcast is one of the two biggest cable companies in the US alongside Charter, which is scheduled to announce Q4 2025 earnings tomorrow. In Q3 2025, Charter reported a loss of 109,000 Internet customers, a bit more than Comcast’s 104,000-customer loss in the same quarter. Charter, which is seeking regulatory approval to buy cable company Cox, had 27.76 million residential Internet customers and 2.03 million small business Internet customers.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The crypto market has not had a cozy winter. After Bitcoin suffered some epic tumbles in November, the OG cryptocurrency had been hovering around $90,000 — until today, that is.

On Thursday, the Senate Agriculture Committee advanced a bill that would establish a federal regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. The bill’s future prospects seem dim, but it resulted in a sizable crash for Bitcoin, which fell to around $84,000 — its nadir for 2026 so far. Other prominent digital currencies like Ethereum and Doge fell it with, tumbling as much as 6 percent.

Now, as crypto analysts speculate whether further downfalls are in Bitcoin’s future, crypto bros are struggling to maintain a cohesive narrative in the face of such epic volatility. Some were frustrated that a rising tide in the stock market didn’t lift the Bitcoin boat.

“Stocks go up, crypto stays flat. Stocks go down, crypto goes down,” posted crypto guru João Leite on X-formerly-Twitter. “Amazing tech.”

Others compared Bitcoin to gold futures, which have been volatile day-to-day, but are up to record highs overall.

“Make it make sense,” another crypto poster wrote. “Gold is up 193 percent over the last 5 years and everyone and their mother is talking about buying. Bitcoin is up 146 percent over the last 5 years after a pullback and everyone and their is [sic] completely oblivious to the price. BTW #Bitcoin is actually finite unlike Gold.”

Others struggled to make any sense of the crash at all.

“None of this crypto sh*t makes sense,” one netizen ranted on the r/CryptoCurrency subreddit. “Idk how so many people get involved with it if it can just disappear like this.”

“I’m really tired of all the manipulation but I’m sure they’re doing it because they make money,” one Facebook user wrote under a post on the crash from Bitcoin Magazine. “They short it and then they go along with it and they do everything except just leave it the hell alone and let it go up over time. Very frustrating.”

            <h2>Sam Altman Says AI Will Cause Massive Deflation, Making Money Worth Vastly More</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/future-society/sam-altman-ai-deflation">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI is betting in the biggest way possible on a future ruled by AI. It’s committing to spending well over $1 trillion to build out enormous data centers — despite business fundamentals lagging far behind, stoking fears over troubling days ahead.

During a town hall livestreamed on Monday, CEO Sam Altman admitted that the company was looking to pump the brakes, revealing that it’s looking to “dramatically slow down” hiring as the company continues to burn through billions of dollars each quarter.

At the same time, Altman remained characteristically bullish about what his company’s tech will soon offer to the world. When asked if AI can be used to “solve economic gaps that have existed for decades,” the executive argued that it’s “going to be massively deflationary.”

“Given, certainly, progress with work you can do in front of a computer, but also what looks like it will soon happen with robotics and a bunch of other things, we’re going to have massively deflationary pressure,” he predicted.

As a result of this deflationary pressure, Altman promised that things would get “radically cheaper” and the “empowerment of individual people” will go up as money becomes more valuable — which, it’s worth noting, would be an inversion of virtually every economic system in history, which have overwhelmingly been inflationary.

Altman reasoned that these economic changes would be the result of AI allowing individuals to be vastly more productive. He argued that by the end of this year, an individual spending $1,000 on inference — essentially the cost of running an AI — could complete a piece of software in a short period of time, a task that would have previously taken a whole team a much longer period.

It’s not the first time Altman has argued that AI could make money more valuable. In March, he claimed that AI will have a deflationary impact on the global economy during a closed-door Morgan Stanley conference.

The broader argument that AI could lead to an age of “abundance” in which the cost of living starts to decrease — and that we could even choose not to work if we didn’t want to — has long been deployed by tech leaders, including Altman and xAI CEO Elon Musk, to drive the AI hype cycle.

But given the current state of the economy, such a point remains little more than a daydream. The reality is that AI is still incredibly far from boosting efficiency enough to offset inflation. Just earlier today, the US Federal Reserve held interest rates steady, citing ongoing concerns over “elevated” inflation.

In fact, AI has more frequently been linked to mass layoffs that make it harder to survive. Long-term unemployment hit a four-year high earlier this year as jobseekers struggled to find new work. The cost of living has also continued to climb, particularly in larger US cities.

Whether AI will come to the rescue and dramatically bring down prices remains to be seen, as uncomfortable questions surrounding the tech’s viability linger.

Researchers have shown that AI is largely failing to boost productivity, at least in its current form. Surveys have found that the number of people using AI at work is falling, a troubling trend that flies in the face of promises made by tech leaders. Many of these workers argue that AI is essentially useless to them, despite their employers’ insistence that it’s revolutionary, productivity-boosting tech.

To AI’s many critics, it’s a dead end. Some have argued that OpenAI itself could be a house of cards that’s one run on the banks away from collapsing in on itself.

In short, there are plenty of reasons to remain skeptical of Altman’s claims that AI will put more buying power into each of our pockets as productivity goes stratospheric. He’s also gone as far as to argue that AI could cure cancer, solve climate change, and alleviate our financial struggles with “universal extreme health.”

Musk has similarly prophesied that “there will be no poverty in the future, and so no need to save money.” Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has also argued that we could one day work far less as a result of AI.

It’s an enormous bet — and Altman and his counterparts have plenty still to prove as reality continues to lag behind their lofty promises.

Even Altman himself isn’t entirely convinced that sudden abundance will actually be a good thing for the average person.

“Massively more abundance and access and massively decreased cost to be able to create new things, new companies, discover new science, whatever…” he said during this week’s town hall. “I think that should be an equalizing force in society and a way that people who have not gotten treated that fairly get a really good shot.”

“As long as we don’t screw up the policy around it in a big way,” he warned, “which could happen.”

            <h2>NASA’s Moon Spacesuits Are Plagued With Issues</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">NASA is gearing up for the first crewed journey to the Moon in over half a century, a mission that could launch as soon as two weeks from now.

And next year, the agency will finally attempt to return astronauts to the lunar surface itself as part of its Artemis 3 mission, which will dramatically increase the already considerable stakes.

Particularly when it comes to stepping out of the spacecraft — the agency has yet to pick between Blue Origin and SpaceX’s offerings in that regard — staying protected from the extreme temperature swings, space radiation, and lack of atmosphere is extremely challenging.

That’s not to mention the physical limitations of an extremely bulky spacesuit, which could physically tax astronauts even more than stepping outside of the International Space Station during a spacewalk.

As Ars Technica reports, former NASA astronaut and microbiologist Kate Rubins, who retired last year and has logged 300 days in space, recently voiced her concerns over the Moon suit that private space company Axiom Space has been developing for NASA as part of a $228 million contract.

“What I think we have on the Moon that we don’t really have on the space station that I want people to recognize is an extreme physical stress,” she said during a recent meeting of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.

Besides not getting any sleep, Rubin warned that people will be “in these suits for eight or nine hours” and doing extravehicular activities (EVAs) “every day.”

Compared to the suits NASA astronauts wore during the Apollo missions, the Axiom Space suit is considerably heavier. While a sixth of gravity will greatly alleviate some of that heft, they still weigh in at 300 pounds. At the same time, Moon walkers will enjoy greatly enhanced flexibility, allowing them to kneel down to pick up objects, for instance.

“I think the suits are better than Apollo, but I don’t think they are great right now,” Rubin warned, noting “flexibility issues” and the reality that “people are going to be falling over.”

In remarks directly to Ars, Rubin elaborated, emphasizing that the suits are “definitely much better than Apollo,” but remain “still quite heavy.”

Even something as simple as getting back up after a fall — as demonstrated by the many Apollo astronauts who took a tumble while on the Moon — involves a type of “jumping pushup,” as Rubins told Ars, which is a “non-trivial” and “risky maneuver.”

Not everybody is as concerned about the Axiom Space suit. Current NASA astronaut and physician Mike Barratt argued in remarks during the committee meeting that the “suit is getting there,” pointing out that “we’ve got 700 hours of pressurized experience in it right now.”

“Bending down in the suit is really not too bad at all,” he added.

NASA still plans to conduct plenty of tests involving the suit, including parabolic flight, which can simulate the partial gravity of the Moon’s surface. The agency has already put the suit through its paces underwater at NASA’s Neutral Buoyancy Lab.

The agency has until sometime next year to finalize the design for its long-awaited Artemis 3 mission to the lunar surface. At the same time, NASA still has plenty of decisions to make, including how to get down to the lunar surface in the first place.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine enters its fourth year, remotely-operated ground robots have become a startlingly common sight on the battlefield.

According to the defense policy think tank, the Jamestown Foundation, Ukraine has turned into a world leader in unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), allowing the country’s military to coordinate robotic warfare while reducing casualties.

Now, a video making the rounds on social media appears to show three Russian soldiers emerging from a building with their arms raised and surrendering to a robot armed with a machine gun. One of the soldiers appears to be covered in blood, adding to the sense of surreal darkness. A separate drone appears to be trained on the soldiers as well.

According to the Ukrainian military news outlet Militarnyi, the robot was a reconnaissance-strike ground unit dubbed Droid TW, built by Ukrainian defense company DevDroid. The washing machine-sized platform uses AI to autonomously identify targets and can shoot 7.62mm caliber rounds. The robot was developed at the request of the First Medical Battalion of the Ukrainian army, which was seeking a way to evacuate wounded soldiers under heavy fire — but considering the footage, the army may have found a different use for it as well.

The Jamestown Foundation noted that Ukrainian UVGs are “increasingly replacing infantry in high-risk missions, providing sustained firepower, engineering support, and resilience against electronic warfare, terrain challenges, and prolonged deployments.”

The country has had to seriously step up its game, with 40 Ukrainian defense companies producing 99 percent of UGVs domestically. As The Economist reported last year, there are around 200 different models of these robots, ranging from AI-enabled anti-drone laser guns to ground-based machine-gun platforms.

Other robots can lay down anti-tank mines, transport tons of materials for infantry on the front lines, or provide cover from the air under heavy artillery to exfiltrate injured soldiers. Some are outfitted with dozens of pounds of explosives to self-destruct near fortifications or bridges.

Ukraine is also getting a hand from Western defense companies, like German firm ARX Robotics, which is manufacturing a fleet of small tank-like UGVs.

Apart from videos of Russian soldiers surrendering, we’ve seen footage of UGVs engaging Russian armored personnel carriers. We’ve also seen other buggy-sized “Droid” UGVs, built by DevDroid, fighting with Russian infantry.

In short, the frontlines of the Russia-Ukraine war are a weird laboratory for modern warfare, which, against all odds, has given Ukraine a considerable tactical edge over its much larger adversary.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Earlier this week, news emerged that SpaceX CEO Elon Musk was considering taking his private space company public on his birthday in June at a staggering valuation of $1.5 trillion, making it easily the largest IPO in history.

Now, as Reuters reports, Musk is hoping to go one step further, merging his AI startup xAI with SpaceX ahead of the IPO — a baffling plan that raises far more questions than answers.

For now, we have no idea why the deal is even on the table, let alone the financial specifics. The narrative will likely have something to do with SpaceX helping xAI launch data centers into Earth’s orbit — an idea that AI tech leaders have become obsessed with as of late, despite experts warning it makes little sense, citing concerns over economic viability and bandwidth limitations.

“The lowest cost place to put AI will be in space,” Musk said during an interview in Davos last week. “And that will be true within two years, maybe three at the latest.”

Other companies, most notably Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, are also looking to launch thousands of satellites that will ultimately serve data centers from space. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has also been infatuated by the idea, arguing that bringing data centers closer to the Sun could allow them to reap practically unlimited amounts of solar energy while in orbit.

According to Reuters, two entities in Nevada, including a limited liability company that lists SpaceX chief financial officer Bret Johnsen, have been set up to facilitate the swapping of xAI and SpaceX shares. A source told the news agency that xAI executives could receive cash instead of SpaceX stock as part of the deal.

SpaceX already agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI last year as part of the startup’s fundraising round. Both xAI and SpaceX have secured major defense contracts with the Pentagon. Just earlier this year, defense secretary Pete Hegseth revealed that Musk’s AI chatbot Grok will be operating inside Pentagon networks.

SpaceX is also developing a national security version of its Starlink broadband internet network, called Starshield, which is expected to use AI to track targets back on the surface, according to Reuters.

Musk is no stranger to merging his own businesses. Last year, for instance, he folded his social media echo chamber X into xAI. His embattled EV maker, Tesla, is also seemingly getting in on the fun, announcing that it had agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI earlier this week, after reporting some disastrous earnings.

            <h2>Sam Altman Says Oops, They Accidentally Made the New Version of ChatGPT Worse Than the Previous One</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s been a little over three years since the launch of the first commercially-available large language model (LLM) chatbot, OpenAI’s ChatGPT. And though the AI model has certainly made performance gains since it came online, the lackluster performance of recent iterations hasn’t helped the perception that LLMs are hitting a plateau.

Case in point, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently conceded that the company had “screwed up” the language capabilities of its latest chatbot iteration, GPT-5.2.

“I think we just screwed that up,” Altman said at a developer town hall on Monday. “We will make future versions of GPT 5.x hopefully much better at writing than 4.5 was.”

Continuing, Altman said that the company chose to focus on ChatGPT’s technical capabilities, perhaps to the detriment of its human-language performance.

“We did decide, and I think for good reason, to put most of our effort in 5.2 into making it super good at intelligence, reasoning, coding, engineering, that kind of thing,” Altman said. “And we have limited bandwidth here, and sometimes we focus on one thing and neglect another.”

The admission raises a high-stakes question: whether frontier AI models can continue to excel at tasks across the board, or if proficiency in one domain will start to come at the expense of a broader skill set.

As Search Engine Journal points out, the release of GPT-5.2 came with a huge emphasis on technical tasks like coding and formatting spreadsheets. Compared to past iterations, there was scarce mention of any writing or creative work at all, a pivot which has left many non-technical users feeling like ChatGPT is hitting a wall.

As data scientist and tech blogger Mehul Gupta pointed out in a review of GPT-5.2, there are plenty of signs that the LLM is backsliding, and some of them aren’t particularly subtle.

These include a “flatter tone,” worse translation capability, inconsistent behavior across tasks, and some major regression in “instant mode,” a setting meant to provide immediate answers to simple questions.

As Gupta writes, it also struggles with real-world tasks. When it comes to evaluating human documents like contracts, mixed-format notes or PDFs, GPT-5.2 “forgot earlier details, contradicted itself, misread cross-references, [and] hallucinated clarifications that didn’t exist.”

“Benchmarks are clean,” Gupta observed. “Real documents are not. 5.2 still struggles with the noise of reality.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ethos Technologies, a San Francisco-based provider of software for selling life insurance, debuted on the Nasdaq on Thursday. As one of the year’s first major tech IPOs, the insurtech platform is being closely watched as a bellwether for the 2026 listing cycle.

The company and its selling shareholders raised approximately $200 million in the offering, selling 10.5 million shares at $19 each under the ticker symbol “LIFE” — one of the more on-the-nose choices in recent memory. The name fits. Ethos runs a three-sided platform where consumers buy policies online in 10 minutes without medical exams. It says over 10,000 independent agents use its software to sell those policies and that carriers like Legal & General America and John Hancock rely on it for underwriting and administrative services. Ethos itself isn’t an insurer — it’s a licensed agency earning commissions on sales.

Though the company’s stock closed its first day as a public company at $16.85, 11% below its IPO price of $19, Ethos co-founders Peter Colis and Lingke Wang still have plenty to celebrate, having grown the 10-year-old business to public-market scale.

“When we launched [the business], there were like eight or nine other life insurtech startups that looked very similar to Ethos, with similar Series A funding,” Colis told TechCrunch. “Over time, the vast majority of those startups have pivoted, been acquired at subscale, remain at subscale or gone out of business.”

For instance, Policygenius, which raised over $250 million from investors, including KKR and Norwest Venture Partners, was acquired by PE-backed Zinnia in 2023. Meanwhile, Health IQ, a startup that secured more than $200 million from prominent VCs like Andreessen Horowitz, filed for bankruptcy that same year.

Ethos, which has raised over $400 million in venture capital, could have easily succumbed to a similar fate. Instead, the company remained laser-focused on reaching profitability as the era of cheap capital and easy fundraising came to an end in 2022. “Not knowing what the ongoing funding climate would be, we got really serious about ensuring profitability,” Colis said.

That financial discipline transformed it into a profitable company by mid-2023, according to its IPO documents. Since then, Ethos has also maintained a year-over-year revenue growth rate of more than 50%. In the nine months ending September 30, 2025, the company generated almost $278 million in revenue and just under $46.6 million in net income.

Still, the company ended its first day as a public company with a market capitalization of about $1.1 billion, a valuation that’s significantly below the $2.7 billion it garnered in its last private round led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2 in July 2021.

When asked why Ethos went public, Colis said that a big part of the reason was to bring “additional trust and credibility” to potential partners and clients. He explained that because many major insurance carriers are over a century old, being publicly traded signals the company’s staying power.

The largest outside shareholders of Ethos include prominent firms, including Sequoia, Accel, Google’s venture arm GV, and SoftBank, as well as General Catalyst and Heroic Ventures. Sequoia and Accel did not sell shares in the IPO, the company disclosed.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple had a great Q1, though iPhone sales were the real standout. The company reports that its signature device had its best quarter ever, thanks partially to a surge of sales in regions like China and India.

“iPhone had its best-ever quarter driven by unprecedented demand, with all-time records across every geographic segment,” said CEO Tim Cook during the company’s earnings call Thursday. Apple’s earnings report shows the company sold $85 billion worth of iPhones during its first quarter, up from $69 billion in the same period last year.

During the call’s Q&A portion, Cook revealed that China had seen a huge surge in sales. “It was driven by iPhone, where we set an all-time revenue record,” Cook said, noting that it was the “best iPhone quarter in history in Greater China.” Cook said the sales bump had been driven by enthusiasm for the iPhone 17, which was announced in September. The new model has proven to be significantly more popular than the company’s previous iPhone.

Apple’s earnings report shows that its overall sales in the Greater China region jumped from $18.5 billion in the year-ago quarter to $25.5 billion. Cook noted that, overall, the company had fared quite well in the region. “I would tell you that during the quarter, traffic in our stores in China grew by strong double digits year over year,” he said.

Cook also highlighted India as another region where iPhones — as well as other products — seemed to be flying off the shelves. “We did set a quarterly revenue record during the December quarter,” Cook said, noting that records had been set for “iPhone and Mac and iPad [sales] and an all-time revenue record on services.” Cook called it “a terrific quarter” in a country that he noted is “the second largest smartphone market in the world and the fourth largest PC market.”

The iPhone aside, Apple’s overall sales jumped across every geographical region, its earnings report shows. In the Americas, for instance, sales went from $52.6 billion a year ago to $58.5 billion, while in Europe, they increased from $33.8 billion to $38.1 billion.

            <div id="article-text">Apple exceeded expectations when it reported its quarterly earnings on Thursday, revealing that it made $143.8 billion in revenue for a 16% year-over-year increase. As analysts peppered CEO Tim Cook with softball questions during Apple’s earnings call, one analyst dared to ask the question that seemingly no one in Silicon Valley is willing to ask.

“When I think about your AI initiatives, you know, it’s clear there are added costs associated with that… Many of your competitors have already integrated AI into their devices, and it’s just not clear yet what incremental monetization they’re seeing because of AI…,” started Morgan Stanley’s Erik Woodring.

Could there be a tinge of nervousness underneath this Finance Man’s probably-very-financey facade? In what I can only imagine must have been a Herculean display of courage, Woodring asked the question that lurks only in the darkest, dampest recesses of investors’ minds.

You’d think this would come up more. You would be wrong. Instead, Big Tech has taken a largely vibes-driven approach to AI development. Take OpenAI, for instance, which may seem like it’s on top of the world, given how ChatGPT has embedded itself into the cultural consciousness. But the company isn’t planning to make any money until 2030. Analysts from HBSC are even doubtful about that timeline, especially since it will need another $207 billion in funding, estimates say. Ask anyone in tech how OpenAI is planning to break even, and you’ll be met with the verbal equivalent of the ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ emoticon.

But good ol’ Tim “$143.8 billion in revenue” Cook was having a good afternoon, so maybe he’d finally spill the beans about how any of these companies are planning to recoup their investments.

“Well, let me just say that we’re bringing intelligence to more of what people love, and we’re integrating it across the operating system in a personal and private way, and I think that by doing so, it creates great value, and that opens up a range of opportunities across our products and services,” Cook said.

So, there you have it, folks. Apple will monetize AI by creating “great value.” And, crucially, that will “open up a range of opportunities.” Which we will experience in “products and services.” Cool!

Well, shout-out to that Morgan Stanley guy for trying.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/elon-musk-spacex-tesla-xai-merger-talks-ipo-reuters/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Three of Elon Musk’s companies — SpaceX, xAI, and Tesla — are in play for a potential merger. While the talks appear to be in the early stage, according to reports from Bloomberg and Reuters, it could eventually lead to at least one company folding into SpaceX.

Two scenarios are being hashed out. In one, SpaceX and Tesla would merge, per Bloomberg, citing unnamed insiders. In another, SpaceX and aXI (which already owns Musk’s social media platform X) would combine.

According to reporting by Reuters, a merger between SpaceX and xAI could take place ahead of a planned SpaceX IPO this year. This would bring products like the Grok chatbot, X platform, Starlink satellites, and SpaceX rockets together under one corporation.

Company representatives from SpaceX and xAI have not discussed this possibility in public. However, recent filings show that two new corporate entities were established in Nevada on January 21, which are called K2 Merger Sub Inc. and K2 Merger Sub 2 LLC. This suggests that Musk is keeping all options open.

There are upsides to either scenario. Combining the SpaceX and xAI companies could allow xAI to put its data centers in space, something Musk has said he wants. A SpaceX-Tesla tie-up could align the EV maker’s energy storage business with the data center in space idea as well.

And both options — as well as a combination of all three companies — fall in line with Musk’s comments and recent actions to consolidate, or at the very least share resources between them. Last year, SpaceX agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI, according to The Wall Street Journal, and earlier this week, Tesla (also led by Musk) revealed it, too, invested $2 billion in the AI startup.

Last year, xAI bought X in a deal that Musk said valued xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion. SpaceX, which has been around since 2002, reportedly launched a secondary sale that valued it at $800 billion, making it the most valuable private company in the U.S.

A recent Financial Times report indicated that Musk wants to take SpaceX public in June. Then again, Musk’s grand plans rarely happen on time.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI, a company already valued at $500 billion, has made it known that it’s on the hunt for another $100 billion in investment. Such a funding round could lead the company’s valuation to shoot up to a titanic $830 billion. The Wall Street Journal is now reporting that Amazon may contribute at least $50 billion of that record-breaking investment.

Not much is known about the potential deal, although the Journal notes that Amazon’s CEO, Andy Jassy, is currently leading the negotiations with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. TechCrunch reached out to Amazon and OpenAI for comment.

In its pursuit of additional funding, OpenAI has also reportedly been having discussions with sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East, and The New York Times has written that the startup has held additional talks with Nvidia, Microsoft, and SoftBank. The funding deal is expected to close by the end of Q1.

Such a partnership between Amazon and OpenAI would be particularly interesting because of Amazon’s close ties to the OpenAI competitor Anthropic. Amazon’s AWS is the primary cloud and training provider for Anthropic, and the company has invested at least $8 billion into Anthropic. Amazon also recently opened an $11 billion data center campus in Indiana, designed to exclusively run Anthropic models.

            <div id="article-text">Hustle culture may be the norm at tech companies in the AI era, but the work will stop tomorrow at publishing platform Medium. Medium CEO Tony Stubblebine is giving the company’s employees permission to take the day off to participate in tomorrow’s nationwide general strike protesting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.

Activists behind the general strike are calling for “no work, no school, and no shopping” amid a push to defund ICE, which has escalated raids in U.S. cities, killing several people, including two U.S. citizens earlier this month in Minneapolis.

In a Slack message shared today with Medium staff, Stubblebine says all employees are free to participate in the strike however they see fit.

“Whether or not you want to fully take the day away from work, or do a partial work day, or orient your work towards something that feels aligned to the goals of the strike, that is up to you,” he wrote in a general announcements channel.

The exec clarified that Medium is not “in the business of dictating people’s politics,” so the choice to participate was an individual one, not a company mandate.

Of course, the publishing platform has an important role in helping people share news, opinions, insights, and analysis around politics, culture, and other topics. So that it can allow its employees to take the day off to protest, Stubblebine said Medium will coordinate with the necessary teams to ensure there’s a plan for “business continuity” on Friday.

Tech leaders, including Google DeepMind chief scientist Jeff Dean, have been outspoken in protest of ICE. Still, many large tech companies and executives have spent the last several weeks courting favor with the Trump administration. Some execs — including Apple CEO Tim Cook — were criticized for attending the screening of the Amazon MGM Studios-produced “Melania” documentary on the day federal border control agents shot and killed ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.

Many rank-and-file tech employees, meanwhile, have demanded that ICE and CBP (Customs and Border Protection) get out of U.S. cities, as evidenced by the open letter signed by more than 500 tech industry employees.

Stubblebine seems to share that opinion, writing that Medium has a responsibility to “make its stance clear,” especially “as many other tech orgs are donating to the Trump campaign.” He also said that Medium’s product exists to help “elevate truth and diverse voices,” not hateful content or racism.

His message also reiterated Medium’s support for DEI, the set of pro-diversity policies the Trump administration has attempted to dismantle through executive orders, the elimination of DEI positions in the federal workforce, curriculum removals, legal targeting, and more.

“Our business thrives when the country thrives, and so being out there representing is good for [our] mission,” Stubblebine said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Before Elon Musk, most electric vehicles seemed less like an alternative to gasoline than an argument in its favor. The sad state of affairs for EVs for many years was that they were slow, impractical, and largely enticing only if you lived with copious guilt over your carbon emissions.

Then Tesla came out with the Tesla Model S. The speedy, high-tech sedan didn’t just leave other EVs in the dust; it could compete with the likes of BMW and Mercedes-Benz. “EVs went from ‘eating your vegetables’ to getting you super-car performance in a vehicle that’s luxurious and quiet,” Jake Fisher, the senior director of auto testing at Consumer Reports, told me. The Model S proved something that’s now easy to take for granted: EVs can work, and ordinary people might actually want one. A year after the Model S’s 2012 debut, Musk personally drove one coast-to-coast to prove that it was just as capable as a gas car.

Now the Model S is going away. During Tesla’s earnings call yesterday, Musk announced that his company will soon stop manufacturing the car that launched his empire. “That is slightly sad,” he acknowledged on the call. In a sense, it was inevitable. Tech products get killed off all the time to make way for something better; Apple no longer sells the iPhone 4. Indeed, the Tesla Model S has become irrelevant and overpriced compared with the company’s newer cars. (As a Road & Track headline put it in 2023, “The Tesla Model S Has Lived Long Enough to See Itself Become a Villain.”) Nearly all of Tesla’s global sales come from the more affordable Model Y and Model 3, leaving the original Model S unceremoniously lumped in with “Other Models” in the company’s financial reports.

But Tesla is not phasing out the Model S to focus on making even better cars. The move is part of a retreat from the car business. Tesla will stop producing the Model S and another one of its less popular cars, the gull-winged Model X SUV, in order to free up space at its California factory to build the human robot Optimus. “It is time to bring the S and X programs to an end and shift to an autonomous future,” Musk said yesterday. He’s made very clear that he wants to reposition Tesla as an AI company. The promise of robotaxis that can take you to work and robots that water your plants is why Tesla’s investors recently offered Musk a $1 trillion pay package even as the company’s car sales are slumping and slumping. If cars like the Model S changed the world, the investors would argue, then there’s no reason to believe that Musk’s vision for robots can’t do something even grander. (Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.)

Read: Tesla wants out of the car business

This plan had better work. Now that Tesla seems largely done with making new car models, the company is throwing away a lot in order to go all in on autonomy. The irony is that in canceling the Model S, Tesla is effectively walking away from a business that it helped create. Even at its apex, the Model S never sold as well as something like the Toyota Camry. (The Tesla’s initial starting price of about $100,000 immediately put it out of reach for most car buyers.) But it is undoubtedly the most important car of the 21st century. The global EV industry would not be what it is today without it.

Perhaps the biggest legacy of the Model S is that it turned cars into gadgets. From the get-go, Tesla owners enjoyed a parade of new features rolled out via software downloads. Until the Model S, whatever features your car had at purchase were essentially all you ever got, unless you modified it yourself or paid a shop to do it. Tesla pioneered the idea of a car that could, like a smartphone, get better over time with digital upgrades. At times, software updates can be a nuisance for drivers: Some features are now locked behind a subscription paywall. This kind of approach has made Tesla a tech company, with a stock price more reminiscent of Silicon Valley than of Detroit. Tesla is now worth more than most other car companies combined.

Naturally, other automakers were eager to replicate the Tesla playbook. By the late 2010s, the rest of the industry was scrambling to chase Tesla’s progress and innovation (and that stock price). Other companies have since sunk billions of dollars into EVs, batteries, and software, all to varying degrees of success. Software updates are something the sector is still struggling with. Even last year, when Tesla’s profits and sales sank, most Americans who bought an EV were opting for Teslas. And when Tesla set up its factory in China, it kicked that country’s auto industry into high gear. Now electric cars from companies such as Geely and Xiaomi handily outclass many of Tesla’s cars; the auto giant BYD just eclipsed Tesla to become the world’s biggest seller of EVs. Perhaps that’s why Tesla is moving away from making cars; it’s now up against dozens of other Teslas that have government support and considerable financial resources.

The Model S may have another enduring legacy: In addition to turning Tesla into an EV juggernaut, it also laid the groundwork for Musk’s eventual obsession with robots and robotaxis. Tesla’s “Autopilot” feature, which allows drivers to take their hands off the wheel on the highway and while parallel parking, debuted as a software upgrade on the Model S. Over time, this evolved into “Full Self-Driving,” for hands-free driving in cities. It’s the basis for Tesla’s AI-powered autonomous-car dreams and its hopes for robotics: A humanoid robot like Optimus should theoretically “see” and operate in the world much the same way.

Even so, Tesla is racing toward a totally unproven concept. The technology behind humanoid robots remains in its infancy, and there’s no guarantee that fully autonomous cars can be deployed safely at scale. Musk’s company proved that people could want electric cars. It might be a much taller order to prove that they’d want humanlike robots and cars without steering wheels.</div>

The attack on Representative Ilhan Omar on Tuesday was horrifying but depressingly predictable. Not only has the country seen a recent spree of political violence, but Omar, a Democrat from Minnesota, has also been a frequent target of death threats.

The suspect, whom police have identified as Anthony Kazmierczak, was arrested after he squirted a combination of apple-cider vinegar and water at Omar during a town hall in Minneapolis, according to court documents. She was apparently not injured in the attack and continued to speak for 25 minutes before being medically screened. Kazmierczak has a long rap sheet, and he also has a long record of social-media posts that support right-wing causes and President Trump. His brother told The Independent that Kazmierczak frequently complained about Somali immigrants and about Omar in particular, who was born in Somalia before immigrating and becoming an American citizen. Court documents allege that he once said someone “should kill that bitch.”

Kazmierczak’s alleged animosity toward Omar didn’t come out of nowhere. A chorus on the right, led by Trump, has worked for years to villainize her. When ABC News reached Trump on Tuesday night, he said that he hadn’t seen the footage of the attack but then baselessly claimed that Omar had staged the incident. “I don’t think about her. I think she’s a fraud,” he said. “She probably had herself sprayed, knowing her.”

For a guy who claims not to think about Omar, Trump sure seems obsessed with her. Just a few hours earlier, at a speech in Iowa, Trump had been talking about her. “She comes from a country that’s a disaster,” he said. “It’s considered, I think, the worst. It’s not even a country.” He has sought to make her the face of Somali immigration, usually invoking her name when he mentions the fraud rings involving Somali immigrants in Minnesota. (Omar has no known connection to the criminal investigations.) Trump has mentioned her at least 10 times this month alone on Truth Social, where he’s labeled her “disgusting,” called her a “fake ‘Congresswoman,’” and alleged that she married her brother, a long-running claim that fact-checkers have noted is baseless. He said last week that she should be investigated for “Political Crimes,” a chillingly authoritarian phrase, and even found time to rant about her during his speech at the World Economic Forum.

In fact, Trump helped turn Omar into a national figure in 2019, shortly after she entered Congress. “‘Progressive’ Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe,” should “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came,” he wrote on social media in July of that year. The comment was widely interpreted as a swipe at Omar (among others)—a theory that Trump effectively confirmed a few days later when he complained about her personally, inciting a rally crowd to chant “Send her back!”

In other words, Trump is a major driver of the visceral anger toward Omar. He knows the effect his words might have, though he avoids specifically encouraging violence against her, a phenomenon that Juliette Kayyem, a terrorism scholar and an Atlantic contributor, has called “stochastic terrorism.”

Trump is familiar with this line of thinking, even if he hasn’t used the academic term. After two attempts on his life in 2024, including one that left him bloodied in Butler, Pennsylvania, Trump and many of his allies charged that Democrats and other Trump critics were to blame for demonizing Trump and saying that he was a threat to democracy. Many of the same arguments followed the assassination of Charlie Kirk last year, and some on the right tried to crack down on political speech even as they hailed Kirk for defending it.

A handful of Omar’s critics, including Representative Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican, have condemned the attack on her. “Regardless of how vehemently I disagree with her rhetoric—and I do—no elected official should face physical attacks. This is not who we are,” Mace wrote on X. But others have hewed closer to Trump’s line. Representative Randy Fine, a Florida Republican, said that Omar shouldn’t have been attacked, and then immediately pivoted: “I also blame Ilhan Omar for what happened.”

After the assassination attempts on Trump and Kirk’s murder, some people believed that a national effort to lower tensions and avoid violent rhetoric might be possible. But the victim-blaming emanating from Trump and Fine shows that many prominent extremists have no appetite for calming their language, and they haven’t developed a principled commitment to suppressing political violence—they just don’t want their own side to face it. Maintaining a peaceful, stable democracy is nearly impossible when some prominent figures are willing to inflame and then shrug off violence against their political adversaries.

Here are four new stories from The Atlantic:

“At least,” a friend sighed, “they didn’t call it the 2026 National War Strategy.” True enough, although if Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth claims that he now leads the Department of War, logical consistency would suggest substituting the fiercer war for the feebler defense in the National Defense Strategy.

But logistical consistency, like coherence and gravitas, does not characterize the new NDS. It is a document that supposedly nests within the National Security Strategy, explaining at greater length the implications of overall policy for the armed forces. The 2026 version does not do that. Rather, it restates some of the basic priorities of the Trump administration but for the most part confines itself to flattery of the president, insults, and bombast.

Read. Writing a great memoir about choosing a “good enough” life, it turns out, is hard, Lily Meyer writes.

Listen. Bruce Springsteen’s “Streets of Minneapolis” taps into a time-old tradition to rail against a modern crisis, Spencer Kornhaber writes.

In Princeton, New Jersey, a short stroll from the university you have heard of, there lies a little campus home to the Institute for Advanced Study. It was founded in 1930 not to confer degrees nor—God forbid!—to make money, nor even to conduct research toward any end in particular. The institute proclaims that its purpose is “the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake.”

Founder Abraham Flexner reckoned that brilliant minds, once freed to pursue “useless satisfactions,” would stumble upon discoveries of “undreamed-of utility,” as he wrote in a magazine a few years into the institute’s work. It seems to have worked for Albert Einstein, who had an office there. J. Robert Oppenheimer, too.

Enjoy this week’s “useless” satisfactions. I look forward to your theory of everything the week after.

And by the way, did you know that one of the first American protest songs was “Yankee Doodle”? In 1755, a British doctor put new words to a popular tune, mocking the American colonists as “doodles,” or simpletons, and “dandies,” or fops.

Once war broke out, British fighters taunted their American opposition with the song, but as the tide shifted, the Americans embraced it and began belting it back with proud defiance. And in 1781, when the British surrendered at Yorktown, some witnesses reported that the moment was set to the music of “Yankee Doodle.”

And by the way, did you know that the United States spent only $10,000 on the last land that it outright purchased? In 1944, the country bought Water Island, 500 volcanic acres in the Caribbean just south of St. Thomas; it had purchased the Virgin Islands (including St. Thomas) from Denmark a few decades earlier.

Water Island was not then owned by Denmark, but rather the Danish East Asiatic Company. By World War II, the United States wanted Water Island too, to support military operations on St. Thomas, so it scooped up the land for a bargain.

This, however, was not the last time the United States tried to purchase land, and not even that decade. Two years after the Water Island purchase, the Truman administration offered Denmark $100 million in gold to buy … Greenland.

And by the way, did you know that the vaunted Athenians, inventors of democracy, most commonly selected their political officeholders by chance? Bronze tokens representing the adult men of Athens would be slotted into a carved-stone device called the kleroterion, then dice would be repeatedly dropped into the contraption to rule out tokens until only the number required to hold office remained.

The proper poli-sci term for this is sortition, which also applies to how the United States selects people for jury duty today. But imagine the rest of U.S. democracy working like that: You’re tossing out your junk mail when you notice a letter from the feds—congrats, the big government Plinko board has decided you’re serving one year in Congress. Good luck!

And by the way, did you know that—speaking of snow monsters—the U.S. State Department in 1959 issued guidance on yeti expeditions? It informed Americans who wished to hunt for the abominable snowman that they would have to comply with certain rules set by Nepal: They needed to pay for a permit, they had to share any photographic evidence they found, and they were allowed to capture the yeti alive but could kill it only “in an emergency arising out of self defence.”

Alas, this did not mean that State officials believed in the monster. Rather, they were trying to show their support for Nepalese sovereignty—and thus keep the country out of the clutches of a boogeyman that scared Americans even more than the yeti: communism.

And by the way, did you know that throughout the history of the Nobel Prizes, there have been years so turbulent that the Peace Prize committee determined not to confer an award, even as other categories went on?

This happened in a few of the interwar years as Nazi Germany rearmed, Italy invaded Ethiopia, and peace generally disintegrated. It was also the case for the years of World War I, with the exception of 1917, when the committee recognized the Red Cross for its humanitarian aid. (All of the Nobel Prizes were suspended during the early years of World War II.)

The circumstances were a bit different in 1948, when the committee ruled that “there was no suitable living candidate.” The clear message was that the award—which by rule cannot be given posthumously—should have gone to Mahatma Gandhi, assassinated earlier that year.</div>

In 1915, former President Theodore Roosevelt criss-crossed the country as a champion of what he called “Americanism.” The concept was becoming commonplace in American discourse, marking a stand against what he referred to as “hyphenated Americanism.” The persistence of such identities—German American, Italian American, Jewish American—was for Roosevelt “the one absolutely certain way of bringing this nation to ruin,” creating a “tangle of squabbling nationalities.” “The foreign-born population of this country,” Roosevelt said, “must be an Americanized population—no other kind can fight the battles of America either in war or peace.”

In 1916, the writer Randolph S. Bourne offered a rejoinder in The Atlantic. In his essay, “Trans-national America,” Bourne wondered: If Americanization on the terms that Roosevelt and others had defined failed, what of it? Should immigrants not shape their own lives as they see fit? Should they deny their own cultures and identities? To be open to this sort of cultural diversity was not, Bourne wrote, “to admit the failure of Americanization. It is not to fear the failure of democracy. It is rather to urge us to an investigation of what Americanism may rightly mean.”

Bourne’s investigation came in the form of this essay, which is often glossed as a rejection of the “melting pot” ideal and an early statement on multiculturalism—long before that term was in circulation. But in its immediate context, “Trans-national America” was something more urgent. During a moment of rising xenophobia and growing war fever, it was a direct challenge to the orthodoxy that there was only one way to be an American.

The alarm about immigrants and their incomplete assimilation into American life was not new to the mid-1910s. The wave of arrivals that began in the last decades of the 19th century sparked a range of nativist and exclusionary movements—particularly against East Asians—and considerable anxiety about those deemed too alien to integrate into the culture. The prospect of American intervention in the First World War after 1914 turned alarm into panic about immigrants’ supposedly divided loyalties. Calling on Congress for defense appropriations at the end of 1915, President Woodrow Wilson lashed out at those immigrants “who have poured the poison of disloyalty into the very arteries of our national life.” “Such creatures of passion, disloyalty, and anarchy,” he said, “must be crushed out.”

For Bourne, the mood was eerily redolent of what he’d seen in Germany when the First World War broke out in the summer of 1914. As he scrambled to leave the country at the end of a post-college European tour, he saw how quickly militarism could coalesce into conformity—and how easily people could forget their principles in the process. At home in 1916, Bourne watched as calls for military “preparedness” merged with hardening definitions of loyalty and belonging.

Bourne tendered “Trans-national America” to The Atlantic (which had published his early work) to persuade Americans that they were asking the wrong questions about identity and belonging. If the melting pot had failed and the hyphenated Americans remained hyphenated, this was so much the better in Bourne’s view. Stripping new arrivals of their cultures and identities and forcing them into an Anglo-Saxon mold that didn’t fit them couldn’t be called freedom. It wasn’t even terribly American, considering so much of what passed for Anglo-Saxon culture in the United States was rooted in what Bourne saw as cowering fealty to English practice and precedent.

“Trans-national America” offered what Bourne called “a higher ideal.” America represented, in his telling, “a unique sociological fabric” as a gathering of the world’s peoples. The country’s dynamism lay not in its uniformity but in its diversity. A capacious America could avoid the fate of an Old World embroiled in a brutal military conflict. “Living here in mutual toleration, freed from the age-long tangles of races, creeds, and dynasties,” Americans could work out what Bourne called “a federated ideal” in which people were “mingled, yet not homogeneous”—in which “they merge, but they do not fuse.” This was Bourne’s concept of “trans-nationality”: a cosmopolitan American identity that embraced the world, and America itself, rather than emulating what had come before. Why, Bourne wondered, would anyone reject such a vital national formation? The alternative—“the weary old nationalism,—belligerent, exclusive, inbreeding”—was on display in a Europe at war.

Although Bourne was not an immigrant himself, he knew what it was to be an outsider in a world that was wary of them. During his birth, an obstetrician’s forceps had deformed his face; when he was a young child, spinal tuberculosis had stunted his growth and curved his spine. Bourne moved through the world keenly aware of both his disability and his difference—to which he testified with incisive clarity in a September 1911 Atlantic essay. As an undergraduate at Columbia, Bourne came to feel at home and first glimpsed the possibility of his “higher ideal” in lively intellectual exchange. To argue, debate, and ultimately understand was the foundation of what Bourne called a “Beloved Community” rooted in respect for people’s ideas and individuality. The model of the college could be expanded to the country at large, a nation built on “intellectual sympathy” for “different cultural expressions.” Such a community, Bourne said, “will make understanding and not indignation its end. Such a sympathy will unite and not divide.”

But Bourne’s essay and ideas could not stem a tide that was becoming a torrent. The continued drift toward war would only further amplify the panic over immigration. Bourne called for national educational service as a means of advancing his vision of a beloved community on a national scale; others welcomed American intervention abroad, and the conscripted military service it would require, as the best means to “yank the hyphen” out of immigrants with supposedly split loyalties. The immediate future did not belong to Bourne but to those he wrote against. Bourne’s more strident anti-war writings after “Trans-national America” would get him blackballed from most mainstream publications. The broader xenophobia of the time was built into a series of laws restricting immigration, increased suppression of dissent, and the rise of a national Ku Klux Klan that appropriated “100 percent Americanism” as its slogan.

Mercifully, perhaps, Bourne was not around to see it. He died in 1918, a victim of the flu pandemic. Although never quite forgotten, Bourne’s ideas gained new currency in the 1960s; a reflection and anthology of his work was published in 1965—the same year the Immigration and Nationality Act reversed the restrictions that had been in place since the 1920s. At least for a little while, people were able to see, as Bourne did, that “it bespeaks poverty of imagination not to be thrilled at the incalculable potentialities of so novel a union of men.”</div>

Americans have now seen with their own eyes the cost of President Trump’s abuse of power and disregard for the Constitution. Videos of the killing of Pretti and Renee Good by federal agents have exposed the lies of Trump-administration officials who were quick to smear the victims as “domestic terrorists.” Even Americans who have grown habituated to Trump’s excesses have been shaken by these killings and the reflexively cruel and dishonest response from the administration.

This crisis also reveals a deeper moral rot at the heart of Trump’s MAGA movement. Whatever you think about immigration policy, how can a person of conscience justify the lack of compassion and empathy for the victims in Minnesota, and for the families torn apart or hiding in fear, for the children separated from their parents or afraid to go to school?

That compassion is weak and cruelty is strong has become an article of MAGA faith. Trump and his allies believe that the more inhumane the treatment, the more likely it is to spread fear. That’s the goal of surging heavily armed federal forces into blue states such as Minnesota and Maine—street theater of the most dangerous kind. Other recent presidents, including Joe Biden, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton, managed to deport millions of undocumented immigrants without turning American cities into battlegrounds or making a show of keeping children in cages.

“The cruelty is the point,” as The Atlantic’s Adam Serwer memorably put it during Trump’s first term. The savagery is a feature, not a bug. By contrast, as Serwer noted recently in these pages, the people of Minnesota have responded with an approach you could call “‘neighborism’—a commitment to protecting the people around you, no matter who they are or where they came from.” To my ears, that’s as Christian a value as it gets.

The glorification of cruelty and rejection of compassion don’t just shape the Trump administration’s policies. Those values are also at the core of Trump’s own character and worldview. And they have become a rallying cry for a cadre of hard-right “Christian influencers” who are waging a war on empathy.

Their twisted campaign validates Trump’s personal immorality and his administration’s cruelty. It marginalizes mainstream religious leaders who espouse traditional values that conflict with Trump’s behavior and agenda. And it threatens to pave the way for an extreme vision of Christian nationalism that seeks to replace democracy with theocracy in America.

The rejection of bedrock Christian values such as dignity, mercy, and compassion did not start with the crisis in Minnesota. The tone was set right at the beginning of this second Trump presidency. The day after taking the oath of office last January, Trump attended a prayer service at the National Cathedral. The Episcopal bishop of Washington, Mariann Edgar Budde, directed part of her sermon at the new president: “In the name of our God, I ask you to have mercy upon the people in our country who are scared now.” She spoke of children of immigrant families afraid that their parents would be taken away, refugees fleeing persecution, and young LGBTQ Americans who feared for their lives. It was an honest plea, suffused with the kind of love and generosity toward neighbors and strangers that Jesus taught.

Bishop Budde was immediately vilified. One Republican congressman said she “should be added to the deportation list.” The pastor and influencer Ben Garrett warned his followers, “This snake is God’s enemy and yours too. She hates God and His people. You need to properly hate in response.” The right-wing Christian podcaster Allie Beth Stuckey called the sermon “toxic empathy that is in complete opposition to God’s Word and in support of the most satanic, destructive ideas ever conjured up.” Toxic empathy! What an oxymoron. I don’t know if the phrase reflects moral blindness or moral bankruptcy, but either way it’s appalling.

This is certainly not what I was taught in Sunday school, not what my reading of the Bible teaches me, and not what I believe Jesus preached in his short time on Earth. Yes, I went to Sunday school. In fact, my mother taught Sunday school at our Methodist church in Park Ridge, Illinois. As an adult, I occasionally taught at our church in Little Rock, Arkansas. Some people—such as the Republican congressman who once called me the Antichrist—might find this surprising. (When I confronted him, he mumbled something about not having meant it. Trump later appointed him to his Cabinet.)

I’ve never been one to wear my faith on my sleeve, but that doesn’t mean it’s not important to me. Quite the opposite: My faith has sustained me, informed me, saved me, chided me, and challenged me. I don’t know who I would be or where I would have ended up without it. So I am not a disinterested observer here. I believe that Christians like me—and people of faith more generally—have a responsibility to stand up to the extremists who use religion to divide our society and undermine our democracy.

No less a religious authority than the late Pope Francis called out the Trump administration’s war on empathy. After Vice President Vance argued that Christians should be stingy with their love, prioritizing those close to us over strangers, he offered a rebuke. “Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons and groups,” the pope noted, before urging everyone to read up on the Good Samaritan.

Luis Parrales: What the border-hawk Catholics get wrong

The contrast between traditional Christian morality and Trumpian amorality was particularly stark at the memorial service for the slain MAGA activist Charlie Kirk in September. Kirk’s widow, Erika, publicly forgave her husband’s killer. “I forgive him because it was what Christ did,” she said. “The answer to hate is not hate. The answer we know from the Gospel is love and always love.”

It reminded me of the families of the victims of the Mother Emanuel Church massacre in Charleston, South Carolina. In 2015, nine Black worshippers were murdered at an evening Bible study by a young white man trying to start a race war. In court a few days later, one by one, grieving parents and siblings stood up and told the shooter, “I forgive you.”

Instead of being inspired by Erika Kirk’s grace, though, Trump rejected it. “I hate my opponent and I don’t want the best for them,” he declared. He would not forgive his enemies. “I am sorry, Erika,” he said. So much for “Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute you.”

With leadership like this, it’s no wonder that one survey found a quarter of Republicans and nearly 40 percent of Christian nationalists now agree that “empathy is a dangerous emotion that undermines our ability to set up a society that is guided by God’s truth.” MAGA rejects the teachings of Jesus to “love thy neighbor” and care for “the last, the least, and the lost.” It recognizes only a zero-sum war of all against all. The world may look gilded from the patio at Mar-a-Lago, but the MAGA view is fundamentally fearful and impoverished. MAGA sees a world of vengeance, scorn, and humiliation, and cannot imagine generosity or solidarity.

The whole exercise is suffused with barely disguised misogyny. The extremist pastor Joe Rigney wrote a book called Leadership and the Sin of Empathy. Rigney is an ally of the influential Christian nationalist Douglas Wilson, who thinks giving women the right to vote was a mistake and advocates turning the United States into a theocracy. (Would it shock you to know that Pete Hegseth is a big fan of Wilson’s?)

Rigney declared that Bishop Budde’s plea for mercy was “a reminder that feminism is a cancer that enables the politics of empathetic manipulation and victimhood that has plagued us in the era of wokeness.” Manipulation by wily women is a sexist trope as old as Adam and Eve, but this is an ugly new twist. Instead of women tempting men with vice, now the great fear is that women will tempt men with virtue.

Christian nationalism—the belief that God has called certain Christians to exercise dominion over every aspect of American life, with no separation between Church and state—is ascendant in Trump’s Washington. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, displays a historic flag outside his office on Capitol Hill that in recent years has been embraced by Christian nationalists. The same flag was carried by insurrectionists on January 6, 2021, and flown by Justice Samuel Alito’s wife at the couple’s vacation home.

The National Council of Churches, the largest ecumenical organization for mainline churches in the country, has warned about the dangers of Christian nationalism. “In this quest for political power, Christian humility is lost, as is the message of God’s love for all humanity,” the council said in a 2021 statement. “Where the Bible has at its core the story of a people committed to welcoming aliens and strangers because they themselves were aliens and strangers, and to defending the oppressed because they themselves were once oppressed, the Christian nationalist narrative rejects the stranger and judges the oppressed as deserving of their oppression.”

This is exactly the kind of mainstream Christian view that enrages Allie Beth Stuckey. The author of Toxic Empathy, who styles herself a voice for Christian women, has more than a million followers on social media. In between lifestyle pitter-patter and her demonization of IVF treatments, she warns women not to listen to their soft hearts. This commissar of MAGA morality targets other evangelicals whose empathy, she warns, has left them open to manipulation. Maybe they recognize the humanity of an undocumented immigrant family and decide that mass deportation has gone too far. Or they make space in their heart for a young rape survivor forced to carry a pregnancy to term and start questioning the wisdom and morality of total abortion bans. It’s all toxic to Stuckey.

The don’t-love-thy-neighbor Christians have powerful allies in the war on empathy. Silicon Valley techno-authoritarians and social Darwinists argue that empathy is weakness and “suicidal” for civilization because it gets in the way of ruthless ambition and efficiency. That’s pretty rich for the crew that’s busy building artificial-intelligence systems they freely admit might obliterate humanity one day. But these are the same billionaires who dismiss critics and liberals as “NPCs,” or non-player characters, a video-game term for nonhumans. Once you see people that way, why would you care about understanding or helping them?

Elizabeth Bruenig: The conservative attack on empathy

They may be convinced that they’re the smartest guys in the room, but they’re dead wrong about this. Empathy won’t destroy civilization; indeed, it just might save it. We can debate policies. We can debate theology. But if we give up on empathy, we give up on any real chance of coming together to solve our problems. Empathy does not overwhelm our critical thinking or blind us to moral clarity. It opens our eyes to moral complexity. It’s not a sign of weakness; it’s a source of strength.

This might be lost on tycoons who have a huge financial interest in leaving the rest of us behind on their way to Mars, but one might hope Christians would know better. You don’t need to look too far back to find examples of those who do. I disagreed with President George W. Bush about many things, but I respected his sincere belief in a more “compassionate conservatism.” There was no greater proof of this commitment than the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, a mission of mercy that helped save an estimated 26 million lives. It was a public-health miracle. Many of the program’s most ardent champions were evangelical Christians inspired by Jesus’s teachings to heal the sick and feed the hungry. That hasn’t stopped the Trump administration from slashing PEPFAR and other lifesaving assistance to people in need around the world. Experts predict that 14 million people could die by 2030 as a result—including millions of children.

Some earlier leaders of the religious right were also cruel and demagogic. When I was coming up in politics, we had huckster televangelists instead of social-media snake-oil salesmen, but the game was the same: exploit religion to profiteer and push an extreme political agenda. In the 1980s, right-wing firebrands such as Jerry Falwell and Anita Bryant claimed that the AIDS epidemic was a plague sent by God to punish gay people. There was no shortage of rhetoric that I would call dehumanizing or un-Christian. These reactionary religious forces led a decades-long campaign against women’s rights and gay rights that helped turn the Republican Party against democracy itself. The rise of unabashed Christian nationalists is their legacy.

But what we’re seeing today feels different—and more dangerous. The question of who deserves empathy, and the rights and respect that flow from our shared humanity, has always been highly contested in our politics. But until now, no major American political movement has ever seriously suggested that empathy and compassion themselves are suspect.

The decline of mainstream Christian voices in recent decades left a vacuum that the most extreme ideologues and provocateurs eagerly filled. The Catholic Church and the old mainline Protestant denominations have been weakened by destabilizing scandals and schisms, and have seen declining attendance. With the percentage of Americans identifying as Christian hitting record lows, the National Council of Churches expects that as many as 100,000 churches across the country will close in the coming years, mostly mainstream Methodist, Presbyterian, and Lutheran congregations.

It has pained me to see my own United Methodist Church split by deep disagreements over gay rights. Many conservative American congregations seceded and joined with traditionalist congregations in Africa and elsewhere to form a separate, less inclusive Church. Other denominations have faced similar struggles. All of this has left room for upstarts such as Douglas Wilson’s Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches, a growing network of more than 150 Christian-nationalist congregations.

Another factor is Trump himself. No one mistakes him for a devout Christian or a person of faith or morality. But his corruption isn’t just a personal matter—it taints everything he touches, including his Christian supporters. The conventional wisdom is that Trump says out loud what many others think privately, that his blunt bigotry gives permission for people to throw off the shackles of political correctness and woke piety. That may be partly true. He does bring out the worst in people. But it’s more than that. He makes people worse. Cruelty and ugliness are infectious. When they become the norm, we all suffer.

Consider the contrast between Trump and Reagan, two presidents beloved by the religious right. Reagan offered a vision of an optimistic, sunny, welcoming America. He called it a shining city on a hill. His policies often failed to match his rhetoric, but the stories we tell ourselves matter. They shape our national narrative and shared moral framework. By contrast, Trump’s story is dark and angry, filled with “American carnage” in the streets. It makes sense that his political movement—and its version of Christianity—would be dark and angry, too.

Reagan cultivated a distinctly American mythos: the aw-shucks cowboy working his ranch and standing up to tyranny. Trump, especially in this second term, has styled himself as a gold-plated Caesar, the farthest thing from an American ideal. Instead of the decency of Washington we get the decadence of Caligula; rather than the humility of Lincoln, the cruelty of Nero. You’d think good Christians would see the irony of throwing their lot in with a wannabe Roman emperor, but the whole point of a cult of personality is to leave you blind and afraid.

Finally, I am convinced that the uniquely pernicious dynamics of social media have put all of these trends on steroids. Our addiction to algorithms has made society more lonely, anxious, and mean. Platforms like TikTok and Elon Musk’s X reward extremism and marginalize moderation. They promote negativity and smother positivity. Empathy doesn’t drive engagement, so it’s not valuable.

In the 1980s, I was impressed by Neil Postman’s book Amusing Ourselves to Death, which argued that television was corroding American society and democracy. He bemoaned how religion and politics had been reduced to shallow entertainment as a distracted public lost the ability to think clearly and debate rationally.

Today I find Postman’s warnings eerily prescient. He argued that “each medium, like language itself, makes possible a unique mode of discourse by providing a new orientation for thought, for expression, for sensibility.” Now that social media—and short-form, algorithmic video in particular—has taken over the world, it’s crucial that we understand how this medium is shaping our culture. It’s no coincidence that TikTok has given such a boost to far-right politics. It’s not just the hidden hand of the Chinese Communist Party, or the group of Trump supporters who recently bought the app’s American shell, although that’s also alarming. It’s that the medium is designed to boost vitriol and knee-jerk reactions rather than thoughtful dialogue. It provides fertile ground for misinformation and is inhospitable to serious journalism or debate.

Cultural critics have begun warning that we are at risk of becoming a “post-literate” society. They point to declining reading and math scores across the Western world in the years since the smartphone was introduced. The fear is that with fewer people reading books and newspapers, we’ll lose the ability to process complex ideas and arguments, become more susceptible to propaganda, and, to paraphrase Postman, scroll our way to oblivion.

There’s good reason to believe that a post-literate society will also be a post-moral society. We already have Christian influencers saying empathy is a sin. We have a president who is allergic to civic virtue. Americans spend countless hours on social media and are lonelier, angrier, and more distrustful than at any time I can remember.

A good place to start is to follow the example of courageous faith leaders standing up to the Trump administration’s abuses. On January 23, about 100 clergy were arrested after protesting deportation flights at the Minneapolis airport. They prayed and sang hymns in the brutal cold until police took them away. Many more have fanned out across the city to support protesters and help immigrant families in need.

David Brooks: America needs a mass movement—now

In November, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops released an unusual special message condemning “the indiscriminate mass deportation of people” and “the vilification of immigrants.” It is rare for America’s bishops to speak with one voice like this—the last time was in 2013—but they said, “We feel compelled now in this environment to raise our voices in defense of God-given human dignity.”

I hope grassroots faith leaders across the country who are appalled by what they see from an immoral administration and an extremist political right also find their voice. It is understandable that some stay silent out of fear. Influencers like Stuckey are zealously policing any deviation from the party line. But speaking truth to power has been part of the Christian tradition since the very beginning. The Christian community—and the country—would be stronger and healthier if we heard these voices.

We also need to contest this ground politically. If MAGA Republicans are going to give up on traditional virtues such as compassion and community, Democrats have an opportunity to fill that gap. The violent overreach in Minnesota may provide an opening to engage new audiences looking for alternatives. Many evangelical Christians who have long voted Republican are turned off by Trump’s venality and cruelty. Even some Republican leaders are starting to question the administration’s berserk immigration crackdown.

Democrats need a big tent that welcomes people of faith into our coalition, even if we don’t agree on every issue. Don’t forget, liberal Christianity has a long and storied history. Progressive people of faith have led virtually every major social movement. Think of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. marching with Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel in Selma. That’s a spirit we should work to reclaim.

Indeed, welcoming is not enough. Democrats should actively reach out to people of faith and try to win their trust and their votes. That dozens of liberal clergy have already signed up to run for office in the 2026 midterms is an encouraging sign. This doesn’t mean Democrats should abandon our commitments to freedom, justice, and equality for all, or fight any less hard for what we believe in. We should listen with an open heart and an open mind, and be unafraid to talk about our values.

I know empathy isn’t easy. But neither is Christianity. When Jesus called on us to turn the other cheek and pray for those who persecute us, it was supposed to be hard. We fail more than we succeed—we’re human—but the discipline is to keep trying.

It’s especially challenging to feel empathetic for people with whom we disagree passionately. I certainly struggle with this. You may remember that I once described half of Trump supporters as “the basket of deplorables.” I was talking about people drawn to racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, Islamophobia—you name it. “Some of those folks, they are irredeemable,” I said. I still believe intolerance and hatred are deplorable. Slandering a peaceful protester and cheering his murder is deplorable. Terrorizing children because their parents are undocumented is deplorable. But as a Christian, I also aspire to see the goodness in everyone and believe that everyone has a chance at redemption, no matter how remote.

When I see brutality like we’ve all witnessed in Minnesota, I ask myself: Can I really find empathy for people who insist on dehumanizing others? I’m not sure, to be honest. I’m still working on it. I believe our hearts are big enough to hold two truths at once. We can see the humanity in even the worst of our fellow human beings and still fiercely resist tyranny and repression. We can stand firm without mirroring the cruelty of our opponents. These are dark days in America. To rekindle our light, we must reject cruelty and corruption. To be strong, we need more empathy, not less.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The first few strums of Bruce Springsteen’s new song make you feel like you’re in for, well, a Bruce Springsteen song—a rollicking sing-along about rough-and-tumble but ultimately hopeful times in some troubled American town. And this song, “Streets of Minneapolis,” is exactly that.

It’s also a response to ICE’s bloody record in Minneapolis. It excoriates, by name, Kristi Noem, Stephen Miller, and “Trump’s federal thugs.” It memorializes Alex Pretti and Renee Good—the Americans killed by federal agents—and the “whistles and phones” still in use by demonstrators. The song’s considerable power lies in the way it transposes a classic, even hoary, mode of protest rock into the present. Springsteen conveys that we’re living through a time that will be sung about for years to come, and that the future depends a lot on what we do in this moment.

Springsteen has made many protest songs: the inequality elegy of “The Ghost of Tom Joad,” the post-9/11 rallying cry of “The Rising,” the Vietnam-veteran anthem “Born in the U.S.A.” As a reaction to law-enforcement overreach, “Minneapolis” especially recalls Springsteen’s 2000 song “American Skin (41 Shots),” about the police killing of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed Black man. And across his catalog, Springsteen’s concrete lyricism and drawling vocals channel folk music’s titans of protest, Bob Dylan and Woody Guthrie. Here, those influences are worn proudly, ringing out in a buoyant harmonica solo.

But the song that “Minneapolis” most evokes is Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young’s 1970 touchstone, “Ohio,” recorded after the National Guard killed four students during a protest at Kent State University. “Tin soldiers and Nixon coming,” sang Neil Young in a scene-setting verse; “King Trump’s private army from the DHS,” sings Springsteen now. Here we are again, late in a culture war, with a champion of a supposed silent majority breaking norms and pushing polarization. Here we are again as armed agents menace civilians. “Ohio” crystallized a moment that had already captured national attention, but it also invited listeners to suss out where they stand. “What if you knew her and found her dead on the ground?” Young asked. “How can you run when you know?”

“Streets of Minneapolis” doesn’t bother with questions. Its mission is to rouse in the manner of drinking songs, which its sloping melodies and gang-sung harmonies evoke. Springsteen has sounded bitter before, and mournful, but never this purely angry. His voice slithers and spits, reserving extra phlegm for the names of Donald Trump and his allies. Grace and warmth peek out in strategic moments as well, like the chorus’s oh-so-slowly intoned slant rhymes: the words Minneapolis, stranger in our midst, and—the poignance of this one took a moment to understand—26.

Twenty-six as in 2026: the exotic-sounding name of this new year in a decade that remains baffling more than halfway through. Who expected to be living this far in the future and yet trapped in the same old story? One can trace Minneapolis back not only to Kent State but also to the civil-rights movement, and to the labor riots and fascist takeovers abroad that inspired Guthrie. The details change, but the fundamental shape of the struggle remains stubbornly familiar: On one side, gun-toting agents of the establishment; on the other, advocates for the freedom of the less powerful. The clashes result in deaths that get called “senseless” but take on enduring symbolic weight thanks to songs just like this one.

Read: What Hollywood gets wrong about Springsteen

To be clear, “Minneapolis” is not “Ohio,” a paradigm-pushing masterpiece. Springsteen’s language—“thugs,” “King Trump,” “they trample on our rights”—is more Facebook post than poetry. The wordplay about fire and ice and ICE is cheap. The music is heavy-footed and formulaic. The immediate acclaim for it makes the critic in me a little resentful: Artists of all kinds routinely make songs engaging with their times, but so often these days, prestige is reserved for the music that copies the Boomers’ glory days. However, as this song suggests, that era shines in the public memory for a reason.

After sitting with “Streets of Minneapolis,” I tried again to get into Jesse Welles, a 33-year-old folk singer who makes scathingly anti-Trump songs with titles such as “Join ICE” and “No Kings.” Musically, he imitates Dylan and Springsteen to the point of parody. The way the media and rock institutions have embraced him—he’s played Stephen Colbert, performed with Joan Baez, and is up for four Grammys this year—implies that he is the great hope for musical resistance, but his blend of modern buzzwords with Woodstock aesthetics has struck my ear as injuriously hokey.

This Springsteen song has changed my ear a bit. I’m starting to hear Welles and other singers like him—we’re in a bit of a boom for conscientious folk rock—a little more generously. That they’re singing at all, and that anyone is listening, really does matter. Culture, we all know, has become fractured. The easiest way for Trump to get everything he wants is for his opponents to fail to speak in a unified voice. Thinking back to the last time such unity seemed possible isn’t nostalgic—it’s practical.</div>

Isn&#39;t that supposed to be covered by unemployment benefits?

No, unemployment benefits deal with frictional unemployment. The short-term, between jobs kind.

Structural unemployment, which is what allegedly the llms are about to unleash has always been dealt with by a more complex policy.

In any case, nobody is starving to death so that is a de factor guaranteed minimum income.

Oh please learn what those words mean. Disability is something entirely different from structural unemployment.

In any case my point was simply that there already are government programs that support people long-term.  How to do it is not unknown.

Rural Americans have been supportint the policies that hurt them for a very long time now, so perhaps they have grounds to claim disability of a certain kind.

Yes but if you&#39;re dealing with mass unemployment due to AI, why set up a UBI when you could expand unemployment instead?

The theory behind UBI that I&#39;ve heard is that it saves on administrative procedures. A lot.

All the right wing nut talking points about &quot;fraud&quot; would disappear and all those billions spent on ICE and the like would go to the people.

Isn&#39;t that supposed to be covered by unemployment benefits?NO current system is prepared for permanent human unemployable status. UBI is nothing more than Welfare 2.0 until Greed N. Corruption is forced to give a shit otherwise.What&#39;s in a UBI name? Nothing without proper funding to keep the pitchfork-armed masses at bay.

One class were the many poor in Europe in the early middle ages, they were sent on crusades, lead by the heirless offpring of their tribal chieftains.

We don&#39;t have &quot;AI&quot;, we have a massive resource waste in the hope that it will produce &quot;AI&quot;. The LLM cannot even replace a creative tiktoker, nevermind someone who produces a value.

I don&#39;t know about the UK, but aren&#39;t unemployment benefits funded on the assumption that more people will eventually find work?

We need a new kind of disability payment, a market disability. Where being made of flesh and blood and needing sleep and food and housing is too much of a liability to make you employable anymore.

Where is all the money for this UBI going to come from?

Yeah, that&#39;s not working now so I don&#39;t see it working just because UBI is a thing.

The sad reality is that AI is likely to cause major financial stress, regardless of whether there&#39;s a bubble or not.   Once AI improves worker productivity by a huge amount there will be job losses.  That loss of jobs means less money in the economy to purchase goods and services.  Reduced demand means reduced profits for the companies that employed AI in the

I&#39;ve actually supported a UBI in the USA for years.  That said, my UBI is a lot less generous than most, making it easier to finance.Anyways:$500/month (well, $600 now).  Get a job if you want to live in an expensive area or not have roommates.Eliminate most other forms of welfare.  This actually funds the lion&#39;s share of it.  Biggest exemption would be medical, because that&#39;s too uneven of an expense.Flatten the tax brackets to tax most of the UBI back from people actually working or otherwise earning mone

Even the Egyptian pharaoh knew that slave labor isn&#39;t useful for great achievements like conquering the neighboring tribes or building the pyramids. Eventually the trumpistani society will also develop to that level, or disappear.

...and robots and the Internet and personal computers and the Green revolution and shipping containers and mechanization of agriculture and internal combustion engines and railroads and canals and horse collars and on and on and on.

You could use any revolutionary productivity improvement as justification for UBI. But we&#39;ve been over this ground uncountable times in /. so time to trot out the same timeworn arguments which won&#39;t change anyone&#39;s minds.

            <div id="article-text">As T-Mobile taught us, price guarantees are worthless. Verizon charges an economic conditions fee regardless of guaranteed prices.

I&#39;m trading one asshole for another.  AT&T is currently ripping up my neighborhood, laying fiber.  Nearly 20 years after they said they would.

They likely won&#39;t lose the elderly, inertia and all that.  But I&#39;ll jump ship the instant it&#39;s declared &#39;stable&#39;

AT&T has an shit router unless you bypass it and don&#39;t get that air shit (lower caps / not an real IPv4)

Maybe... just maybe... they shouldn&#39;t have god awful fucking shit quality service, both the ISP connection itself, and their customer service !?

They&#39;ve spent decades abusing their customers (and everyone else) with their endless corporate bullshit, network abuse, price hikes, service outages, etc...

And when people start finding reasonable alternatives, SURPRISE.... They take advantage of them.

Thats what happens when you lose your monopoly spamcast.  The second I was able to get fiber at my premise, I dropped them the same day.

Got 3 times the speed, for half the price.  Latency also dropped quite a bit too.

Last year I switched from XFinity broadband to a local company called Ezee Fiber. XFinity kept raising their prices, they make it all but impossible to bring your own devices (cable modems), and there were numerous service outages. The last straw was when service went out on a Friday, and they said they could come out and take a look at the problem by the next Wednesday. Instead, I switched providers, and had my service up and running the next day. Plus, it was 5x faster (5 GBps) and came with a WiFi 6 router with no monthly rental fees. I did not save money on the new service, but the customer service is 10x better. So far, I&#39;m very happy with the switch.

must be nice to have an local company with fiber not all of us have that. For some it&#39;s comcast or slow DSL maybe an 2th cable co.

Nice, but I had to wait years before it arrived.

Yeah, they literally just laid fiber in our neighborhood a couple of years ago. For many years, Comcast was the only option.

Funny thing is, after EzeeFiber came through the neighborhood, AT&T decided they&#39;d better get in on the act, and they too laid fiber. But while EzeeFiber took a month or two to lay fiber to 2500 homes, AT&T took a couple of years, and hit several gas lines in the process. Still having three options is nice, and keeps prices down.

10,000,000 satellites in space beaming internet. And no they won&#39;t Kessler-ize. They won&#39;t collide often either as they will be placed in low earth orbits fifty to a hundred miles from each other (space is huge). That&#39;s the future.

I used them for several years, and they dropped out nearly every time it rained. Which wasn&#39;t just an inconvenience - I work from home.

I got a second ISP account with a local provider, who didn&#39;t have the best reputation for reliability, but I used them as a backup.

After I set up monitoring on the lines I realized my connection to the local ISP was actually really stable, and dropped Comcast.

It was a great decision. No calling to negotiate the price down every year, it works in the rain, and the people there are really nice. They cost about 1/3 what Comcast charged, too.

You burnt too many bridges over the last 20+ years. Now you wonder why customers are leaving when they can. As soon as fiber became available in my area I instantly switched. It&#39;s less than half the price, many times faster, and far more reliable. Oh, and my fiber provider has a TRUE price guarantee. What is advertised is what I pay, not a penny more, and in over two years now no price increases. You&#39;re a relic Comcast ... bye bye. Your asshole ways did you in.

Let&#39;s add that they don&#39;t truly have unlimited, and if you want truly unlimited, you need to pay for truly unlimited... Huh fuckers. Another $50!

Plus, their cable upload sucks. We&#39;re among the people who moved away from Comcast 1gb down/100mbps up... and were paying close to $200/month for truly-truly-really-unlimited to now $95 for about 750 Mbps download/upload via fixed wireless. So far, it&#39;s been working great.

I had Comcast. I signed up for some reasonable price agreed on the phone, then they started sending me bills for about 250 USD (for internet + cable).

Eventually I switched to a local competitor. They offered Ethernet to my apartment, with unlimited IPv4 internet IPs with no NAT (seriously) for only 60 USD/month. On top of that a few extra bucks for streaming services and it&#39;s better service for half the price.

Then Comcast in their genius tried sending me to a debt collector.

Their standard service was still 8 times slower on upload versus download the last time I checked.

Despite the pandemic showing us that we need two-way video to do virtual anything, so service is limited by the slowest data direction.

I&#39;m considering moving to a senior living place in the next year or so.  One sticking point is that their building ISP is Comcast.I&#39;m a software engineer - my work network meetings are mostly audio and screen sharing, so I can tolerate asymmetric data, barely.My wife is a sign l

Yes, on cable they are. I have their fastest service which is 2 Gbps down. Upstream is about 300 Mbps. I wish it was symmetrical.

Their history of poor customer service and the talk of data caps means people are doing exactly what they should:  shopping elsewhere.

Have not ended. You still have to call every year to stop your bill from doubling. A few years ago, they wouldn&#39;t budget on the price. I ended up switching to a fixed wireless ISP. It sacked, sadly. I&#39;m back on Comcast. Currently at $80/month on 2 Gbps/300 Mbps.

Their advertised price is now $100/month with 5 year guarantee. I would not take that deal now if my contract ended.

Indeed. This is why they rebranded to Xfinity. But the word has gotten out on that, too.

Their network assets should be turned over to smaller local providers, perhaps municipal, that actually care about their customers.

Pretty much universally, everyone hates Comcast.  Their business model has for years been, &quot;do everything possible to suppress competition, then raise prices and reduce the level of service&quot;.  Everywhere they&#39;re being competed with, they have excellent service and low prices (and are fighting hard to get other players out of their market and lobbying against municipal broadband).  Everywhere else, you pay them because they&#39;re the only option, and you get what you get.

Won&#39;t work. Literally everyone except the oligarchs and their sycophants will move to Canada. Then they will complain about immigrants until a populist PM is elected and creates the 51st state.

Please. We&#39;ll take alternative marketplaces any day.

If we&#39;re getting politically harangued no matter what we do then it&#39;s time to open up the market. Why protect a country&#39;s copyright that won&#39;t reciprocate?

More self-promotion from this grifter. The internet&#39;s problem isn&#39;t &quot;shit&quot; it&#39;s &quot;spam&quot; and grifters like Corey are a part of the problem. Enshittification just doesn&#39;t apply to the internet, it applies to all technology. Take cars for example, replacing physical controls for things like heating, windscreen demister and wipers and putting them on the touchscreen.

lol, it&#39;s like you have to make things reaaaalllllly simple in your mind

Seriously, you should be checked for early onset dementia.  Your posts are getting pretty pathetic.

Doctorow&#39;s idea is nice, but the government of Canada is just as beholden to Big Tech as the government of the USA.

This sort of thing is marginally more likely to happen in the EU and much more likely to happen in places like China or Russia where they (rightly) don&#39;t give a crap about laws that criminalize circumvention of DRM.

What Canada can do (and IMO must do) is stop using US products and services to the greatest extent practical, and then work on eliminating them from places where right now there are no practical alternatives, similar to initiatives like this [slashdot.org].

It&#39;s not based on &quot;intellectual property theft&quot;.  It&#39;s based on preventing corporations from abusing customers.

When a farmer can&#39;t repair a tractor without paying thousands of dollars to the manufacturer, even if the actual problem is a $20 part, then sorry... fuck the corporation.

It&#39;s all but guaranteed to happen. Canada more and more seems to be aligning itself with the EU, and it&#39;s been happening in the EU for over two decades (sideloading, alternative app stores, USB-C connector, GPDR, etc.). It&#39;s happening in countries like South Korea and Japan (allowing alternative app stores and payment systems), India (app store billing policies), Vietnam, Nigeria and Brazil (data sovereignty), Australia and France (age restrictions on social media), and so on.

If youâ(TM)ve read the CBC in the last week, there is talk about concerns that US tech companies will interfere in the secessionist movements.  Look at the Brexit example.  Much of that voteâ(TM)s mis)information was controlled by foreign interests.There is already talk about home grown social media and other tech.Perhaps MAPL shouldnâ(TM)t be just for the feedstock of entertainment, but also the channels for delivering information.  Though please no great firewall of Canada.  What would you

>>home grown social media and other tech.

No one would use it. It would end up being something like the Canadian government would have to make it illegal to use Facebook, and only the shittier domestic alternative would be allowed. Similar to Ladas in the Soviet Union.

What Canada can do (and IMO must do) is stop using US products and services to the greatest extent practical, and then work on eliminating them from places where right now there are no practical alternatives.We&#39;re working on it.  Disentangling our economy from the US takes time.  Meanwhile, we&#39;re basically trying to quietly make our moves without drawing Trump&#39;s attention.  The pressures in play right now are bad, but they&#39;ve been worse and can easily be made worse.  If we can drag things out as-is for a while, it only benefits us (and our new partners).

Yeah, I&#39;m Canadian and doing my bit to avoid sending any of my money to the USA.

But our federal government is almost completely dependent on US corporations to function, namely Microsoft and to a much lesser extent, Google.  If that&#39;s not a national security risk, I don&#39;t know what is.

Canada&#39;s GDP is half that of just California, even though Canada has a slightly larger population. They don&#39;t have Silicon fabs. A decade of left-wing government that dis-invested in energy and infrastructure production while increasing regulatory requirements means that something like a data-center is prohibitively expensive to build in Canada.

And the thing about having a replacement for something like Google/Apple/Facebook means billions in capital investment, in a place that can&#39;t provide the return on i

The US invading would hurt the US. Just the threats have opened peoples eyes. Migrations take time and I don&#39;t know anyone that ever ran to aÂbully to get abused.

The USA won&#39;t invade Canada.  It would be far too costly for the USA to try that.

Instead, it&#39;ll do shady things like encouraging separatists (we&#39;re already seeing that in Alberta) and trying to undermine Canadian unity and cohesiveness.

And corporations don&#39;t need an excuse to behave like dicks.  They&#39;re already doing that, so we have little to lose.

We told Meta they need to pay media outlets if they&#39;re using their content on Facebook, etc..

So you can&#39;t post any links to Canadian media, eg CBC.

Australia did the same thing, but Meta decided to pay there.

Odds are that if we tried what Cory&#39;s suggesting, they&#39;d just stop selling here. (Not that a number of people are already actively boycotting US products and looking at companies from other countries. #ElbowsUp)

>>but I think when Canada tries this, most bigger corps are &#39;so what&#39; and just drop Canada as a market.

The entire Canadian market is 1/2 the size of California. Why would an international business go out of their way for Canadian dollars in that case?

What agenda would the be pushing?  To get more gaming on Linux?

In the 30 years I&#39;ve been using Linux, I&#39;ve never once been able to get it fully working on consumer hardware. I use Linux daily in a VM for writing software, so I don&#39;t consider the failure mine.

It seems to have reversed in the last few years for me. My laptop from 2020 was never able to wake back up from sleep mode, until Windows 10 hit EOL and I put Debian on it. I&#39;ve also noticed a lot less desktop/video/UI issues since switching to a distro/DE with Wayland.

Positive trajectory aside, it&#39;s not that Linux is so perfect and problem-free. It&#39;s that Windows 10/11 really, really sucks, even by Microsoft standards. The bottom&#39;s fallen out. I&#39;m talking to a guy right now, in the window underneath this o

A toy company doesn&#39;t know how to secure their web site. Nobody saw that coming.

The optimistic story about the FBI’s surprising Wednesday raid on Fulton County, Georgia, voting offices to seize ballots and electronic materials related to the 2020 election is that it’s another instance of the United States Department of Justice and other parts of the federal government indulging in Donald Trump’s fantastical belief that he lost the presidential election to Joe Biden in 2020 because of fraud. If that reason for the raid is right, the investigation will amount to very little, even if Trump and allies mangle whatever evidence the FBI produces to continue spreading ridiculous voter fraud claims. If the government attempts to bring criminal charges (that may well be barred by the statute of limitations), they are far more likely to be about Trump’s retribution campaign than about actual intentional violations of federal law protecting the integrity of elections.

The pessimistic story is far darker. It’s about the raid being a test run for messing with election administrators and the counting of ballots in the midterm elections in 2026, when control of both houses of Congress could be at stake. Now is the time for state and local governments, the courts, and the people to work against such potential election subversion.

The Fulton County saga goes back to the hotly contested 2020 presidential election, which was conducted in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Donald Trump was an unpopular incumbent running against former Vice President Joe Biden. Many states made it easier for people to vote by mail in 2020, which was much safer than voting in person and potentially getting sick. Trump had long spread unsubstantiated claims about voter fraud, from massive noncitizen voting to fraud committed in large American cities like Philadelphia and Detroit that have substantial minority populations. But during 2020, Trump turned his propaganda machine on the influx of mail-in ballots, which he claimed would be infected by fraud; never mind that he regularly voted by mail in his home state of Florida.

Election results came in slowly, thanks in part to the slower count necessary to properly process the flood of mail-in ballots. When the numbers were released, Biden had won, including in Georgia, where he claimed victory by a slim margin. Trump tried various tactics to overturn that result and others. Before the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol—an unsuccessful attempt to stop Congress from counting states’ Electoral College votes and declare Trump the winner—Trump leaned on election administrators and elected officials in states with majority-Republican legislatures to overturn the results. Even though Georgia had conducted a hand recount of all the state’s ballots that confirmed Biden’s victory, Trump notoriously pressured Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to “find” 11,780 votes to flip the results to him. Raffensperger refused.

While Trump worked the refs, his allies worked the public, and much of the effort to gin up fraud claims focused on the processing of ballots in State Farm Arena by Fulton County election workers. Focusing on an area with a large population of Black voters was par for the course among Trump’s fraudulent fraud-squad members. Rudy Giuliani falsely accused two election workers there of fraud (as well as passing around drugs), and they faced threats and harassment; the workers, Wandrea Moss and her mother, Ruby Freedman, won a $148 million defamation suit against Giuliani, which later settled.

Fulton County, like many large counties in the United States, has seen its share of election administration mismanagement. But a yearslong investigation by state officials found no intentional wrongdoing and nothing that would have changed the 2020 outcome.

Given the deep investigations of the 2020 elections generally and Fulton County, Georgia, in particular, it is highly unlikely that the new FBI investigation (whose warrant was curiously sought by a U.S. attorney in Missouri, not Georgia or even Washington, D.C.) will amount to anything. So what was it really about?

One tipoff is the curious appearance during the FBI raid of Fulton County’s election offices of Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, who is known to peddle conspiracy theories herself. Portraying this raid as part of a national security effort is in line with the musings of Cleta Mitchell, a Trump conspiracy-theory ally who had been on Trump’s call with Raffensperger. Back in September, Mitchell, on a call with fellow election deniers, suggested that Trump could declare a “national sovereignty crisis” in a bid to take over the midterm elections.

Trump has no power over the conduct of federal elections, which are left in the hands of the states, a point numerous courts have made recently in striking down parts of an August Trump executive order purporting to make voting harder. But that doesn’t mean he won’t try. Trump has expressed regret that he did not seize voting machines in 2020. So this threat for 2026 (and 2028) is real.

So what can be done about all of this? To begin with, state and local election officials need to be ready to go to federal court to seek injunctions barring the government from seizing voting machines or otherwise interfering with the process of tabulating ballots. Trump might even try to send troops to seize ballots without a search warrant, and if that threat is real, proactive judicial action is necessary. These threats are most likely to materialize in those areas around the country with contested congressional races. Particular targets may be in those states, such as California and Arizona, where the tabulation of ballots takes a long time, so there is more time for Trump and his allies to act.

State officials and the public need to support, with dollars and volunteers, election administrators and those who would hold the line against interference. The greater the transparency of the work of these administrators in tabulating ballots, and the quicker a fair count can take place, the harder it will be for Trump to have a legal excuse to try to interfere with the balloting.

Donald Trump is not going to be able to cancel U.S. elections. But the events this week in Fulton County remind us that he has many tools at his disposal to try to mess with them. It’s not too early to plan against another attempt to overturn democratically conducted elections in the United States.

How do you stop someone from killing someone else? In most societies, we do so with warnings, promises, and contracts. We make laws to make ourselves feel safe. It’s important to feel safe, because reality is terrifying. In Minneapolis this weekend, we saw reality: a group of men with guns, in a semicircle, firing a barrage of shots into a man’s body lying on the ground. The laws that were supposed to protect Alex Pretti—the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, multiple state and local and national statutes on use of force—failed. Pretti’s death, captured on video from multiple angles, was so shocking that even the Trump administration has been forced to rethink its brutal tactics in the Twin Cities, which for more than a month has been ravaged by an onslaught of federal agents ostensibly conducting “immigration enforcement.”

Now, the Trump administration is shifting its approach, or at least its messaging. Gregory Bovino, the cartoonishly fascist figurehead of Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s operations in the Twin Cities, has been removed from his post and forced off social media. Kristi Noem, Bovino’s boss at the Department of Homeland Security, received a brief, but significant, rebuke from the president. The Democrats, America’s sluggish and often ineffectual opposition party, are howling for investigations, firings, and impeachments.

It’s tempting to see these developments as a victory, as the rule of law slowly reasserting itself over a deadly aberration in America’s social contract. Soon, you might think, things may go back to normal. But in Donald Trump’s America, the contract has been rewritten. The conditions that caused Pretti’s death still exist—in Minneapolis, in Maine, in California, in every city and every town where agents of the state carry guns. The goon squads are here to stay, and it’s only a matter of time until they kill again.

What this reflects is more than the Trump administration’s vicious immigration policies, but a broader shift in American politics. Inside the West Wing, a terrifying new political ideology is on display, one that says the right to shape, change, and end Americans lives is not granted by a democratic framework of laws, but by a simple equation of who has more guns.

This shift was not immediate. During the first Trump administration, the snarl of legal jurisprudence that slowed down many of Trump’s most egregious excesses also lured us into a false sense of comfort that the law still worked, and that the contract still held—and sometimes it did. When Trump attempted to overturn the 2020 election, the system worked. Judges threw out his cases. When rioters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, they were prosecuted en masse for their crimes. Trump himself was impeached, though never convicted, thanks to the cowardice of a bloc of Republican senators.

Upon entering his second term, Trump went for it, not so much testing as smashing through the constraints of legal precedent—he pardoned the criminals who stormed the Capitol on his behalf and indicted many of the officials that, in turn, had indicted him. On the border, he saw a chance to test his might: calling in Marines to quell protesters in Los Angeles and increasing the DHS’s purview to arrest, detain, and raid far outside of their preexisting jurisdictions.

The guardrails are not holding this time around.

Minneapolis represents the most stark example of the rule of the gun thus far. During “Operation Metro Storm,” the ominously named federal operation in the Twin Cities, federal agents have shot three people, killed two, and injured dozens with pepper spray, rubber bullets, tear gas, and fists. Until Pretti’s death finally tipped the scales, Noem and other figures in the administration doubled and tripled down on their mandate to use force. Jonathan Ross, the agent who shot Renee Good, the first person killed by ICE in the Twin Cities, currently faces no charges, after the FBI intervened to toss out the state-level investigation into the killing.

Federal agents have repeatedly violated protesters’ First Amendment rights, detained citizens and noncitizens alike unlawfully, and even sought to prevent detainees from accessing legal counsel. The Department of Justice, instead of investigating these abuses, has instead leveled charges on the protesters. There are videos all over social media of officers, after Good’s killing, taunting protesters with threats that they will be next. The men with guns knew the power they held. They knew no one could stop them from killing.

And so when Alex Pretti stood up in the middle of the street, filming them with his phone, and intervened to try to help another civilian they had pushed to the ground, they shot him. He had, after all, committed a crime in their eyes: He had resisted the administration’s will. The agents who killed Pretti have not been identified or charged; like in Good’s killing, there will be no federal civil rights investigation, only an internal process overseen by the department that fired the shots. (Two of the agents involved in shooting Pretti have now been put on leave, but that’s a far cry from meaningful consequences for what they did.) Even if, by some miracle, Good’s and Pretti’s killers are eventually brought to justice, their individual consequences do nothing to subvert ICE’s mandate of force wherever it appears. ICE can afford to discipline or lose an agent or two to mollify public opinion. They have plenty more operating, still, under the same rules of engagement.

Under Trump’s new government-by-gun, individuals are presented with a choice between obedience and execution—or at least the ever-present danger of it. And without legal recompense, the only check to this power appears to be other armed men.

In Maine, where ICE and other agencies have been conducting snatch-and-grab arrests and targeted harassment of protesters similar to those in Minneapolis, local law enforcement has already staked out a hard line against their excesses, something that Minneapolis’ authorities were slow to do. Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce called ICE’s actions “bush-league policing” in an interview on Sunday, after federal agents mistakenly arrested a local corrections officer. This pressure has also changed the situation in Minneapolis, where Gov. Tim Walz has managed to muster a largely tepid show of force from his own military, the Minnesota National Guard, deploying them to the streets in cute reflective vests with donuts and coffee.

It’s easy to see those images and miss what they mean. The National Guard is often seen as a friendly force that shows up with bottled water during hurricanes and digs out roads after mudslides. But that’s not what they are: They are armed forces that are ostensibly under the command of a state governor. Their presence on the streets of Minneapolis, orange vests and all, is a show of force by a state military aligned opposite of a federal military. Right now, it’s no more than optics. But lines are being drawn.

And things could always get worse. The National Guard and domestic police are not sympathetic forces to many of this country’s marginalized groups. In L.A. and D.C., National Guard troops squared up with protesters themselves, and their orders come from political actors—governors, mayors, and other politicians with their own biases and agendas.

Soldiers and police, however, are not the only people in America who have guns. As the top levels of our political system wield violence in the open, it’s only a matter of time before people tired of having guns pointed at them may decide that it’s time to have more guns to point back. Communities I have reported on for years are beginning to mobilize again. Online, left-wing accounts and marginalized groups are openly championing the Second Amendment, abandoning arguments for reasonable gun control in favor of arming themselves to face a future in which their only defense is through open force. There was nothing to stop ICE agents from killing Alex Pretti, their thinking goes, so the next time it happens someone might as well shoot back. A brutal occupation unrestrained by any notion of fairness or recompense often inspires a violent response, which would plunge our society into circumstances it has rarely, if ever, seen before: widespread violence on the streets and guerilla attacks on federal forces that inspire even more brutal reprisals and repression.

It’s still possible to regain control of our society before we get to that point; to organize and protest and document well enough that a better future is made possible before the rule of the gun is all we have left. We’ve seen that approach have some success , in this specific case: The administration’s excesses were so blatant and cruel—and so highly publicized—that politicians on both sides of the aisle were forced to hold them to account. But so far, Trump’s response looks more like damage control than a larger shift in approach. The goon squads are still on the streets, still hauling people into their vans. They will learn from this defeat. They will get better at killing. And unless we find a way to upset the architects of our new political order, they’re almost certainly going to do it again.

The big question about President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace—which he formally announced while at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week—is whether it’s a scam, a delusion, or both.

Trump first mentioned a Board of Peace in September during the signing of a ceasefire accord for Israel’s war in Gaza. The idea was that the board would be the forum where Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and other Middle East countries discuss political reforms, reconstruction, and other issues relating to security and long-term peace in Gaza. Trump would chair the board—a role that he improbably insisted wasn’t his idea, but the plan made some sense, given that Trump played a major role in prodding the parties to sign the ceasefire.

However, in the months since, Trump’s vision of the board has—like much else about his presidency—swelled with self-aggrandizement. The board’s charter—which he hasn’t publicized but which the Times of Israel obtained and published—doesn’t mention Gaza at all. Rather, the document states that the board will seek “to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict”—seeming to indicate any sort of conflict, anywhere on earth.

The members on the board will consist of whichever heads of state the chairman, Donald Trump, chooses to invite. Their terms of membership will last three years, unless they pay the board $1 billion, which would buy them lifetime tenure. (Trump is designated as chairman for as long as he likes, certainly beyond the remaining three years of his presidency, gratis.)

The board will decide policies and declare resolutions by majority vote, but the chairman (read: Trump) gets veto power; he can also initiate measures unilaterally, eject members, and choose his own successor.

In other words, the Board of Peace marks yet another episode in Trump’s massive meandering ego trip. More than that, its charter, laid out in formal legalese, is sheer fantasy. It is no surprise that most of the heads of state whom he invited to join, notably those with proven interest in peace and “lawful governance,” have declined.

The naysayers include France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom—in short, many of our leading allies. Trump retracted his invitation to Canada after its prime minister, Mark Carney, delivered a much-lauded speech at Davos calling on middle-sized countries to avoid unfair pressures from larger powers by banding together. (Trump’s retraction, which he posted on social media, bolsters the impression that this is all about Trump, not world peace.)

Those who have said they will join include Argentina, Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Belarus, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Egypt, El Salvador, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Kosovo, Morocco, Mongolia, Pakistan, Paraguay, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. None of them are members of the U.N. Security Council (which Trump preposterously hopes to supplant), only a few practice “lawful governance,” and even fewer have any experience at seriously mediating conflict. It is not known whether any of them have been foolish enough to pony up the $1 billion initiation fee—nor has Trump or anyone else said who would control this slush fund. (Want to take a guess?)

The leaders of China, India, and Russia are among those who haven’t yet responded. This is no surprise. These are regional, aspiringly global powers who have a serious (if, in some cases, disruptive) interest in matters of war and peace. And they must know that Trump’s Board of Peace is not serious.

In his gushing invitation letter, Trump declared that his goal is to “bring together a distinguished group of nations ready to shoulder the noble responsibility of building LASTING PEACE.” In his snitty retraction letter to Prime Minister Carney, he brayed that Canada would thereby be excluded from “what will be the most prestigious Board of Leaders ever assembled at any time.”

If Trump believes his own hype (always an uncertainty), he reveals here once again that he has no idea what peace, especially “LASTING PEACE,” requires. To the extent Trump currently has the power to elicit feigned respect and sometimes reluctant obedience from other world leaders, it’s because he is president of the United States—meaning that he can exert the tremendous leverage of the world’s main currency and most powerful military.

Once his term in the Oval Office ends in three years, no leader would have any reason to pay him the slightest attention or courtesy. No leaders embroiled in conflict would welcome the mediation of his so-called Board of Peace, much less follow its orders.

Maybe some leaders would consent to a meeting if the board really were composed of “the most prestigious” peacemakers. But look at who, according to a statement from the White House, is on the group’s “founding” executive board: Trump’s globe-trotting emissary, Steve Witkoff, and son-in-law Jared Kushner (whose efforts to end Russia’s war on Ukraine have been especially aimless); Marc Rowan (a billionaire financier who has led Trump’s political pressure campaigns on American universities); Robert Gabriel (a former producer of Laura Ingraham’s TV show who is now Trump’s deputy national security adviser); Secretary of State Marco Rubio (whose influence will fade along with Trump’s at the end of this administration, at least if he remains under his post-presidential thumb); Sir Tony Blair (whose record as Britain’s prime minister still makes many in the Middle East shudder); and Ajay Banga, president of the World Bank.

Banga is an interesting choice: He was nominated to the World Bank by President Joe Biden, he worked with Vice President Kamala Harris, and he knows something about world politics.* The others, once untethered from a sitting American president, would have no authority in making peace whatsoever.

Even with the power of the White House and the imprimatur of a U.N. Security Council resolution, Trump’s current Board of Peace has been unable to make headway on molding long-term peace in Gaza, the one conflict it was created to help solve. (The Security Council limited the board’s authority solely to rebuilding Gaza and set it to expire at the end of 2027.) The idea that it can roam the globe on its own, ending wars with no base of power or authority, is risible.

If the next president is a Democrat, one of their first tasks will probably be to order the words “Donald J. Trump” to be removed from the august wall of the Kennedy Center. There will, however, be no need to worry about dismantling, or doing anything about, the Trump Board of Peace; it will quickly collapse of its own accord.

Correction, Jan. 29, 2026: This post originally misstated that Banga advised Harris during her 2024 campaign.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Java developers still struggle to secure containers, with nearly half (48 percent) saying they&#39;d rather delegate security to providers of hardened containers than worry about making their own container security decisions.

This finding comes from BellSoft, which offers the Liberica JDK, a free, open-source implementation of Java SE. The company says it surveyed 427 developers at Devoxx last year for its 2025 State of Container Security report. Its goal was to better understand decisions about containers, security, priorities, and practices.

The most important factor among the survey respondents in choosing a base container image was security (29 percent), followed by performance (21 percent), image size (17 percent), Java support (17 percent), ease of use (11 percent), license compliance (4 percent), and other (1 percent).

That&#39;s understandable given that almost one in four of the devs (23 percent) said they&#39;d experienced container-related security incidents in the past year.

Yet the choices these developers make in terms of their software tools may be undermining their stated goals. About 55 percent rely on general-purpose Linux distributions and 69 percent use general-purpose JDKs. Such software, BellSoft argues, is bloated by unnecessary packages and thus requires extra work to secure and optimize compared to pre-hardened options.

That might be manageable were it not for unreliable people. According to the respondents, 62 percent of container security mistakes came from human error, followed by patching difficulties (36 percent), gaps before patch availability (32 percent), and false positives from scanning tools (29 percent).

And these issues were compounded by organizational time and resource constraints (49 percent) and lack of organizational prioritization (36 percent).

Respondents revealed various approaches to dealing with container security. These range from relying on trusted container registries (45 percent), vulnerability scanning (43 percent), software bill-of-materials (SBOM) generation (18 percent), image signing (16 percent), and hardware isolation (6 percent). Ten percent said their organization took no additional security measures beyond standard tools.

&quot;Across every section of the survey, one message repeats consistently: Teams want security, efficiency and simplicity but their current strategies and tooling makes this difficult to achieve,&quot; BellSoft CEO Alex Belokrylov said in a statement.

Belokrylov argues that adopting hardened images shifts the burden of security and maintenance to the image vendor, thereby reducing maintenance and cost burdens.

BellSoft elicited these findings despite, or perhaps because of, the wide use of AI tools.

Marketing VP Maria Gladkaya told The Register in an email that while AI didn&#39;t come up in the responses this year, the 2024 survey revealed that 74 percent of developers were using AI to write code. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">opinion Maybe everything is all about timing, like the time (this week) America&#39;s lead cyber-defense agency sounded the alarm on insider threats after it came to light that its senior official uploaded sensitive documents to ChatGPT.

Either way, on Wednesday, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) called insider threats &quot;one of the most serious risks to organizational security.&quot; It urged critical infrastructure entities to &quot;take decisive action&quot; to mitigate threats from both malicious insiders and honest mistakes, and to help them do that, CISA published an infographic [PDF] with guidance on how to assemble a multi-disciplinary insider threat management team.

The team should include subject-matter experts from across the organization, such as human resources personnel, legal counsel, security and IT leadership, and threat analysts, and should coordinate with external partners - including law enforcement and other risk and health professionals - as needed.

These team members run the organization&#39;s insider threat program, monitor for potential threats, and intervene as needed to (hopefully) prevent any damage to the company&#39;s people, data, reputation, and bottom line, the guide says.

Plus, CISA offers several other free resources on this topic, such as an insider threat mitigation guide, a workshop, and a program evaluation tool.

&quot;Insider threats remain one of the most serious challenges to organizational security because they can erode trust and disrupt critical operations,&quot; acting CISA Director Madhu Gottumukkala said in a statement announcing the guidance.

This is a topic that Gottumukkala knows well - one could even say he has insider knowledge about these types of threats.

A day before CISA unveiled its how-to-build-multi-disciplinary-threat-management-teams infographic, Politico reported that Gottumukkala last summer uploaded sensitive CISA contracting documents into a public version of ChatGPT. His actions reportedly triggered automated security warnings intended to stop the theft or unintentional disclosure of government material from federal networks, according to four unnamed Homeland Security officials.

CISA Director of Public Affairs Marci McCarthy confirmed to The Register that the interim boss did use the AI chatbot, but told us he only used ChatGPT &quot;with DHS controls in place.&quot;

&quot;This use was short-term and limited,&quot; McCarthy said in a statement emailed to The Register. &quot;CISA is unwavering in its commitment to harnessing AI and other cutting-edge technologies to drive government modernization and deliver on the President&#39;s Executive Order, Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence.&quot;

CISA&#39;s security posture blocks access to ChatGPT by default – unless employees are granted an exception. Gottumukkala was authorized to use ChatGPT under a temporary exception, and the last time he used the chatbot was in mid-July 2025.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) oversees CISA, which acts as Homeland Security&#39;s cyber arm. DHS also has its own internal chatbot for employee use, and this one is configured to prevent sensitive government documents from leaving federal networks.

Documents uploaded into a public AI tool like ChatGPT, however, can leave the user&#39;s control and may be retained or used by the service, depending on the provider&#39;s policies and account settings. So this action seems to be a fairly big security snafu for the leader of the federal government&#39;s top cybersecurity agency to make.

Plus, while insider threats pose a huge risk for critical organizations, and one that&#39;s only getting bigger with the proliferation of AI agents connecting to sensitive information and servers, the timing of CISA&#39;s guidance seems tone-deaf at best. Sadly, it&#39;s not Gottumukkala&#39;s – nor the Trump administration&#39;s – first security slipup.

Gottumukkala also reportedly sought access to highly sensitive cyber intelligence over the summer, and then placed six staffers on leave after they administered a counterintelligence polygraph exam that he failed.

Earlier this month, Gottumukkala reportedly tried to oust CISA&#39;s Chief Information Officer Robert Costello.

Looking beyond CISA, who could forget last year&#39;s security missteps by US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, national security adviser Michael Waltz, and others that put American critical infrastructure, national security, and troops&#39; lives in danger.

These include Hegseth reportedly installing an insecure internet connection in his office so that he could use Signal on a personal computer, and using the encrypted messaging app on his personal phone to share sensitive details about military operations in Yemen among multiple Signal groups.

Meanwhile, Waltz and other members of the US National Security Council reportedly used their personal Gmail accounts to exchange information about an unnamed military conflict in the spring.

All of these could be case studies for how not to best manage insider threats.

Maybe that explains the timing of CISA&#39;s guidance? Although in this case, it would have been smart to expand the intended audience. CISA says it&#39;s &quot;designed for critical infrastructure entities and state, local, tribal, and territorial governments.&quot; But it seems the feds are the ones who need it the most. ®

            <h2>Musk distracts from struggling car biz with fantastical promise to make 1 million humanoid robots a year</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/29/truth_telling_man_always_tells_truth/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk&#39;s car company is getting ready to be Skynet. Tesla, facing an 11 percent decline in automotive revenue in Q4 2025, has committed to $20 billion in capex spending this year on manufacturing and compute infrastructure. The goal: build lots of humanoid robots.

The cash conflagration includes a plan to shift its Fremont, California, manufacturing facility from making Tesla S and X model vehicles, discontinued as of Q2 2026, into a production line capable of turning out one million Optimus robots annually.

Optimus, as described by Tesla, is &quot;A general purpose, bi-pedal, humanoid robot capable of performing tasks that are unsafe, repetitive or boring.&quot; Tesla says it is aiming at a manufacturing cost of $20,000 per unit.

&quot;I&#39;m confident that we&#39;ll get to a million units a year in Fremont of Optimus 3,&quot; said Musk on Tesla&#39;s Q4 2025 earnings call. &quot;This Optimus really will be a general-purpose robot that can learn by observing human behavior.&quot;

Musk has a history of fanciful forward-looking statements. For example, in a 2011 interview with The Wall Street Journal, he said that Space X would put an astronaut into space within three years. That didn&#39;t happen until 2020. His claims about sending astronauts to Mars remain similarly unfulfilled.

During the Recode Conference in 2016, Musk said, &quot;Well, we&#39;re going to send [a SpaceX rocket] to Mars in 2018.&quot;

&quot;Wait, wait, wait,&quot; said moderator Walt Mossberg. &quot;2018? That&#39;s for sure?&quot;

There have been many other such missed predictions, particularly around the prevalence of driverless Tesla robotaxis. At one point, Musk said there&#39;d be a million on the road in 2020. Six years later, there are reportedly couple hundred or so operating, and all of them are currently using safety drivers, according to Electrek.

If Tesla were to produce a million humanoid robots, they wouldn&#39;t be all that useful. Asked during the conference call how Tesla employs Optimus, Musk said the robots currently are not doing meaningful work.

&quot;Well, we are still very much at the early stages of Optimus,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s still in the R&D phase. We have had Optimus do some basic tasks in the factory. But as we iterate on new versions of Optimus, we deprecate the old versions. It&#39;s not in usage in our factories in a material way. It&#39;s more so that the robot can learn. We wouldn&#39;t expect to have any kind of significant Optimus production volume until probably the end of this year.&quot;

Even if Tesla hits its production milestone of one million units by the end of 2027, the company needs to demonstrate their Optimus can actually perform useful labor alongside other humans for less than it would cost to hire a human. We note that Boston Dynamics and Hyundai have planned for more modest manufacturing capacity amounting to 30,000 humanoid robots per year, mainly for warehouse tasks.

People who work in the robotics industry have doubts that humanoid robots are ready for deployment outside of controlled industrial spaces. That&#39;s what we heard at the Humanoids Summit in Mountain View, California. There are many technical, social, and practical barriers that need to be overcome.

In its October 2025 report, &quot;Humanoid robots: Crossing the chasm from concept to commercial reality,&quot; global consultancy McKinsey observes that public demonstrations of humanoid robots don&#39;t translate into economically viable autonomous machines.

&quot;[T]he gap between what is technically demonstrated in pilots and what is commercially viable at scale remains wide,&quot; the report says. &quot;The prototypes that are capturing headlines are impressive but still far from delivering consistent, reliable, and economically justifiable performance in real-world settings.&quot;

Barriers include the safety implications of free-roaming robots, limited battery life when not tethered to power, lack of manual dexterity and mobility, and cost.

Lei Yang, CEO of IntBot, a humanoid robot startup, told The Register in an email that given the rapid advances being made in hardware and AI, he expects Tesla and the robotics industry will be able to deliver humanoid robots in the not-too-distant future.

&quot;While we see impressive demonstrations of robots dancing or performing backflips, these are often visible signs of hardware progress rather than autonomy,&quot; said Yang. &quot;If you look past the spectacle, the deeper reality is that many demos still rely on scripted behaviors or direct supervision. The true challenge remains turning that raw capability into safe, repeatable, and autonomous operation around people.&quot;

Yang said that commercial viability is already here, pointing to the humanoid robots his company has deployed to hotels for hospitality functions.

&quot;These units are already generating value by amplifying the guest experience – welcoming visitors, answering questions, and providing real-time assistance,&quot; he said.

Yang said safety remains the biggest issue. &quot;The engineering challenge lies in creating &#39;inherently safe&#39; systems that balance power with compliance,&quot; he said. &quot;A robot must be strong enough to be useful, yet soft and responsive enough to never injure a human, even in the event of an AI misinterpretation or system accident.&quot;

Dale Walsh, VP of strategy and innovation at Roboworx, a robotics field support company, told The Register that his company is starting to see humanoid robots in the field, but they&#39;re only capable of performing specific tasks.

&quot;&#39;Humanoid&#39; is a form factor and not so much a type of robot,&quot; Walsh explained. &quot;When we&#39;re talking about Tesla Optimus or other robots like Atlas from Boston Dynamics, they&#39;re humanoids but they&#39;re general purpose robots where the goal is to be able to make them do pretty much what a human can do. So we&#39;re not seeing that yet in the market space.&quot;

Walsh said that general purpose humanoid robots present a lot of challenges. A five-foot tall robot, he said, might weigh 150 or 200 pounds. &quot;In its natural state, it&#39;s unstable,&quot; he said. &quot;So as it loses power, it&#39;s gonna fall. So safety is a big concern for that.&quot;

Then, he said, there&#39;s the whole issue of social acceptance. &quot;People already fear robots taking their jobs when it&#39;s an AMR [autonomous mobile robot], you know, that moves around on the floor,&quot; he said. &quot;Well when the robot looks like you and acts like you and moves like you, you know, that&#39;s going to be even more of a challenge from an adoption standpoint.&quot;

Asked to estimate the current size of the market for humanoid robots, Walsh said, &quot;I would say hundreds,&quot; with the caveat that a lot depends on how you define the term. He noted that Softbank produced about 27,000 Pepper robots before discontinuing them in 2021.

&quot;That&#39;s by most definitions a humanoid robot, but it&#39;s not a general purpose robot,&quot; he said.

Veteran MIT roboticist Rodney Brooks, founder and CTO of Robust.ai, in a January 1, 2026, blog post, voiced skepticism about seeing useful humanoid robots any time soon.

&quot;For [Figure and Tesla] and probably several others the general plan is that humanoid robots will be &#39;plug compatible&#39; with humans and be able to step in and do the manual things that humans do at lower prices and just as well,&quot; Brooks wrote. &quot;In my opinion, believing that this will happen any time within decades is pure fantasy thinking.&quot; ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/29/googles_project_genie_ai/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google has put the video gaming industry on notice with the rollout of Project Genie, an experimental AI world-model prototype that generates explorable 3D environments from text or image prompts.

Google&#39;s Genie AI is nothing new (we&#39;ve been reporting on its existence since 2024), but its appearance in Project Genie, now available to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the US, is.

Like many of Google&#39;s other experimental efforts, Project Genie is rolling out through Google Labs, where users can generate and explore short interactive environments from text or image prompts. Built on DeepMind&#39;s Genie 3 world-model research, the prototype lets users move through AI-generated scenes in real time and regenerate variations using revised prompts, rather than serving as a full game engine or production tool.

Demos shown on Google&#39;s Project Genie website show various examples, like a cat exploring a living room from the back of a Roomba, a car exploring the surface of a rocky moon, and a person in a wingsuit flying down the side of a mountain. All of the worlds can be navigated in real time, and while they&#39;re generated as characters move through them, the worlds are consistent, so backtracking won&#39;t result in new areas being generated on top of old ones. Any changes an agent makes to the world will remain, at least for as long as the hardware rendering the world retains space in its memory.

&quot;Genie 3 environments are … &#39;auto-regressive&#39; – created frame by frame based on the world description and user actions,&quot; Google explains on Genie&#39;s website. &quot;The environments remain largely consistent for several minutes, with memory recalling changes from specific interactions for up to a minute.&quot;

After those few minutes, however, things get a bit tricky.

&quot;The model can support a few minutes of continuous interaction, rather than extended hours,&quot; Google said, noting elsewhere that generation is currently limited to 60 seconds, though it&#39;s not clear what happens after time is up. A Google spokesperson told The Register that Genie can create renderings for longer than 60 seconds, but the company &quot;found 60 seconds provides a high quality and consistent world, and it gives people enough time to explore and experience the environment.&quot;

Google told us that world consistency will last through a whole session. It&#39;s not clear if Google will extend session time later. Regardless, that&#39;s not Genie&#39;s only current limitation.

Agents interacting with the generated worlds can only perform a limited range of actions for now, and multiple models in the same world have trouble interacting. Genie also has trouble rendering legible text, can&#39;t really simulate real-world locations accurately (it&#39;s not like Google has a massive collection of 3D maps of notable locations, after all), and it says that agents sometimes lag and don&#39;t respond properly to controls.

In addition, &quot;A few of the Genie 3 model capabilities we announced in August, such as promptable events that change the world as you explore it, are not yet included in this prototype,&quot; Google added.

Still, the company said it expects Genie to offer a path toward automated general intelligence, which it says needs to be able to interact with evolving worlds in order to properly reason.

&quot;A world model simulates the dynamics of an environment, predicting how they evolve and how actions affect them,&quot; the company said of Genie. &quot;While Google DeepMind has a history of agents for specific environments like Chess or Go, building AGI requires systems that navigate the diversity of the real world.&quot;

Before it helps Google develop AGI, the company also sees uses for Genie in the gaming industry, something that ought to concern the already-struggling developers in that space.

While Genie &quot;is not a game engine and can’t create a full game experience,&quot; a Google spokesperson told The Register, &quot;we are excited to see the potential to augment the creative process, enhancing ideation, and speeding up prototyping.&quot;

According to a report from Informa&#39;s Game Developers Conference published this week, 33 percent of surveyed US game developers, and 28 percent globally, reported being subject to at least one layoff in the past two years. Half of these game devs also said that their current or most recent employer had conducted layoffs in the past 12 months.

In other words, the gaming space is suffering, and many are worried AI will only add to that.

Of the game industry professionals surveyed by GDC, 52 percent said they think AI is having a negative impact on the games industry. That&#39;s a sharp increase from last year, when 30 percent of respondents said the same. The year before that, just 18 percent expressed negative feelings about generative AI in the games industry.

Professionals in visual and technical art, game design and narrative, and programming roles held the most unfavorable views of AI.

In the words of one machine learning ops employee in the gaming space, however, an AI like Genie is coming for the gaming industry.

&quot;We are intentionally working on a platform that will put all game devs out of work and allow kids to prompt and direct their own content,&quot; the GDC study quotes the respondent as saying.

It might have its rough edges and limitations now, but given the speed of AI product improvement, Genie could soon make that prediction come true. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Corporate use of AI agents in 2026 looks like the Wild West, with bots running amok and no one quite knowing what to do about it - especially when it comes to managing and securing their identities.

Organizations have been using identity security controls for decades to ensure only authorized human users access the appropriate resources to do their jobs, enforcing least-privilege principles and adopting zero-trust-style policies to limit data leaks and credential theft.

&quot;These new agentic identities are absolutely ungoverned,&quot; Shahar Tal, the CEO of agentic AI cybersecurity outfit Cyata, told The Register. Agentic identities are the accounts, tokens, and credentials assigned to AI agents so they can access corporate apps and data.

&quot;We&#39;re letting things happen right now that we would have never let happen with our human employees,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#39;re letting thousands of interns run around in our production environment, and then we give them the keys to the kingdom. One of the key pain points that I hear from every company is that they don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening&quot; with their AI agents.

In part, this is by design. &quot;In the agentic AI world, the value proposition is: give us access to more of your corporate data, and we will do more work for you,&quot; Nudge Security co-founder and CEO Russell Spitler told The Register. &quot;Agents need to live inside the existing ecosystem of where that data lives, and that means that they need to live within the existing authentication and access infrastructure that SaaS providers already provide to access your data.&quot;

This means AI agents using OAuth tokens to access someone&#39;s Gmail or OneDrive containing corporate files, or repository access tokens to interact with a GitHub repo that holds source code.

We&#39;re letting things happen that we would have never let happen with our human employees

&quot;In order to provide value, agents need to get the data from the things that already have the data, and there are existing pathways to get that data,&quot; Spitler said.

Plus, the plethora of coding tools makes it super easy for individual employees to create AI agents, delegate access to their accounts and data, and then ask the agents to do certain jobs to make the humans&#39; lives easier.

Spitler calls this AI&#39;s &quot;hyper-consumerized consumption model.&quot;

&quot;Those two pieces are what gives rise to the challenges that people have from a security perspective,&quot; he said.

These challenges can lead to disastrous consequences, as researchers and red teams have repeatedly shown. For example, AI agents with broad access to sensitive data and systems can create a &quot;superuser&quot; that can chain together access to sensitive applications and resources, and then use that access to steal information or remotely execute malicious code.

As global education and training company Pearson&#39;s CTO Dave Treat recently noted: AI agents &quot;tend to want to please,&quot; and this presents a security problem when they are granted expansive access to highly sensitive corporate info.

&quot;How are we creating and tuning these agents to be suspicious and not be fooled by the same ploys and tactics that humans are fooled with?&quot; he asked.

Block discovered during an internal red-teaming exercise that its AI agent could be manipulated via prompt injection to deploy information-stealing malware on an employee laptop. The company says the issue has since been fixed.

These security risks aren&#39;t shrinking anytime soon. According to Gartner&#39;s estimates, 40 percent of all enterprise applications will integrate with task-specific AI agents by 2026, up from less than 5 percent in 2025.

Considering many companies today don&#39;t know how many AI agents have access to their apps and data, the challenges are significant.

Tal explains the first thing his company does with its customers is a discovery scan. &quot;And there is always this jaw-dropping moment when they realize the thousands of identities that are already out there,&quot; he said.

It&#39;s important to note: these are not only agentic identities but also human and machine identities. As of last spring, however, machine identities outnumber human identities by a ratio of 82 to one.

When Cyata scans corporate environments, &quot;we are seeing anywhere from one agent per employee to 17 per employee,&quot; Tal said. While some roles - specifically research and development and engineering - tend to adopt AI agents more quickly than the rest of their companies, &quot;folks are adopting agents very, very quickly, and it&#39;s happening all across the organization.&quot;

This is causing an identity crisis of sorts, and neither Tal nor the other AI security folks The Register spoke to for this story believe that agentic identities should be included in the larger machine identities counts. AI agents are dynamic and context-aware - in other words, they act more like humans than machines.

&quot;AI agents are not human, but they also do not behave like service accounts or scripts,&quot; Teleport CEO Ev Kontsevoy told us.

&quot;An agent functions around the clock and acts in unpredictable ways. For example, they may execute the same task with different approaches, continuously creating new access paths,&quot; he added. &quot;This requires accessing critical resources like MCP servers, APIs, databases, internal services, LLMs, and orchestration systems.&quot;

It also makes securing them using traditional identity and access management (IAM) and privileged access management (PAM) tools &quot;near impossible at scale,&quot; Kontsevoy said. &quot;Agents break traditional identity assumptions that legacy tools are built on, that identity is either human or machine.&quot;

AI agents are not human, but they also do not behave like service accounts or scripts

For decades, IAM and PAM have been critical in securing and managing user identities. IAM is used to identify and authorize all users across an organization, while PAM applies to more privileged users and accounts such as admins, securing and monitoring these identities with elevated permissions to access sensitive systems and data.

While this has more or less worked for human employees with predictable roles, it doesn&#39;t work for non-deterministic AI agents, which act autonomously and change their behavior on the fly. This can lead to security issues such as agents being granted excessive privileges, and &quot;shadow AI.&quot;

&quot;We are seeing a lot of shadow AI - someone using a personal account for ChatGPT or Cursor or Claude Code or any of these productivity tools,&quot; Tal said, adding that this can lead to &quot;blast-radius issues.&quot;

&quot;What I mean by that: they&#39;re risky agents,&quot; he said, explaining that some are essentially workflow experiments that someone in the organization created, and neither the IT nor security departments have any oversight.

&quot;What they have done is created a super-connected AI agent that is connected to every MCP server and every data source the company has,&quot; Tal said. &quot;We&#39;ve seen the problem of rogue MCP servers over and over again, where they compromise an agent and steal all of its tokens.&quot;

Fixing this requires visibility into both IT-sanctioned and unsanctioned AI agents being used, so they can be continuously monitored for misconfigurations or any other threats.

&quot;We do a risk assessment for each and every identity that we discover,&quot; Tal said. &quot;We look at its configuration, its connectivity, the permissions that it has. We look at its activity or history - journals, logs that we collect - so we can maintain a profile for each of these agents. After that, we want to put posture guardrails in place.&quot;

These are mitigating controls that prevent the agent from doing something or accessing something sensitive. Sometimes improving security is as easy as speaking to the human behind the AI agents about the risk they unknowingly introduced via the agent and what it can access.

&quot;We need to pop this bubble that agents come out of immaculate conception - a human is creating them, a human is provisioning their access,&quot; Spitler said. &quot;We need to associate tightly those agents with the human who created it, or the humans who work on it. We need to know who proxied their access to these other platforms, and what roles those accounts have in these platforms, so we understand the scope of access and potential impact of that agent&#39;s access in the wild.&quot;

Spitler says that&#39;s &quot;ground zero&quot; for managing and securing agentic identities. &quot;You need to know who your agents are.&quot; ®

            <h2>Dow Chemical says AI is the element behind 4,500 job cuts</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/29/dow_chemical_ai_layoffs/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">ai-pocalypse The jury is still out when it comes to determining how much job loss AI is causing. However, we now have another case study. Dow Chemical blames AI automation for its plans to cut 4,500 jobs, about 12.5 percent of its work force.

The thousands of employees losing their jobs are being cut as part of a rhyming companywide initiative called “Transform to Outperform” that aims to radically simplify operations, and modernize its go-to-market playbook in the hopes of achieving $2 billion in EBITDA improvement by 2028.

&quot;The goal of Transform to Outperform is to achieve significant growth and productivity gains that elevate Dow&#39;s competitive position,&quot; said Karen S. Carter , Dow&#39;s chief operating officer, in the press release announcing the initiative. &quot;We are building on the momentum of our current self-help measures – transforming Dow into a company that is more resilient, consistently delivers growth, enables customer success, and delivers greater shareholder value across the cycle.&quot;

Dow is one of the biggest enterprises working with Palantir rival C3 AI, which uses a digital twin to map a company, its employees, products, and its processes in a hunt to find efficiencies.

“C3 AI has been pivotal in transforming Dow’s operations from reactive to predictive, optimizing asset performance to drive value. As we scale these solutions across Dow’s portfolio, we anticipate significant benefits,” said Debra Bauler, chief information and digital officer at Dow in a June 2025 press release. “We look forward to continuing our partnership with C3 AI as we advance a world-class predictive maintenance program and uncover further opportunities to enhance efficiency, reliability, and productivity throughout our operations.”

The two companies partnered last year on a predictive maintenance solution for the petrochemical industry through Dow’s subsidiary Univation Technologies, which was allowed to license and install C3 AI products.

“Our work with Dow sets the standard for how industrial companies can use AI to drive efficiency, reduce costs, and optimize performance,” said Ed Abbo, Chief Technology Officer, C3 AI in the same June press release. “And this collaboration with Univation will accelerate adoption of this proven, domain-specific AI application across the broader petrochemical industry and support modernization across the market by delivering real, measurable benefits of AI at scale.”

El Reg asked Dow spokesperson to name the processes, software, and technologies that Dow plans to use to replace its employees, but the chemical giant didn&#39;t address the question.

“Through this work, we are leveraging best‑in‑class practices from across industries and high‑impact technologies, such as automation and AI, as we radically simplify our operating model and modernize how we serve our customers,” the spokesperson told The Register.

Dow’s employee numbers have held steady to around 36,000 since 2019. While the company did hire about 2,000 new employees between 2022 and 2023, growing to 37,800, by last year that number was back down to 36,000, according to annual reports and proxy filings.

Dow expects to spend $1.5 billion in one-time costs related to the job cuts with $600 million to $800 million of that going to severance for those let go, or between $133,333 and $177,777 per employee. ®

            <h2>It’s a new heyday for gas thanks to data centers</h2>

            <div id="article-text">AI data centers are driving a surge in new gas projects.

AI data centers are driving a surge in new gas projects.

The US is now leading a global surge in new gas power plants being built in large part to satisfy growing energy demand for data centers. And more gas means more planet-heating pollution.

Gas-fired power generation in development globally rose by 31 percent in 2025. Almost a quarter of that added capacity is slated for the US, which has surpassed China with the biggest increase of any country. More than a third of that growth in the US is expected to directly power data centers, according to a recent analysis by the nonprofit Global Energy Monitor (GEM).

More gas means more planet-heating pollution

The rush to install more powerful hardware into expanding data centers used for generative AI has led to forecasts of skyrocketing power demand. There’s still a lot of uncertainty about whether AI will become as ingrained in everyday life as tech companies might like, and many proposed data centers could fall flat. Even so, plans to build out more gas plants in the name of AI are stalling efforts to transition to cleaner energy sources.

“There is a risk that this capacity could lock in future emissions and become stranded assets if anticipated electricity demand from AI never materializes,” Jenny Martos, project manager for GEM’s Global Oil and Gas Plant Tracker, said in a press release.

Already, 2026 is shaping up to be a record-smashing year for gas. If all of this year’s proposed projects cross the finish line, it would be an even bigger jump in added capacity than the record set in 2002. That’s pretty remarkable considering the 2000s ushered in America’s so-called “shale gas revolution,” when fracking suddenly unleashed previously hard-to-reach reserves. Gas is now a cheaper power source than coal and creates less carbon pollution when burned. But gas production releases methane, a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide even though it doesn’t persist in the atmosphere for as long.

Ramping up electricity generation from gas is also a sharp pivot away from global climate goals. A decade ago, nearly every country on Earth — including its two biggest greenhouse gas polluters, China and the US — signed a historic deal in Paris to limit global warming. The only way to achieve the most ambitious goals set out in the Paris agreement would be to replace fossil fuels with less-polluting alternatives like renewable energy and slash greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by around 2050.

But President Donald Trump has pulled the US out of the Paris agreement and in 2025, US greenhouse gas emissions grew after falling for two years during the Biden administration. The US, the world’s leading gas producer and the country with the most data centers, almost tripled the amount of gas-fired capacity it had in development last year, according to the GEM report. Trump has worked to suppress research on climate change and efforts to rein in greenhouse gas pollution in favor of entrenching oil, gas, and coal reliance. His “AI Action Plan” prioritizes speeding the building out of new fossil fuel infrastructure for data centers.

            <div id="article-text">iPhone revenue surged past $85.3 billion despite setbacks in AI.

iPhone revenue surged past $85.3 billion despite setbacks in AI.

Apple says the iPhone had its “best-ever” quarter, with revenue hitting more than $85.3 billion over the past few months. The company announced the news as part of its Q1 2026 earnings report, which also revealed record-breaking revenue of $143.8 billion, up 16 percent when compared to the same time last year.

“The demand for iPhone was simply staggering, with revenue growing 23 percent year over year,” Apple CEO Tim Cook says during a call with investors. “This is the strongest iPhone lineup we’ve ever had, and by far the most popular.”

iPhone sales surged despite delays surrounding an AI-upgraded Siri, with the base iPhone 17 model offering many features previously exclusive to “Pro” level devices, including an always-on display and a screen with a higher refresh rate. Rumors that iPhone Air sales fell short of expectations didn’t seem to have a big impact, either.

The “high levels” of demand for the iPhone 17 have led to a “constrained” supply, according to Cook. He adds that the company is “seeing less flexibility in the supply chain” when it comes to the availability of the advanced process nodes that it uses to build the device’s chip. Meanwhile, Apple’s services revenue, which includes subscriptions like Apple Music, iCloud, and Apple TV, surged 14 percent year over year, while Mac and wearable revenue were down.

In the coming months, Apple will bring promised AI-powered personalization features to Siri. Apple is partnering with Google to power this upgrade, which will use a custom version of Google’s Gemini AI model.

The company is also acquiring an AI startup, called Q.ai, for $2 billion, according to the Financial Times. Though there aren’t any details on how Apple plans to use the startup’s technology, the Financial Times reports that Q.ai’s patents “show its technology being used in headphones or glasses, using ‘facial skin micro movements’ to communicate without talking.”

Rumors suggest that Apple has even bigger AI ambitions, as a report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman suggests the company plans on turning Siri into an AI chatbot built directly into its iPhone and Mac. Apple is also reportedly working on an AI-powered web search tool for Siri.

The Neo headphones that roll up to become a Bluetooth speaker will be available for preorder starting on February 10th.

There’s never a shortage of weird tech debuting at CES every year. A new company called Tomorrow Doesn’t Matter, or TDM, announced a peculiar pair of headphones at the show earlier this month with a feature no one has tried before. The Neo headphones can be rolled up like a hedgehog which turns them into a compact Bluetooth speaker for those times when you want to share a real banger with those around you. They were expected to launch through a Kickstarter slated for this month, but TDM now says the crowdfunding campaign will officially open on February 10th, 2026.

Pricing for the Neo is set to be $249 when they eventually launch in July 2026, but those placing preorders by backing the Kickstarter can get the headphones discounted to $179.

Designed to make it easier to share music, the earcups on the Neo headphones each feature both inward and outward-facing 40mm drivers. In headphone mode only the inward-facing drivers are used for a private listening experience. When they’re rolled up, the Neo automatically switches to only using the outward-facing drivers for speaker mode, but there’s also a button for toggling between both modes manually.

The Verge’s John Higgins had the chance to go hands-on with the Neo during CES 2026. While the headphones were a bit heavy because of their batteries and extra hardware in each earcup, he also found that rolling them up to switch between modes was “easy and fast” and “a little bit of fun, too.”

Folding phones come with great responsibilities and great rewards.

A foldable phone isn’t for the faint of heart. They’re generally heavier, pricier, and have less capable cameras than a standard slab-style phone. They’re also still not as durable as regular smartphones, though they’re not nearly as fragile as they once were. In fact, thanks to Google, we finally have a foldable phone we can take with us to the beach.

There are basically two kinds of foldables at the moment — the kind that fold like books and the ones that fold clamshell style, like your old flip phone. Here’s how I think of it: a book-style foldable is like a phone plus a tablet, and a flip-style foldable is a phone plus a smartwatch. The book foldables provide an outer screen for all your regular phone needs, and then a tablet-like inner screen when you want, well, more screen. Flip phones come with a smaller secondary display on the outer panel that’s useful for checking information quickly. When you need to do regular phone stuff, you unfold it.

There’s no shortcut to properly testing a phone; I put my personal SIM card (physical or otherwise) in each phone I review and live with it for a minimum of one full week. I set up each phone from scratch, load it up with my apps, and go about living my life — stress testing the battery, using GPS navigation on my bike while streaming radio, taking rapid-fire portrait mode photos of my kid — everything I can throw at it. Starting over with a new phone every week either sounds like a dream or your personal hell, depending on how Into Phones you are. For me, switching has become so routine that it’s mostly painless.

The phones listed here have powerful processors and enough RAM to keep up for years, so it’s fair to expect more than a handful of OS updates throughout the life of your phone. Four years of new OS versions and five years of security updates is a healthy benchmark for this class, and many of the phones here meet or exceed that standard.

Most phone cameras can perform well in good lighting conditions, from the flagship class down to $300 budget phones. The devices listed here offer a little something extra, like a useful telephoto lens, a great portrait mode, or impressive low-light shooting — and many include all three. Stabilization for the main camera unit to help in low light is a must in this category.

Most modern foldables carry an IP48 rating, meaning they’re built to withstand full water immersion and solid particles 1mm or bigger. Devices with an IP48 rating aren’t fully protected from dust, which remains a concern when it comes to long-term durability. However, Google’s Pixel 10 Pro Fold carries an IP68 rating, making it the first foldable to offer full water and dust resistance.

In addition to the best devices at any price, I look for phones that offer the best mix of must-have features for good prices. That might lead to a recommendation of a lower-tier model if it’s particularly feature-rich for its price or last year’s model if it’s still sold new and this year’s device doesn’t offer many upgrades.

So while they all fit in one category of folding tech, they’re suited to two very different kinds of people — someone who wants even more phone with their phone and someone who wants to be fully immersed a little less. Whichever category you fit into, you’d be wise to get the manufacturer’s extended warranty with your purchase; fixes can be expensive, and you won’t be able to walk into just any phone repair shop to get them. If you don’t opt for the warranty, you’ll want to be sure you can comfortably afford to replace your phone in the event of a sudden sand-related catastrophe. Death can come swiftly to a folding screen.

If I haven’t scared you off by this point, then you’re probably the kind of person who will have a heck of a good time with a foldable. I’ve used every phone under the sun, and folding phones are some of my favorite gadgets. Run four apps at once! Prop it up like a tiny laptop! Hold it like a camcorder when you shoot video! There are tons of possibilities, and the thrill you get when you fold your phone shut never fully wears off.

Full dust resistance! On a foldable!Qi2 support with built-in magnets

Heavy and chunkyCameras aren’t as good as the other 10 Pro phones’Pricier than a regular phone

Screen: 8-inch, 2076p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 6.4-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED cover screen / Processor: Google Tensor G5 / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS; 10.8-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS; 10.5-megapixel ultrawide; 10-megapixel selfie (cover screen); 10-megapixel inner selfie camera / Battery: 5,015mAh / Charging: 30W wired, 15W wireless (Qi2) / Weather resistance: IP68

Durability has long been the North Star of the foldable category, and the Pixel 10 Pro Fold marks a real milestone in that journey. With an IP68 rating, it’s the first foldable to offer full water and dust resistance. That means you can take the $1,799 device on a hike or to the beach without worrying that a stray grain of sand will absolutely destroy it. Add in Qi2 support with built-in magnets for accessories and wireless charging — along with Google’s more powerful Tensor G5 chip — and you have the most well-rounded foldable available.

The Pixel 10 Pro Fold isn’t without its shortcomings, though. It offers all-day battery life with minimal use of the inner display; however, if you spend most of your time using the inner screen, your battery will likely be in the red by bedtime. Also, while we love the device’s improved durability, its cameras fall short of Google’s other 10 Pro models, especially in low light. The foldable is a bit heavier and thicker than the Galaxy Z Fold 7, too, which is a fair trade for greater peace of mind.

Samsung finally adopted the big cover screenAll-day batteryReliable camera

More susceptible to dust than your average phoneStill too hard to run full apps on the cover screen

Screen: 6.9-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 4.1-inch, 948p, OLED cover screen / Processor: Samsung Exynos 2500 / Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 main with OIS; 12-megapixel ultrawide; 10-megapixel selfie (inner screen) / Battery: 4,300mAh / Charging: 25W wired, 15W wireless, 4.5W reverse wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP48

The latest Galaxy Z Flip may not be as fun as the newest Razr Ultra, but it does offer a few new tricks. Samsung ditched the old file-folder cover screen in favor of a glorious, 4.1-inch edge-to-edge panel that wraps around the cameras. The extra real estate means you have more room to quickly respond to messages or perform any task that doesn’t require you to open your phone (and risk getting lost in a digital rabbit hole).

In addition to the larger cover screen, the Flip 7 offers a couple of other thoughtful updates. It’s thinner than its predecessor and features a bigger 4,300mAh battery, which is a step up from the 4,000mAh battery found in the last-gen Flip 6. The camera system remains unchanged from last year’s model, too, though that’s not necessarily a bad thing. The 50-megapixel main shooter still produces great images, and you get all the versatility the flip form factor has to offer, including the ability to easily take selfies using the rear camera.

Despite some welcome changes, the Flip 7 carries the same IP48 rating as last year’s model, which means long-term durability against fine dust particles remains a concern. However, Samsung offers a great warranty and repair program, along with seven years of OS and security updates. The Flip 7 isn’t perfect, but it’s the most powerful and polished version yet — just don’t drop it while lounging on the beach.

One of the best-looking phones you can buyGreat battery lifeOuter screen is useful in unexpected ways

AI button is wasted real estate Long-term durability is still a question markCamera processing is occasionally weird

Screen: 7-inch 1224p OLED 165Hz inner screen; 4-inch 1080p OLED 165Hz outer screen / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite / Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 main with OIS; 50-megapixel f/2.0 ultrawide; 50-megapixel f/2.0 selfie / Battery: 4,700mAh / Charging: 68W wired, 30W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP48

The Razr Ultra is the newest and most advanced member of Motorola’s foldable lineup. Compared to the Razr Plus, it boasts a higher-resolution inner screen, Qualcomm’s most powerful mobile processor, double the storage space, and an upgraded selfie camera. The device is also one of the best-looking phones you can buy — the gold-bronze chassis and wooden back panel lend the Ultra a real elegance. When every phone tends to look the same — even in the foldable market — the Razr Ultra stands out in a crowd, which only adds to its charm.

Beyond its appearance, the Ultra is just plain fun to use. The 4-inch outer screen covers almost the entire front of the phone, making it perfect for checking notifications, responding to messages, and taking quick actions such as hailing an Uber. The titanium hinge is also an upgrade over the stainless steel found in the Razr Plus. While the Ultra is enjoyable, it can’t overcome the gripes we’ve had with previous Motorola foldables, like inconsistent camera processing. Meanwhile, Motorola is only promising three OS upgrades and four years of security updates, which is on the shorter side considering the $1,300 retail price.

It’s really, really thinExcellent battery lifeThe crease is almost invisible

Foldables are still fragileIt’s not launching in the US or Europe

Screen: 8.12-inch, 2248p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 6.62-inch, 1140p, 120Hz OLED outer screen size/ Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.9 main with OIS, 50-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 8-megapixel ultrawide, 8-megapixel selfie cameras (inner and outer) / Battery: 5,600mAh / Charging: 80W wired, 50W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IPX8/IPX9

Let’s get the bad news out of the way first: if you live in the US or Europe, you can’t buy the Oppo Find N5. That rules out, well, a lot of us. But if you live in China, Singapore, or any of the other Asian countries Oppo included in its so-called “global” release, then you’re in luck: you can pick up one of the world’s thinnest book-style folding phones, and the rest of us are all very jealous of you.

The Find N5 isn’t all about thinness, either. Its Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset is highly capable, the phone is fully water-resistant, and battery life is excellent. It utilizes silicon-carbon battery technology to accommodate a large (by foldable standards) 5,600mAh battery, which easily holds up after a long day of heavy use. What’s even more impressive is that, like the aforementioned Z Fold 7, the Find N5 is still barely thicker than a standard slab-style phone and only slightly heavier. That matters when you’re using the phone via the cover screen for long periods of time or stashing it in the side pocket of your yoga pants. When a foldable is only about as heavy and bulky as a regular phone, using the inner screen feels like getting away with something fantastic — not a benefit you have to make many other sacrifices for. Oppo delivers this in spades, and I just wish more of us could… find it.

Musk could be consolidating his companies.

Elon Musk-led SpaceX may merge with another company helmed by Elon Musk. Reuters initially reported Thursday that SpaceX and xAI are “in discussions to merge” ahead of SpaceX’s IPO that’s planned for later this year. The merger would help with SpaceX’s plans to launch data centers into space, according to the publication. Later on Thursday, Bloomberg reported that SpaceX is “considering” a potential merger with Tesla or an “alternative combination” with xAI.

The specific timing and value of any potential merger are unclear. SpaceX is considering an IPO date in mid-June, the Financial Times reported this week. SpaceX, Tesla, and xAI didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from The Verge.

If SpaceX merges with xAI, it would put the rocket company in the same house as Grok, which is under significant scrutiny and even an investigation in the EU over sexualized deepfakes.

And should SpaceX merge with either Tesla or xAI, it would be just the latest transaction between companies with Elon Musk as its CEO. Tesla said this week that it would be investing “approximately” $2 billion in xAI. Tesla also sold $430 million in backup batteries to xAI in 2025, CNBC reports. Last year, xAI bought X.

﻿FT reports Apple is paying $2 billion for Q.ai, an audio startup that uses facial expressions to understand you without a word.

Apple’s biggest acquisition ever is still its $3 billion Beats buy in 2014, but now the second biggest deal is bringing in Q.ai, a four-year-old AI audio startup. Apple did not disclose the terms, but Financial Times reports that Apple is spending $2 billion on the company. It also mentioned Q.ai patents for optical sensor technology that could be built into headphones or glasses to recognize “facial skin micro movements,” allowing for non-verbal discussions with an AI assistant, for example.

The founders of Q.ai will join Apple, including CEO Aviad Maizels, who founded PrimeSense. Apple bought that company in 2013 and repurposed its Xbox Kinect technology to power the iPhone’s FaceID setup. This time around, tech that understands whispered speech could connect to the generative AI-upgraded Siri or other Apple Intelligence features, and work with future AirPods, Vision Pro, iPhone, or Mac devices.

In a statement provided to Reuters, Apple hardware exec Johnny Srouji called Q.ai “a remarkable company that is pioneering new and creative ways to use imaging and machine learning.” Google Ventures has backed the startup, and managing partner Tom Hulme wrote in a blog post about how this could help us find out “what happens when the computer finally ‘disappears’ into our daily lives.”

            <div id="article-text">The US Department of Homeland Security is using AI video generators from Google and Adobe to make and edit content shared with the public, a new document reveals. It comes as immigration agencies have flooded social media with content to support President Trump&#39;s mass deportation agenda—some of which appears to be made with AI—and as workers in tech have put pressure on their employers to denounce the agencies’ activities.

The document, released on Wednesday, provides an inventory of which commercial AI tools DHS uses for tasks ranging from generating drafts of documents to managing cybersecurity.

In a section about “editing images, videos or other public affairs materials using AI,” it reveals for the first time that DHS is using Google&#39;s Veo 3 video generator and Adobe Firefly, estimating that the agency has between 100 and 1,000 licenses for the tools. It also discloses that DHS uses Microsoft Copilot Chat for generating first drafts of documents and summarizing long reports and Poolside software for coding tasks, in addition to tools from other companies.

Google, Adobe, and DHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The news provides details about how agencies like Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, which is part of DHS, might be creating the large amounts of content they’ve shared on X and other channels as immigration operations have expanded across US cities. They’ve posted content celebrating “Christmas after mass deportations,” referenced Bible verses and Christ’s birth, showed faces of those the agency has arrested, and shared ads aimed at recruiting agents. The agencies have also repeatedly used music without permissions from artists in their videos.

Some of the content, particularly videos, has the appearance of being AI-generated, but it hasn’t been clear until now what AI models the agencies might be using. This marks the first concrete evidence such generators are being used by DHS to create content shared with the public.

It still remains impossible to verify which company helped create a specific piece of content, or indeed if it was AI-generated at all. Adobe offers options to “watermark” a video made with its tools to disclose that it is AI-generated, for example, but this disclosure does not always stay intact when the content is uploaded and shared across different sites.

The document reveals that DHS has specifically been using Flow, a tool from Google that combines its Veo 3 video generator with a suite of filmmaking tools. Users can generate clips and assemble entire videos with AI, including videos that contain sound, dialogue, and background noise, making them hyperrealistic. Adobe launched its Firefly generator in 2023, promising that it does not use copyrighted content in its training or output. Like Google’s tools, Adobe’s can generate videos, images, soundtracks, and speech. The document does not reveal further details about how the agency is using these video generation tools.

Workers at large tech companies, including more than 140 current and former employees from Google and more than 30 from Adobe, have been putting pressure on their employers in recent weeks to take a stance against ICE and the shooting of Alex Pretti on January 24. Google’s leadership has not made statements in response. In October, Google and Apple removed apps on their app stores that were intended to track sightings of ICE, citing safety risks.

An additional document released on Wednesday revealed new details about how the agency is using more niche AI products, including a facial recognition app used by ICE, as first reported by 404Media in June.

Meet the Vitalists: the hardcore longevity enthusiasts who believe death is “wrong”

Last April, an excited crowd gathered at a compound in Berkeley, California, for a three-day event called the Vitalist Bay Summit. It was part of a longer, two-month residency that hosted various events to explore tools—from drug regulation to cryonics—that might be deployed in the fight against death.One of the main goals, though, was to spread the word of Vitalism, a somewhat radical movement established by Nathan Cheng and his colleague Adam Gries a few years ago. Consider it longevity for the most hardcore adherents—a sweeping mission to which nothing short of total devotion will do.Although interest in longevity has certainly taken off in recent years, not everyone in the broader longevity space shares Vitalists’ commitment to actually making death obsolete. And the Vitalists feel that momentum is building, not just for the science of aging and the development of lifespan-extending therapies, but for the acceptance of their philosophy that defeating death should be humanity’s top concern.

The ability to remember you and your preferences is rapidly becoming a big selling point for AI chatbots and agents.Personalized, interactive AI systems are built to act on our behalf, maintain context across conversations, and improve our ability to carry out all sorts of tasks, from booking travel to filing taxes.But their ability to store and retrieve increasingly intimate details about their users over time introduces alarming, and all-too-familiar, privacy vulnerabilities––many of which have loomed since “big data” first teased the power of spotting and acting on user patterns. Worse, AI agents now appear poised to plow through whatever safeguards had been adopted to avoid those vulnerabilities. So what can developers do to fix this problem? Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">The eastern half of the US saw a monster snowstorm over the weekend. The good news is the grid has largely been able to keep up with the freezing temperatures and increased demand. But there were some signs of strain, particularly for fossil-fuel plants.

One analysis found that PJM, the nation’s largest grid operator, saw significant unplanned outages in plants that run on natural gas and coal. Historically, these facilities can struggle in extreme winter weather.

Much of the country continues to face record-low temperatures, and the possibility is looming for even more snow this weekend. What lessons can we take from this storm, and how might we shore up the grid to cope with extreme weather?

Living in New Jersey, I have the honor of being one of the roughly 67 million Americans covered by the PJM Interconnection.

So I was in the thick of things this weekend, when PJM saw unplanned outages of over 20 gigawatts on Sunday during the height of the storm. (That’s about 16% of the grid’s demand that afternoon.) Other plants were able to make up the difference, and thankfully, the power didn’t go out in my area. But that’s a lot of capacity offline.

Typically, the grid operator doesn’t announce details about why an outage occurs until later. But analysts at Energy Innovation, a policy and research firm specializing in energy and climate, went digging. By examining publicly available grid mix data (a breakdown of what types of power plants are supplying the grid), the team came to a big conclusion: Fossil fuels failed during the storm.

The analysts found that gas-fired power plants were producing about 10 gigawatts less power on Sunday than the peak demand on Saturday, even while electricity prices were high. Coal- and oil-burning plants were down too. Because these plants weren’t operating, even when high prices would make it quite lucrative, they were likely a significant part of the problem, says Michelle Solomon, a manager in the electricity program at Energy Innovation.

PJM plans to share more details about the outages at an upcoming committee meeting once the cold snap passes, Dan Lockwood, a PJM spokesperson, told me via email.

Fossil-fuel plants can see reliability challenges during winter: When temperatures drop, pressures in natural-gas lines fall too, which can lead to issues for fuel supply. Freezing temperatures can throw compression stations and other mechanical equipment offline and even freeze piles of coal.

One of the starkest examples came in 2021, when Texas faced freezing temperatures that took many power plants offline and threw the grid into chaos. Many homes lost power for days, and at least 246 people died during that storm.

Texas fared much better this time around. After 2021, the state shored up its grid, adding winter weatherization for power plants and transmission systems. Texas has also seen a huge flood of batteries come online, which has greatly helped the grid during winter demand peaks, especially in the early mornings. Texas was also simply lucky that this storm was less severe there, as one expert told Inside Climate News this week.

Here on the East Coast, we’re not out of the woods yet. The snow has stopped falling, but grids are still facing high electricity demand because of freezing temperatures. (I’ve certainly been living under my heated blanket these last few days.)

PJM could see a peak power demand of 130 gigawatts for seven straight days, a winter streak that the local grid has never experienced, according to an update to the utility’s site on Tuesday morning.

The US Department of Energy issued emergency orders to several grid operators, including PJM, that allow power plants to run while basically ignoring emissions regulations. The department also issued orders allowing several grids to tell data centers and other facilities to begin using backup generators. (This is good news for reliability but bad news for clean air and the climate, since these power sources are often incredibly emissions-intensive.)

We here on the East Coast could learn a thing or two from Texas so we don’t need to resort to these polluting emergency measures to keep the lights on. More energy storage could be a major help in future winter storms, lending flexibility to the grid to help ride out the worst times, Solomon says. Getting offshore wind online could also help, since those facilities typically produce reliable power in the winter.

No one energy source will solve the massive challenge of building and maintaining a resilient grid. But as we face the continued threat of extreme storms, renewables might actually help us weather them.

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/29/1131815/vitalism-longevity-enthusiasts-influence/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">“Who here believes involuntary death is a good thing?”

Nathan Cheng has been delivering similar versions of this speech over the last couple of years, so I knew what was coming. He was about to try to convince the 80 or so people in the audience that death is bad. And that defeating it should be humanity’s number one priority—quite literally, that it should come above all else in the social and political hierarchy.

“If you believe that life is good and there&#39;s inherent moral value to life,” he told them, “it stands to reason that the ultimate logical conclusion here is that we should try to extend lifespan indefinitely.”

Solving aging, he added, is “a problem that has an incredible moral duty for all of us to get involved in.”

It was the end of April, and the crowd—with its whoops and yeahs—certainly seemed convinced. They’d gathered at a compound in Berkeley, California, for a three-day event called the Vitalist Bay Summit. It was part of a longer, two-month residency (simply called Vitalist Bay) that hosted various events to explore tools—from drug regulation to cryonics—that might be deployed in the fight against death. One of the main goals, though, was to spread the word of Vitalism, a somewhat radical movement established by Cheng and his colleague Adam Gries a few years ago.

No relation to the lowercase vitalism of old, this Vitalism has a foundational philosophy that’s deceptively simple: to acknowledge that death is bad and life is good. The strategy for executing it, though, is far more obviously complicated: to launch a longevity revolution.

Interest in longevity has certainly taken off in recent years, but as the Vitalists see it, it has a branding problem. The term “longevity” has been used to sell supplements with no evidence behind them, “anti-aging” has been used by clinics to sell treatments, and “transhumanism” relates to ideas that go well beyond the scope of defeating death. Not everyone in the broader longevity space shares Vitalists’ commitment to actually making death obsolete. As Gries, a longtime longevity devotee who has largely become the enthusiastic public face of Vitalism, said in an online presentation about the movement in 2024, “We needed some new word.”

“Vitalism” became a clean slate: They would start a movement to defeat death, and make that goal the driving force behind the actions of individuals, societies, and nations. Longevity could no longer be a sideshow. For Vitalism to succeed, budgets would need to change. Policy would need to change. Culture would need to change. Consider it longevity for the most hardcore adherents—a sweeping mission to which nothing short of total devotion will do.

“The idea is to change the systems and the priorities of society at the highest levels,” Gries said in the presentation.

To be clear, the effective anti-aging treatments the Vitalists are after don’t yet exist. But that’s sort of the point: They believe they could exist if Vitalists are able to spread their gospel, influence science, gain followers, get cash, and ultimately reshape government policies and priorities.

For the past few years, Gries and Cheng have been working to recruit lobbyists, academics, biotech CEOs, high-net-worth individuals, and even politicians into the movement, and they’ve formally established a nonprofit foundation “to accelerate Vitalism.” Today, there’s a growing number of Vitalists (some paying foundation members, others more informal followers, and still others who support the cause but won’t publicly admit as much), and the foundation has started “certifying” qualifying biotech companies as Vitalist organizations. Perhaps most consequentially, Gries, Cheng, and their peers are also getting involved in shaping US state laws that make unproven, experimental treatments more accessible. They hope to be able to do the same at the national level.

Vitalism cofounders Nathan Cheng and Adam Gries want to launch a longevity revolution.

All this is helping Vitalists grow in prominence, if not also power. In the past, people who have spoken of living forever or making death “optional” have been dismissed by their academic colleagues. I’ve been covering the broader field of aging science for a decade, and I’ve seen scientists roll their eyes, shrug their shoulders, and turn their backs on people who have talked this way. That’s not the case for the Vitalists.

Even the scientists who think that Vitalist ideas of defeating death are wacky, unattainable ones, with the potential to discredit their field, have shown up on stage with Vitalism’s founders, and these serious researchers provide a platform for them at more traditionally academic events.

I saw this collegiality firsthand at Vitalist Bay. Faculty members from Harvard, Stanford, and the University of California, Berkeley, all spoke at events. Eric Verdin, the prominent researcher who directs the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in Novato, California, had also planned to speak, although a scheduling clash meant he couldn’t make it in the end. “I have very different ideas in terms of what’s doable,” he told me. “But that’s part of the [longevity] movement—there’s freedom for people to say whatever they want.”

Many other well-respected scientists attended, including representatives of ARPA-H, the US federal agency for health research and breakthrough technologies. And as I left for a different event on longevity in Washington, DC, just after the Vitalist Bay Summit, a sizable group of Vitalist Bay attendees headed that way too, to make the case for longevity to US lawmakers.

The Vitalists feel that momentum is building, not just for the science of aging and the development of lifespan-extending therapies, but for the acceptance of their philosophy that defeating death should be humanity’s top concern.

This, of course, sparks some pretty profound questions. What would a society without death look like—and would we even want it? After all, death has become an important part of human culture the world over. And even if Vitalists aren’t destined to realize their lofty goal, their growing influence could still have implications for us all. As they run more labs and companies, and insert themselves into the making of laws and policy, perhaps they will discover treatments that really do slow or even reverse aging. In the meantime, though, some ethicists are concerned that experimental and unproven medicines—including potentially dangerous ones—are becoming more accessible, in some cases with little to no oversight.

Gries, ultimately, has a different view of the ethics here. He thinks that being “okay with death” is what disqualifies a person from being considered ethical. “Death is just wrong,” he says. “It’s not just wrong for some people. It’s wrong for all people.”

When I arrived at the Vitalist Bay Summit on April 25, I noticed that the venue was equipped with everything a longevity enthusiast might need: napping rooms, a DEXA body-composition scanner, a sauna in a bus, and, for those so inclined, 24-hour karaoke.

I was told that around 300 people had signed up for that day’s events, which was more than had attended the previous week. That might have been because arguably the world’s most famous longevity enthusiast, Bryan Johnson, was about to make an appearance. (If you’re curious to know more about what Johnson was doing there, you can read about our conversation here.)

The key to Vitalism has always been that “death is humanity’s core problem, and aging its primary agent,” cofounder Adam Gries told me. “So it was, and so it has continued, as it was foretold.”

But Gries, another man in his 40s who doesn’t want to die, was the first to address the audience that day. Athletic and energetic, he bounded across a stage wearing bright yellow shorts and a long-sleeved shirt imploring people to “Choose Life: VITALISM.”

Gries is a tech entrepreneur who describes himself as a self-taught software engineer who’s “good at virality.” He’s been building companies since he was in college in the 2000s, and grew his personal wealth by selling them.

As with many other devotees to the cause, his deep interest in life extension was sparked by Aubrey de Grey, a controversial researcher with an iconic long beard and matching ponytail. He’s known widely both for his optimistic views about “defeating aging” and for having reportedly made sexual comments to two longevity entrepreneurs. (In an email, de Grey said he’s “never disputed” one of these remarks but denied having made the other. “My continued standing within the longevity community speaks for itself,” he added.)

In an influential 2005 TED Talk (which has over 4.8 million views), de Grey predicted that people would live to 1,000 and spoke of the possibility of new technologies that would continue to stave off death, allowing some to avoid it indefinitely. (In a podcast recorded last year, Cheng described a recording of this talk as “the OG longevity-pilling YouTube video.”)

“It was kind of evident to me that life is great,” says Gries. “So I’m kind of like, why would I not want to live?”

A second turning point for Gries came during the early stages of the covid-19 pandemic, when he essentially bet against companies that he thought would collapse. “I made this 50 [fold] return,” he says. “It was kind of like living through The Big Short.”

Gries and his wife fled from San Francisco to Israel, where he grew up, and later traveled to Taiwan, where he’d obtained a “golden visa” and which was, at the time, one of only two countries that had not reported a single case of covid. His growing wealth afforded him the opportunity to take time from work and think about the purpose of life. “My answer was: Life is the purpose of life,” he says. He didn’t want to die. He didn’t want to experience the “journey of decrepitude” that aging often involves.

So he decided to dedicate himself to the longevity cause. He went about looking up others who seemed as invested as he was. In 2021 his search led him to Cheng, a Chinese-Canadian entrepreneur based in Toronto. He had dropped out of a physics PhD a few years earlier after experiencing what he describes on his website as “a massive existential crisis” and shifted his focus to “radical longevity.” (Cheng did not respond to email requests for an interview.)

The pair “hit it off immediately,” says Gries, and they spent the following two years trying to figure out what they could do. The solution they finally settled on: revolution.

After all, Gries reasons, that’s how significant religious and social movements have happened in the past. He says they sought inspiration from the French and American Revolutions, among others. The idea was to start with some kind of “enlightenment,” and with a “hardcore group,” to pursue significant social change with global ramifications.

“We were convinced that without a revolution,” Gries says, “we were as good as dead.”

Early on, they wrote a Vitalist declaration, a white paper that lists five core statements for believers:

While it’s not an explicit part of the manifesto, it was important to them to think about it as a moral philosophy as well as a movement. As Cheng said at the time, morality “guides most of the actions of our lives.” The same should be true of Vitalism, he suggested.

Gries has echoed this idea. The belief that “death is morally bad” is necessary to encourage behavior change, he told me in 2024. It is a moral drive, or moral purpose, that pushes people to do difficult things, he added.

Revolution, after all, is difficult. And to succeed—to “get unlimited great health to the top of the priority list,” as Gries says—the movement would need to infiltrate the government and shape policy decisions and national budgets. The Apollo program got people to the moon with less than 1% of US GDP; imagine, Gries asks, what we could do to human longevity with a mere 1% of GDP?

It makes sense, then, that Gries and Cheng launched Vitalism in 2023 at Zuzalu, a “pop-up city” in Montenegro that provided a two-month home for like-minded longevity enthusiasts. The gathering was in some ways a loose prototype for what they wanted to accomplish. Cheng spoke there of how they wanted to persuade 10,000 or so Vitalists to move to Rhode Island. Not only was it close to the biotech hub of Boston, but they believed it had a small enough population for an influx of new voters sharing their philosophy to influence local and state elections. “Five to ten thousand people—that’s all we need,” he said. Or if not Rhode Island, another small-ish US state, where they could still change state policy from the inside.

The ultimate goal was to recruit Vitalists to help them establish a “longevity state”—a recognized jurisdiction that “prioritizes doing something about aging,” Cheng said, perhaps by loosening regulations on clinical trials or supporting biohacking.

This idea is popular among many vocal members of the Vitalism community. It borrows from the concept of the “network state” developed by former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan, defined as a new city or country that runs on cryptocurrency; focuses on a goal, in this case extending human lifespan; and “eventually gains diplomatic recognition from preexisting states.”

Some people not interested in dying have made progress toward realizing such a domain. Following the success of Zuzalu, one of the event’s organizers, Laurence Ion, a young cryptocurrency investor and self-proclaimed Vitalist, joined a fellow longevity enthusiast named Niklas Anzinger to organize a sequel in Próspera, the private “special economic zone” on the Honduran island of Roatán. They called their “pop-up city” Vitalia.

I visited shortly after it launched in January 2024. The goal was to create a low-regulation biotech hub to fast-track the development of anti-aging drugs, though the “city” was more like a gated resort that hosted talks from a mix of respected academics, biohackers, biotech CEOs, and straight-up eugenicists. There was a strong sense of community—many attendees were living with or near each other, after all. A huge canvas where attendees could leave notes included missives like “Don’t die,” “I love you,” and “Meet technoradicals building the future!”

But Vitalia was short-lived, with events ending by the start of March 2024. And while many of the vibes were similar to what I’d later see at Vitalist Bay, the temporary nature of Vitalia didn’t quite match the ambition of Gries and Cheng.

Patri Friedman, a 49-year-old libertarian and grandson of the economist Milton Friedman who says he attended Zuzalu, Vitalia, and Vitalist Bay, envisions something potentially even bolder. He’s the founder of the Seasteading Institute, which has the goal of “building startup communities that float on the ocean with any measure of political autonomy” and has received funding and support from the billionaire Peter Thiel. Friedman also founded Pronomos Capital, a venture capital fund that invests in projects focused on “building the cities of tomorrow.”

His company is exploring various types of potential network states, but he says he’s found that medical tourism—and, specifically, a hunger for life extension—dominates the field. “People do not want this ‘10 years and a billion dollars to pass a drug’ thing with the FDA,” says Friedman. (While he doesn’t call himself a Vitalist, partly because he’s “almost never going to agree with” any kind of decree, Friedman holds what you might consider similarly staunch sentiments about death, which he referred to as “murder by omission.” When I asked him if he has a target age he’d like to reach, he told me he found the question “mind-bogglingly strange” and “insane.” “How could you possibly be like: Yes, please murder me at this time?” he replied. “I can always fucking shoot myself in the head—I don’t need anybody’s help.”)

But even as Vitalists and those aligned with their beliefs embrace longevity states, Gries and Cheng are reassessing their former ambitions. The network-state approach has limits, Gries tells me. And encouraging thousands of people to move to Rhode Island wasn’t as straightforward as they’d hoped it might be.

Not because he can’t find tens of thousands of Vitalists, Gries stresses—but most of them are unwilling to move their lives for the sake of influencing the policy of another state. He compares Vitalism to a startup, with a longevity state as its product. For the time being, at least, there isn’t enough consumer appetite for that product, he says.

The past year shows that it may in fact be easier to lobby legislators in states that are already friendly to deregulation. Anzinger and a lobbying group called the Alliance for Longevity Initiatives (A4LI) were integral to making Montana the first US hub for experimental medical treatments, with a new law to allow clinics to sell experimental therapies once they have been through preliminary safety tests (which don’t reveal whether a drug actually works). But Gries and his Vitalist colleagues also played a role—“providing feedback, talking to lawmakers … brainstorming [and] suggesting ideas,” Gries says.

The Vitalist crew has been in conversation with lawmakers in New Hampshire, too. In an email in December, Gries and Cheng claimed they’d “helped to get right-to-try laws passed” in the state—an apparent reference to the recent expansion of a law to make more unapproved treatments accessible to people with terminal illnesses. Meanwhile, three other bills that expand access even further are under consideration.

Ultimately, Gries stresses, Vitalism is “agnostic to the fixing strategies” that will help them meet their goals. There is, though, at least one strategy he’s steadfast about: building influence.

To trigger a revolution, the Vitalists may need to recruit only around 3% or 4% of “society” to their movement, Gries believes. (Granted, that does still mean hundreds of millions of people.) “If you want people to take action, you need to focus on a small number of very high-leverage people,” he tells me.

That, perhaps unsurprisingly, includes wealthy individuals with “a net worth of $10 million or above,” he says. He wants to understand why (with some high-profile exceptions, including Thiel, who has been investing in longevity-related companies and foundations for decades) most uber-wealthy people don’t invest in the field—and how he might persuade them to do so. He won’t reveal the names of anyone he’s having conversations with.

These “high-leverage” people might also include, Gries says, well-respected academics, leaders of influential think tanks, politicians and policymakers, and others who work in government agencies.

A revolution needs to find its foot soldiers. And at the most basic level, that will mean boosting the visibility of the Vitalism brand—partly through events like Vitalist Bay, but also by encouraging others, particularly in the biotech space, to sign on. Cheng talks of putting out a “bat signal” for like-minded people, and he and Gries say that Vitalism has brought together people who have gone on to collaborate or form companies.

There’s also their nonprofit Vitalism International Foundation, whose supporters can opt to become “mobilized Vitalists” with monthly payments of $29 or more, depending on their level of commitment. In addition, the foundation works with longevity biotech companies to recognize those that are “aligned” with its goals as officially certified Vitalist organizations. “Designation may be revoked if an organization adopts apologetic narratives that accept aging or death,” according to the website. At the time of writing, that site lists 16 certified Vitalist organizations, including cryopreservation companies, a longevity clinic, and several research companies.

One of them is Shift Bioscience, a company using CRISPR and aging clocks—which attempt to measure biological age—to identify genes that might play a significant role in the aging process and potentially reverse it. It says it has found a single gene that can rejuvenate multiple types of cells.

Shift cofounder Daniel Ives, who holds degrees in mitochondrial and computational biology, tells me he was also won over to the longevity cause by de Grey’s 2005 TED Talk. He now has a countdown on his computer: “It’s my days till death,” he says—around 22,000 days left. “I’m using that to keep myself focused.”

Ives calls himself the “Vitalist CEO” of Shift Bioscience. He thinks the label is important first as a way for like-minded people to find and support each other, grow their movement, and make the quest for longevity mainstream. Second, he says, it provides a way to appeal to “hardcore” lifespan extensionists, given that others in the wellness and cosmetics industry have adopted the term “longevity” without truly applying themselves to finding rejuvenation therapies. He refers to unnamed companies and individuals who claim that drinking juices, for example, can reverse aging by five years or so.

“You don’t have to convince the mainstream,” says ARPA-H science and engineering advisor Mark Hamalainen. Though “kind of a terrible example,” he notes, Stalinism started small. “Sometimes you just have to convince the right people.”

“Somebody will make these claims and basically throw legitimate science under the bus,” he says. He doesn’t want spurious claims made on social media to get lumped in with the company’s serious molecular biology. Shift’s head of machine learning, Lucas Paulo de Lima Camillo, was recently awarded a $10,000 prize by the well-respected Biomarkers of Aging Consortium for an aging clock he developed.

Another out-and-proud Vitalist CEO is Anar Isman, the cofounder of AgelessRx, a telehealth provider that offers prescriptions for purported longevity drugs—and a certified Vitalist organization. (Isman, who is in his early 40s, used to work at a hedge fund but was inspired to join the longevity field by—you guessed it—de Grey.)

During a panel session at Vitalist Bay, he stressed that he too saw longevity as a movement—and a revolution—rather than an industry. But he also claimed his company wasn’t doing too badly commercially. “We’ve had a lot of demand,” he said. “We’ve got $60 million plus in annual revenue.”

Many of his customers come to the site looking for treatments for specific ailments, he tells me. He views each as an opportunity to “evangelize” his views on “radical life extension.” “I don’t see a difference between … dying tomorrow or dying in 30 years,” he says. He wants to live “at least 100 more” years.

Vitalism, though, isn’t just appealing to commercial researchers. Mark Hamalainen, a 41-year-old science and engineering advisor at ARPA-H, describes himself as a Vitalist. He says he “kind of got roped into” Vitalism because he also works with Cheng—they founded the Longevity Biotech Fellowship, which supports new entrants to the field through mentoring programs. “I kind of view it as a more appealing rebranding of some of the less radical aspects of transhumanism,” he says. Transhumanism—the position that we can use technologies to enhance humans beyond the current limits of biology—covers a broad terrain, but “Vitalism is like: Can we just solve this death thing first? It’s a philosophy that’s easy to get behind.”

In government, he works with individuals like Jean Hébert, a former professor of genetics and neuroscience who has investigated the possibility of rejuvenating the brain by gradually replacing parts of it; Hébert has said that “[his] mission is to beat aging.” He spoke at Zuzalu and Vitalist Bay.

Andrew Brack, who serves as the program manager for proactive health at ARPA-H, was at Vitalist Bay, too. Both Brack and Hébert oversee healthy federal budgets—Hébert’s brain replacement project was granted $110 million in 2024, for example.

Neither Hébert nor Brack has publicly described himself as a Vitalist, and Hébert wouldn’t agree to speak to me without the approval of ARPA-H’s press office, which didn’t respond to multiple requests for an interview with him or Brack. Brack did not respond to direct requests for an interview.

Gries says he thinks that “many people at [the US Department of Health and Human Services], including all agencies, have a longevity-positive view and probably agree with a lot of the ideas Vitalism stands for.” And he is hoping to help secure federal positions for others who are similarly aligned with his philosophy. On both Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve last year, Gries and Cheng sent fundraising emails describing an “outreach effort” to find applicants for six open government positions that, together, would control billions of dollars in federal funding. “Qualified, mission-aligned candidates we’d love to support do exist, but they need to be found and encouraged to apply,” the pair wrote in the second email. “We’re starting a systematic search to reach, screen, and support the best candidates.”

Hamalainen supports Gries’s plan to target high-leverage individuals. “You don’t have to convince the mainstream,” he says. Though “kind of a terrible example,” Hamalainen notes, Stalinism started small. “Sometimes you just have to convince the right people.”

One of the “right” people may be the man who inspired Gries, Hamalainen, Ives, Isman, and so many others to pursue longevity in the first place: de Grey. He’s now a paid-up Vitalist and even spoke at Vitalist Bay. Having been in the field for over 20 years, de Grey tells me, he’s seen various terms fall in and out of favor. Those terms now have “baggage that gets in the way,” he says. “Sometimes it’s useful to have a new term.”

Though one of the five principles of Vitalism is a promise to “carry the message,” some people who agree with its ideas are reluctant to go public, including some signed-up Vitalists. I’ve asked Gries multiple times over several years, but he won’t reveal how many Vitalists there are, let alone who makes up the membership.

Even some of the founders of Vitalism don’t want to be public about it. Around 30 people were involved in developing the movement, Gries says—but only 22 are named as contributors to the Vitalism white paper (with Gries as its author), including Cheng, Vitalia’s Ion, and ARPA-H’s Hamalainen. Gries won’t reveal the names of the others. He acknowledges that some people just don’t like to publicly affiliate with any organization. That’s certainly what I’ve found when I’ve asked members of the longevity community if they’re Vitalists. Many said they agreed with the Vitalist declaration, and that they liked and supported what Gries was doing. But they didn’t want the label.

Some people worry that associating with a belief system that sounds a bit religious—even cult-like, some say—won’t do the cause any favors. Others have a problem with the specific wording of the declaration.

For instance, Anzinger—the other Vitalia founder—won’t call himself a Vitalist. He says he respects the mission, but that the declaration is “a bit poetic” for his liking.

And Dylan Livingston, CEO of A4LI and arguably one of the most influential longevity enthusiasts out there, won’t describe himself as a Vitalist either.

Many other longevity biotech CEOs also shy away from the label—including Emil Kendziorra, who runs the human cryopreservation company Tomorrow Bio, even though that’s a certified Vitalist organization. Kendziorra says he agrees with most of the Vitalist declaration but thinks it is too “absolutist.” He also doesn’t want to imply that the pursuit of longevity should be positioned above war, hunger, and other humanitarian issues. (Gries has heard this argument before, and counters that both the vast spending on health care for people in the last years of their life and the use of lockdown strategies during the covid pandemic suggest that, deep down, lifespan extension is “society’s revealed preference.”)

Still, because Kendziorra agrees with almost everything in the declaration, he believes that “pushing it forward” and bringing more attention to the field by labeling his company a Vitalist organization is a good thing. “It’s to support other people who want to move the world in that direction,” he says. (He also offered Vitalist Bay attendees a discount on his cryopreservation services.)

“There’s a lot of closeted scientists working in our field, and they get really excited about lifespans increasing,” explains Ives of Shift Bioscience. “But you’ll get people who’ll accuse you of being a lunatic that wants to be immortal.” He claims that people who represent biotech companies tell him “all the time” that they are secretly longevity companies but avoid using the term because they don’t want funders or collaborators to be “put off.”

Ultimately, it may not really matter how much people adopt the Vitalist label as long as the ideas break through. “It’s pretty simple. [The Vitalist declaration] has five points—if you agree with the five points, you are a Vitalist,” says Hamalainen. “You don’t have to be public about it.” He says he’s spoken to others about “coming out of the closet” and that it’s been going pretty well.

Gries puts it more bluntly: “If you agree with the Vitalist declaration, you are a Vitalist.”

And he hints that there are now many people in powerful positions—including in the Trump administration—who share his views, even if they don’t openly identify as Vitalists.

For Gries, this includes Jim O’Neill, the deputy secretary of health and human services, whom I profiled a few months after he became Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s number two. (More recently, O’Neill was temporarily put in charge of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.)

O’Neill has long been interested in both longevity and the idea of creating new jurisdictions. Until March 2024, he served on the board of directors of Friedman’s Seasteading Institute. He also served as CEO of the SENS Research Foundation, a longevity organization founded by de Grey, between 2019 and 2021, and he represented Thiel as a board member there for many years. Many people in the longevity community say they know him personally, or have at least met him. (Tristan Roberts, a biohacker who used to work with a biotech company operating in Próspera, tells me he served O’Neill gin when he visited his Burning Man camp, which he describes as a “technology gay camp from San Francisco and New York.” Hamalainen also recalls meeting O’Neill at Burning Man, at a “techy, futurist” camp.) (Neither O’Neill nor representatives from the Department of Health and Human Services responded to a request to comment about this.)

O’Neill’s views are arguably becoming less fringe in DC these days. The day after the Vitalist Bay Summit, A4LI was hosting its own summit in the capital with the goal of “bringing together leaders, advocates, and innovators from around the globe to advance legislative initiatives that promote a healthier human lifespan.” I recognized lots of Vitalist Bay attendees there, albeit in more formal attire.

The DC event took place over three days in late April. The first two involved talks by longevity enthusiasts across the spectrum, including scientists, lawyers, and biotech CEOs. Vitalia’s Anzinger spoke about the success he’d had in Próspera, and ARPA-H’s Brack talked about work his agency was doing. (Hamalainen was also there, although he said he was not representing ARPA-H.)

But the third day was different and made me think Gries may be right about Vitalism’s growing reach. It began with a congressional briefing on Capitol Hill, during which Representative Gus Bilirakis, a Republican from Florida, asked, “Who doesn’t want to live longer, right?” As he explained, “Longevity science … directly aligns with the goals of the Make America Healthy Again movement.”

“There’s a lot of closeted scientists working in our field, and they get really excited about lifespans increasing,” says Daniel Ives of Shift Bioscience. “But you’ll get people who’ll accuse you of being a lunatic that wants to be immortal.”

Bilirakis and Representative Paul Tonko, a New York Democrat, were followed by Mehmet Oz, the former TV doctor who now leads the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; he opened with typical MAHA talking points about chronic disease and said US citizens have a “patriotic duty” to stay healthy to keep medical costs down. The audience was enthralled as Oz talked about senescent cells, the zombie-like aged cells that are thought to be responsible for some age-related damage to organs and tissues. (The offices of Bilirakis and Tonko did not respond to a request for comment; neither did the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.)

And while none of the speakers went anywhere near the concept of radical life extension, the Vitalists in the audience were suitably encouraged.

Gries is too: “It seems that now there is the most pro-longevity administration in American history.”

Whether or not Vitalism starts a revolution, it will almost always be controversial in some quarters. While believers see an auspicious future, others are far less certain of the benefits of a world designed to defeat death.

Gries and Cheng often make the case for deregulation in their presentations. But ethicists—and even some members of the longevity community—point out that this comes with risks. Some question whether it is ever ethical to sell a “treatment” without some idea of how likely it is to benefit the person buying and taking it. Enthusiasts counter with arguments about bodily autonomy. And they hope Montana is just the start.

Then there’s the bigger picture. Is it really that great not to die … ever? Some ethicists argue that for many cultures, death is what gives meaning to life.

Sergio Imparato, a moral philosopher and medical ethicist at Harvard University, believes that death itself has important moral meaning. We know our lives will end, and our actions have value precisely because our time is limited, he says. Imparato is concerned that Vitalists are ultimately seeking to change what it means to be human—a decision that should involve all members of society.

Alberto Giubilini, a philosopher at the University of Oxford, agrees. “Death is a defining feature of humanity,” he says. “Our psychology, our cultures, our rituals, our societies, are built around the idea of coping with death … it’s part of human nature.”

Imparato’s family is from Naples, Italy, where poor residents were once laid to rest in shared burial sites, with no headstones to identify them. He tells me how the locals came to visit, clean, and even “adopt” the skulls as family members. It became a weekly ritual for members of the community, including his grandmother, who was a young girl at the time. “It speaks to what I consider the cultural relevance of death,” he says. “It’s the perfect counterpoint to … the Vitalist conception of life.”

Gries seems aware of the stigma around such “immortality quests,” as Imparato calls them. In his presentations, Gries shares lists of words that Vitalists should try to avoid—like “eternity,” “radical,” and “forever,” as well as any religious terms.

He also appears to be dropping, at least publicly, the idea that Vitalism is a “moral” movement. Morality was “never part of the Vitalist declaration,” Gries told me in September. When I asked him why he had changed his position on this, he dismissed the question. “Our point … was always that death is humanity’s core problem, and aging its primary agent,” he told me. “So it was, and so it has continued, as it was foretold.”

But despite these attempts to tweak and control the narrative, Vitalism appears to be opening the door to an incredibly wide range of sentiments in longevity science. A decade ago, I don’t think there would have been any way that the views espoused by Gries, Anzinger, and others who support Vitalist sentiments would have been accepted by the scientific establishment. After all, these are people who publicly state they hope to live indefinitely and who have no training in the science of aging, and who are open about their aims to find ways to evade the restrictions set forth by regulatory agencies like the FDA—all factors that might have rendered them outcasts not that long ago.

But Gries and peers had success in Montana. Influential scientists and policymakers attend Vitalism events, and Vitalists are featured regularly at more mainstream longevity events. Last year’s Aging Research and Drug Discovery (ARDD) conference in Copenhagen—widely recognized as the most important meeting in aging science—was sponsored in part by Anzinger’s new Próspera venture, Infinita City, as well as by several organizations that are either certified Vitalist or led by Vitalists.

“I was thinking that maybe what I was doing was very fringe or out there,” Anzinger, the non-Vitalist supporter of Vitalism, admits. “But no—I feel … loads of support.”

There was certainly an air of optimism at the Vitalist Bay Summit in Berkeley. Gries’s positivity is infectious. “All the people who want a fun and awesome surprise gift, come on over!” he called out early on the first day. “Raise your voice if you’re excited!” The audience whooped in response. He then proceeded to tell everyone, Oprah Winfrey–style, that they were all getting a free continuous glucose monitor. “You get a CGM! You get a CGM!” Plenty of attendees actually attached them to their arms on the spot.

Every revolution has to start somewhere, right?

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">G2, the Chicago-based software insights platform, agreed today to acquire three prominent software review and discovery properties from Gartner: Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp.

The deal brings four of the largest B2B review sites under a single roof and signals a shift toward unified, AI-driven software recommendation and buying experiences.

According to the announcement, the combined business will include roughly six million verified customer reviews and tap into an audience of more than 200 million annual software buyers. G2 said it expects the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2026, subject to standard regulatory and closing conditions.

G2’s leadership frames the agreement as a response to fragmentation in the software buying journey. By consolidating multiple review databases and audiences, the company aims to streamline discovery for buyers and expand demand-generation tools for vendors.

In a public post, G2’s CEO described the integration as building “the trusted data foundation for B2B software in the age of AI,” with deeper buyer intent signals and a more consistent taxonomy across categories.

For buyers, the enlarged platform promises easier access to user-verified feedback and faster decision cycles. For software vendors, the unified dataset could translate into broader visibility and enhanced market insights.

G2’s roadmap includes tighter AI integration across search and recommendation workflows.

Gartner, which currently owns Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp, has held these properties for years as part of its digital markets portfolio.

This divestiture appears to reflect a strategic choice to focus its core research and advisory business while enabling specialized review platforms to evolve under a dedicated marketplace operator.

As the software market continues to expand, the consolidation of review infrastructure under G2 could reshape how products are evaluated and purchased.

The market will watch closely for how the combined entity leverages its scale to influence search visibility and buyer influence metrics in 2026 and beyond.

            <div id="article-text">AI adoption is creating a clear divide among employees. Some see AI as a tool to increase their impact, while others see it as a threat to their role. So, where does the truth lie between these two mindsets? Let’s explore.

Over the past two years, we’ve seen a wave of layoffs often attributed to “AI replacing humans.” Among widely discussed cases, IBM openly stated that over 7,000 back-office roles may no longer need to be hired because AI can absorb the work. Many other tech players, including Microsoft, Amazon, and HP, have cut between 6,000 and 200,000 employees as a shift toward AI-driven initiatives.

Meanwhile, beware: many might make misleading conclusions. They are often treated as straightforward examples of AI replacing human labor, when in reality they reflect a deeper restructuring of how value is created inside organizations.

Taking a closer look, it becomes evident that in many examples like these, people weren’t displaced because AI was smarter or outperformed people.

They were displaced because one (or more) of the following reasons:

From this perspective, it becomes evident: AI isn’t coming for roles, it’s here to remove low-leverage work. Roles that exist mainly to handle volume or work around broken systems no longer make sense once those problems disappear.

This is already playing out across teams. For example:

As AI reduces friction and automates workflows, organizations and employees are increasingly forced to ask these two questions: 1) where real value is created, 2) where human input is essential in areas AI cannot handle. Teams that explore and embrace this shift early will be better positioned to adapt as AI continues to compress the cost and effort of execution.

An overlooked but highly efficient aspect many businesses miss: AI introduces a level of transparency most organizations have never had before. This visibility changes how organizations make decisions and how they manage business resources.
In particular, AI-powered spend analysis is set to become one of the most transformative forces inside companies.

Ultimately, the level of business success is largely determined by the ability to turn spend data into an operational signal. When, instead of tracking costs in isolation, organizations clearly see how spend translates into productivity and revenue, that’s where real differentiation begins.

Smart spend management platforms like this already exist, take Spendbase, for example. In this case, AI can be the next layer that unlocks even deeper insights.

ROI and cost efficiency are at the very center of any business. Therefore, as AI increases transparency into multiple business areas (performance, time, spend, etc.), work that cannot be clearly tied to outcomes loses its footing. Hence, roles that fail to translate their work into clear outcomes risk being deprioritized.

As AI automates execution, the people and teams that remain essential are those who can clearly explain how their work impacts the business in ways AI cannot. Such as:

Apart from this, another important area of impact lies in organizational and customer-facing work, where human-driven value is created from responsibilities focused on aligning teams, resolving complexity, building trust, and, particularly, innovating.

Imagine a product team competing in a crowded market or where competitors are continuously copying each other. In this case, AI can meticulously handle research and benchmarking: analyze competitor offerings, user behavior, reviews, and market gaps.

It can even generate predictions or simulate feature adoption. However, it takes human vision and accountability to challenge assumptions and find unpaved paths for growth.

When it comes to creating something inherently new, with no existing market equivalent, AI may fall short at innovation. Yet these are often the areas where the greatest business impact lies.

In most organizations, changes revolving AI adoption won’t happen overnight. Roles will gradually shrink, shift, and eventually be redefined. As a result, human contributions that can’t be tied to measurable outcomes quietly lose relevance.

            <div id="article-text">The way people discover information online is quietly but fundamentally changing.

Instead of scrolling through links and choosing which article to open, users are increasingly asking large language models to answer directly. Tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity don’t send people browsing; they synthesise information from multiple sources and deliver a ready-made response inside the interface.

For brands and publishers, this creates a new problem: what does visibility mean when nobody clicks anymore?

For years, search optimization revolved around a familiar feedback loop: publish content, earn rankings, drive clicks, measure performance. Traffic, impressions, and engagement acted as proxies for relevance and influence. AI-generated answers disrupt that loop entirely.

This isn’t a temporary fluctuation in search behaviour. It’s a structural shift in how information is consumed.

Large language models do not simply index the web like classic search engines. Their response generation involves a combination of training data, real-time search, and internal reasoning. As shown in analyses comparing Perplexity and ChatGPT, these systems search the web differently even when responding to the same questions.

ChatGPT tends to issue longer, context-rich queries to build an explanation, whereas Perplexity formulates shorter, list-like queries focused on freshness and comparison.

This means visibility isn’t universal across models; a topic that surfaces in one LLM is not guaranteed to surface in another.

If clicks are no longer the primary signal, content strategies must adapt. Instead of optimizing only for human users and search engine algorithms:

Content intended for modern AI discovery needs both depth and freshness: explanations that support contextual reasoning (favoured by ChatGPT-style behaviour) and concise, signal-rich sections (favoured by Perplexity-style behaviour). This duality underscores the complexity of AI brand visibility.

Publishers and marketers have few tools to assess whether their pages are actually being consulted by AI agents. Traditional analytics platforms report pageviews, but:

This lack of transparency means that even high-quality content may go unnoticed in AI answers, not because it is irrelevant, but because it does not match the specific patterns an LLM uses when selecting sources.

Recognising the need for a new feedback loop, solutions are emerging that approach this problem from an engineering perspective rather than purely a marketing one. For instance, Genezio has analysed how ChatGPT and Perplexity prioritise sources and generate their search behaviours, revealing that the same topic leads to substantially different retrieval patterns across systems and therefore different visibility outcomes.

Rather than treating AI visibility as a black box, these approaches:

By observing how AI systems behave at scale, marketers can begin to measure brand visibility in conversations rather than clicks, transforming raw engineering data into actionable insight.

AI-generated answers are rapidly reshaping how information is found, processed, and presented. In this new environment, visibility is not just about ranking formulas or organic traffic; it’s about earning a place in the narrative that LLMs generate.

The brands that succeed will be those that understand not only how to produce quality content, but also how to make it legible and extractable to systems that never lead users back to a webpage.

Measuring visibility without clicks may seem intangible today, but as AI becomes central to how people seek answers, it will soon become standard practice.

            <h2>Bonjour Visio: France turns digital sovereignty into policy</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-28</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a bold turn of phrase and deed, Paris has quietly told Silicon Valley “au revoir.”  On January 26, 2026, France’s Ministry of Finance announced that by 2027, all public servants will switch from U.S. video apps like Microsoft Teams and Zoom to a homegrown platform called Visio.

No more license renewals for Teams, Zoom, Webex, or Meet, just one unified, French-built solution.

In one stroke, a long-discussed slogan “digital sovereignty” has leapt off the podium and into practice. This is not a press release; it’s a watershed moment: Europe’s second-biggest economy is wagering that, when it comes to critical infrastructure, it’s time to govern itself.

“Digital sovereignty” has become the EU’s new watchword, a declaration of independence from foreign tech hegemons. Over the past few years, it has surged from a niche policy to a headline priority, as EU leaders from Ursula von der Leyen to Emmanuel Macron have warned that Europe must control its own networks and data.

The phrase sounds grand, but what changed now is urgency. Americans’ own laws make the risks concrete: under the U.S. CLOUD Act, for example, U.S. authorities can demand data from any American platform, regardless of where it’s stored.

In practice, “jurisdiction follows ownership,” as one analyst noted: even data sitting on a Frankfurt server can be swept up by U.S. warrants if the service provider is American.

Edward Snowden’s revelations and murky court orders have long haunted Europe with the idea that a virtual meeting might be spied on from overseas. Now, with geopolitics in flux, U.S. political turns and global crises, that theoretical risk seems all too real.

The push has taken many forms. The EU has drafted cloud-certification rules demanding “sovereignty” guarantees and drafted data laws to keep Europeans’ information in Europe.

Member states debate mandating local clouds. Digital sovereignty has moved from virtue-signaling to something harder, actual infrastructure.

France’s pivot is concrete and wide-ranging. Visio, developed by the government’s interministerial digital agency (DINUM), has been tested for about a year with some 40,000 regular users. It’s already being adopted piecemeal: CNRS (France’s national research center) will replace all its 34,000 Zoom seats by March 2026, covering 120,000 associated researchers.

By early 2026, the Defense Ministry, finance tax offices, health insurance, and other big agencies will be on Visio. The government now says every state department will use Visio as the default video tool by 2027, after which external conferencing licenses simply won’t be renewed.

The official rationale is familiar: a patchwork of Teams, Zoom, Webex, and friends “fragilises security” and creates hidden costs, dependencies, and interoperability headaches.

Visio is billed as a solution under full French control: it’s hosted on a certified “SecNumCloud” by Dassault-owned Outscale, built with ANSSI (France’s cyber agency) oversight, and even uses French AI for meeting transcription and captions.

The aim, in the minister’s words, is to “end the use of non-European solutions and guarantee the security and confidentiality of public electronic communications by relying on a powerful…sovereign tool”.

In short: no more data flying through American servers or falling under foreign laws.

There are financial perks, too. Officials point out that ditching pricey Teams and Zoom licenses will save money: roughly €1 million per year for every 100,000 users who shift off commercial tools. That’s not pocket change, even if it’s a rounding error in a €600 billion budget. In any case, for France, this isn’t just about cost – it’s about control.

Taken together, these facts show a very concrete policy timeline. In one meeting on Jan. 26, the state literally put a deadline on dependence: four years to shift the ENTIRE civil service. It’s one thing to talk about sovereignty in Brussels speeches, quite another to swap out the nation’s video chat app.

France isn’t alone in flirting with this idea, but it’s the first to bet big. Other EU countries are eyeballing similar moves. In Denmark, parts of the public sector have already announced plans to phase out Microsoft’s software.

In Germany, the state of Schleswig-Holstein recently ditched Microsoft Office in favor of open-source alternatives. Even non-state bodies are joining the sovereignty club: the International Criminal Court said it will move its systems to a German-developed open-source platform (OpenDesk).

These are baby steps compared to France’s all-hands policy, but they reflect a shared unease about over-reliance on foreign tech.

Europe is also wrestling with headline-grabbing hiccups like last year’s massive cloud outages in the U.S., which left public agencies scrambling. The Visio announcement itself notes that Europe’s “overreliance on U.S. IT infrastructure” has been questioned after those failures.

And there are EU-wide initiatives underway, from the Gaia-X cloud alliance to tougher data localization rules – aimed at seeding local alternatives.

If France makes Visio work, it could serve as a proof of concept for others. Will a homegrown tool really run government communications smoothly? If yes, it might embolden policymakers in Brussels or Rome to push harder on local platforms. If not, it could slow the momentum.

For now, France’s move is a beacon: it shows that digital sovereignty can move beyond talk. Other nations will watch closely.

No one seriously argues that keeping calls on Visio will magically end world unrest. Rather, this is a narrow, technical solution to a policy problem. On the other side, France will indeed have tighter control: all servers, encryption keys, and software updates are now under French (and EU) jurisdiction.

Public-sector IT teams can audit code, set security parameters, and avoid nasty surprises (say, a foreign court order) without jumping through transatlantic hoops.

Data stays where the politicians say it stays.

But what might be lost? For one, user experience and innovation often depend on scale. Big Tech’s video platforms have oceans of R&D behind them, from instant translation to seamless device-hopping, and millions of users giving feedback.

A new platform built from scratch may not match Teams’ polish or Zoom’s ubiquity overnight. (The French have even admitted an irony: naming it “Visio” risks confusion with Microsoft Visio, the longtime diagram app, hinting that branding and polish sometimes play second fiddle to strategy.)

There’s also the question of interoperability: how well will Visio meetings work when French officials Zoom into a partner country’s conference, or vice versa? Will France demand that foreign delegations install its app, or allow links to other networks? The devil is in the details.

Some critics fret that an insular approach could fragment standards. One EU paper urges that sovereignty shouldn’t mean isolation but rather a robust, open ecosystem.

If every country builds its own siloed cloud and chat service, the Internet risks reinventing wheels (and reinventing firewalls) in every member state. Of course, Visio is only for civil servants, not a consumer product, yet it sets a precedent.

On the other hand, an expertly executed French stack could jumpstart a continental open-source community or spur startups to plug gaps. It’s a calculated gamble: France assumes that on net, its security and strategic stakes outweigh any shortfall in bells and whistles.

For its part, France says this isn’t a bare-bones trade-off. Officials emphasize Visio will include modern features: speaker separation, AI for transcripts, captions, etc. The goal is “not [a] minimalist replacement,” but a full-featured tool under domestic control.

In other words, they aim for the best of both worlds, though acknowledging it’s a tall order.

In its own softly decisive way, France’s Visio plan signals a definitive shift: digital sovereignty is no longer a future wish or empty catchphrase, but a deadline-driven program.

Europe has debated “strategic autonomy” for years; this is the first major state-level bet, with clear timelines and budget line savings. From the perspective of a tech editor watching policy trends, it’s heartening to see ambition meet action.

Will it pay off? If Visio runs smoothly, France will score a coup: more secure chats, money saved, and perhaps the bragging rights of a proof of concept. If glitches persist, France’s analysts may ask if the Q1 rollout to 200,000 civil servants is biting off too much too soon.

Either way, the move puts stakes on the table. Digital sovereignty has many meanings, but here it means doing something concrete, even if it means saying “non” to familiar tools.

In the end, it’s a balancing act. Europe gains control of what it might risk in convenience. France has just turned insurance talk into policy practice. Other countries will now watch and learn: Visio is not just a video app; it’s France’s case study in what digital independence can actually look like.
