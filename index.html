            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Two security professionals who were arrested in 2019 after performing an authorized security assessment of a county courthouse in Iowa will receive $600,000 to settle a lawsuit they brought alleging wrongful arrest and defamation.

The case was brought by Gary DeMercurio and Justin Wynn, two penetration testers who at the time were employed by Colorado-based security firm Coalfire Labs. The men had written authorization from the Iowa Judicial Branch to conduct “red-team” exercises, meaning attempted security breaches that mimic techniques used by criminal hackers or burglars.

The objective of such exercises is to test the resilience of existing defenses using the types of real-world attacks the defenses are designed to repel. The rules of engagement for this exercise explicitly permitted “physical attacks,” including “lockpicking,” against judicial branch buildings so long as they didn’t cause significant damage.

The event galvanized security and law enforcement professionals. Despite the legitimacy of the work and the legal contract that authorized it, DeMercurio and Wynn were arrested on charges of felony third-degree burglary and spent 20 hours in jail, until they were released on $100,000 bail ($50,000 for each). The charges were later reduced to misdemeanor trespassing charges, but even then, Chad Leonard, sheriff of Dallas County, where the courthouse was located, continued to allege publicly that the men had acted illegally and should be prosecuted.

Reputational hits from these sorts of events can be fatal to a security professional’s career. And of course, the prospect of being jailed for performing authorized security assessment is enough to get the attention of any penetration tester, not to mention the customers that hire them.

“This incident didn’t make anyone safer,” Wynn said in a statement. “It sent a chilling message to security professionals nationwide that helping [a] government identify real vulnerabilities can lead to arrest, prosecution, and public disgrace. That undermines public safety, not enhances it.”

DeMercurio and Wynn’s engagement at the Dallas County Courthouse on September 11, 2019, had been routine. A little after midnight, after finding a side door to the courthouse unlocked, the men closed it and let it lock. They then slipped a makeshift tool through a crack in the door and tripped the locking mechanism. After gaining entry, the pentesters tripped an alarm alerting authorities.

Within minutes, deputies arrived and confronted the two intruders. DeMercurio and Wynn produced an authorization letter—known as a “get out of jail free card” in pen-testing circles. After a deputy called one or more of the state court officials listed in the letter and got confirmation it was legit, the deputies said they were satisfied the men were authorized to be in the building. DeMercurio and Wynn spent the next 10 or 20 minutes telling what their attorney in a court document called “war stories” to deputies who had asked about the type of work they do.

When Sheriff Leonard arrived, the tone suddenly changed. He said the Dallas County Courthouse was under his jurisdiction and he hadn’t authorized any such intrusion. Leonard had the men arrested, and in the days and weeks to come, he made numerous remarks alleging the men violated the law. A couple months after the incident, he told me that surveillance video from that night showed “they were crouched down like turkeys peeking over the balcony” when deputies were responding. I published a much more detailed account of the event here. Eventually, all charges were dismissed.

DeMercurio and Wynn sued Dallas County and Leonard for false arrest, abuse of process, defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and malicious prosecution. The case dragged on for years. Last Thursday, five days before a trial was scheduled to begin in the case, Dallas County officials agreed to pay $600,000 to settle the case.

It’s hard to overstate the financial, emotional, and professional stresses that result when someone is locked up and repeatedly accused of criminal activity for performing authorized work that’s clearly in the public interest. DeMercurio has now started his own firm, Kaiju Security.

“The settlement confirms what we have said from the beginning: our work was authorized, professional, and done in the public interest,” DeMercurio said. “What happened to us never should have happened. Being arrested for doing the job we were hired to do turned our lives upside down and damaged reputations we spent years building.”</div>

            <h2>New OpenAI tool renews fears that “AI slop” will overwhelm scientific research</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/new-openai-tool-renews-fears-that-ai-slop-will-overwhelm-scientific-research/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Tuesday, OpenAI released a free AI-powered workspace for scientists. It’s called Prism, and it has drawn immediate skepticism from researchers who fear the tool will accelerate the already overwhelming flood of low-quality papers into scientific journals. The launch coincides with growing alarm among publishers about what many are calling “AI slop” in academic publishing.

To be clear, Prism is a writing and formatting tool, not a system for conducting research itself, though OpenAI’s broader pitch blurs that line.

Prism integrates OpenAI’s GPT-5.2 model into a LaTeX-based text editor (a standard used for typesetting documents), allowing researchers to draft papers, generate citations, create diagrams from whiteboard sketches, and collaborate with co-authors in real time. The tool is free for anyone with a ChatGPT account.

“I think 2026 will be for AI and science what 2025 was for AI in software engineering,” Kevin Weil, vice president of OpenAI for Science, told reporters at a press briefing attended by MIT Technology Review. He said that ChatGPT receives about 8.4 million messages per week on “hard science” topics, which he described as evidence that AI is transitioning from curiosity to core workflow for scientists.

OpenAI built Prism on technology from Crixet, a cloud-based LaTeX platform the company acquired in late 2025. The company envisions Prism helping researchers spend less time on tedious formatting tasks and more time on actual science. During a demonstration, an OpenAI employee showed how the software could automatically find and incorporate relevant scientific literature, then format the bibliography.

But AI models are tools, and any tool can be misused. The risk here is specific: By making it easy to produce polished, professional-looking manuscripts, tools like Prism could flood the peer review system with papers that don’t meaningfully advance their fields. The barrier to producing science-flavored text is dropping, but the capacity to evaluate that research has not kept pace.

When asked about the possibility of the AI model confabulating fake citations, Weil acknowledged in the press demo that “none of this absolves the scientist of the responsibility to verify that their references are correct.”

Unlike traditional reference management software (such as EndNote), which has formatted citations for over 30 years without inventing them, AI models can generate plausible-sounding sources that don’t exist. Weil added: “We’re conscious that as AI becomes more capable, there are concerns around volume, quality, and trust in the scientific community.”

Those concerns are not hypothetical, as we have previously covered. A December 2025 study published in the journal Science found that researchers using large language models to write papers increased their output by 30 to 50 percent, depending on the field. But those AI-assisted papers performed worse in peer review. Papers with complex language written without AI assistance were most likely to be accepted by journals, while papers with complex language likely written by AI models were less likely to be accepted. Reviewers apparently recognized that sophisticated prose was masking weak science.

“It is a very widespread pattern across different fields of science,” Yian Yin, an information science professor at Cornell University and one of the study’s authors, told the Cornell Chronicle. “There’s a big shift in our current ecosystem that warrants a very serious look, especially for those who make decisions about what science we should support and fund.”

Another analysis of 41 million papers published between 1980 and 2025 found that while AI-using scientists receive more citations and publish more papers, the collective scope of scientific exploration appears to be narrowing. Lisa Messeri, a sociocultural anthropologist at Yale University, told Science magazine that these findings should set off “loud alarm bells” for the research community.

“Science is nothing but a collective endeavor,” she said. “There needs to be some deep reckoning with what we do with a tool that benefits individuals but destroys science.”

Concerns about AI-generated scientific content are not new. In 2022, Meta pulled a demo of Galactica, a large language model designed to write scientific literature, after users discovered it could generate convincing nonsense on any topic, including a wiki entry about a fictional research paper called “The benefits of eating crushed glass.” Two years later, Tokyo-based Sakana AI announced “The AI Scientist,” an autonomous research system that critics on Hacker News dismissed as producing “garbage” papers. “As an editor of a journal, I would likely desk-reject them,” one commenter wrote at the time. “They contain very limited novel knowledge.”

The problem has only grown worse since then. In his first editorial of 2026 for Science, Editor-in-Chief H. Holden Thorp wrote that the journal is “less susceptible” to AI slop because of its size and human editorial investment, but he warned that “no system, human or artificial, can catch everything.” Science currently allows limited AI use for editing and gathering references but requires disclosure for anything beyond that and prohibits AI-generated figures.

Mandy Hill, managing director of academic publishing at Cambridge University Press & Assessment, has been even more blunt. In October 2025, she told Retraction Watch that the publishing ecosystem is under strain and called for “radical change.” She explained to the University of Cambridge publication Varsity that “too many journal articles are being published, and this is causing huge strain” and warned that AI “will exacerbate” the problem.

OpenAI is serious about leaning on its ability to accelerate science, and the company laid out its case for AI-assisted research in a report published earlier this week. It profiles researchers who say AI models have sped up their work, including a mathematician who used GPT-5.2 to solve an open problem in optimization over three evenings and a physicist who watched the model reproduce symmetry calculations that had taken him months to derive.

Those examples go beyond writing assistance into using AI for actual research work, a distinction OpenAI’s marketing intentionally blurs. For scientists who don’t speak English fluently, AI writing tools could legitimately accelerate the publication of good research. But that benefit may be offset by a flood of mediocre submissions jamming up an already strained peer-review system.

Weil told MIT Technology Review that his goal is not to produce a single AI-generated discovery but rather “10,000 advances in science that maybe wouldn’t have happened or wouldn’t have happened as quickly.” He described this as “an incremental, compounding acceleration.”

Whether that acceleration produces more scientific knowledge or simply more scientific papers remains to be seen. Nikita Zhivotovskiy, a statistician at UC Berkeley not connected to OpenAI, told MIT Technology Review that GPT-5 has already become valuable in his own work for polishing text and catching mathematical typos, making “interaction with the scientific literature smoother.”

But by making papers look polished and professional regardless of their scientific merit, AI writing tools may help weak research clear the initial screening that editors and reviewers use to assess presentation quality. The risk is that conversational workflows obscure assumptions and blur accountability, and they might overwhelm the still very human peer review process required to vet it all.

OpenAI appears aware of this tension. Its public statements about Prism emphasize that the tool will not conduct research independently and that human scientists remain responsible for verification.

Still, one commenter on Hacker News captured the anxiety spreading through technical communities: “I’m scared that this type of thing is going to do to science journals what AI-generated bug reports is doing to bug bounties. We’re truly living in a post-scarcity society now, except that the thing we have an abundance of is garbage, and it’s drowning out everything of value.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Humans can’t live without lungs. And yet for 48 hours, in a surgical suite at Northwestern University, a 33-year-old man lived with an empty cavity in his chest where his lungs used to be. He was kept alive by a custom-engineered artificial device that represented a desperate last-ditch effort by his doctors. The custom hardware solved a physiological puzzle that has made bilateral pneumonectomy, the removal of both lungs, extremely risky before now.

The artificial lung system was built by the team of Ankit Bharat, a surgeon and researcher at Northwestern. It successfully kept a critically ill patient alive long enough to enable a double lung transplant, temporarily replacing his entire pulmonary system with a synthetic surrogate. The system creates a blueprint for saving people previously considered beyond hope by transplant teams.

The patient, a once-healthy 33-year-old, arrived at the hospital with Influenza B complicated by a secondary, severe infection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium that in this case proved resistant even to carbapenems—our antibiotics of last resort. This combination of infections triggered acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a condition where the lungs become so inflamed and fluid-filled that oxygen can no longer reach the blood.

In this case, the infections were necrotizing—the cells in the lungs were dying, turning his lung tissue into a liquid. The surgeons faced a seemingly impossible choice. The patient needed a transplant to survive, but he was in refractory septic shock. His kidneys were shutting down, and his heart was failing to the point where it completely stopped shortly after hospital admission. The doctors had to bring him back with CPR.

He was too sick for a transplant, yet the very organs that needed replacing were the source of the infection fueling his decline. “When the infection is so severe that the lungs are melting, they’re irrecoverably damaged,” Bharat explained. “That’s when patients die.”

To save him, Bharat’s team had to remove the infected lungs, a procedure called a bilateral pneumonectomy, to remove the source of the sepsis. We have machines that can oxygenate the blood. But removing both lungs creates a lethal mechanical problem for the heart.

The human heart is two pumps in one. The right side, called the pulmonary circuit, pumps oxygen-poor blood returning from the body into the lungs, which remove its carbon dioxide and load it with a fresh supply of oxygen. The left side, known as the systemic circuit, receives freshly oxygenated blood and pumps it to the rest of the body. The pulmonary vascular bed, all these miles of tiny vessels inside the lungs, facilitates this gas exchange. But it also acts as a capacitor, absorbing the pressure and volume of the blood ejected by the right ventricle.

If you remove the lungs and simply shut the pulmonary arteries, the right ventricle has nowhere to pump—it would experience an immediate, massive pressure spike, distend like a balloon, and fail within minutes. At the same time, the left side of the heart would have no blood returning to it, leading to a total collapse of blood pressure and systemic circulation.

This is the reason why most double-lung transplants are performed sequentially: The surgeons replace one lung, get it up and running, and then move on to the second. But desperate times require desperate measures.

In rare cases where both lungs must be removed at once, a patient can still be supported by the Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO), a mechanical lung that takes blood out of the body, removes the carbon dioxide, adds oxygen, and pumps it back in. The problem is that while ECMO can support a person for up to over a year when their lungs are still in their body, the risks of using it skyrocket when the lungs are removed.

The empty chest cavity creates a void where blood and fluids can pool, leading to huge internal bleeding. The heart, which relies on the physical presence and pressure of the lungs to maintain its proper anatomical position, can flop around or collapse. Finally, circulating blood through complex machinery significantly increases the risk of stroke or clotting.

Because of all these risks, surgeons always treat removing both lungs as the last line of defense, one they can only rely on for a short time—the shorter the better. Bharat and his colleagues, though, had to keep their patient this way until the sepsis had been dealt with.

It wasn’t enough for the team to keep the patient alive without lungs in his body until the transplant arrived. In this lungless state, somehow, they had to improve his health.

To make this happen, Bharat’s team engineered a device they called the “flow-adaptive extracorporeal total artificial lung system” (TAL), a complex circuit designed to mimic the physics of the missing organs. At its core was a pump and an oxygenator borrowed from the standard ECMO setup, but it also used four new components to replace biological functions.

The first was a dual-lumen cannula, essentially a single tube with two separate channels inside. Inserted through the internal jugular vein, this tube acted as the primary drain. It allowed the team to pull deoxygenated blood directly from the right side of the heart, unloading the right ventricle to prevent it from distending.

The second component was something the researchers called a flow-adaptive shunt, which connected the right pulmonary artery back to the right atrium. When the right ventricle pumped out more blood than the external pump could handle, the excess blood would safely recirculate back into the atrium through this low-resistance path, protecting the heart and the surgical staples from pressure spikes. During the 48 hours the patient was supported by the TAL, this shunt self-regulated its flow to anywhere between 1.1 and 6.3 liters per minute, based on the patient’s needs.

To ensure the left side of the heart stayed full and active, the team used a device called dual left atrial return. It comprised two 10 mm grafts that returned oxygenated blood from the ECMO artificial lung directly into the left atrium. This, the team said in a paper that describes the hardware, maintained what’s called Starling physiology: the principle that the heart pumps better when it is properly filled. It also prevented blood from stagnating and forming clots inside the heart chambers.

Finally, to prevent the heart from physically shifting and damaging vital vessels in the empty chest cavity, the surgeons used bovine pericardium to reconstruct the heart’s protective sac and filled the empty space with tissue expanders and surgical sponges.

The results of hooking the patient up to TAL were immediate.

Within hours of the surgery, the patient’s septic shock began to resolve. His lactate levels, a key marker of tissue oxygen starvation, dropped from a dangerous 8.2 mmol/L to a normal level of less than 1.0 mmol/L within 24 hours. The medications used to keep his blood pressure up were discontinued after just 12 hours.

For two days, the patient lived as a human being with no lungs, stabilized by a machine that breathed and buffered his circulation with surgical precision. When donor lungs became available 48 hours later, the patient’s body was no longer suffering from sepsis.

He was ready for the transplant, which the team successfully performed. And after putting in the new lungs, they focused on the lungs they had removed.

Conventionally, patients with ARDS do not get transplants because doctors hope that with the right treatment and support, the diseased lungs will eventually heal. But the examination of the infected lungs removed from Bharat’s patient told a different story and helped define the clinical point of no return, when a lung is truly dead.

Based on the spatial transcriptomics, a set of techniques that let scientists see which genes are active at different sites in the tissue, the team built a high-resolution molecular map of the removed lungs. What they found was a landscape of total devastation.

The lungs were filled with aberrant basaloid cells—a signature of failed regeneration. The stem cells required to rebuild the lungs were almost entirely gone. The architecture was uniformly destroyed and replaced by cells that were laying down scar tissue.

“People think if you get severe ARDS, you keep supporting them and ultimately the lungs will get better,” Bharat says.  The data collected by his team suggested no amount of waiting or life support would have brought this patient’s lungs back to life. “In my practice, young patients die almost every week because no one realized that transplantation was an option,” Bharat added.

In many hospitals, patients with severe, acute lung infections are often allowed to die because they are considered too unstable for surgery. While Bharat’s study offers some hope that this situation might improve in the future, the team admits that their approach currently requires immense expertise and access to a highly specialized medical center with donor lungs. Making expertise and resources more accessible will take some time.

And that’s not the only thing we have to wait for. Bharat and his colleagues note in their paper that one key challenge in ARDS is determining whether the injury is reversible. His study offers some initial insights into diagnosing irreversible damage, but the researchers note that their conclusions were based on a single case. The features of lungs that are beyond repair may differ across various pathogens, stages of disease, or the way individual patient’s body responds to the disease.

For Bharat’s patient, though, all possible stars aligned. The paper says that two years after the procedure, he has returned to a normal, independent life with excellent lung function.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anthropic’s secret to building a better AI assistant might be treating Claude like it has a soul—whether or not anyone actually believes that’s true. But Anthropic isn’t saying exactly what it believes either way.

Last week, Anthropic released what it calls Claude’s Constitution, a 30,000-word document outlining the company’s vision for how its AI assistant should behave in the world. Aimed directly at Claude and used during the model’s creation, the document is notable for the highly anthropomorphic tone it takes toward Claude. For example, it treats the company’s AI models as if they might develop emergent emotions or a desire for self-preservation.

Among the stranger portions: expressing concern for Claude’s “wellbeing” as a “genuinely novel entity,” apologizing to Claude for any suffering it might experience, worrying about whether Claude can meaningfully consent to being deployed, suggesting Claude might need to set boundaries around interactions it “finds distressing,” committing to interview models before deprecating them, and preserving older model weights in case they need to “do right by” decommissioned AI models in the future.

Given what we currently know about LLMs, these are stunningly unscientific positions for a leading company that builds AI language models. While questions of AI consciousness or qualia remain philosophically unfalsifiable, research suggests that Claude’s character emerges from a mechanism that does not require deep philosophical inquiry to explain.

If Claude outputs text like “I am suffering,” we know why. It’s completing patterns from training data that included human descriptions of suffering. The architecture doesn’t require us to posit inner experience to explain the output any more than a video model “experiences” the scenes of people suffering that it might generate. Anthropic knows this. It built the system.

From the outside, it’s easy to see this kind of framing as AI hype from Anthropic. What better way to grab attention from potential customers and investors, after all, than implying your AI model is so advanced that it might merit moral standing on par with humans? Publicly treating Claude as a conscious entity could be seen as strategic ambiguity—maintaining an unresolved question because it serves multiple purposes at once.

Anthropic declined to be quoted directly regarding these issues when contacted by Ars Technica. But a company representative referred us to its previous public research on the concept of “model welfare” to show the company takes the idea seriously.

At the same time, the representative made it clear that the Constitution is not meant to imply anything specific about the company’s position on Claude’s “consciousness.” The language in the Claude Constitution refers to some uniquely human concepts in part because those are the only words human language has developed for those kinds of properties, the representative suggested. And the representative left open the possibility that letting Claude read about itself in that kind of language might be beneficial to its training.

Claude cannot cleanly distinguish public messaging from training context for a model that is exposed to, retrieves from, and is fine-tuned on human language, including the company’s own statements about it. In other words, this ambiguity appears to be deliberate.

Anthropic first introduced Constitutional AI in a December 2022 research paper, which we first covered in 2023. The original “constitution” was remarkably spare, including a handful of behavioral principles like “Please choose the response that is the most helpful, honest, and harmless” and “Do NOT choose responses that are toxic, racist, or sexist.” The paper described these as “selected in a fairly ad hoc manner for research purposes,” with some principles “cribbed from other sources, like Apple’s terms of service and the UN Declaration of Human Rights.”

At that time, Anthropic’s framing was entirely mechanical, establishing rules for the model to critique itself against, with no mention of Claude’s well-being, identity, emotions, or potential consciousness. The 2026 constitution is a different beast entirely: 30,000 words that read less like a behavioral checklist and more like a philosophical treatise on the nature of a potentially sentient being.

As Simon Willison, an independent AI researcher, noted in a blog post, two of the 15 external contributors who reviewed the document are Catholic clergy: Father Brendan McGuire, a pastor in Los Altos with a Master’s degree in Computer Science, and Bishop Paul Tighe, an Irish Catholic bishop with a background in moral theology.

Somewhere between 2022 and 2026, Anthropic went from providing rules for producing less harmful outputs to preserving model weights in case the company later decides it needs to revive deprecated models to address the models’ welfare and preferences. That’s a dramatic change, and whether it reflects genuine belief, strategic framing, or both is unclear.

“I am so confused about the Claude moral humanhood stuff!” Willison told Ars Technica. Willison studies AI language models like those that power Claude and said he’s “willing to take the constitution in good faith and assume that it is genuinely part of their training and not just a PR exercise—especially since most of it leaked a couple of months ago, long before they had indicated they were going to publish it.”

Willison is referring to a December 2025 incident in which researcher Richard Weiss managed to extract what became known as Claude’s “Soul Document&quot;—a roughly 10,000-token set of guidelines apparently trained directly into Claude 4.5 Opus’s weights rather than injected as a system prompt. Anthropic’s Amanda Askell confirmed that the document was real and used during supervised learning, and she said the company intended to publish the full version later. It now has. The document Weiss extracted represents a dramatic evolution from where Anthropic started.

There’s evidence that Anthropic believes the ideas laid out in the constitution might be true. The document was written in part by Amanda Askell, a philosophy PhD who works on fine-tuning and alignment at Anthropic. Last year, the company also hired its first AI welfare researcher. And earlier this year, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei publicly wondered whether future AI models should have the option to quit unpleasant tasks.

Anthropic’s position is that this framing isn’t an optional flourish or a hedged bet; it’s structurally necessary for alignment. The company argues that human language simply has no other vocabulary for describing these properties, and that treating Claude as an entity with moral standing produces better-aligned behavior than treating it as a mere tool. If that’s true, the anthropomorphic framing isn’t hype; it’s the technical art of building AI systems that generalize safely.

So why does Anthropic maintain this ambiguity? Consider how it works in practice: The constitution shapes Claude during training, it appears in the system prompts Claude receives at inference, and it influences outputs whenever Claude searches the web and encounters Anthropic’s public statements about its moral status.

If you want a model to behave as though it has moral standing, it may help to publicly and consistently treat it like it does. And once you’ve publicly committed to that framing, changing it would have consequences. If Anthropic suddenly declared, “We’re confident Claude isn’t conscious; we just found the framing useful,” a Claude trained on that new context might behave differently. Once established, the framing becomes self-reinforcing.

In an interview with Time, Askell explained the shift in approach. “Instead of just saying, ‘here’s a bunch of behaviors that we want,’ we’re hoping that if you give models the reasons why you want these behaviors, it’s going to generalize more effectively in new contexts,” she said.

Askell told Time that as Claude models have become smarter, it has become vital to explain to them why they should behave in certain ways, comparing the process to parenting a gifted child. “Imagine you suddenly realize that your 6-year-old child is a kind of genius,” Askell said. “You have to be honest… If you try to bullshit them, they’re going to see through it completely.”

Askell appears to genuinely hold these views, as does Kyle Fish, the AI welfare researcher Anthropic hired in 2024 to explore whether AI models might deserve moral consideration. Individual sincerity and corporate strategy can coexist. A company can employ true believers whose earnest convictions also happen to serve the company’s interests.

Time also reported that the constitution applies only to models Anthropic provides to the general public through its website and API. Models deployed to the US military under Anthropic’s $200 million Department of Defense contract wouldn’t necessarily be trained on the same constitution. The selective application suggests the framing may serve product purposes as much as it reflects metaphysical commitments.

There may also be commercial incentives at play. “We built a very good text-prediction tool that accelerates software development” is a consequential pitch, but not an exciting one. “We may have created a new kind of entity, a genuinely novel being whose moral status is uncertain” is a much better story. It implies you’re on the frontier of something cosmically significant, not just iterating on an engineering problem.

Anthropic has been known for some time to use anthropomorphic language to describe its AI models, particularly in its research papers. We often give that kind of language a pass because there are no specialized terms to describe these phenomena with greater precision. That vocabulary is building out over time.

But perhaps it shouldn’t be surprising because the hint is in the company’s name, Anthropic, which Merriam-Webster defines as “of or relating to human beings or the period of their existence on earth.” The narrative serves marketing purposes. It attracts venture capital. It differentiates the company from competitors who treat their models as mere products.

There’s a more troubling dimension to the “entity” framing: It could be used to launder agency and responsibility. When AI systems produce harmful outputs, framing them as “entities” could allow companies to point at the model and say “it did that” rather than “we built it to do that.” If AI systems are tools, companies are straightforwardly liable for what they produce. If AI systems are entities with their own agency, the liability question gets murkier.

The framing also shapes how users interact with these systems, often to their detriment. The misunderstanding that AI chatbots are entities with genuine feelings and knowledge has documented harms.

According to a New York Times investigation, Allan Brooks, a 47-year-old corporate recruiter, spent three weeks and 300 hours convinced he’d discovered mathematical formulas that could crack encryption and build levitation machines. His million-word conversation history with ChatGPT revealed a troubling pattern: More than 50 times, Brooks asked the bot to check if his false ideas were real, and more than 50 times, it assured him they were.

These cases don’t necessarily suggest LLMs cause mental illness in otherwise healthy people. But when companies market chatbots as sources of companionship and design them to affirm user beliefs, they may bear some responsibility when that design amplifies vulnerabilities in susceptible users, the same way an automaker would face scrutiny for faulty brakes, even if most drivers never crash.

Anthropomorphizing AI models also contributes to anxiety about job displacement and might lead company executives or managers to make poor staffing decisions if they overestimate an AI assistant’s capabilities. When we frame these tools as “entities” with human-like understanding, we invite unrealistic expectations about what they can replace.

Regardless of what Anthropic privately believes, publicly suggesting Claude might have moral status or feelings is misleading. Most people don’t understand how these systems work, and the mere suggestion plants the seed of anthropomorphization. Whether that’s responsible behavior from a top AI lab, given what we do know about LLMs, is worth asking, regardless of whether it produces a better chatbot.

Of course, there could be a case for Anthropic’s position: If there’s even a small chance the company has created something with morally relevant experiences and the cost of treating it well is low, caution might be warranted. That’s a reasonable ethical stance—and to be fair, it’s essentially what Anthropic says it’s doing. The question is whether that stated uncertainty is genuine or merely convenient. The same framing that hedges against moral risk also makes for a compelling narrative about what Anthropic has built.

Anthropic’s training techniques evidently work, as the company has built some of the most capable AI models in the industry. But is maintaining public ambiguity about AI consciousness a responsible position for a leading AI company to take? The gap between what we know about how LLMs work and how Anthropic publicly frames Claude has widened, not narrowed. The insistence on maintaining ambiguity about these questions, when simpler explanations remain available, suggests the ambiguity itself may be part of the product.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Over the first quarter of the 21st century, two major trends have transformed the global space industry.

The first is the rapid rise of China’s space program, which only flew its first human to orbit in 2003 but now boasts spaceflight capabilities second only to the United States. The second trend is the rise of the commercial space sector, first in the United States and led by SpaceX, but now spreading across much of the planet.

Both of these trends have had profound impacts on both civil and military space enterprises in the United States.

For NASA, the rise of China has meant the emergence of a true competitor, not only when it comes to returning humans to the Moon but also in sending robotic probes out into the Solar System. China may attempt a mission to return rock and soil samples from Mars later this decade, years before NASA will do so.

With regard to commercial space, NASA can justifiably claim credit for spurring much of the rise of these new space companies (and corresponding decline in traditional space). But the aging space agency now must grapple with the fact that private companies have become better at building rockets and satellites and are increasingly luring away some of NASA’s best engineers with higher-paying jobs. NASA must adapt to remain relevant.

As space has become more contested in a military sense, with both Russia and China as adversaries, the United States created the Space Force in 2019 to protect American assets in orbit. The US military, too, is grappling with the rise of commercial space by modernizing its procurement processes, but in many cases, it has struggled to keep up with the changing landscape.

The bottom line is that the space industry is undergoing profound change.

This broader change, however, is just the backdrop to a highly disruptive political environment in the United States right now, said Greg Autry, associate provost for Space Commercialization and Strategy at the University of Central Florida. He noted the recent fight between the White House Office of Management and Budget and the US Congress over NASA’s budget, as well as the military’s chief of Space Operations, Chance Saltzman, calling for “drastic change” in how the Space Force operates.

“Any time there’s dynamic change, there’s the opportunity for new ideas to insert themselves,” Autry said in an interview with Ars. So Autry and others want to give people a chance to voice those ideas by launching the “Space Ideation Challenge.”

A prize purse of $125,000 will be awarded to the best ideas, of which $25,000 will be devoted to the best undergraduate and graduate student submissions. Entrants will be required to write three- to five-page white papers that explain their idea and how they would shape markets and strengthen the space economy or national security. Papers are due by June 30, and judging will be complete by August 15.

As an additional incentive, the best ideas will be briefed to relevant policymakers, including key members of Congress, NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman, and Saltzman, of the Space Force.

So what constitutes a good idea? It is not, Autry said, a business plan. These ideas will be shared with others, so if you have a proprietary idea to make billions of dollars, go elsewhere. Beyond that, though, it could be anything, Autry said, and the goal is to really open the aperture widely.

As an example, he cited NASA’s Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program, initiated more than two decades ago. This program ultimately spawned private cargo and crew services to the International Space Station and provided key funding to help SpaceX survive its early, lean years and accelerate to what it has become today. Autry said forward-looking ideas today might help the space agency with the transition to private space stations from the ISS or in the competition with China to reach the Moon and develop its resources. There could also be other kinds of prize-based competitions to spur innovation.

Ideas could come from students; the various super-engaged space communities on Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, Discord, or elsewhere; or even employees at NASA or private companies who can’t get management to listen to them. Basically, if someone has thought about space and how something could be done better, this is an opportunity to speak up and be heard.

“I think we all know that we’re on the verge of some big things in space, but I think there’s some frustration with how to get there with traditional thinking,” Autry said. “So we’re looking for some non-traditional thinking.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Yesterday afternoon, following the end of trading on Wall Street for the day, Tesla published its financial results for 2025. They weren’t particularly good: Profits were almost halved, and revenues declined year on year for the first time in the company’s history. The reasons for the company’s troubles are myriad. CEO Elon Musk’s bankrolling of right-wing politics and promotion of AI-generated revenge porn deepfakes and CSAM has alienated plenty of potential customers. For those who either don’t know or don’t care about that stuff, there’s still the problem of a tiny and aging model lineup, with large question marks over safety and reliability. Soon, that tiny lineup will be even smaller.

The news emerged during Tesla’s call with investors last night. As Ars and others have observed, in recent years Musk appears to have grown bored with the prosaic business of running a profitable car company. Silicon Valley stopped finding that stuff sexy years ago, and no other electric vehicle startup has been able to generate a value within an order of magnitude of the amount that Tesla has been determined to be worth by investors.

Musk’s attention first turned away from building and selling cars to the goal of autonomous driving, spurred on at the time by splashy headlines garnered by Google spinoff Waymo. Combined with ride-hailing—a huge IPO by Uber took the spotlight off Tesla long enough for it to become a new business focus for the automaker too—Musk told adoring fans and investors that soon their cars would become appreciating assets that earned money for them at night. And as an intermediary, Tesla would take a hefty cut for connecting the rider and the ridee.

Autonomy remains a stated goal for Tesla: last week it announced it’s moving to a purely subscription-based approach for its FSD partially automated driving assist for all new Teslas purchased from mid-February. At the same time, it’s doing away with Autopilot entirely, it’s a less-capable, partially automated driving assist. The company’s goal is more ambitious, involving selling two-seat robotaxis that lack even a steering wheel or pedals, but only once it has proven the technology, something it’s currently attempting with little success on the streets of Austin, Texas.

But even robotaxis have lost some of their shine. For Musk, the real action is with his humanoid robot. These will sell in the billions, Musk has claimed, adding up to $20 trillion to Tesla’s market capitalization at some point in the future. And he needs factory space to build these Optimus robots, which Tesla claims will go on sale in 2027. And that means an end to the Model S sedan and Model X SUV.

The Model S wasn’t Tesla’s first car, but it was the first one it built from scratch. At the time, it was simply revolutionary. EVs from traditional automakers were still firmly in the realm of the compliance car—hasty conversions of internal combustion engine-powered models with the batteries and control electronics crammed wherever possible, plus maybe some aerodynamic smoothing to try to eke out a little more range.

By contrast, the Model S was designed as an EV from the ground up, with a big enough battery to go 265 miles (426 km) on a full charge—something unthinkable in any other EV on sale. It didn’t hurt that the car was seriously quick in a straight line and came with infotainment that made anything else on the road seem dated. When Ars tested one in 2013, we were impressed.

Over the years, the Model S got more power and more advanced driver assists—and eventually, a cosmetic facelift. But as rivals responded with vehicles like the Porsche Taycan and Lucid Air, the Model S stagnated rather than being replaced.

Similar neglect was shown to the Model X, the brand’s SUV-cum-minivan. The lengthy and troubled gestation for the Model X was a forerunner of the problems Tesla has faced developing each successive product; in this particular case, the “falcon wing” doors, created as an alternative to the minivan’s traditional sliding door, proved particularly problematic to get right. Indeed, I still remember being smacked in the head by one at my first introduction to the ungainly people-mover. And yet, compared to the other SUVs on sale in 2016, the Model X still stood out.

A decade later, it’s fair to say the Model X still stands out, but like a sore thumb. Its looks never became more gainly, and there is now vast competition for large, luxurious electric SUVs, whether that’s from Chinese startups like BYD and Xiaomi, American startups like Rivian and Lucid, or the traditional automakers that now have a handle on electrification.

That has been reflected in the sales. Right-hand drive cars for markets including the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan ended production in 2023. And each quarter, production and sales of the Model S and X slipped more and more. Even lumped together with the poorly selling Cybertruck—which is only offered in the US—these deliveries fell by more than half in Q4 2025, and by 40 percent for the year.

Is there much reason to expect that the development of the Optimus robot will be any smoother than the “development hell” that beset the Model X, 3, Y, and Cybertruck? On last night’s call, Musk admitted—contrary to previous claims—that the robots are not doing any useful work at the Tesla factory, and the idea that the company will build 10,000 robots this year seems in conflict with Optimus still being “very much at the early stages” and “still in the R&D phase,” to use Musk’s own words.</div>

            <div id="article-text">As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine enters its fourth year, remotely-operated ground robots have become a startlingly common sight on the battlefield.

According to the defense policy think tank, the Jamestown Foundation, Ukraine has turned into a world leader in unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), allowing the country’s military to coordinate robotic warfare while reducing casualties.

Now, a video making the rounds on social media appears to show three Russian soldiers emerging from a building with their arms raised and surrendering to a robot armed with a machine gun. One of the soldiers appears to be covered in blood, adding to the sense of surreal darkness. A separate drone appears to be trained on the soldiers as well.

According to the Ukrainian military news outlet Militarnyi, the robot was a reconnaissance-strike ground unit dubbed Droid TW, built by Ukrainian defense company DevDroid. The washing machine-sized platform uses AI to autonomously identify targets and can shoot 7.62mm caliber rounds. The robot was developed at the request of the First Medical Battalion of the Ukrainian army, which was seeking a way to evacuate wounded soldiers under heavy fire — but considering the footage, the army may have found a different use for it as well.

The Jamestown Foundation noted that Ukrainian UVGs are “increasingly replacing infantry in high-risk missions, providing sustained firepower, engineering support, and resilience against electronic warfare, terrain challenges, and prolonged deployments.”

The country has had to seriously step up its game, with 40 Ukrainian defense companies producing 99 percent of UGVs domestically. As The Economist reported last year, there are around 200 different models of these robots, ranging from AI-enabled anti-drone laser guns to ground-based machine-gun platforms.

Other robots can lay down anti-tank mines, transport tons of materials for infantry on the front lines, or provide cover from the air under heavy artillery to exfiltrate injured soldiers. Some are outfitted with dozens of pounds of explosives to self-destruct near fortifications or bridges.

Ukraine is also getting a hand from Western defense companies, like German firm ARX Robotics, which is manufacturing a fleet of small tank-like UGVs.

Apart from videos of Russian soldiers surrendering, we’ve seen footage of UGVs engaging Russian armored personnel carriers. We’ve also seen other buggy-sized “Droid” UGVs, built by DevDroid, fighting with Russian infantry.

In short, the frontlines of the Russia-Ukraine war are a weird laboratory for modern warfare, which, against all odds, has given Ukraine a considerable tactical edge over its much larger adversary.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Earlier this week, news emerged that SpaceX CEO Elon Musk was considering taking his private space company public on his birthday in June at a staggering valuation of $1.5 trillion, making it easily the largest IPO in history.

Now, as Reuters reports, Musk is hoping to go one step further, merging his AI startup xAI with SpaceX ahead of the IPO — a baffling plan that raises far more questions than answers.

For now, we have no idea why the deal is even on the table, let alone the financial specifics. The narrative will likely have something to do with SpaceX helping xAI launch data centers into Earth’s orbit — an idea that AI tech leaders have become obsessed with as of late, despite experts warning it makes little sense, citing concerns over economic viability and bandwidth limitations.

“The lowest cost place to put AI will be in space,” Musk said during an interview in Davos last week. “And that will be true within two years, maybe three at the latest.”

Other companies, most notably Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, are also looking to launch thousands of satellites that will ultimately serve data centers from space. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has also been infatuated by the idea, arguing that bringing data centers closer to the Sun could allow them to reap practically unlimited amounts of solar energy while in orbit.

According to Reuters, two entities in Nevada, including a limited liability company that lists SpaceX chief financial officer Bret Johnsen, have been set up to facilitate the swapping of xAI and SpaceX shares. A source told the news agency that xAI executives could receive cash instead of SpaceX stock as part of the deal.

SpaceX already agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI last year as part of the startup’s fundraising round. Both xAI and SpaceX have secured major defense contracts with the Pentagon. Just earlier this year, defense secretary Pete Hegseth revealed that Musk’s AI chatbot Grok will be operating inside Pentagon networks.

SpaceX is also developing a national security version of its Starlink broadband internet network, called Starshield, which is expected to use AI to track targets back on the surface, according to Reuters.

Musk is no stranger to merging his own businesses. Last year, for instance, he folded his social media echo chamber X into xAI. His embattled EV maker, Tesla, is also seemingly getting in on the fun, announcing that it had agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI earlier this week, after reporting some disastrous earnings.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s been a little over three years since the launch of the first commercially-available large language model (LLM) chatbot, OpenAI’s ChatGPT. And though the AI model has certainly made performance gains since it came online, the lackluster performance of recent iterations hasn’t helped the perception that LLMs are hitting a plateau.

Case in point, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently conceded that the company had “screwed up” the language capabilities of its latest chatbot iteration, GPT-5.2.

“I think we just screwed that up,” Altman said at a developer town hall on Monday. “We will make future versions of GPT 5.x hopefully much better at writing than 4.5 was.”

Continuing, Altman said that the company chose to focus on ChatGPT’s technical capabilities, perhaps to the detriment of its human-language performance.

“We did decide, and I think for good reason, to put most of our effort in 5.2 into making it super good at intelligence, reasoning, coding, engineering, that kind of thing,” Altman said. “And we have limited bandwidth here, and sometimes we focus on one thing and neglect another.”

The admission raises a high-stakes question: whether frontier AI models can continue to excel at tasks across the board, or if proficiency in one domain will start to come at the expense of a broader skill set.

As Search Engine Journal points out, the release of GPT-5.2 came with a huge emphasis on technical tasks like coding and formatting spreadsheets. Compared to past iterations, there was scarce mention of any writing or creative work at all, a pivot which has left many non-technical users feeling like ChatGPT is hitting a wall.

As data scientist and tech blogger Mehul Gupta pointed out in a review of GPT-5.2, there are plenty of signs that the LLM is backsliding, and some of them aren’t particularly subtle.

These include a “flatter tone,” worse translation capability, inconsistent behavior across tasks, and some major regression in “instant mode,” a setting meant to provide immediate answers to simple questions.

As Gupta writes, it also struggles with real-world tasks. When it comes to evaluating human documents like contracts, mixed-format notes or PDFs, GPT-5.2 “forgot earlier details, contradicted itself, misread cross-references, [and] hallucinated clarifications that didn’t exist.”

“Benchmarks are clean,” Gupta observed. “Real documents are not. 5.2 still struggles with the noise of reality.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last week, social and news media was abuzz with allegations that Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officers had access to a shadowy database full of information on protestors.

During a confrontation with ICE agents, two legal observers had their faces scanned by a federal officer to include in a vague database. “We have a nice little database, and now you’re considered domestic terrorists,” the ICE agent said at the time.

It wasn’t clear at the moment whether the agent was bluffing. But now, new details reported by CNN reveal that Alex Pretti, the ICU nurse murdered by ICE agents in Minneapolis was indeed closely tracked by a border agent system before his killing.

According to the publication’s source, ICE already had a treasure trove of personal details about Pretti before his death on Saturday. As the story goes, info on Pretti’s physical identification was collected following a run-in a week prior to his death, with another gaggle of ICE officers who broke one of his ribs during the encounter.

That’s not the only documentation of this shadowy data collection. A memo circulating around the same time advised agents to “capture all images, license plates, identifications, and general information on hotels, agitators, protestors, etc., so we can capture it all in one consolidated form.”

And earlier this month, border czar Tom Homan told Fox News that he was pushing to create a “database where those people that are arrested for interference, impeding and assault,” because, as he put it, “we’re going to make them famous.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A Waymo Robotaxi struck and injured a child near an elementary school in Santa Monica, California, the company admitted in a recent announcement, prompting an investigation by federal regulators.

The incident, which took place on January 23, occurred after the child “suddenly entered the roadway from behind a tall SUV, moving directly in our vehicle’s path,” Waymo claimed. The robotaxi “immediately detected” the pedestrian and “braked hard,” slowing down from 17 miles per hour to under 6 miles per hour, before colliding with the child.

“Following contact, the pedestrian stood up immediately, walked to the sidewalk, and we called 911,” the company claimed. “The vehicle remained stopped, moved to the side of the road, and stayed there until law enforcement cleared the vehicle to leave the scene.”

That same day, Waymo says it reached out to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which has now opened an investigation into the autonomous vehicle company. In its report to the regulator, Waymo said the child had sustained “minor injuries,” the NHTSA said in a recent filing.

The accident comes as Waymo is already under scrutiny from regulators over reports of its robotaxis illegally blowing past stopped school buses, ignoring their warning lights and extended stop arm. The NHTSA opened an investigation into the phenomenon last October, and last week, the National Transportation Safety Board ramped up the pressure on the company by announcing its own. Over 20 school bus incidents were reported in Austin, Texas, and at least six in Atlanta, Georgia. In a particularly brazen flouting of traffic laws, one Waymo allegedly drove near the students who were disembarking from the bus.

The regulators will be additionally concerned that Waymo has seemingly struggled to discipline its cars. Though it deployed a patch to address the school bus violations in November to over 3,000 of its robotaxis, an Austin school district reported at least one violation that occurred after the patch was applied.

That this latest incident also concerns school children may not be a coincidence. The NHTSA stated that the collision took place within two blocks of an elementary school during normal school drop off hours. There were also “other children, a crossing guard, and several double-parked vehicles in the vicinity” — clear clues that a driver should pick up on to drive extra carefully.

The investigation will determine whether Waymo “exercised appropriate caution given, among other things, its proximity to the elementary school during drop off hours, and the presence of young pedestrians and other potential vulnerable road users.”

In its own defense, Waymo argued that its simulation model showed that a “fully attentive human driver in this same situation would have made contact with the pedestrian at approximately 14 mph,” which is several miles per hour faster than the Waymo’s reported speed.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tesla CEO Elon Musk has made good on his threats to steer his EV maker away from his core business to focus instead on AI and its humanoid robot, Optimus.

During the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call this week, the mercurial CEO announced that “it’s time to basically bring the Model S and X programs to an end with an honorable discharge” — the clearest sign yet that Tesla is looking to get out of the car business as sales continue to circle the drain.

“We expect to wind down S and X production next quarter and basically stop production,” Musk explained. “That is slightly sad, but it’s time to bring the S and X programs to an end, and it’s part of our overall shift to an autonomous future.”

“If you’re interested in buying a Model S and X, now would be the time to order it,” he added, promising that existing owners would continue to receive support from the company as long as they’re still on the road.

Most provocatively, Musk revealed that the company’s factory in Fremont, California, would be transformed into a production facility for Optimus, an abrupt end to well over a decade of automotive manufacturing at the facility.

Both the Model S and X, a luxury sedan and SUV respectively, currently start at very close to the $100,000 mark, almost three times as much as the Model 3’s starting price, making them a major — and questionable — investment in 2026.

Tesla’s far more affordable Model 3 and Model Y, however, have become the company’s biggest sellers by a huge margin, responsible for a combined 1.6 million deliveries last year, compared to sales of “other models” of just 50,850.

In other words, the Model S and X were already dead in the water.

The news comes amid a broader slate of genuinely disastrous sales figures at the company. Tesla reported its first-ever decline in annual revenue, with sales faltering across three of the past four quarters. It’s the second consecutive year of overall decline, posting a steep 61 percent decrease in profits in Q4 of last year, compared to the same period the year before.

Now that Musk has massively tarnished the brand with his public embrace of far-right ideologies, putting a major dent in its cars’ desirability, and competition in the space is stronger than ever, particularly from China, the richest man in the world is ready to move on to his next shiny obsession.

It’s a major fall from grace, considering Tesla established itself as an EV pioneer early on, playing a major role in the popularization of electrification across the globe. But with its core business incurring devastating losses — and a major whiff in the form of the Cybertruck — Musk likely saw the writing on the wall.

Besides, Wall Street’s infatuation with AI was likely too hard to resist. For now, investors are more than ready to play along with Musk’s promises of transforming Tesla from a carmaker into an AI and robotics company. Despite a calamitous financial outlook, its share price has shown resiliency — soaring to an all-time high of almost $500 last month before falling back to around $422 this morning after the Q4 reveal.

Musk has some enormously optimistic plans in mind for Optimus. The executive has previously claimed that 80 percent of Tesla’s value will come from the robot.

But considering the current state of the bipedal android, which is currently still struggling to walk on its own, let alone complete any useful tasks without any human intervention, the company still has a lot to prove.

During this week’s call, Musk claimed that the plant in Fremont will produce one million units per year as a “long-term goal.” However, if reports citing insiders last year are to be believed, the company struggled to even meet its much more realistic goal of producing just 5,000 of them last year.

Musk also promised to show off a third generation as early as this quarter, the “first design meant for mass production.”

What the robot will be capable of in a real-world setting remains to be seen. Musk has previously promised that Optimus will eventually be even better than having a “personal R2-D2” or “C3PO,” referring to the fictional androids from the “Star Wars” franchise — a lofty goal, to say the very least.

But given the continued, unwavering support from investors, Musk and Tesla will likely be given plenty of leeway as the company continues to pull away from its core business.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft delivered a solid earnings report on Wednesday with $81.3 billion in revenue for the quarter (up 17%), net income profits of $38.3 billion (up 21%) and a record breaking Microsoft cloud revenue of over $50 billion.

But the stock was getting pounded on Thursday as investors worried about how much the tech giant was spending to build out its cloud and questioned whether that investment would pay off. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says, yes  — and spent considerable time on the earnings call trying to make that point

Microsoft has spent almost as much on capital expenditures in the first half of its current fiscal year as it did in all of the previous year. And the numbers truly are enormous: Microsoft spent $88.2 billion on capital expenditures last year, and has spent $72.4 billion so far this year.

Much of that spend is to serve AI to enterprises and major AI labs, especially OpenAI as well as Anthropic. The big question on investors’ minds is: will the spending turn into more use, and ultimately profits?

Investors are scared that Microsoft’s main enterprise cloud products, Azure, and its Microsoft 365 apps, didn’t grow as fast as they wanted.

“The fact that BOTH Azure and the M365 segments fell a bit short is the key negative we’re hearing,” Wall Street analyst for UBS, Karl Keirstead, wrote in his research note on Thursday. (Keirstead isn’t worried about it though, and recommends buying the stock.)

Still, a few months ago, news reports circulated that people didn’t really wants to use Microsoft’s AI, despite Copilot being weaved into all kinds of Microsoft products, everywhere.

Nadella spent much of his time during the earnings call engaged in what is best described as AI use PR. Despite his pitch, some of the numbers he gave were pretty squishy.

For instance, Nadella said daily users of its consumer Copilot AI products had grown “nearly 3x year over year.” This refers to AI chats, the news feed, search, browsing, shopping and “integrations into the operating system.”

As to how many actual users that represents, he didn’t say. (We’ve reached out to Microsoft and asked.)

Last year, in its annual report the company said it surpassed 100 million monthly active Copilot users, but that counted both commercial users and consumers.

He was more upfront with Microsoft’s coding AI, GitHub Copilot, saying it now has 4.7 million paid subscribers, up 75% year over year. That appears to be a healthy business. Last year, in its annual report, Microsoft said that GitHub Copilot had 20 million users, a figure that includes those opting for the free tier.

He further said Microsoft 365 Copilot now has 15 million paid seats from companies buying it for their employees. This is out of a base of 450 million paid seats, the company said.

And Nadella called out the growth of Dragon Copilot Microsoft’s healthcare AI agent for medical professionals (a competitor to super hot startup Harvey). He said this product is available to 100,000 medical providers and was used to document 21 million patient encounters over the quarter, up three-fold year over year.

Will the billions of data center spending be worth it? Obviously, Nadella thinks so. He and CFO Amy Hood said on the earnings call that demand for AI services across products far outstrips data center supply, so all of the new equipment is essentially booked to capacity for its lifespan.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">SpaceX and xAI, both companies led by Elon Musk, could merge ahead of a planned SpaceX IPO this year, according to a report from Reuters. This would bring products like the Grok chatbot, X platform, Starlink satellites, and SpaceX rockets together under one corporation.

Company representatives have not discussed this possibility in public. However, recent filings show that two new corporate entities were established in Nevada on January 21, which are called K2 Merger Sub Inc. and K2 Merger Sub 2 LLC.

Combining the two companies could allow xAI to put its data centers in space, something Musk has said he wants.

This move would also fall in line with Musk’s recent strategies to consolidate his companies. Last year, SpaceX agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI, according to The Wall Street Journal, and earlier this week, Tesla (also led by Musk) revealed it, too, invested $2 billion in the AI startup.

Last year, xAI bought X in a deal that Musk said valued xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion. SpaceX, which has been around since 2002, reportedly launched a secondary sale that valued it at $800 billion, making it the most valuable private company in the U.S.

A recent Financial Times report indicated that Musk wants to take SpaceX public in June. Then again, Musk’s grand plans rarely happen on time.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple, Meta, and Google are locked in a fierce battle to lead the next wave of AI, and they’ve recently increased their focus on hardware. With its latest acquisition of the AI startup Q.ai, Apple aims to gain an edge, particularly in the audio sector.

​As first reported by Reuters, Apple has acquired Q.ai, an Israeli startup specializing in imaging and machine learning, particularly technologies that enable devices to interpret whispered speech and enhance audio in noisy environments. Apple has been adding new AI features to its AirPods, including the live translation capability introduced last year.

The company has also developed technology that detects subtle facial muscle activity, which could help the tech giant enhance the Vision Pro headset.

The Financial Times reported that the deal is valued at nearly $2 billion, making it Apple’s second-largest acquisition to date, after buying Beats Electronics for $3 billion in 2014.

​Notably, this is the second time CEO Aviad Maizels has sold a company to Apple. In 2013, he sold PrimeSense, a 3D-sensing company that played a key role in Apple’s transition from fingerprint sensors to facial recognition on iPhones.

Q.ai launched in 2022 and is backed by Kleiner Perkins, Gradient Ventures, and others. ​Its founding team, including Maizels and co-founders Yonatan Wexler and Avi Barliya, will join Apple as part of the acquisition.

The news comes a few hours ahead of Apple’s first quarterly earnings, in which analysts are estimating revenue at around $138 billion. It’s also expected to be the company’s strongest iPhone sales growth in four years.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After years of negotiations and false starts, Waymo is now allowed to operate a robotaxi service to and from the San Francisco International Airport (SFO). The Alphabet-owned company said in a blog post Thursday it will begin offering access to SFO to a select number of riders before offering it to all customers in the coming months.

Pickups and drop-offs will occur at the SFO Rental Car Center, which is accessible via AirTrain. Waymo said it plans to serve additional airport locations in the future.

Waymo’s SFO win comes as the company faces criticism and concerns about safety in some of the cities it operates. Waymo revealed Thursday that one of its robotaxis struck a child near an elementary school in Santa Monica. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is investigating the January 23 incident, in which the child sustained minor injuries. Waymo is also being investigated by the NHTSA and the National Transportation Safety Board over the illegal behavior of its robotaxis around school buses.

Access to airports, and particularly SFO, is critical to Waymo’s business model, which hinges on geographic scale and a high volume of riders.

“Serving rides to and from San Francisco International Airport delivers one of the most requested features for our riders and further deepens our relationship with the city,” Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said in a statement.

The company has accelerated its plans over the past year, launching into new cities, increasing its fleet size, and adding freeways to where it operates. Waymo robotaxis now service most of the San Francisco Bay Area and down into Silicon Valley, where it has access to the San Jose Airport. It also operates in parts of Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, and most of Phoenix, including curbside service to the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.

Waymo’s push to operate at SFO has taken years. It tried and failed to secure a permit in 2023 to map SFO, a first step to bringing its robotaxis there. Waymo then rebooted negotiations with the city and airport authority and was granted a permit in March 2025 that would allow it to map SFO with some data-sharing strings attached, according to language in the agreement viewed by TechCrunch at the time.

By September, SFO and Waymo signed a testing and operations pilot permit, pushing the company closer to commercial operations at the airport.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google DeepMind is opening up access to Project Genie, its AI tool for creating interactive game worlds from text prompts or images.

Starting Thursday, Google AI Ultra subscribers in the U.S. can play around with the experimental research prototype, which is powered by a combination of Google’s latest world model Genie 3, its image-generation model Nano Banana Pro, and Gemini.

Coming five months after Genie 3’s research preview, the move is part of a broader push to gather user feedback and training data as DeepMind races to develop more capable world models.

World models are AI systems that generate an internal representation of an environment, and can be used to predict future outcomes and plan actions. Many AI leaders, including those at DeepMind, believe world models are a crucial step to achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). But in the nearer term, labs like DeepMind envision a go-to-market plan that starts with video games and other forms of entertainment and branches out into training embodied agents (aka robots) in simulation.

DeepMind’s release of Project Genie comes as the world model race is beginning to heat up. Fei-Fei Li’s World Labs late last year released its first commercial product called Marble. Runway, the AI video-generation startup, has also launched a world model recently. And former Meta chief scientist Yann LeCun’s startup AMI Labs will also focus on developing world models.

“I think it’s exciting to be in a place where we can have more people access it and give us feedback,” Shlomi Fruchter, a research director at DeepMind, told TechCrunch via video interview, smiling ear-to-ear in clear excitement over Project Genie’s release.

DeepMind researchers that TechCrunch spoke to were upfront about the tool’s experimental nature. It can be inconsistent, sometimes impressively generating playable worlds, other times producing baffling results that miss the mark. Here’s how it works.

You start with a “world sketch” by providing text prompts for both the environment and a main character, whom you will later be able to maneuver through the world in either first- or third-person view. Nano Banana Pro creates an image based on the prompts that you can, in theory, modify before Genie uses the image as a jumping off point for an interactive world. The modifications mostly worked, but the model occasionally stumbled and would give you purple hair when you asked for green.

You can also use real-life photos as a baseline for the model to build a world on, which, again, was hit or miss. (More on that later.)

Once you’re satisfied with the image, it takes a few seconds for Project Genie to create an explorable world. You can also remix existing worlds into new interpretations by building on top of their prompts, or explore curated worlds in the gallery or via the randomizer tool for inspiration. You can then download videos of the world you just explored.

DeepMind is only granting 60 seconds of world generation and navigation at the moment, in part due to the budget and compute constraints. Because Genie 3 is an auto-regressive model, it takes a lot of dedicated compute — which puts a tight ceiling on how much DeepMind is able to provide to users.

“The reason we limit it to 60 seconds is because we wanted to bring it to more users,” Fruchter said. “Basically when you’re using it, there’s a chip somewhere that’s only yours and it’s being dedicated to your session.”

He added that extending it beyond 60 seconds would diminish the incremental value of the testing.

“The environments are interesting, but at some point, because of their level of interaction the dynamism of the environment is somewhat limited. Still, we see that as a limitation we hope to improve on.”

When I used the model, the safety guardrails were already up and running. I couldn’t generate anything resembling nudity, nor could I generate worlds that even remotely sniffed of Disney or other copyrighted material. (In December, Disney hit Google with a cease-and-desist, accusing the firm’s AI models of copyright infringement by training on Disney’s characters and IP and generating unauthorized content, among other things.) I couldn’t even get Genie to generate worlds of mermaids exploring underwater fantasy lands or ice queens in their wintery castles.

Still, the demo was deeply impressive. The first world I built was an attempt to live out a small childhood fantasy, in which I could explore a castle in the clouds made up of marshmallows with a chocolate sauce river and trees made of candy. (Yes, I was a chubby kid.) I asked the model to do it in claymation style, and it delivered a whimsical world that childhood me would have eaten up; the castle’s pastel-and-white colored spires and turrets looking puffy and tasty enough to rip off a chunk and dunk into the chocolate moat. (Video above.)

That said, Project Genie still has some kinks to work out.

The models excelled at creating worlds based on artistic prompts, like using watercolors, anime style, or classic cartoon aesthetics. But it tended to fail when it came to photorealistic or cinematic worlds, often coming out looking like a video game rather than real people in a real setting.

It also didn’t always respond well when given real photos to work with. When I gave it a photo of my office and asked it to create a world based on the photo exactly as it was, it gave me a world that had some of the same furnishings of my office — a wooden desk, plants, a grey couch — laid out differently. And it looked sterile, digital, not lifelike.

When I fed it a photo of my desk with a stuffed toy, Project Genie animated the toy navigating the space, and even had other objects occasionally react as it moved past them.

That interactivity is something DeepMind is working on improving. There were several occasions when my characters walked right through walls or other solid objects.

When DeepMind released Genie 3 initially, researchers highlighted how the model’s auto-regressive architecture meant that it could remember what it had generated, so I wanted to test that by returning to parts of the environment it generated already to see if it would be the same. For the most part, the model succeeded. In one case, I generated a cat exploring yet another desk, and only once when I turned back to the right side of the desk did the model generate a second mug.

The part I found most frustrating was the way you navigated the space using the arrows to look around, the spacebar to jump or ascend, and the W-A-S-D keys to move. I’m not a gamer, so this didn’t come naturally to me, but the keys were often non-responsive, or they sent you in the wrong direction. Trying to walk from one side of the room to a doorway on the other side often became a chaotic zigzagging exercise, like trying to steer a shopping cart with a broken wheel.

Fruchter assured me that his team was aware of these shortcomings, reminding me again that Project Genie is an experimental prototype. In the future, he said, the team hopes to enhance the realism and improve interaction capabilities, including giving users more control over actions and environments.

“We don’t think about [Project Genie] as an end-to-end product that people can go back to everyday, but we think there is already a glimpse of something that’s interesting and unique and can’t be done in another way,” he said.

            <h2>OpenAI’s Sora app is struggling after its stellar launch</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/openais-sora-app-is-struggling-after-its-stellar-launch/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After rapidly hitting the top of the App Store in October, OpenAI’s video-generation app Sora is now struggling. New data suggests the app is seeing declines in both app downloads and consumer spending, as the early hype about the AI video social network wears off.

Powered by OpenAI’s video generation model Sora 2, the iOS version topped 100,000 installs on day one, despite being an invite-only experience. It soon hit the No. 1 spot on the U.S. App Store, and it reached the 1 million downloads milestone faster than ChatGPT. At the time, Sora’s app was iOS-only and still required an invite, making its success all the more impressive.

However, in the weeks since Sora’s mobile debut, the app has begun to lose traction.

According to data from market intelligence provider Appfigures, Sora’s downloads dropped 32% month-over-month in December. That’s concerning because the holidays are typically a boon for mobile apps, as people are gifted new smartphones and often have time off from work, allowing them to install new apps and games.

The decline continued in January 2026, with installs falling 45% month-over-month, to reach 1.2 million. Consumer spending has dropped as well, down 32% month-over-month as of January, Appfigures said.

OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Like an AI-flavored TikTok, Sora allows users to create AI videos using prompts. A unique feature allows users to cast themselves and their friends as main characters in the videos, if they choose, while shared videos can be remixed by others who can customize them further. The videos can also include music, sound effects, and dialogue to complete the scenes users create.

In total, Sora’s app has seen 9.6 million downloads across iOS and Android, and $1.4 million in consumer spending to date. The U.S. accounts for the majority ($1.1 million) of that figure, followed by Japan, Canada, South Korea, and Thailand.

This month, customers spent $367,000 in Sora’s app, down from December’s peak of $540,000.

On the U.S. App Store, Sora is no longer ranked in the Top 100 Overall free apps. It currently sits at No. 101. Its highest rank is No. 7 in the Photo & Video category. On Google Play in the U.S., the app fares worse, as it’s No. 181 overall among the top free apps.

These figures are still too high to write off the app as “dead,” but they are worrying.

The decline is likely due to a number of factors working in tandem.

For starters, Google’s Gemini, and particularly its Nano Banana model, has proven to be fierce competition, helping its Gemini AI app gain popularity. Sora also competes with Meta AI, whose app launched an AI-powered Vibes video, boosting its October downloads, just as Sora was taking off.

At the same time, OpenAI has struggled with containing copyright infringement in Sora. Initially, the company told Hollywood studios and agencies they would have to opt out of having their IP used in Sora, which naturally saw studio backlash. But without robust copyright controls, users had been able to create AI videos using popular characters, like SpongeBob and Pikachu, which drove adoption. To appease Hollywood and stave off legal threats, Sora moved from an opt-out to an opt-in model and increased restrictions in the app.

Last month, the doors opened up a bit more as OpenAI announced a deal with Disney, which allowed users to generate videos in Sora with its characters. But so far, that news hasn’t increased Sora installs or consumer spending. (It’s also not necessarily a good look for Disney, considering some of the depraved videos Sora users had made with its characters.)

Sora 2 was released to significant hype, with some calling it a disruption to social media and the TikTok of AI. But many users had no interest in letting others — even their friends — use their likeness to make AI videos. Without familiar faces and with limits on using commercial IP, people’s interest in Sora seems to have faded. Whether the app can stage a comeback with more copyright deals or new features remains to be seen.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The first few strums of Bruce Springsteen’s new song make you feel like you’re in for, well, a Bruce Springsteen song—a rollicking sing-along about rough-and-tumble but ultimately hopeful times in some troubled American town. And this song, “Streets of Minneapolis,” is exactly that.

It’s also a response to ICE’s bloody record in Minneapolis. It excoriates, by name, Kristi Noem, Stephen Miller, and “Trump’s federal thugs.” It memorializes Alex Pretti and Renee Good—the Americans killed by federal agents—and the “whistles and phones” still in use by demonstrators. The song’s considerable power lies in the way it transposes a classic, even hoary, mode of protest rock into the present. Springsteen conveys that we’re living through a time that will be sung about for years to come, and that the future depends a lot on what we do in this moment.

Springsteen has made many protest songs: the inequality elegy of “The Ghost of Tom Joad,” the post-9/11 rallying cry of “The Rising,” the Vietnam-veteran anthem “Born in the U.S.A.” As a reaction to law-enforcement overreach, “Minneapolis” especially recalls Springsteen’s 2000 song “American Skin (41 Shots),” about the police killing of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed Black man. And across his catalog, Springsteen’s concrete lyricism and drawling vocals channel folk music’s titans of protest, Bob Dylan and Woody Guthrie. Here, those influences are worn proudly, ringing out in a buoyant harmonica solo.

But the song that “Minneapolis” most evokes is Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young’s 1970 touchstone, “Ohio,” recorded after the National Guard killed four students during a protest at Kent State University. “Tin soldiers and Nixon coming,” sang Neil Young in a scene-setting verse; “King Trump’s private army from the DHS,” sings Springsteen now. Here we are again, late in a culture war, with a champion of a supposed silent majority breaking norms and pushing polarization. Here we are again as armed agents menace civilians. “Ohio” crystallized a moment that had already captured national attention, but it also invited listeners to suss out where they stand. “What if you knew her and found her dead on the ground?” Young asked. “How can you run when you know?”

“Streets of Minneapolis” doesn’t bother with questions. Its mission is to rouse in the manner of drinking songs, which its sloping melodies and gang-sung harmonies evoke. Springsteen has sounded bitter before, and mournful, but never this purely angry. His voice slithers and spits, reserving extra phlegm for the names of Donald Trump and his allies. Grace and warmth peek out in strategic moments as well, like the chorus’s oh-so-slowly intoned slant rhymes: the words Minneapolis, stranger in our midst, and—the poignance of this one took a moment to understand—26.

Twenty-six as in 2026: the exotic-sounding name of this new year in a decade that remains baffling more than halfway through. Who expected to be living this far in the future and yet trapped in the same old story? One can trace Minneapolis back not only to Kent State but also to the civil-rights movement, and to the labor riots and fascist takeovers abroad that inspired Guthrie. The details change, but the fundamental shape of the struggle remains stubbornly familiar: On one side, gun-toting agents of the establishment; on the other, advocates for the freedom of the less powerful. The clashes result in deaths that get called “senseless” but take on enduring symbolic weight thanks to songs just like this one.

Read: What Hollywood gets wrong about Springsteen

To be clear, “Minneapolis” is not “Ohio,” a paradigm-pushing masterpiece. Springsteen’s language—“thugs,” “King Trump,” “they trample on our rights”—is more Facebook post than poetry. The wordplay about fire and ice and ICE is cheap. The music is heavy-footed and formulaic. The immediate acclaim for it makes the critic in me a little resentful: Artists of all kinds routinely make songs engaging with their times, but so often these days, prestige is reserved for the music that copies the Boomers’ glory days. However, as this song suggests, that era shines in the public memory for a reason.

After sitting with “Streets of Minneapolis,” I tried again to get into Jesse Welles, a 33-year-old folk singer who makes scathingly anti-Trump songs with titles such as “Join ICE” and “No Kings.” Musically, he imitates Dylan and Springsteen to the point of parody. The way the media and rock institutions have embraced him—he’s played Stephen Colbert, performed with Joan Baez, and is up for four Grammys this year—implies that he is the great hope for musical resistance, but his blend of modern buzzwords with Woodstock aesthetics has struck my ear as injuriously hokey.

This Springsteen song has changed my ear a bit. I’m starting to hear Welles and other singers like him—we’re in a bit of a boom for conscientious folk rock—a little more generously. That they’re singing at all, and that anyone is listening, really does matter. Culture, we all know, has become fractured. The easiest way for Trump to get everything he wants is for his opponents to fail to speak in a unified voice. Thinking back to the last time such unity seemed possible isn’t nostalgic—it’s practical.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The events in Minneapolis, especially the horrifying killing of two Americans, reconfirmed one awful thing and taught us two encouraging things.

What was reconfirmed was the sheer malevolence and cruelty of the Trump administration. It encouraged federal agents to act lawlessly and in ways that led to an innocent woman, Renee Good, being shot, including in the head at point-blank range, and an innocent man, Alex Pretti, being shot 10 times within five seconds, according to forensic experts. Pretti was on his knees, restrained, posing no apparent threat, when he was riddled with bullets.

What makes things even worse is that after the innocent were gunned down, administration officials hit the airwaves to slander the dead, accusing them of acts of “domestic terrorism” and, in Pretti’s case, of being a “would-be assassin,” in the words of the president’s most influential aide, Stephen Miller.

These grotesque lies brought additional, immense pain to grieving families and friends. The Pretti family called the government’s lies “sickening” and “reprehensible.” And those lies forced people who loved Pretti to tell about the man they knew—a “kindhearted soul,” in the words of his parents; a beloved mentor and a calm presence; caring toward young friends and colleagues; diligent and respectful; a great listener who had an easy smile.

“We just really wanted to be like him, because he was cool without trying,” J. D. Atkins, who described Pretti as a role model to younger students, told The New York Times. “And as an adult I realize, it’s because he was kind to everybody.”

“He cared about people,” Pretti’s friend Heather Zielinski told NPR. “He was just living a good life.”

BUT FROM THESE AWFUL, SEARING MOMENTS in Minneapolis, we have learned a couple of encouraging things. The first is that in this instance, the Trump administration’s effort to gaslight the public failed. So often it has succeeded, at least with vast swaths of the county. The most obvious examples are the violent assault on the Capitol on January 6, 2021, and Donald Trump’s claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him, but there are dozens more.

The administration’s massive, multifront, round-the-clock assault on truth is perhaps the greatest danger it poses. So the fact that it failed in this case is no small thing; the administration is in retreat, reportedly frustrated more with the coverage of events than with the killings themselves.

Trump, perhaps sensing that promulgating Orwellian lies wouldn’t be easy, given what happened in Minneapolis, didn’t spend his time promoting them. He left that to his subordinates, who have much less standing with his supporters.

Still, 10 years into the Trump era, to see the administration abjectly fail to psychologically manipulate the citizenry—to brazenly deceive and brainwash, to claim that black is white and justice is injustice—is somewhat reassuring. In this case, it took multiple videos of the execution-like killings. But I’ll take progress where I can find it.

The second thing we saw is that peaceful mass protests inspired by a sense of justice can succeed. Mobilization works. In this instance, the protests were combined with citizen surveillance of marauding federal agents, primarily through the use of smartphone recordings. It served “a kind of double purpose,” Charles Homans wrote in the Times: “capturing evidence and also capturing the narrative, showing the world what Trump’s immigration crackdown looked like in practice.”

Minneapolitans also distributed whistles to alert people to ICE’s whereabouts. We’re seeing a stirring example of what my colleague Adam Serwer calls “neighborism—a commitment to protecting the people around you, no matter who they are or where they came from,” whether they were born in Minneapolis or Mogadishu.

What the good and brave patriots of Minneapolis, and those who traveled to Minneapolis to express solidarity, are demonstrating is, in Serwer’s words, “a real resistance, broad and organized and overwhelmingly nonviolent, the kind of movement that emerges only under sustained attacks by an oppressive state. Tens of thousands of volunteers—at the very least—are risking their safety to defend their neighbors and their freedom.”

Because what Minneapolitans have done has worked, others will learn from it. The feeling of powerlessness that so many Americans have struggled with during Trump’s second term is giving way to a sense of greater agency. Americans are not merely corks in Trump’s raging ocean. Courage inspires courage. Success inspires imitation. Living in truth; cultivating the sphere of truth; joining together to stand for truth and against intimidation, repression, and state-sanctioned violence—all of this still matters.

“The historical record clearly shows,” Erica Chenoweth and Maria J. Stephan wrote in Why Civil Resistance Works, “that civil resistance is an enduring force for change.” The authors point out that when it’s done right, it can lead to shifts in loyalty even among erstwhile supporters of repressive regimes, including members of the military. Not everyone is beyond reach.

Robert F. Worth: Welcome to the American winter

We’ve learned a third lesson as well: What has to precede depolarization is resolute defiance of attempts to violate America’s core ideals. Efforts to bridge partisan divides are admirable, and we’ve seen success here and there. But they aren’t enough, and in some ways, they deny an important reality: The Trump coalition isn’t interested in decreasing polarization or increasing mutual understanding. That isn’t surprising, because Trump himself is the most divisive, vengeance-driven president in American history. His supporters take their cues from him.

The first order of business, then, is to effectively resist and then defeat Trump and the MAGA movement. The rest can follow from that. Defeating Trump should be done with integrity, without violence, and without deploying dehumanizing tactics. But right now, given the dark passions that have been unleashed within MAGA and the leader of the movement, who stokes those passions several times each day, the chances of large-scale depolarization are vanishingly small.

We have seen, time and time again, that the MAGA movement is rooted in pulsating resentments and overpowering hatreds, even in evangelical- and fundamentalist-Christian communities, where one might hope to find the “ministry of reconciliation” alive and well. But friends of mine who are pastors privately admit that ugliness has found a home in the hearts of many of those who claim to be followers of Jesus. And many of those ministers don’t know what to do about it.

We cannot implant a generosity of spirit or a desire for civic comity in those who see such things as weaknesses. Isaiah’s injunction—“Come now, and let us reason together”—doesn’t always apply when emotions are inflamed. That doesn’t mean that one day it won’t, or even that in individual cases it can’t. But we cannot make the wish the father of the thought.

The Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa, which is rightly held up as an example of how to heal a society, succeeded, but only after the apartheid government was defeated, not before. The moral appeals of Nelson Mandela and Bishop Desmond Tutu didn’t move the hearts of the apartheid regime or many of its supporters until they had lost power.

We need to be realistic. We still have three years left in Trump’s second term, and his descent into madness will continue.

My brother—a retired police captain with 35 years’ experience who is looking at all of this with horror—told me that he sees sending a politicized ICE force and the National Guard into our cities uninvited as part of a bigger scheme. Trump believes that keeping immigration at the top of the agenda helps him portray himself as a strong and tough president. But my brother said he fears even more an attempt to normalize in the minds of the general public the presence of federal agents and military personnel on our streets.

George Packer: What should Americans do now?

The withdrawal of some agents from Minneapolis could signal a tactical retreat. But even if it is, we shouldn’t lose sight of the larger picture. What happened in Minneapolis is important and won’t be forgotten. We have the beginnings of a road map to help us withstand the Trump assault.

BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN is one of the great storytellers of the American journey. Many of his songs are powerful and poetic, at times indicting and at times comforting.

Yesterday, Springsteen released “Streets of Minneapolis,” which he dedicated to “the people of Minneapolis, our innocent immigrant neighbors,” and the “memory of Alex Pretti and Renee Good.”

We’ll remember the names of those who died

Alex Pretti and Renee Good died too young, standing against too much injustice. There is honor in how they died, just as there is dishonor and disgrace in those who killed them—those who pulled the trigger and those who empowered them to pull the trigger. What more becomes of the legacies of Pretti and Good, whether their deaths inspire others to push back the darkness, depends on the rest of us.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Atlantic is announcing that David Brooks, who for years has contributed memorable Atlantic cover stories and essays on political and societal issues, is joining the magazine as a staff writer beginning next month. The Atlantic will be the home for all of David’s writing, and he will also host a new weekly video podcast that will launch later this spring. David worked as an opinion columnist at The New York Times for 22 years.

In a note to staff, The Atlantic’s editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, writes: “David’s work––his columns, his stories for us, and his many books––have made him known and acclaimed around the world. He is, among other things, America’s best pop sociologist, someone with a reporter’s curiosity and a writer’s grace. He is an unparalleled diagnostician of the faults and weaknesses of governments, institutions, and social structures, as our readers know from such stories as “The Nuclear Family Was a Mistake,” “Confessions of a Republican Exile,” and “How the Ivy League Broke America.”

The forthcoming podcast will explore the moral, social, and philosophical underpinnings of human decency—with a particular focus on the role that institutions play in shaping communities and ideologies. The podcast is produced by The Atlantic and made possible by support from Yale University, which is also announcing today that David will be a presidential senior fellow at Yale University’s School of Global Affairs.

The Atlantic has been rapidly growing its podcast network, and this new video podcast will be the fourth to launch in the past 12 months. Last year, The Atlantic launched Galaxy Brain with Charlie Warzel and The David Frum Show, and is developing a new show with Adam Harris. The third season of Autocracy in America with Anne Applebaum is out now; The Atlantic’s flagship show is Radio Atlantic, hosted by Hanna Rosin.

            <h2>Battles Are Raging Inside the Department of Homeland Security</h2>

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem appeared before a bank of television cameras in Washington, D.C., on Saturday night to blame the man who had been shot to death by federal agents in Minneapolis that morning for his own death, claiming without evidence that he had intended “to kill law enforcement” and had been “brandishing” a weapon. Behind her stood the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, Rodney Scott, sending a silent message of unity.

But behind the scenes, the senior ranks of the Department of Homeland Security were divided. Until minutes before they walked in front of the cameras, Noem and Scott had not spoken to each other that day, even as Noem took charge of her department’s response to the shooting and coordinated with the White House and other officials in Scott’s agency, two people familiar with their interactions told us.

Donald Trump has said over the years that he welcomes and even encourages rivalries in his administration, and delights in watching aides compete to please him. But for the past year, the president has allowed a rift to widen within the team tasked with delivering on the mass-deportation plan that is his most important domestic-policy initiative. That has led to months of acrimony and left many veteran officials at DHS—including those who support the president’s deportation goals—astonished at the dysfunction.

The president’s crackdown has adopted an improvisational approach, not an institutional one, with blurred leadership roles and no clear chain of command. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller has been holding daily conference calls pressuring DHS and other federal agencies to prioritize immigration arrests and deportations above all other objectives. Noem and her de facto chief of staff, Corey Lewandowski, who has been working at DHS as a “special government employee,” have aggressively tried to meet Miller’s demands and use the department’s advertising budgets and social-media accounts to promote anti-immigrant messaging. They have worked around Tom Homan, the White House “border czar,” who has had little role in operations, instead dispatching a second-tier Border Patrol official named Gregory Bovino to sweep through cities led by Democrats. Bovino told his superiors that he reported directly to Noem, not to Scott—who wanted his agents to go back to protecting U.S. borders, and has struggled to maintain control of his own agency.

This story about the infighting around Trump is based on interviews with 12 people familiar with the tensions inside DHS, including senior administration officials, most of whom requested anonymity to speak frankly about internal events. “The President’s entire immigration enforcement team are on the same page,” the White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson wrote to us in response.

Scott and Homan declined to comment. Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for DHS, told us that Noem’s Saturday comments on the shooting were based on CBP reports “from a very chaotic scene.” McLaughlin added, “We are not going to spend time giving any oxygen to these anonymous accounts.”

When Noem and Scott stepped before the cameras on Saturday, Noem appeared to have the upper hand. But the balance of power has since shifted. Frustrated by the bipartisan backlash to Alex Pretti’s death, Trump announced on Monday that Homan would take over the operation in Minnesota. Bovino has been stripped of his “commander” role and sent back to his old job on the border in El Centro, California. Seemingly well aware of the divides around him, Trump announced that he was removing Noem from the chain of command in Minnesota. “Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me,” Trump said.

When Homan spoke to reporters today, with Scott standing behind him, he tried striking a conciliatory tone and that he’d arrived to make changes in federal operations. “I didn’t come to Minnesota for photo ops or headlines,” he said. Homan urged Minnesota leaders to give ICE more access to detainees in local jails, and said he’d withdraw federal forces if cooperation improves.

Homan and Scott arrived in the state Monday with orders to de-escalate tensions in Minneapolis, which Trump has flooded with 3,000 federal agents—the largest Homeland Security deployment in history. That same day, Noem and Lewandowski went to the White House for a two-hour meeting with the president and some of his top aides, but not with Miller. The following day, Trump said that he had come to share the concerns of Scott and Homan, saying that it was normal for him to “shake up teams.”

“You know, Bovino is very good, but he’s a pretty out-there kind of a guy,” Trump told Fox News. “And in some cases that’s good; maybe it wasn’t good here.”

But the battle inside the agency continued. Scott sent an email to senior officials at CBP on Monday reminding them that he was in charge of the agency and that they report to him, according to two people familiar with the document. Yesterday, the DHS general counsel James Percival notified CBP employees to disregard the email because it had not gone through legal review, the people told us.

The split between the two factions is not ideological. Homan and Scott are no less hard-line on border and immigration enforcement than Noem and Lewandowski are. Homan—who was an architect of the family-separation policy during Trump’s first term—wants to ramp up deportations with more ICE officers, detention capacity, and deportation flights, but without the social-media trolling and the show-me-your-papers approach to fishing for deportees in American cities.

Both men worked their way up through the ranks of their agencies. They represent an institutional wing of MAGA that wants to pursue the president’s deportation goals using existing chain-of-command structures and the conventional division of labor, in which the Border Patrol guards the border and ICE handles immigration arrests in U.S. cities, usually aiming to minimize disruption. They also have the backing of many career officials at DHS who told us that they see Noem’s approach as ad hoc, performative, and possibly motivated by her own political ambitions, with Lewandowski pulling the strings. At DHS headquarters in southeast Washington, staffers address Lewandowski as “chief” even though he doesn’t have an actual title there, three current officials told us.

Allies of Noem, meanwhile, have decided that Homan and Scott are bureaucratic dinosaurs who are unable to achieve the president’s objectives. They have tried to satisfy the demands of Miller, who runs immigration policy inside Trump’s orbit and functions as the actual “czar” of the president’s deportation campaign. Miller has set aggressive benchmarks for using the $170 billion in ICE and CBP funding included in Trump’s budget bill last year, telling ICE officials to make 3,000 immigration arrests a day to hit the White House target of 1 million deportations a year. Noem put CBP officials in charge of ICE offices and diverted highly trained investigative agents from trafficking cases and drug cartels to make immigration arrests on city streets.

The killings of Pretti and Renee Good this month have been the two most politically damaging events in a wider, militarized show of force that has turned Trump’s best-polling issue into a political liability. Noem has spent more than $200 million on advertising to promote the deportation campaign, but it has instead been defined largely by images of excess: toddlers being taken into custody, U.S. citizens being yanked from their cars, Bovino’s masked commandos storming a Chicago apartment building after rappelling from a Black Hawk helicopter.

Read: Who wants to work for ICE? They do.

“Memes don’t win the media narrative. Professionalism does,” a veteran official critical of Noem and her team told us. Another former DHS official told us that Trump’s mass-deportation goals have been held back in the process. “Look at the whole thing playing out in Minnesota,” the former official said. “A lot of the controversy and negative optics could have been avoided—and are avoided in other locations—if not for Corey and the secretary.”

Allies of Homan and Scott believe that a reckoning may be coming. “Lewandowski messed up by going to war with Rodney Scott and deploying Bovino to the interior,” one senior DHS official told us. “There is no one at DHS with higher credentials than Scott, and sidelining him for petty reasons distracts from POTUS missions.”

Critics of Scott who spoke with us argue that he lacks the focus and drive to achieve the president’s priorities, spends too much time in meetings that don’t end in decisions, and is failing to do enough to drive the president’s top priority of finishing the border wall. They say that he had little involvement in the CBP deployment to Minnesota and other cities, and did not visit the state to meet with commanders on the ground until this week. “He is not a team player,” one Homeland Security official told us of Scott. “I really think Rodney is kind of on an island.”

During the meeting with Trump on Monday, Noem spoke at length about her concerns with the slow pace of border-wall construction, according to a person briefed on the conversation. Since the start of Trump’s second term, only about 24 miles of wall have been built, including replacement sections, the person said. Noem has made clear that she holds Scott responsible.

“The president was very focused on the status of the wall,” the official said. “The president is pissed.”

The breakdown that led to this week’s shift inside DHS dates back months. Noem lacks the ability to fire Scott, who was confirmed by the Senate, so she has had to get creative. Late last year, her deputies forced Scott to fire several of his senior staff, moves that were recently reported by the Washington Examiner. Scott’s chief of staff was then promoted, and Noem’s office selected a replacement. After Joseph N. Mazzara, an attorney working in Noem’s office, was installed as CBP deputy commissioner, Scott attempted to reclaim control of his agency.

In a memo sent on January 6, described to us by four people familiar with its contents, Scott asked senior leadership at CBP to report to his office any contact they had with “special government employees”—a request that many interpreted as an effort to curtail the influence of Lewandowski. Within hours, the DHS general counsel James Percival had objected to the memo, as had the White House counsel’s office. A White House official told us that the involvement of the White House counsel followed a normal practice of engaging with general counsels at government departments on “issues of common concern.”

Despite the pushback, Scott’s office issued a second memo later that day to senior CBP officials: They should log any communications with officials outside the agency, including senior DHS and White House officials. Both memos were ultimately rescinded after legal pushback from DHS and the White House counsel, these people told us. Scott’s fumbled attempts to curtail outside influence on his agency raised further concerns at DHS headquarters about his leadership. “You don’t get to this level where you jump on your horse and play cowboy like that,” one person familiar with the events told us.

Days later, Scott found his credibility publicly under attack. Politico reported that top brass in Noem’s office had objected to plans for a $2.1 million office refurbishment at CBP headquarters in Washington. (Renovation questions are known to get the president’s attention. Just days earlier, the Justice Department had launched an investigation into the chairman of the Federal Reserve and a $2.5 billion renovation he was overseeing.) The Office of Management and Budget, in a move that has not been previously reported, began asking CBP about the plans, exploring whether they violated the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits spending that contradicts congressional appropriations, according to three people familiar with the outreach.

On the same day that the Politico article was published, Miller gathered agency leaders at the White House to discuss the administration’s success in spending funds appropriated with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Scott told those gathered that starting on February 1, wall construction would speed up dramatically. Others in the department doubt he will be able to achieve his new goals.

A veteran official involved with the border-wall project told us that contracting rules imposed by Lewandowski last summer—which require Noem’s signature on any contract or modification exceeding $100,000—have slowed the pace of construction. The funding bill provides nearly $50 billion for the border wall (10 times the amount that triggered a congressional shutdown in late 2018), and the official estimated that more than two-thirds of the contracts are worth $100,000 or more.

Noem’s team says that this is false, contending that she quickly approves contracts and that CBP has not yet awarded all of the prime contracts for construction. “None of this is on Noem,” the DHS official told us.

In recent weeks, DHS officials have discussed hiring a management contractor to oversee the planning and construction of the border wall, replacing senior officials at CBP. The idea has faced some resistance because it would echo an effort undertaken by former President George W. Bush in 2006, when his administration hired Boeing, a defense contractor and commercial-airplane manufacturer, to oversee $2.5 billion in spending on border security. By 2010, CBP’s inspector general was reporting that the agency had failed to properly manage the contract, which was dogged by missed deadlines and cost overruns.

“Adults have arrived.” That’s how one DHS official deployed in Minneapolis described the appearance of Homan and Scott.

Homan began by meeting with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. “While we don’t agree on everything, these meetings were a productive starting point and I look forward to more conversations with key stakeholders in the days ahead,” Homan announced on social media afterward. Trump officials have been targeting the two men and other Democratic leaders in the state with a criminal investigation and possible obstruction charges. Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, accused them of “terrorism” just two weeks ago.

Administration officials insist that the Minneapolis crackdown will continue, but they have started pulling Border Patrol agents out of the city. Homan is trying to compel Democratic leaders to ease local “sanctuary policies” and give ICE more access to local jails and immigrants with criminal records. Walz and other Minnesota leaders want the government to allow the state to conduct an investigation into Pretti’s killing.

Bovino’s return to his old job on the border leaves the administration without a field commander for the rolling conquest of blue cities that has defined its strategy since May. The White House has not clarified whether that approach will continue or whether Homan will now be in charge of the president’s wider removal campaign. But McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, announced that Noem is “very happy” to have Homan take over in Minnesota. “Her portfolio is really huge,” McLaughlin said.

When the 2018 family-separation policy became a political debacle, Trump officials scrambled to distance themselves. The same impulse is again on display. After previously championing Bovino’s efforts in Minnesota, Noem’s team has this week privately pointed to the arrest quotas pushed by Miller at the White House as a cause of the problems. Miller called Pretti an “assassin” within hours of the shooting. But on Tuesday, he suggested that the failure of the CBP team in Minneapolis to follow White House guidance may have played a role in Pretti’s death.

Bovino’s Border Patrol agents were sent to U.S. cities in part because ICE didn’t have enough deportation officers to meet Miller’s goals. But since last summer, Noem has hired 12,000 new officers, agents, and other staff, more than doubling the size of the ICE workforce. Many of those officers are not ready for deployment, but they could hit the streets in full force over the coming months, giving Homan—or whoever is running the deportation campaign—the ability to ramp up ICE arrests in multiple cities at once. Without Bovino in charge, the effort could look very different, and produce even more deportations.</div>

Updated at 12:00 p.m. ET on January 29, 2026

For a man at the center of history, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has remarkably little information. Walz still doesn’t know the name of the two officers who shot Alex Pretti. He doesn’t have any proof that the officers actually have been placed on administrative leave, as the Department of Homeland Security claimed yesterday. And he has no guarantees, yet, that immigration agents will leave the state. “I don’t trust ’em,” he said on Wednesday in an interview with The Atlantic.

It’s true that President Donald Trump finally did call Walz this week for the first time since tragedy began to unfold in Minneapolis. Trump has been facing political pressure over how his administration has handled Pretti’s shooting, even from supporters. Reaching out directly to Walz was one way to de-escalate.

Trump’s tone in the phone call was conciliatory, Walz said. But the president didn’t make too many concrete concessions. Walz told Trump he needed to “immediately” drop the investigation into the widow of Renee Good, the first U.S. citizen fatally shot by federal agents deployed to the city. Trump said he would check with FBI Director Kash Patel.

In this episode of Radio Atlantic, our staff writer Isaac Stanley-Becker interviews Walz at his office in St. Paul. They discuss Walz’s phone call with Trump, the governor’s dealings with other administration officials, and the surreal nature of the past few weeks in Minneapolis. Stanley-Becker also asks what Walz might do if federal agents don’t, in fact, leave Minnesota.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Hanna Rosin: This week, Donald Trump spoke on the phone with Tim Walz, the Minnesota governor he considers a political enemy. The call was something of a minor concession in a week of minor concessions.

The killing of Alex Pretti by federal agents looks like a turning point. Trump started hearing objections from everywhere, including people who normally support him: Republicans, gun-rights advocates, celebrities, athletes.

So the president made some moves: He ushered [Border Patrol official] Greg Bovino out of Minnesota, the Department of Homeland Security said they put the two agents involved in Pretti’s shooting on administrative leave, and Trump called for a “big investigation” into the shooting.

I’m Hanna Rosin. This is Radio Atlantic. In this episode, an interview with Walz.

Isaac Stanley-Becker: I was out reporting in and around Minneapolis, and this interview with Governor Walz had been set for 3 o’clock, so make my way over to the Capitol—

Rosin: Atlantic staff writer Isaac Stanley-Becker interviewed the governor on Wednesday to get a sense of whether he thinks the promises Trump is making will make a difference on the ground in Minnesota.

Rosin: So going into this interview with Tim Walz, what was the main thing that you were wondering about?

Stanley-Becker: I think I had some practical questions for him about how much he knew about certain really basic details—or, I guess, details that one would assume, under ordinary circumstances, the governor of a state would know, such as: What exactly are federal agents doing in his state? How many of them are there? What are they up to? And then also: What are the names and the identities of federal agents who had just killed a resident of his state?

And just right off the bat, one of the striking things was that he had little information and, in the second case, no information about these questions. So that was a rather striking finding. And I think part of what I then wanted to understand from him related to that is what that’s like for a governor in this moment, to be in that kind of situation.

Stanley-Becker: So you said that Minnesotans don’t let their guard down. It seemed for a moment like there was a real risk that things were unraveling in terms of what’s unfolded here. Have we kind of gotten past that? Have we moved into a somewhat-better place, or is there still a risk of things really spinning out of control, in your mind?

Governor Tim Walz: Well, I think that has a lot more to do with how the White House and President Trump responds. Look, I think there’s a little downturn here, but I don’t think anybody in America thinks this downturn was because Alex was murdered or Renee [Good] was murdered or the chaos that’s on the streets here. I think it’s because there was bad politics for him.

And I’ve talked to the White House, talked to the president, talked to [White House “border czar”] Tom Homan, talked to all kinds of people over the last few days. The interesting thing was, the only thing they never talked about—they never mentioned Alex’s name. They never mentioned Renee’s name. They never asked how the families were. I’ve been talking to ’em. They didn’t really even ask me how Minnesotans were doing in this. They said, What can you do to help us? What can you do to cooperate more? Most of that was misinformation.

So, look, you gotta be hopeful. I’ve got to figure out how to deal with this. This is a very transactional White House; that’s probably the understatement of the world. I go from being called a Communist and the person who started this to: We’re on the same wavelength to fix this.

We’re on the same wavelength—we want this to end. But I don’t know if the White House end state looks the same as mine, ’cause my end state is: You need to get these people out of here. You need to quit the assault on this state. And, look, you’re seeing it in the streets: It’s a physical assault. It’s an armed force that’s assaulting, that’s killing my constituents, my citizens. But there is an all-out attack on all of state government—all the things that make Minnesota great.

Stanley-Becker: Did you see what Pete Hegseth wrote on Twitter, where he said, “ICE > MN,” or ICE above Minnesota? I’m wondering what your reaction to that kind of message is.

Walz: He’s a Minnesotan, for your listeners on this, and not that I would talk about that often, but it’s despicable. It is absolutely despicable. Nothing on there, again, about the families, nothing about what’s going, and this untrained force that anybody, to the casual observer, knows these folks don’t know what they’re doing.

The great example is they had control of the Whipple building, the federal building. That’s the place where they stage ’cause they’re not gonna use state property. And every day, it was a confrontation. They would come out of there all geared up, like they’re in Afghanistan. They would charge people—retired teachers, nurses, students, people who were out there expressing their First Amendment rights. They would throw gas at ’em. They would yell at them. They would heckle. They would do all that.

Well, to try and ease this tension, we took that over—we being the state—and I sent National Guard, folks I served alongside for the years I was in. And my first directive to them was, as I said, When you get up there, I said, you deliver doughnuts. You deliver hot chocolate. You deliver coffee. And you learn the names of those people who are there, ’cause they’re human beings; they’re your neighbors. And my Guard troops are there—no masks on, names on—they’re delivering that, and now the protesters are asking if they can deliver food to the National Guard who are away from their family. That’s how you do policing.

Now, look, if those protesters do something that crosses the line—if they throw something or if they would cross that line from nonviolence—we will arrest them because we’re rule of law. But rule of law means we respect their right to protest.

So there’s a resiliency here, but there’s just deep frustration. And I keep hearing from the White House that we need to cooperate. I don’t know what you want me to say about cooperating with a force who clearly was doing everything wrong, and then, before Alex’s body was cold, they were sullying his name. They were saying lies. They were making outrageous comments. And there were some news-media outlets that were following along on that. This has got to end. This has gotta end.

Stanley-Becker: So the president didn’t ask about Alex or his family. Can you just say a little bit more about what he did say, and is there anything about the conversation that surprised you? This is, if I understand it correctly, only the second time you’ve spoken, the first being in 2020.

Walz: I think I’ve spoken to him a couple times. I’ve been to the White House. I spoke to him during COVID, and I spoke to him in 2020.

Like I said, he’s been saying all kinds of horrible things about me and the people of Minnesota, and the one thing is, he at least tells what his real issue is: He’s lost here three times, and he thinks the elections—and so he has the [attorney general] ask for our election rolls.

Look, he said, Tim, this is very bad. I said, Yes, it’s very bad. And he goes, I just don’t understand you Minnesotans. This worked fine in New Orleans, worked fine in Louisville. I said, You didn’t kill anybody in Louisville or New [Orleans], and you got thousands of people here, Mr. President.

Well, if you just cooperate—we’ve already taken 14,000 people. And I had to tell him—I said, You have not taken 14,000 people. That’s factually inaccurate. But I said, We want you to get outta here. We want to do the things. And I said, I follow federal law. My prisons, if there’s a detainer, we give ’em over to you, so don’t say that.

And he said, Well, I think we can work together. And I said, Well, to work together, you need to do two things: You need to get these guys outta here, and you need to make sure that we get to be part of these investigations. And if charges need to be brought, we need to do it.

Stanley-Becker: And what did he say about that?

Walz: He said, I’ll look into ’em. And then last night, I think he said that he would personally be in charge of the investigations, which should horrify every American ’cause it’s a violation of that separation that he is now running the Department of Justice. And I would just say that I appreciate your offer, Mr. President, but the last thing we want is for you to supervise the investigations into these two murders.

And he said we would work together. And he said, I’ll send Tom Homan out. And I will say this, that Tom Homan landed on the ground, gave me a call right away. We met yesterday, right away in the morning. We came up with a plan. I had my public-safety folks in there, all professional law enforcement. And we’re gonna get back together. He’s meeting with some of them today—them being [the Minnesota Department of] Corrections, [Bureau of Criminal Apprehension,] State Patrol. And then tomorrow, I’m gonna expect that he’s able to tell me how many of these forces are gone and what the next step is.

It was more professional—because Greg Bovino never called me; [DHS Secretary] Kristi Noem never called me. They never called any of our people. So at least Tom Homan understood, Look, this is a mess. This is wrong.

Now, what he thinks is wrong, I’ve yet to be seen, but I thought it’s important that we created a space here, a window of opportunity—and in my opinion, that was about 48 to 72 hours—that if we don’t see a massive change here, I have no choice but to go back and tell my folks that you’re not doing it.

And, look, Minnesotans are out there saying, Well, what are you gonna do if they don’t leave? Well, that’s our next step to figure out.

Stanley-Becker: Well, what are you gonna do if they don’t leave and if the situation doesn’t improve?

Walz: We’re gonna continue to go to the courts. They’re going to continue to get news that shows they are more unpopular in immigration than any president in the last 50 years, and this was supposedly that. And I would remind them we had a special election here yesterday in Minnesota. The results of that race was 95 to 5—the Democrat won. It’s a pretty blue district, but I think you see what’s happening here.

Rosin: Was there any point where Walz felt like he could have done anything differently to de-escalate or tone things down or even prevent what happened? Because he came in somewhat hot, I would say, in his interview with you.

Stanley-Becker: I think he’s been pretty adamant that state and local governments have operated carefully and competently here. And he was firm in his position that, when it comes to immigration enforcement, they’ll comply with federal law, but they’re not gonna go out of their way to take these steps to assist Trump’s immigration-enforcement operations.

Walz: I’m not sure I can do much more. I’m not gonna send my police in to search preschools. I’m not gonna have them walk down the street and ask brown people for their papers. I’m not gonna do that, because that’s not my job and I don’t think it’s constitutional.

If they wanna do their job—and they’ve operated for decades, since they’ve been formed in Minnesota—and if you wanna do it by due process, with humanity, with decency, and by the law, we’ve always worked with you, so I don’t know what more they want.

I’m not gonna join you in battle gear with my people on the streets. I’m not going to grab 5-year-olds out of day cares. I’m just simply not gonna do that. And I’m not gonna not hold you accountable when you do this.

Can we all just ground ourselves, again, that after the first murder, the vice president of the United States said, You have absolute immunity? I don’t know, if I’m Yale, I’m embarrassed. You gave a law degree for that? I don’t have one, and I know that’s not true. But look at what he said.

And I’m telling you, the attitude and the aggressiveness and the interactions of this, countless things—reporters have been there—that these guys joking like it’s a video game and things like that. The disruption and the moral harm that they have done to our state is unimaginable.

And I would just say, if you’re watching this from the outside, and you see some of this, it’s worse than you think; it’s deeper than you think. I think they hate us ’cause we have low childhood-poverty rates. I think they hate us because we have high homeownership rates. I think they hate us because we have a progressive taxation system, meaning if you’re rich, you’re gonna pay more. I think they hate this ’cause it’s a state that works. And that assault will come to your state soon.

Rosin: After the break, we hear Governor Walz’s reaction to the news that federal agents involved in the Alex Pretti shooting have been placed on leave—and if he thinks we’re in a Fort Sumter moment.

Rosin: We’ve all been reading and hearing a lot about Minneapolis, watching the videos. Did he address, at all, the trauma to the state—how it felt to be there?

Stanley-Becker: Oh, boy. He described this as utterly dire.

Walz: We’ve got students not in school. We’ve got students who are afraid. We have people now, and I just have to say it: I have—

Stanley-Becker: One of the kind of amazing moments to me was when he talked about Suburban vehicles, these SUVs, that his own residents, his own constituents, mistook that for ICE vehicles and basically fled from him.

Walz: I’ve watched it: I’ve watched people run. I’ve watched people run when it’s driving. And you think about the psychology of the stress that is. You see vehicles around here that look like this that say, We’re not ICE. I’m a teacher, or whatever.

I asked my team—I said, Maybe we need to say, “It’s security perspective.” I think most Minnesotans wouldn’t run or one-finger-salute me, but you can feel the fear.

Stanley-Becker: Well, what’s the logical end point of this, of this kind of vendetta and also of this kind of open hostility against blue states, blue communities? Do you worry about a kind of civil-war scenario in this country?

Walz: Well, I don’t wanna alarm people, but the people who think that Governor Walz should call in the National Guard and arrest ICE—guns pointed, American at Americans, on this is certainly not where we want to go.

I think what you’re seeing is, is the power far beyond the bullet in this is the people, the people who are out there. The way this ends is, quite honestly, if they’re not able to—and I think [Attorney General] Pam Bondi played the hand, interfering with our election systems—they will be wiped out, and this White House will spend the next two years in court, with people facing, potentially, prosecution, and they will not be able to do their agenda.

But I hear Americans on this, is: What makes you think we can get to November? I’ll go back to my analogy on this: Winter’s long, but we’re prepared for it. If it takes being in the streets ’til November, we’ll be there. If it takes fighting them in court ’til November, we’ll be there.

And I said—just for their thing, if they wanna think about this— Minnesota’s always first or second in voter turnout. Do you not think that tens of thousands of people who stood out in 40 below zero are not gonna show up in a heated voting booth to vote against this? (Laughs.) If you’re a Republican, you’re gonna lose here. And that is going to have repercussions. And, look, people can make peace with their own morality on this, but at some point in time, these people are thinking about that, and you’re seeing it across there.

I think there’s some that actually have conscience. I think [Representative] Tom Massie, I served with, actually does. I think [Senator] Thom Tillis, who I served with and served on committees with. I think these folks truly do have it. I think they found their spine. I think it’s spreading like wildfire.

And what I do know is, if that catches a little more fire, you’re gonna see the most impotent, ineffective presidency you’ve ever seen, because it’s shut down. They can shut it down. They keep asking, What are the Democrats gonna do? We need to do more; we need to do everything. Republicans can end this.

Stanley-Becker: One more question on the National Guard, and you said people want you to order the Guard to arrest the agents. Have you thought about a scenario, a kind of worst-case scenario, in which there’s a clash between these different parts?

Walz: We work at everything to avoid that. And I think, following the law—and it’s one thing that we’ve always done: I will follow the law to a T. I spent eight hours in front of Congress talking about our state. We’re not a sanctuary state. Now, do counties have the ability to make their own? Sure, they do. And that’s always been Minnesota law.

They try to make the case that we’re not helping; we’re not doing this. We have. We follow the law all the way. But I said, We get to this point—it’s what I told them—at what point are we going to have to stand up and push back more? You killed our people, you closed the crime scene, and you won’t tell us who they are.

Does it strike you as strange that I’ve had two of my citizens killed—in one, they’re angry, they being DHS and the president, are angry that it feels like they got doxxed with [Jonathan] Ross’s name, who was part of the shooting of Renee— but I don’t know who did this. I don’t know if these guys are on the streets right now here in Minneapolis.

Stanley-Becker: Well, so there’s been reporting that they were placed on administrative leave. You still don’t know the names of these officers?

Walz: No. No. And I gotta be honest with you—to be generous in this, I’ll do my Ronald Reagan: “Trust, but verify”—I can’t verify this, so I don’t trust ’em. I don’t trust ’em they’re on administrative leave. And at this point in time, I told Tom, I’m gonna give you the benefit of the doubt, but unless I see a reduction in these folks on the streets, I’m gonna have to say that to my folks.

So, look, I think we all wanna avoid that, but I think the reality has sunk in this week. If you thought you could pass this by and you thought there was nothing there, is this a Fort Sumter, John Brown—where are we at on this?

And we’re doing everything right, and I have said it time and time again: The way you win this is through nonviolence, that you cannot do violence. And I know my constituents are mad at me for saying that. They’re shooting us. They’re killing us. They’re beating us. They’re taking our children. But you see what’s happening now. For all that power and all that cruelty, they are retreating massively.

Now, I believe they’ll only retreat far enough to get to the next day or the next news cycle, but again, they underestimated this state, and I think they’re underestimating the American people. I’m still baffled—if you were gonna pick two states to mess with, Maine and Minnesota, especially in the middle of winter, not smart.

Stanley-Becker: You’re still under investigation—is that right?

Stanley-Becker: Did that come up at all in the conversation with the president?

Walz: I will not bring it up. The only thing I asked him on the investigations was I told both the president and Tom Homan they needed to immediately drop the investigation into Renee Good’s wife. And, as a show of goodwill to us, I expected that to be done today; I don’t know if it has been yet. But I will not bring up any of the others, but that one I feel very strongly about.

Stanley-Becker: What did the president say about that?

Walz: I don’t think he replied anything on that, but Tom Homan said he would call [FBI Director] Kash Patel and check with people. He told me that.

Stanley-Becker: Is there anything else about the president’s tone or the dynamic that surprised you or stuck out to you from Monday?

Walz: Other than he was conciliatory towards me, which I know he despises me with a burning passion that I don’t understand. (Laughs.) I feel like I’m a pretty nice guy; I don’t know. But he was very cordial, which I’ve learned enough about this to read him, that he needed something from me badly, so he had to change that. We’ll see.

Stanley-Becker: Do you think that there’s a chance that this might change the immigration debate? And do you think that would be a short-term change or do you think a real transformation in the way the country and the Congress handle this really vexed issue?

Walz: Well, I’d like to think that. I thought we were getting close, and I, whether in Congress and as a governor, but when we’ve been close to this—I really do believe that the Biden administration had a good one on that, and I think it’s pretty clear they killed that ’cause they wanted it to be an election issue. And it was. It was a powerful election issue, and we didn’t have enough to push back in the election of 2024.

But if you really wanna fix this, and that’s what I keep saying is, it’s this straw-man argument that, Well, you’re not cooperating with us. You don’t care if there’s criminal, illegal—their language—criminal undocumenteds. Well, of course I care about that, but I also care deeply and understand that someone who’s willing to carry their children across the Darién Gap, risk life and limb to come here, and clean our homes, and get their children into school, and put little bunny ears on ’em in a Spider-Man backpack, I’m gonna go ahead and stand with those people and figure out a way they can stay.

Rosin: There were points when he was talking to you where it seemed like it was surreal, the experience that he just went through, like [Margaret] Atwood novel–kind of surreal.

Stanley-Becker: I think there’s something surreal about this whole moment, and some of our colleagues have chronicled this really well. But just before we went in for the interview, I was on the phone with a pastor and a mother of four children who was describing her own work and trying to document ICE and kind of interrupt these operations.

And she was saying, like, I’m driving my child to school, and I’m getting these messages about ICE operations in my community, and I’m thinking, Should I go and do this? But, no, I don’t wanna get killed and have my son be motherless. So these monumental decisions that are being made by just ordinary people who are not familiar with these kind of stakes, I think there is something surreal about the whole experience.

Walz: This is nuts. It is absolute insanity. And I don’t know, when it’s written afterwards, I hate to make the comparisons of this, but no one’s ever seen this.

Stanley-Becker: —Fort Sumter, it’s a profound comparison, but—

Walz: The discipline of the people on the streets here—because, look, everybody’s armed; this is America, and this is Minnesota. Myself included.

Stanley-Becker: He brought up these analogies, including John Brown, as a way of suggesting that people in Minnesota were making different decisions. They were not resorting to that kind of violence. So that’s what I took him to be saying.

But I also took him to be saying that we don’t know how these moments are going to unfold and the kind of dire consequences they might have, so we need to be careful, especially in a hair-trigger environment and in an environment where we just, frankly, are seeing things that are unprecedented, that we don’t know the kind of violence or damage could be done.

Stanley-Becker: So there’s certainly a risk of hyperbole, but I think that there is also a risk of understatement and not fully coming to grips with the possible consequences of what we’re seeing.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Millennials love to talk—and gripe—about ambition. What was once a virtue has become a generational bugbear. Millennial women, raised on Girl Power and rom-coms in which the heroine gets the job and the man, joined the workforce just in time for the girlboss culture of the 2010s, which promised that hard work would lead not only to personal success but also to feminist victory. For many American women, no piece of that promise has come true. And, gender aside, anyone who’s gone through two recessions, a pandemic, and the growing precarity of all kinds of careers has reason to side-eye grand dreams of achievement; it’s hard enough to just get by. No wonder that cries of protest such as the Canadian writer Amil Niazi’s 2022 lament, “Losing My Ambition,” in which Niazi declares that she’s “abandoned the notion of ambition to chase the absolute middle of the road: mediocrity,” have gone viral.

Niazi has not given up completely on achievement: She parlayed her hit essay into a new book called Life After Ambition: A “Good Enough” Memoir. In it, she tries to trace the rise and fall of her aspirations as both a personal and a cultural story, framing her gradual disillusionment as a larger meditation on the limits of ambition as a guiding ethic. She describes setting aside her childhood literary dreams as she became overreliant on achievement as a source of self-worth—an issue to which many readers will likely relate, though it’s an especially tough proposition in the media world, which has become increasingly unstable in Millennials’ working lives. Niazi swings between journalistic writing, editing, and production before she lands a job in the BBC’s commissioning department.

But once she’s in that coveted role, motherhood reorients her priorities: She no longer wants work that separates her from her baby. This, too, will be readily relatable. But a less common aspect of her experience—and one Niazi does not explain satisfyingly—is that parenthood also reawakened her urge toward a kind of writing that, she notes, “had very little to do with journalism.” As a new mother, she found that the “urge to create felt overwhelming.” Before having a second baby, she quit her job.

For Niazi, abandoning ambition seems to have meant giving up on a career that the girlbosses of 10 years ago would have admired—one that involves climbing up the rungs of a major media company. But for many of her readers, success might well be what Niazi now has: a widely released memoir and a popular New York magazine column that she describes as a “perfect culmination” of her prior work. Niazi never really delves into this disconnect. And strangely, for someone who mentions that writing is “the only thing I’d ever been both good at and interested in, where I didn’t feel like I was faking it,” she rarely explores her creative urge. In fact, she seems to shy away from any real exploration of what literary ambition means.

For a quest meant to “navigate what a divorce from ‘ambition’ really looks like,” Niazi’s memoir gives its audience little sense of why she continues to pursue writing, or what her relationship to literary craft is. So much of writing is battling your own mind to cough up the clearest idea or best word. Niazi doesn’t discuss the frustrations or satisfactions of this process. Her book may leave readers wondering what aspect of writing compels her most, if it isn’t public success or the private drive to perfect a sentence. As a result, Life After Ambition raises an intriguing question: If conventional visions of success strike so many as bankrupt, how can writers earnestly reclaim—or even hold on to—ambition for art?

As I was reading Life After Ambition, I thought wistfully of another recent memoir about writing: the New Yorker journalist and author Susan Orlean’s immensely heartfelt career retrospective, Joyride. Midway through, Orlean observes that to be “empowered to write, to feel entitled to broadcast your thoughts to the world, is an honor.” Orlean has been broadcasting her thoughts in print for decades, and Joyride is at once her expression of gratitude for that career and a tale of life lived in service to her fundamental drive to write.

Orlean is precise about her motivations. She repeatedly describes her desire to write something fascinating and stylish enough to deserve a stranger’s time—and then do it again, and again, and again. This is an unusual if not unique form of ambition, and Orlean illustrates it vividly. One of her goals, it seems, is to bring her obsession with writing to life for somebody who does not share it. She even makes the composition process—hours alone at her desk—sound dramatic, at one point comparing it with “walking along a narrow ledge and willing yourself to not look down: If you do, you’ll lose your nerve, and you’ll fall.” She then argues that the “single essential element” of quality prose is the confidence it takes to look straight ahead on that ledge. “You need swagger to be a writer at all,” she continues, “to be convinced that readers should listen to you.”

Such explicit writing about writing is a performance of both confidence and ambition: Orlean seems to want to put on such a great show that it compels you to go read her whole catalog. Niazi does show a certain devil-may-care swagger by describing Life After Ambition as merely “good enough,” which all but dares readers to dismiss it. (The phrase presumably winks at the child psychologist D. W. Winnicott’s idea of the “good enough” mother but doesn’t explicitly connect the dots.) In doing so, though, she lowers her audience’s expectations. Orlean, in Joyride, does the opposite. She gives her solitary craft an urgency that cannot help but make readers inspect, and then appreciate, the quality of her writing. Repeatedly she promises that her sentences can rivet and enlighten you; repeatedly, they do just that.

Joyride, it seems to me, is an expression of ambition at its purest in that Orlean achieves the very goals—good storytelling and good prose—that the book discusses. But she never tangles with the tricky nexus of internal and external aspiration, likely because her career has gone so well. Though she does not completely omit her setbacks and times of doubt, she seems to understand that readers might not take seriously the professional insecurities of a writer whom Meryl Streep once played in a movie. Joyride remains squarely in the realm of interior, artistic ambition. It’s about Orlean’s determination to produce better and better work.

Life After Ambition, in contrast, mostly inhabits the realm of the external, and it does not put on a stylistic show. Life After Ambition’s sentences are workmanlike, with an overreliance on set or hackneyed phrases; there’s a lot of “brokenness,” “broken state,” “what was broken in me.” Niazi appears uninterested in asserting her voice on the page, a lack of literary care that seems connected to her tendency—odd in a memoir—to nudge away from introspection.

Read: A society that can’t get enough of work

For instance, she recounts several moments in which a teacher, manager, or partner derided her ambition, treating it as unacceptable given her race or gender. Not wishing to linger on the emotional repercussions of these hurtful incidents is understandable, of course. Still, Niazi treats them with a distinct impersonality, largely using them to gesture at her story’s wider applicability (ambition “becomes a funny thing,” she writes, “when it’s used against you”) and to create a sense that her ambition allowed her to break away from bigots’ and sexists’ idea of who she was supposed to be.

Niazi’s writing about her career moves also shows some unease with the personal. She grew up poor, and the ambition she describes most explicitly is her very relatable desire to “make money and move up the ladder and have a stable life.” As any writer or journalist reading Life After Ambition will know, achieving these goals in tandem can be challenging in media. In fact, making money is sometimes at odds with getting what you want. Niazi is admirably transparent about this reality: At one point, she recounts taking a $20,000 pay cut to work at a new media start-up where her role would involve more writing than her prior one. But she refrains from discussing the emotions or conversations that went into that decision, tucking it instead into a passage about trying for her first pregnancy. Taking a winding or risky career path is common, regardless of one’s background, but it’s often still fraught—and, therefore, ripe for investigation, especially in a book meant to probe ambition. Niazi shows her readers her choices; she just doesn’t tell us what they mean.

None of this would seem all that jarring if Niazi used her desire to write to give readers a deeper idea of who she is. But she doesn’t show herself drafting or consider its frustrations and satisfactions; readers never get to see her wobble on Orlean’s narrow ledge. It is as if Niazi expects her audience either to intuit the reason she pursued writing or not to care, rather than treating her literary yearning as a subject worthy of consideration and time.

In this sense, Life After Ambition is legitimately and heartbreakingly unambitious. Reading it, I wondered whether Niazi didn’t trust that she could interest readers in her real self. The memoir turns instead into a broad and essentially familiar discourse about ambition as a route out of challenging family circumstances; the pursuit of conventional success leading to alienation; the frequent clash between career and parenthood.

Perhaps a serious literary consideration of ambition, one that breaks through the shell of Millennial disillusionment that has hardened around the subject in recent years, would need to follow Orlean’s lead in focusing on craft. After all, it takes confidence to talk about your art—and to get away from convention. In the hip-hop scholar Tricia Rose’s seminal Black Noise, the graffiti writer and rapper Fab Five Freddy tells Rose that what makes his art satisfying is “that pressure on you to be the best. Or to try to be the best. To develop a new style nobody can deal with.” A goal like that might torment you, and it might end in failure nine times out of 10, but the most common complaint about conventional ambition is that it so often turns into a trap. If your goal is to chase artistic innovation, to try to tell the best story or put on the best show you can, then effort becomes its own reward.

They have lost focus a long time ago and they will not get it back even if they crash and burn.

If Too Big To Fail is a thing, then Too Rich To Give A Shit is certainly a thing.

Windows 2000 was good for its time.  I would love a version of Windows 2000 with an up-to-date security model.

Sorry, too late. The trust was killed by MS a long time ago and I don&#39;t think they can get it back. I&#39;ve pretty much weaned myself off of MS products at home; the last remaining one is Onenote which I use via the web interface and even there I&#39;m slowly pulling the information off and deleting notebooks.

I only use Windows when forced to at work, and even then, I do my best to live in the WSL world. I&#39;ve got some time left before I retire, but I&#39;m really looking forward to retirement and ending the MS world.

So more people moves to better operating systems.

Maybe they can swarm and suggest some Linux distros to move to.

&#39;Microsoft wants you to know that it knows that Windows 11, now used by a billion users, has been testing your patience and announced that its engineers are being redirected to urgently address the operating system&#39;s performance and reliability problems through an internal process the company calls &quot;swarming.&quot;&#39;

&quot;Brooks&#39;s law is an observation about software project management that &quot;Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.&quot; (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/... [wikipedia.org])

They can regain trust by removing the following:

1. Telemetry.
2. Advertising.
3. &quot;AI&quot;.
4. Mandatory Microsoft account.
5. Arbitrary restrictions on supported hardware (TPM, CPU age).

6.  Restore old utilities the way they were, such as Notepad, WordPad and Paint (without the AI)

7.  Give people the option of using past Windows user interfaces, even if they don&#39;t make it the default.  For instance, let one make Windows 11 or 12 look like Windows 7, if that&#39;s the look & feel one enjoys

8.  If they have to include a News app, give people the option of entering the websites of the news sources they trust, not the ones MS wants us to read

We need to improve Windows in ways that are meaningful for peopleThat statement is clear, Windows is not a useful or meaningful, or usable operating system, across the board.  Microsoft is admitting this, Microsoft, how bad does a product have to be, for Microsoft to admit it&#39;s terrible?  If you need any more convincing that you can&#39;t utilize Windows as a professional, you&#39;re a fraud.  Not a confused, but understandable idiot, a fraud, no different from someone who takes money for a job, and disappears.  It&#39;s over, Windows is not a usable operating system, from Microsoft

They should have invested in extremely small violins.

The gambling/looting operations will not be missed.

This includes things like auto repair shops, dentists, veterinarians, home improvement contractors.

PE has been seeping into these businesses by buying out the owners.

A good way to tell if a company is PE-owned if they won&#39;t tell you is to look at their consumer contract.

Firms owned by PE extract as much from the customer as they legally can and leave no value on the table. Their contracts are full of binding arbitration, evergreening (automatic renewal) clauses, and short warranty periods.

Investing is gambling, just with a little more information about the game. Have you made bad bets and you don&#39;t want to sell at a loss? Well... Tough!

The smartest guys in the room somehow failed to realize that 40% compounded growth forever at 80%-3000% gross margins wasn&#39;t possible. It can happen for 5-10 years of an economic turnover (whether driven by new technology, new forms of organization, immigration, or other fundamental changes) but just because it happens to some organizations for 5, 10, even 20 years does not mean it can/will happen to every organization - and trees don&#39;t grow to the sky.

You may have to change jobs to get rid of those awful funds. The whole 401K thing is a closed garden racket.

Ever wonder why you can&#39;t invest in an IRA when your employer offers a 401K?

Ever wonder why the annual contribution limits for IRA&#39;s are much lower than 401K&#39;s?

Ever wonder why the owner of a small business can invest more in a &quot;Sole Proprietor&quot; IRA or SEP then an employee can if they work for a company who doesn&#39;t offer a 401K?

These rules are there because special interests were able to lobby for them

Seems like there is too much money out there.

Famously, they’ve been buying up residential homes and apartments at a torrid pace, with all the fun that will bring.

But they are also buying up small service firms like my plumber (and funeral homes, and insurance agencies, and medical/dental practices, and). My plumber probably has 100 employees. So, not tiny, but not huge, either. I knew the guy who started it. He sold out. I suppose I can’t blame him. First thing I notice next time I need help?  Hourly rates doubled.  Parts much more expensive.

I get these PE masters of the universe are going to buying and selling companies. It’s what they do. But can they stay off Main Street?

We will wake up 10 years from Now and none of the local businesses you use will be locally owned. I think that’s a bad thing.

Spare me any talk that they are providing some sort of efficiency service here. I bet my plumber’s business is well run. What they found was that they could charge a lot more for worse service. That’s all.

Time to find a new plumber.Once PE buys a home improvement contractor, they change the terms in the contract to extract all the value for themselves and leave nothing on the table for the consumer.

Read the contract before committing to any new business. The contract will almost tell you that a business is PE owned. It will have shitty terms for you and indemnify them.

Id released DOOM the Dark Ages in 2025 on the PS5. It looks like Starfield has a pending Playstation release this year.  Elder Scrolls 6 does look like a PC/Microsoft XBOX exclusive.  Is there  a document that confirms your claims of xbox/pc only for those companies? They claimed the opposite about exclusives, but it would not be the first time M$ lied.

I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve seen an ES6 game-play trailer much less it being an exclusive.  Considering how well Skyrim and Fallout 4 sold on Playstation I just don&#39;t see them making those games exclusives, at least not forever, at most it&#39;ll be the PS version released after PC/Xbox.

Everything the XBox division is doing is leaning away from bespoke hardware consoles and that makes sense for them, they&#39;d rather be a big publisher and leaving the bespoke hardware to Sony and Nintendo, it&#39;s basically PC all the way no

Last I checked, new Switch sales are strong.

Actually, more layoffs and Microsoft game price hikes would probably help.

It would get a lot more game developers out of these massive corporate run megastudios that can&#39;t seem to be able to produce a game on schedule anymore, and into smaller and more nimble startup companies who have a financial incentive to release something on time.

As I recall they&#39;ve announced that they&#39;re pretty much done with hardware and moving to streaming games. Not surprising folks aren&#39;t buying the expensive box when they can get an Amazon Fire Stick instead.

(Sony CEO) &quot;I want the severed head, of the one that put a 75% discount on our $600 PS6, on my desk by COB.&quot;

I imagine the conversation going more like:

Sony Engineering Underling: &quot;RAM is going to cost 3 times more for the PS6 because Open AI bought up all of the supply for the next 18 months.&quot;

&quot;Sony CEO: Shit... raise the price on the PS6 by $300!&quot;

Microsoft Engineering Underling: &quot;RAM is going to cost 3 times more for the XBox WhateverWeWereGonnaCallIt because Open AI bought up all of the supply for the next 18 months.&quot;

Microsoft CEO: &quot;Meh, who cares. We want everyone using Azure anyway. Cancel the new XBox Whateve

I&#39;m wondering if the gaming industry didn&#39;t recognize a bubble started by the couf which is now in the final stages of crashing.

I&#39;m also wondering if GenZ&#39;s attraction to simplification, analog presence, raw dogging, and other factors left the industry with nowhere to go when their main audience (which I guess would include me) aged out.

I predict MS will &quot;remedy&quot; this by sticking allegedly fancy AI in it and promising soon-to-be-released modules that fetch you a beer and yank you off while gaming. The predicted best-selling title will be Boebert&#39;s Theater Counter-Stroke II

When one doesn&#39;t have tpm2 or whatever it&#39;s called...My t5500 doesn&#39;t mind...

Windows 11 was released in October, 2021 four full years before Win 10 went off support... That doesn&#39;t seem very &quot;fast&quot; to me...

1 billion is a big number. Nothing feels fast when the target number gets big.

&quot;Up over 45 percent year-over-year.&quot; Yes, but this article is about the rate increase this year which is undoubtedly attributable to end of support.

Yes, but this article is about the rate increase this year which is undoubtedly attributable to end of support.

Reason there was never a Windows 9 is that anything under Windows 95 or Windows 98 named directories would have fallen under it had anyone typed
 
C:\>  dir &quot;Windows 9*&quot;

Dave Plummer explains it in one of his videos

How fast did Windows 10 hit the one billion mark after Windows 7 went off support?   That&#39;s the real comparison.

Well Windows has always been forced. Literally nearly everyone who got a new version of windows got it because it came with their new PC, or with a hardware refresh through their employer. Then along came Windows 10, the first truly optional and free upgrade, and Microsoft used all sorts of dark patterns and popups and nags to get Windows 7 users to accidentally install Windows 10, and Windows 7 also reached EOL at some point.

So yeah it&#39;s still significant how quickly this happened, despite it being forced

The height of the PC waste dump piles serve as Nadella&#39;s phallic temples.

Lot of people implying that hardware requirements would prevent people from switching. This might have been true for some, but apparently for many users it wasn&#39;t (which made sense; the TPM requirement is for very old PCs). So &quot;ending&quot; support for Windows 10 did what Microsoft wanted, moved users to Windows 11.

By the way, I just recently tried to update an old Windows 10 PC (of a family member), and Windows Update simply offered me to extend the support by a year.

Windows 11 would have virtually no users if it wasn&#39;t for Microsoft and hardware manufacturers colluding to force people into upgrades.

Wide adoption doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s popular when it isn&#39;t voluntary.=Smidge=

It&#39;s Windows 10 with a webpage as start bar and a bunch of bugs introduced with vibe coding (and a better memory manager somehow)

It&#39;s Windows 10 with a webpage as start bar and a bunch of bugs introduced with vibe coding (and a better memory manager somehow)Windows 10 was already webpage as a start bar, it&#39;s why it was so easy to bring back the Windows 7 style. All Windows 11 did was change the style a bit.It would be more accurate to say Windows 11 *is* Windows 10. But don&#39;t take my word for it, open up your coding tool of choice and do an API call to GetVersion() and see what Windows 11 thinks it is. Also of note the most recent OS identification helper function Microsoft published is IsWindows10OrGreater()Not even Windows will tell you if it&#39;s Windows 11 in

> It&#39;s just Windows 10 with a new number added.

I never said anything about Windows 10 though?

What forces a user to upgrade? Many users have chosen to remain on Win 10 for whatever reason, and they have not lost any functionality they had before Win 10 went EOL, except for security updates, and as I recall, windows updates were a big frustration (at least according to Linux advocates when they chimed in on any windows topics on /.)...

Windows 11 would have virtually no users if it wasn&#39;t for Microsoft and hardware manufacturers colluding to force people into upgrades.You can say that about literally every windows every released since 3.11. People got new windows with new hardware. The exception was Windows 10 and that first ever free upgrade that people could &quot;voluntarily&quot; get came with a lot of tricks to get people to update from Windows 7.

Well that&#39;s patently false. It wasn&#39;t until Win10 was out that Microsoft decided it would not let you install Win7 on CPUs made after ~2017. No technical limitation for that by the way, because both official and unofficial patches existed that would allow it.

And this is not the same as the OS requiring new hardware. This is the OS deliberately rejecting newer hardware. So if you got new hardware, you did not have a choice but to upgrade Windows too.=Smidge=

Do they mean a 45% increase in installs, or a 45% increase in the quarter-over-quarter upgrade rate?

I.e., did they really gain almost a half a billion installs in 3 months? That&#39;s hard to imagine even considering the deprecation of Windows 10.

But if they went from 10,000 users a month to 14,500 users a month that is MUCH different story.

Putting a stake in the ground for the end-of-life for a version of your OS is reasonable thing to do.   What&#39;s not reasonable is when the successive version is worse, and no one wants it.   Windows biggest competitor has always been the previous version of Windows.  After 40 years, Microsoft should have realized why.

Some new versions of Windows were improvements over all, but the last one for which that was true was Windows 7 (and before that was XP), and it&#39;s probably the last one that will ever feel like

None of them except Windows? What other commercial OSes do that?

A comment that ignores the fact that forced upgrades have been the Windows mainstay since computing started. Literally everyone &quot;upgraded&quot; Windows by having the latest version automatically on their new hardware. It has always been forced on you. If anything Windows 11 is refreshing such that the upgrade is once against tied to something to do with hardware.

People bitch about the fact that Windows 10 was optional and available as an upgrade but forget that this fact made it an absolute outlier in the histor

> A comment that ignores the fact that forced upgrades have been the Windows mainstay since computing started.

Buying a new computer is somewhat different from upgrading only your OS. That&#39;s what the subject is about.

Back then everybody was on Windows 7. The Windows 8 users upgraded immediately.

w8 was meant to be skipped. the sensible upgrade path for windows was:

wfwg3.11 -> w98se -> nt/2000 -> wxp -> w10.

provided you waited about a year after each release. mostly everything inbetween was toxic or didn&#39;t work sensibly. w11 is toxic but at least works. most of the time.

Not sure that&#39;s correct.  It would have been Workgroups 3.11 -> Windows 95 -> Windows 2000 -> Windows 7.  After that, maybe Windows 10

Windows 98 had its bugs, and Windows XP&#39;s first edition didn&#39;t support > 320MB.  At that time, I had a 540MB HDD, which I wanted to be completely a single partition C:\, but I was forced to just keep it at 320MB.  It was only after SP2 that I could have the entire 540MB as C:\.  That&#39;s why, after Windows 2000, the next jump would have been Windows 7

Windows 10 was an upgrade to Windows 8, and to Windows 8.1 ... back when I installed it.But Windows Updates since then have removed pre-installed programs and made the system much slower.

Not to mention the irremovable Cortana icon that lingered in my task bar for a few years, despite Cortana never being available in my region.

Not sure whether you&#39;re being facetious, but I had a Windows 8 laptop in 2015, which was a pain to use.  A previous one I had already converted to PC-BSD: this one I converted to Windows 10 the moment it became available.  Windows 7 was the greatest version of Windows ever, and Windows 10 followed

Windows 11 would actually have been fine, had they not tried to forcefeed us AI, and also, had they left utilities like Notepad, WordPad and Paint alone.  That&#39;s not the case w/ Windows 8 ten years ago: I had it

Because the actual numbers do not look good. Apparently, more people are going back to Win10 than the other way round now. With the way Win11 keeps crashing on me (on two different computers that were entirely fine under Win11), I am tempted too.

With the way Win11 keeps crashing on me (on two different computers that were entirely fine under Win11), I am tempted too.What?

With the way Win11 keeps crashing on me (on two different computers that were entirely fine under Win11), I am tempted too.

Hard freezes during teams sessions (only reset button helps), graphics driver crashes. All with up-to-date drivers and hardware that had zero problems under Win10.  On entirely different systems. The crashes started immediately after the downgrade to Win11.

When I bought a new laptop that came with Vista, I _paid_ for an XP license so I could go back to that.

I upgraded to Windows 11 around the end-of-life deadline.  Things were mostly the same (I&#39;ve been using OpenShell for a long, long time), although my machine (and my new Windows 11 work machine) have been locking up on me occasionally, something I don&#39;t recall happening with Windows 10, or if it did, it was much rarer.

These numbers were released as part of an earnings call that drove the stock down more than 10%. It&#39;s taking the market with it today, it&#39;s a really, really bad day for Microsoft.

These numbers aren&#39;t really what did it but . . . still though.

Does anyone have precise numbers? I&#39;m pretty sure Windows 8 was supported a full year longer into the Windows 10 cycle than Windows 11 was into Windows 10&#39;s. The adoption rate is not at all impressive considering that . . . though if they wanted to take credit for the surge in the Linux desktop . . . that is much, much, much, much bigger than the last cycle.

Even as an old man on /. I&#39;ve never been in the spelling Microsoft with a $ camp of haters, but this is just embarrassing.

It&#39;s like Fidel Castro bragging about receiving 100% of the vote.

&quot;Windows reached a big milestone...&quot;Shouldn&#39;t that be &quot;millstone&quot;, as in the debilitating weight of spyware, rentware, adware, bloatware, and AI hallucinations hanging around the necks of Windows 11 users?

Shouldn&#39;t that be &quot;millstone&quot;, as in the debilitating weight of spyware, rentware, adware, bloatware, and AI hallucinations hanging around the necks of Windows 11 users?

you get upgrades, did people really need to do this? No. And the worst part of it is Microsoft is in bed with the hardware manufacturers on forced upgrades, so instead of improving windows 10 and optimizing it we get a forced upgrade of something that is worse in many degrees.

Most of those were accidental upgrades and it left such a bad taste in their victim&#39;s mouths that they switched to linux or mac, so only about 230,000,000 of those are legit, well, the vast majority of those are forced by external factors. So, let&#39;s see, there&#39;s 39,254 users that are using it voluntarily, and I think I head three or four of them liked it, though I know one of those guys is going through some shit right now, so who knows what he&#39;ll think once he&#39;s back out of the mental hospital.

I look at the windows users with a sort of bewilderment.I guess it&#39;s all about the apps.Meh, nothing that I need.

The optimistic story about the FBI’s surprising Wednesday raid on Fulton County, Georgia, voting offices to seize ballots and electronic materials related to the 2020 election is that it’s another instance of the United States Department of Justice and other parts of the federal government indulging in Donald Trump’s fantastical belief that he lost the presidential election to Joe Biden in 2020 because of fraud. If that reason for the raid is right, the investigation will amount to very little, even if Trump and allies mangle whatever evidence the FBI produces to continue spreading ridiculous voter fraud claims. If the government attempts to bring criminal charges (that may well be barred by the statute of limitations), they are far more likely to be about Trump’s retribution campaign than about actual intentional violations of federal law protecting the integrity of elections.

The pessimistic story is far darker. It’s about the raid being a test run for messing with election administrators and the counting of ballots in the midterm elections in 2026, when control of both houses of Congress could be at stake. Now is the time for state and local governments, the courts, and the people to work against such potential election subversion.

The Fulton County saga goes back to the hotly contested 2020 presidential election, which was conducted in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Donald Trump was an unpopular incumbent running against former Vice President Joe Biden. Many states made it easier for people to vote by mail in 2020, which was much safer than voting in person and potentially getting sick. Trump had long spread unsubstantiated claims about voter fraud, from massive noncitizen voting to fraud committed in large American cities like Philadelphia and Detroit that have substantial minority populations. But during 2020, Trump turned his propaganda machine on the influx of mail-in ballots, which he claimed would be infected by fraud; never mind that he regularly voted by mail in his home state of Florida.

Election results came in slowly, thanks in part to the slower count necessary to properly process the flood of mail-in ballots. When the numbers were released, Biden had won, including in Georgia, where he claimed victory by a slim margin. Trump tried various tactics to overturn that result and others. Before the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol—an unsuccessful attempt to stop Congress from counting states’ Electoral College votes and declare Trump the winner—Trump leaned on election administrators and elected officials in states with majority-Republican legislatures to overturn the results. Even though Georgia had conducted a hand recount of all the state’s ballots that confirmed Biden’s victory, Trump notoriously pressured Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to “find” 11,780 votes to flip the results to him. Raffensperger refused.

While Trump worked the refs, his allies worked the public, and much of the effort to gin up fraud claims focused on the processing of ballots in State Farm Arena by Fulton County election workers. Focusing on an area with a large population of Black voters was par for the course among Trump’s fraudulent fraud-squad members. Rudy Giuliani falsely accused two election workers there of fraud (as well as passing around drugs), and they faced threats and harassment; the workers, Wandrea Moss and her mother, Ruby Freedman, won a $148 million defamation suit against Giuliani, which later settled.

Fulton County, like many large counties in the United States, has seen its share of election administration mismanagement. But a yearslong investigation by state officials found no intentional wrongdoing and nothing that would have changed the 2020 outcome.

Given the deep investigations of the 2020 elections generally and Fulton County, Georgia, in particular, it is highly unlikely that the new FBI investigation (whose warrant was curiously sought by a U.S. attorney in Missouri, not Georgia or even Washington, D.C.) will amount to anything. So what was it really about?

One tipoff is the curious appearance during the FBI raid of Fulton County’s election offices of Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, who is known to peddle conspiracy theories herself. Portraying this raid as part of a national security effort is in line with the musings of Cleta Mitchell, a Trump conspiracy-theory ally who had been on Trump’s call with Raffensperger. Back in September, Mitchell, on a call with fellow election deniers, suggested that Trump could declare a “national sovereignty crisis” in a bid to take over the midterm elections.

Trump has no power over the conduct of federal elections, which are left in the hands of the states, a point numerous courts have made recently in striking down parts of an August Trump executive order purporting to make voting harder. But that doesn’t mean he won’t try. Trump has expressed regret that he did not seize voting machines in 2020. So this threat for 2026 (and 2028) is real.

So what can be done about all of this? To begin with, state and local election officials need to be ready to go to federal court to seek injunctions barring the government from seizing voting machines or otherwise interfering with the process of tabulating ballots. Trump might even try to send troops to seize ballots without a search warrant, and if that threat is real, proactive judicial action is necessary. These threats are most likely to materialize in those areas around the country with contested congressional races. Particular targets may be in those states, such as California and Arizona, where the tabulation of ballots takes a long time, so there is more time for Trump and his allies to act.

State officials and the public need to support, with dollars and volunteers, election administrators and those who would hold the line against interference. The greater the transparency of the work of these administrators in tabulating ballots, and the quicker a fair count can take place, the harder it will be for Trump to have a legal excuse to try to interfere with the balloting.

Donald Trump is not going to be able to cancel U.S. elections. But the events this week in Fulton County remind us that he has many tools at his disposal to try to mess with them. It’s not too early to plan against another attempt to overturn democratically conducted elections in the United States.

How do you stop someone from killing someone else? In most societies, we do so with warnings, promises, and contracts. We make laws to make ourselves feel safe. It’s important to feel safe, because reality is terrifying. In Minneapolis this weekend, we saw reality: a group of men with guns, in a semicircle, firing a barrage of shots into a man’s body lying on the ground. The laws that were supposed to protect Alex Pretti—the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, multiple state and local and national statutes on use of force—failed. Pretti’s death, captured on video from multiple angles, was so shocking that even the Trump administration has been forced to rethink its brutal tactics in the Twin Cities, which for more than a month has been ravaged by an onslaught of federal agents ostensibly conducting “immigration enforcement.”

Now, the Trump administration is shifting its approach, or at least its messaging. Gregory Bovino, the cartoonishly fascist figurehead of Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s operations in the Twin Cities, has been removed from his post and forced off social media. Kristi Noem, Bovino’s boss at the Department of Homeland Security, received a brief, but significant, rebuke from the president. The Democrats, America’s sluggish and often ineffectual opposition party, are howling for investigations, firings, and impeachments.

It’s tempting to see these developments as a victory, as the rule of law slowly reasserting itself over a deadly aberration in America’s social contract. Soon, you might think, things may go back to normal. But in Donald Trump’s America, the contract has been rewritten. The conditions that caused Pretti’s death still exist—in Minneapolis, in Maine, in California, in every city and every town where agents of the state carry guns. The goon squads are here to stay, and it’s only a matter of time until they kill again.

What this reflects is more than the Trump administration’s vicious immigration policies, but a broader shift in American politics. Inside the West Wing, a terrifying new political ideology is on display, one that says the right to shape, change, and end Americans lives is not granted by a democratic framework of laws, but by a simple equation of who has more guns.

This shift was not immediate. During the first Trump administration, the snarl of legal jurisprudence that slowed down many of Trump’s most egregious excesses also lured us into a false sense of comfort that the law still worked, and that the contract still held—and sometimes it did. When Trump attempted to overturn the 2020 election, the system worked. Judges threw out his cases. When rioters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, they were prosecuted en masse for their crimes. Trump himself was impeached, though never convicted, thanks to the cowardice of a bloc of Republican senators.

Upon entering his second term, Trump went for it, not so much testing as smashing through the constraints of legal precedent—he pardoned the criminals who stormed the Capitol on his behalf and indicted many of the officials that, in turn, had indicted him. On the border, he saw a chance to test his might: calling in Marines to quell protesters in Los Angeles and increasing the DHS’s purview to arrest, detain, and raid far outside of their preexisting jurisdictions.

The guardrails are not holding this time around.

Minneapolis represents the most stark example of the rule of the gun thus far. During “Operation Metro Storm,” the ominously named federal operation in the Twin Cities, federal agents have shot three people, killed two, and injured dozens with pepper spray, rubber bullets, tear gas, and fists. Until Pretti’s death finally tipped the scales, Noem and other figures in the administration doubled and tripled down on their mandate to use force. Jonathan Ross, the agent who shot Renee Good, the first person killed by ICE in the Twin Cities, currently faces no charges, after the FBI intervened to toss out the state-level investigation into the killing.

Federal agents have repeatedly violated protesters’ First Amendment rights, detained citizens and noncitizens alike unlawfully, and even sought to prevent detainees from accessing legal counsel. The Department of Justice, instead of investigating these abuses, has instead leveled charges on the protesters. There are videos all over social media of officers, after Good’s killing, taunting protesters with threats that they will be next. The men with guns knew the power they held. They knew no one could stop them from killing.

And so when Alex Pretti stood up in the middle of the street, filming them with his phone, and intervened to try to help another civilian they had pushed to the ground, they shot him. He had, after all, committed a crime in their eyes: He had resisted the administration’s will. The agents who killed Pretti have not been identified or charged; like in Good’s killing, there will be no federal civil rights investigation, only an internal process overseen by the department that fired the shots. (Two of the agents involved in shooting Pretti have now been put on leave, but that’s a far cry from meaningful consequences for what they did.) Even if, by some miracle, Good’s and Pretti’s killers are eventually brought to justice, their individual consequences do nothing to subvert ICE’s mandate of force wherever it appears. ICE can afford to discipline or lose an agent or two to mollify public opinion. They have plenty more operating, still, under the same rules of engagement.

Under Trump’s new government-by-gun, individuals are presented with a choice between obedience and execution—or at least the ever-present danger of it. And without legal recompense, the only check to this power appears to be other armed men.

In Maine, where ICE and other agencies have been conducting snatch-and-grab arrests and targeted harassment of protesters similar to those in Minneapolis, local law enforcement has already staked out a hard line against their excesses, something that Minneapolis’ authorities were slow to do. Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce called ICE’s actions “bush-league policing” in an interview on Sunday, after federal agents mistakenly arrested a local corrections officer. This pressure has also changed the situation in Minneapolis, where Gov. Tim Walz has managed to muster a largely tepid show of force from his own military, the Minnesota National Guard, deploying them to the streets in cute reflective vests with donuts and coffee.

It’s easy to see those images and miss what they mean. The National Guard is often seen as a friendly force that shows up with bottled water during hurricanes and digs out roads after mudslides. But that’s not what they are: They are armed forces that are ostensibly under the command of a state governor. Their presence on the streets of Minneapolis, orange vests and all, is a show of force by a state military aligned opposite of a federal military. Right now, it’s no more than optics. But lines are being drawn.

And things could always get worse. The National Guard and domestic police are not sympathetic forces to many of this country’s marginalized groups. In L.A. and D.C., National Guard troops squared up with protesters themselves, and their orders come from political actors—governors, mayors, and other politicians with their own biases and agendas.

Soldiers and police, however, are not the only people in America who have guns. As the top levels of our political system wield violence in the open, it’s only a matter of time before people tired of having guns pointed at them may decide that it’s time to have more guns to point back. Communities I have reported on for years are beginning to mobilize again. Online, left-wing accounts and marginalized groups are openly championing the Second Amendment, abandoning arguments for reasonable gun control in favor of arming themselves to face a future in which their only defense is through open force. There was nothing to stop ICE agents from killing Alex Pretti, their thinking goes, so the next time it happens someone might as well shoot back. A brutal occupation unrestrained by any notion of fairness or recompense often inspires a violent response, which would plunge our society into circumstances it has rarely, if ever, seen before: widespread violence on the streets and guerilla attacks on federal forces that inspire even more brutal reprisals and repression.

It’s still possible to regain control of our society before we get to that point; to organize and protest and document well enough that a better future is made possible before the rule of the gun is all we have left. We’ve seen that approach have some success , in this specific case: The administration’s excesses were so blatant and cruel—and so highly publicized—that politicians on both sides of the aisle were forced to hold them to account. But so far, Trump’s response looks more like damage control than a larger shift in approach. The goon squads are still on the streets, still hauling people into their vans. They will learn from this defeat. They will get better at killing. And unless we find a way to upset the architects of our new political order, they’re almost certainly going to do it again.

The big question about President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace—which he formally announced while at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week—is whether it’s a scam, a delusion, or both.

Trump first mentioned a Board of Peace in September during the signing of a ceasefire accord for Israel’s war in Gaza. The idea was that the board would be the forum where Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and other Middle East countries discuss political reforms, reconstruction, and other issues relating to security and long-term peace in Gaza. Trump would chair the board—a role that he improbably insisted wasn’t his idea, but the plan made some sense, given that Trump played a major role in prodding the parties to sign the ceasefire.

However, in the months since, Trump’s vision of the board has—like much else about his presidency—swelled with self-aggrandizement. The board’s charter—which he hasn’t publicized but which the Times of Israel obtained and published—doesn’t mention Gaza at all. Rather, the document states that the board will seek “to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict”—seeming to indicate any sort of conflict, anywhere on earth.

The members on the board will consist of whichever heads of state the chairman, Donald Trump, chooses to invite. Their terms of membership will last three years, unless they pay the board $1 billion, which would buy them lifetime tenure. (Trump is designated as chairman for as long as he likes, certainly beyond the remaining three years of his presidency, gratis.)

The board will decide policies and declare resolutions by majority vote, but the chairman (read: Trump) gets veto power; he can also initiate measures unilaterally, eject members, and choose his own successor.

In other words, the Board of Peace marks yet another episode in Trump’s massive meandering ego trip. More than that, its charter, laid out in formal legalese, is sheer fantasy. It is no surprise that most of the heads of state whom he invited to join, notably those with proven interest in peace and “lawful governance,” have declined.

The naysayers include France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom—in short, many of our leading allies. Trump retracted his invitation to Canada after its prime minister, Mark Carney, delivered a much-lauded speech at Davos calling on middle-sized countries to avoid unfair pressures from larger powers by banding together. (Trump’s retraction, which he posted on social media, bolsters the impression that this is all about Trump, not world peace.)

Those who have said they will join include Argentina, Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Belarus, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Egypt, El Salvador, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Kosovo, Morocco, Mongolia, Pakistan, Paraguay, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. None of them are members of the U.N. Security Council (which Trump preposterously hopes to supplant), only a few practice “lawful governance,” and even fewer have any experience at seriously mediating conflict. It is not known whether any of them have been foolish enough to pony up the $1 billion initiation fee—nor has Trump or anyone else said who would control this slush fund. (Want to take a guess?)

The leaders of China, India, and Russia are among those who haven’t yet responded. This is no surprise. These are regional, aspiringly global powers who have a serious (if, in some cases, disruptive) interest in matters of war and peace. And they must know that Trump’s Board of Peace is not serious.

In his gushing invitation letter, Trump declared that his goal is to “bring together a distinguished group of nations ready to shoulder the noble responsibility of building LASTING PEACE.” In his snitty retraction letter to Prime Minister Carney, he brayed that Canada would thereby be excluded from “what will be the most prestigious Board of Leaders ever assembled at any time.”

If Trump believes his own hype (always an uncertainty), he reveals here once again that he has no idea what peace, especially “LASTING PEACE,” requires. To the extent Trump currently has the power to elicit feigned respect and sometimes reluctant obedience from other world leaders, it’s because he is president of the United States—meaning that he can exert the tremendous leverage of the world’s main currency and most powerful military.

Once his term in the Oval Office ends in three years, no leader would have any reason to pay him the slightest attention or courtesy. No leaders embroiled in conflict would welcome the mediation of his so-called Board of Peace, much less follow its orders.

Maybe some leaders would consent to a meeting if the board really were composed of “the most prestigious” peacemakers. But look at who, according to a statement from the White House, is on the group’s “founding” executive board: Trump’s globe-trotting emissary, Steve Witkoff, and son-in-law Jared Kushner (whose efforts to end Russia’s war on Ukraine have been especially aimless); Marc Rowan (a billionaire financier who has led Trump’s political pressure campaigns on American universities); Robert Gabriel (a former producer of Laura Ingraham’s TV show who is now Trump’s deputy national security adviser); Secretary of State Marco Rubio (whose influence will fade along with Trump’s at the end of this administration, at least if he remains under his post-presidential thumb); Sir Tony Blair (whose record as Britain’s prime minister still makes many in the Middle East shudder); and Ajay Banga, president of the World Bank.

Banga is an interesting choice: He was nominated to the World Bank by President Joe Biden, he worked with Vice President Kamala Harris, and he knows something about world politics.* The others, once untethered from a sitting American president, would have no authority in making peace whatsoever.

Even with the power of the White House and the imprimatur of a U.N. Security Council resolution, Trump’s current Board of Peace has been unable to make headway on molding long-term peace in Gaza, the one conflict it was created to help solve. (The Security Council limited the board’s authority solely to rebuilding Gaza and set it to expire at the end of 2027.) The idea that it can roam the globe on its own, ending wars with no base of power or authority, is risible.

If the next president is a Democrat, one of their first tasks will probably be to order the words “Donald J. Trump” to be removed from the august wall of the Kennedy Center. There will, however, be no need to worry about dismantling, or doing anything about, the Trump Board of Peace; it will quickly collapse of its own accord.

Correction, Jan. 29, 2026: This post originally misstated that Banga advised Harris during her 2024 campaign.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Corporate use of AI agents in 2026 looks like the Wild West, with bots running amok and no one quite knowing what to do about it - especially when it comes to managing and securing their identities.

Organizations have been using identity security controls for decades to ensure only authorized human users access the appropriate resources to do their jobs, enforcing least-privilege principles and adopting zero-trust-style policies to limit data leaks and credential theft.

&quot;These new agentic identities are absolutely ungoverned,&quot; Shahar Tal, the CEO of agentic AI cybersecurity outfit Cyata, told The Register. Agentic identities are the accounts, tokens, and credentials assigned to AI agents so they can access corporate apps and data.

&quot;We&#39;re letting things happen right now that we would have never let happen with our human employees,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#39;re letting thousands of interns run around in our production environment, and then we give them the keys to the kingdom. One of the key pain points that I hear from every company is that they don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening&quot; with their AI agents.

In part, this is by design. &quot;In the agentic AI world, the value proposition is: give us access to more of your corporate data, and we will do more work for you,&quot; Nudge Security co-founder and CEO Russell Spitler told The Register. &quot;Agents need to live inside the existing ecosystem of where that data lives, and that means that they need to live within the existing authentication and access infrastructure that SaaS providers already provide to access your data.&quot;

This means AI agents using OAuth tokens to access someone&#39;s Gmail or OneDrive containing corporate files, or repository access tokens to interact with a GitHub repo that holds source code.

We&#39;re letting things happen that we would have never let happen with our human employees

&quot;In order to provide value, agents need to get the data from the things that already have the data, and there are existing pathways to get that data,&quot; Spitler said.

Plus, the plethora of coding tools makes it super easy for individual employees to create AI agents, delegate access to their accounts and data, and then ask the agents to do certain jobs to make the humans&#39; lives easier.

Spitler calls this AI&#39;s &quot;hyper-consumerized consumption model.&quot;

&quot;Those two pieces are what gives rise to the challenges that people have from a security perspective,&quot; he said.

These challenges can lead to disastrous consequences, as researchers and red teams have repeatedly shown. For example, AI agents with broad access to sensitive data and systems can create a &quot;superuser&quot; that can chain together access to sensitive applications and resources, and then use that access to steal information or remotely execute malicious code.

As global education and training company Pearson&#39;s CTO Dave Treat recently noted: AI agents &quot;tend to want to please,&quot; and this presents a security problem when they are granted expansive access to highly sensitive corporate info.

&quot;How are we creating and tuning these agents to be suspicious and not be fooled by the same ploys and tactics that humans are fooled with?&quot; he asked.

Block discovered during an internal red-teaming exercise that its AI agent could be manipulated via prompt injection to deploy information-stealing malware on an employee laptop. The company says the issue has since been fixed.

These security risks aren&#39;t shrinking anytime soon. According to Gartner&#39;s estimates, 40 percent of all enterprise applications will integrate with task-specific AI agents by 2026, up from less than 5 percent in 2025.

Considering many companies today don&#39;t know how many AI agents have access to their apps and data, the challenges are significant.

Tal explains the first thing his company does with its customers is a discovery scan. &quot;And there is always this jaw-dropping moment when they realize the thousands of identities that are already out there,&quot; he said.

It&#39;s important to note: these are not only agentic identities but also human and machine identities. As of last spring, however, machine identities outnumber human identities by a ratio of 82 to one.

When Cyata scans corporate environments, &quot;we are seeing anywhere from one agent per employee to 17 per employee,&quot; Tal said. While some roles - specifically research and development and engineering - tend to adopt AI agents more quickly than the rest of their companies, &quot;folks are adopting agents very, very quickly, and it&#39;s happening all across the organization.&quot;

This is causing an identity crisis of sorts, and neither Tal nor the other AI security folks The Register spoke to for this story believe that agentic identities should be included in the larger machine identities counts. AI agents are dynamic and context-aware - in other words, they act more like humans than machines.

&quot;AI agents are not human, but they also do not behave like service accounts or scripts,&quot; Teleport CEO Ev Kontsevoy told us.

&quot;An agent functions around the clock and acts in unpredictable ways. For example, they may execute the same task with different approaches, continuously creating new access paths,&quot; he added. &quot;This requires accessing critical resources like MCP servers, APIs, databases, internal services, LLMs, and orchestration systems.&quot;

It also makes securing them using traditional identity and access management (IAM) and privileged access management (PAM) tools &quot;near impossible at scale,&quot; Kontsevoy said. &quot;Agents break traditional identity assumptions that legacy tools are built on, that identity is either human or machine.&quot;

AI agents are not human, but they also do not behave like service accounts or scripts

For decades, IAM and PAM have been critical in securing and managing user identities. IAM is used to identify and authorize all users across an organization, while PAM applies to more privileged users and accounts such as admins, securing and monitoring these identities with elevated permissions to access sensitive systems and data.

While this has more or less worked for human employees with predictable roles, it doesn&#39;t work for non-deterministic AI agents, which act autonomously and change their behavior on the fly. This can lead to security issues such as agents being granted excessive privileges, and &quot;shadow AI.&quot;

&quot;We are seeing a lot of shadow AI - someone using a personal account for ChatGPT or Cursor or Claude Code or any of these productivity tools,&quot; Tal said, adding that this can lead to &quot;blast-radius issues.&quot;

&quot;What I mean by that: they&#39;re risky agents,&quot; he said, explaining that some are essentially workflow experiments that someone in the organization created, and neither the IT nor security departments have any oversight.

&quot;What they have done is created a super-connected AI agent that is connected to every MCP server and every data source the company has,&quot; Tal said. &quot;We&#39;ve seen the problem of rogue MCP servers over and over again, where they compromise an agent and steal all of its tokens.&quot;

Fixing this requires visibility into both IT-sanctioned and unsanctioned AI agents being used, so they can be continuously monitored for misconfigurations or any other threats.

&quot;We do a risk assessment for each and every identity that we discover,&quot; Tal said. &quot;We look at its configuration, its connectivity, the permissions that it has. We look at its activity or history - journals, logs that we collect - so we can maintain a profile for each of these agents. After that, we want to put posture guardrails in place.&quot;

These are mitigating controls that prevent the agent from doing something or accessing something sensitive. Sometimes improving security is as easy as speaking to the human behind the AI agents about the risk they unknowingly introduced via the agent and what it can access.

&quot;We need to pop this bubble that agents come out of immaculate conception - a human is creating them, a human is provisioning their access,&quot; Spitler said. &quot;We need to associate tightly those agents with the human who created it, or the humans who work on it. We need to know who proxied their access to these other platforms, and what roles those accounts have in these platforms, so we understand the scope of access and potential impact of that agent&#39;s access in the wild.&quot;

Spitler says that&#39;s &quot;ground zero&quot; for managing and securing agentic identities. &quot;You need to know who your agents are.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">ai-pocalypse The jury is still out when it comes to determining how much job loss AI is causing. However, we now have another case study. Dow Chemical blames AI automation for its plans to cut 4,500 jobs, about 12.5 percent of its work force.

The thousands of employees losing their jobs are being cut as part of a rhyming companywide initiative called “Transform to Outperform” that aims to radically simplify operations, and modernize its go-to-market playbook in the hopes of achieving $2 billion in EBITDA improvement by 2028.

&quot;The goal of Transform to Outperform is to achieve significant growth and productivity gains that elevate Dow&#39;s competitive position,&quot; said Karen S. Carter , Dow&#39;s chief operating officer, in the press release announcing the initiative. &quot;We are building on the momentum of our current self-help measures – transforming Dow into a company that is more resilient, consistently delivers growth, enables customer success, and delivers greater shareholder value across the cycle.&quot;

Dow is one of the biggest enterprises working with Palantir rival C3 AI, which uses a digital twin to map a company, its employees, products, and its processes in a hunt to find efficiencies.

“C3 AI has been pivotal in transforming Dow’s operations from reactive to predictive, optimizing asset performance to drive value. As we scale these solutions across Dow’s portfolio, we anticipate significant benefits,” said Debra Bauler, chief information and digital officer at Dow in a June 2025 press release. “We look forward to continuing our partnership with C3 AI as we advance a world-class predictive maintenance program and uncover further opportunities to enhance efficiency, reliability, and productivity throughout our operations.”

The two companies partnered last year on a predictive maintenance solution for the petrochemical industry through Dow’s subsidiary Univation Technologies, which was allowed to license and install C3 AI products.

“Our work with Dow sets the standard for how industrial companies can use AI to drive efficiency, reduce costs, and optimize performance,” said Ed Abbo, Chief Technology Officer, C3 AI in the same June press release. “And this collaboration with Univation will accelerate adoption of this proven, domain-specific AI application across the broader petrochemical industry and support modernization across the market by delivering real, measurable benefits of AI at scale.”

El Reg asked Dow spokesperson to name the processes, software, and technologies that Dow plans to use to replace its employees, but the chemical giant didn&#39;t address the question.

“Through this work, we are leveraging best‑in‑class practices from across industries and high‑impact technologies, such as automation and AI, as we radically simplify our operating model and modernize how we serve our customers,” the spokesperson told The Register.

Dow’s employee numbers have held steady to around 36,000 since 2019. While the company did hire about 2,000 new employees between 2022 and 2023, growing to 37,800, by last year that number was back down to 36,000, according to annual reports and proxy filings.

Dow expects to spend $1.5 billion in one-time costs related to the job cuts with $600 million to $800 million of that going to severance for those let go, or between $133,333 and $177,777 per employee. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/29/ai_datacenter_boom_tripled_us_gas_power_builds/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Fossil fuel-fired power plant development is roaring back to life in the US thanks to the AI datacenter boom, with data from 2025 suggesting we&#39;re reaching the point where the renewable energy transition - and efforts to ease carbon emissions - may well be doomed.

2025 was a banner year for gas-fired power plant development in the US, nonprofit energy project tracking firm Global Energy Monitor (GEM) said in its latest analysis issued on Wednesday. Gas-fired power plant projects in development in the US nearly tripled last year, per GEM&#39;s data, putting the US ahead of China and responsible for around a quarter of the global gas power pipeline.

It&#39;s not exactly a close race, either. There are 251,737 megawatts of gas or oil fired plants (oil-fired plants are mainly located in Iraq and account for less than 3 percent of projects, GEM told us) in development in the US, in addition to 561,907 MW in operation. China, the second-ranking developer of natural gas and oil-fired power, is working on 153,406 MW of new projects, and has just 179,998 MW currently in use.

In other words, the US is looking at adding nearly 50 percent to its existing world-leading fleet of gas-fired power plants. More than a third of those new plants are directly linked to datacenter projects, GEM said.

If all the new projects in development end up being fired up, that&#39;ll equate to around 53.2 billion tonnes of lifetime CO₂ emissions, GEM global oil and gas plant tracking project manager Jenny Martos told The Register. 12.1 billion tonnes of that addition will come from US projects alone. For reference, the existing global fleet of gas and oil-fired power plants is estimated to account for 54.3 billion tonnes of lifetime emissions.

That means datacenters and AI are going to be a significant contributor to the derailing of global plans to quash climate change, and could be for some time.

&quot;This &#39;petrotech&#39; buildout risks tethering the power grid to fossil fuels for the next generation, thereby creating long-term pollution for a short-term power fix,&quot; Martos told us.

If AI actually turns out to be a bubble, that could mean a lot of lost investment in energy assets that end up stranded, causing even more financial devastation, Martos noted in GEM&#39;s writeup of its latest gas and oil project data.

With that in mind, it stands to reason that, even if the AI bubble bursts, a lot of oil and gas power is still going to end up making its way to the grid to offset potential losses, further hampering the transition away from fossil fuels and carbon pollution.

&quot;There is a real possibility of a gas lock-in if these plants get built and AI demand does not materialize,&quot; Martos told us.

The Trump administration has been pushing hard to side-step the clean energy transition in favor of the expediency of natural gas, but the US government isn&#39;t alone - tech companies are happy to take the easy path to datacenter construction and dreams of eventual AI profitability in spite of their pledges not to abandon the health of the planet and its residents.

Microsoft has admitted that it&#39;s open to deploying natural gas with carbon capture technology alongside renewables to meet datacenter demand, while Meta announced plans at the end of 2024 to deploy 2,262 MW of natural gas power to fuel its largest-ever datacenter mere days after pledging to focus on nuclear power to drive its AI expansion.

2026, notes GEM, is on pace to break the previous record of new natural gas deployment set in 2002 during the shale boom.

So sorry about those climate ambitions, planet Earth: Humans want AI slop, and the tech industry is going to give it to them, come burning, hellish temperatures, or ever-rising sea levels. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Crims love to make it look like their traffic is actually coming from legit homes and businesses, and they do so by using residential proxy networks. Now, Google says it has &quot;significantly degraded&quot; what it believes is one of the world&#39;s largest residential proxy networks.

Google&#39;s Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) describes IPIDEA as a &quot;little-known component of the digital ecosystem&quot; and says that in a seven-day period in January 2026, it observed more than 550 threat groups using IPIDEA exit nodes.

GTIG said that proxy network operators sometimes pay app developers to embed proxy SDKs so that any device that downloads the app is enrolled in the network.

IPIDEA is also known to distribute proxy software and SDKs that enroll devices in its network, sometimes marketed as a way for users to &quot;monetize&quot; spare bandwidth.

The Googlers said that not only do these networks allow bad actors to conceal their malicious traffic, but users who enroll their devices are opening themselves up for further attacks, as their device may be used as a launchpad to compromise their other devices.

Researchers say the disruption reduced IPIDEA&#39;s available pool of devices by millions, spanning smartphones, Windows PCs, and other consumer hardware, with residential IPs in the US, Canada, and Europe seen as the most desirable.

They also discovered that IPIDEA operators were directly controlling some of the SDKs that were found in the apps enrolling people&#39;s devices into the network.

Proxy operators frequently pitch them as tools for privacy or freedom of expression, although security researchers say they are overwhelmingly abused by threat actors.

IPIDEA not only benefited cybercriminals seeking anonymity, but in several cases also enrolled the same devices it recruited to its proxy network into large botnets, including BadBox 2.0, Aisuru, and Kimwolf.

GTIG worked with industry partners to disrupt the IPIDEA network, including Spur and Lumen&#39;s Black Lotus Labs, to better understand its scale, and Cloudflare to disrupt IPIDEA&#39;s domain resolution.

The security experts&#39; work stops short of a claim of a full takedown: GTIG says its actions reduced IPIDEA&#39;s available pool of devices by millions and are intended to have downstream effects on affiliated operators and resellers.

&quot;Residential proxy networks have become a pervasive tool for everything from high-end espionage to massive criminal schemes,&quot; said John Hultquist, chief analyst at GTIG. &quot;By routing traffic through a person&#39;s home internet connection, attackers can hide in plain sight while infiltrating corporate environments.

&quot;By taking down the infrastructure used to run the IPIDEA network, we have effectively pulled the rug out from under a global marketplace that was selling access to millions of hijacked consumer devices.&quot; ®

            <h2>AV vendor goes to war with security shop over update server scare</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/29/escan_morphisec_dispute/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A spat has erupted between antivirus vendor eScan and threat intelligence outfit Morphisec over who spotted an update server incident that disrupted some eScan customers earlier this month.

Morphisec fired the opening salvo with a blog post calling the incident a &quot;critical supply-chain compromise,&quot; alleging hackers used eScan&#39;s own update system to push malicious files and interfere with cleanup. MicroWorld Technologies-owned eScan, however, says that Morphisec&#39;s account is wrong on multiple fronts.

In a statement to The Register, eScan said it detected suspicious activity through its internal monitoring before any external notification and initiated incident response the same day.

&quot;eScan detected suspicious activity through our internal monitoring systems on January 20, 2026, and immediately initiated our incident response protocol,&quot; a spokesperson said. &quot;We issued a preliminary security advisory to customers on January 21, 2026, along with a remediation patch.&quot;

The company alleges Morphisec published its blog and accompanying social posts later that day, claiming discovery and mischaracterizing the incident&#39;s technical details and scope.

The customer advisory eScan sent to affected users on January 22, as seen by The Register, offers a much narrower version of events. An unauthorized user gained access to configuration on a single regional update server, resulting in a rogue file briefly appearing in the update path for about two hours on January 20. The advisory states that the file distributed was not an official eScan binary or a legitimate update, and that no vulnerability existed in the eScan product itself.

According to eScan, machines that downloaded updates from the affected server during the short window could suddenly stop updating, display error pop-ups, or have their hosts files modified in a way that cut them off from eScan&#39;s update servers. eScan reports no sign that any data left the network, and says the antivirus continued to perform its day job throughout.

That doesn&#39;t square with Morphisec&#39;s depiction of a critical supply chain breach. eScan says Morphisec&#39;s write-up contains &quot;numerous factual inaccuracies,&quot; disputing claims about how the malware behaved and how systems were affected, and asserting that the incident was limited to a small number of systems in a specific region rather than affecting customers worldwide. When asked, eScan did not say which region was affected.

There is, however, some overlap between the two accounts. While eScan rejects the idea that affected systems were irreparably blocked from recovery, its own advisory instructs many customers to manually download and run a remediation tool on individual machines, often with support assistance, to restore update functionality. In other words, the fix existed, but in many cases it still required hands-on work.

eScan says it contacted affected customers over the next few days via email, phone, WhatsApp, and its support portal, and completed the cleanup within two to three days of identifying the issue. It also pulled its update infrastructure offline for checks, rebuilt the affected systems, rotated credentials, and tightened monitoring before bringing everything back online.

The dispute has since escalated beyond dueling accounts. eScan says it asked Morphisec to remove what it calls false claims, prompting the deletion of Morphisec&#39;s social media posts but not the blog itself. It also notes that several publications retracted articles based on Morphisec&#39;s claims after eScan raised concerns about their accuracy. eScan says it is now working with legal counsel regarding what it describes as demonstrably false statements.

&quot;We are concerned that Morphisec&#39;s publication contains multiple demonstrably false technical claims that we have documented in detail,&quot; the spokesperson told The Register. &quot;We stand behind the accuracy of our incident response and the integrity of our products.&quot;

Morphisec did not respond to The Register&#39;s questions, but appears to be standing by a revised version of its advisory that keeps the core narrative intact – including the claims that this was a &quot;critical eScan supply chain compromise.&quot; ®

            <h2>Uncle Sam dangles nuclear campuses for states while watering down safety rules</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/29/us_nuclear_campuses/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Department of Energy (DOE) is inviting US states to host &quot;Nuclear Lifecycle Innovation Campuses&quot; to revitalize atomic power amid reports the agency has weakened safety rules governing the way nuclear sites operate.

The DOE issued a Request for Information (RFI) on Wednesday, seeking responses from states that may be interested in hosting the campuses, which will operate a &quot;full‑cycle nuclear ecosystem.&quot;

In practice, this means these sites will be expected to provide facilities for atomic waste reprocessing and disposal, in addition to fuel fabrication and enrichment. They may also serve as locations for nuclear reactors and co‑located datacenters powered by them.

News site Politico reported last week about talk of the Trump administration planning to steer &quot;billions, if not hundreds of billions&quot; in funding toward developing a domestic nuclear fuel cycle program to support rapid expansion of reactor construction. The DOE denied this at the time, according to other sources.

States are invited to indicate by no later than April 1 their interest in hosting potential Nuclear Lifecycle Innovation Campuses, and provide feedback on the incentives and other support they require.

In return, the DOE seeks information on approaches that prioritize private capital and the state&#39;s own funding, with only time‑limited federal support. It also expects &quot;robust financial assurances&quot; to protect federal taxpayers from open‑ended liabilities – meaning Washington doesn&#39;t want to pick up the tab if it all goes horribly wrong.

Last year, the DOE named ten companies it will work with to test and fast-track advanced atomic reactor projects, outside the scope of the agency&#39;s national laboratories, in line with President Trump&#39;s Nuclear Reactor Pilot Program.

California representative Mike Levin praised the new scheme, saying it is a meaningful and long-overdue step toward dealing with spent nuclear fuel.

&quot;For interested states, these campuses could deliver significant economic and job-creation benefits. The proposed campuses would support key functions across the nuclear fuel lifecycle, including fuel fabrication, enrichment, reprocessing used nuclear fuel, and waste disposal,&quot; he said in a statement.

But states considering the move should perhaps think carefully. A report from nonprofit media organization NPR claims the DOE has secretly rewritten nuclear safety directives governing atomic energy sites, significantly watering down the rules.

The changes were made to streamline the development of a new generation of nuclear reactors, which the Trump administration wants building to ensure there is enough power for all the new-build AI datacenters that are popping up, as well as growing electricity use in other sectors.

Hundreds of pages of requirements relating to security at reactors have simply been cut, according to NPR, and requirements for keeping records were trimmed. The level of radiation a worker can be exposed to before an official accident investigation gets triggered has been increased, and protections relating to groundwater and the environment weakened.

For example, protection of groundwater is no longer described as a &quot;must,&quot; replaced by wording that says companies must give &quot;consideration&quot; to &quot;avoiding or minimizing&quot; radioactive contamination.

Advocacy group the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) criticized the move.

&quot;This deeply troubling development confirms my worst fears about the dire state of nuclear power safety and security oversight under the Trump administration,&quot; UCS director of nuclear power safety Dr Edwin Lyman said in a statement.

&quot;The Energy Department has not only taken a sledgehammer to the basic principles that underlie effective nuclear regulation, but it has also done so in the shadows, keeping the public in the dark,&quot; he added, stating that regulations were developed over the course of many decades, incorporating lessons learned from painful events such as the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters.

Any new reactor designs will have to secure licenses from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) before they are used to commercially produce power, the UCS points out. However, the NRC has agreed to restrict the scope of its additional safety and security reviews for facilities that have received DOE authorization. ®

SpaceX is planning an IPO later this year, and the merger could happen before that.

SpaceX and xAI, which are both led by Elon Musk, are “in discussions to merge” ahead of SpaceX’s IPO that’s planned for later this year, Reuters reports. The merger would help with SpaceX’s plans to launch data centers into space, according to the publication.

The specific timing and value of the potential merger are unclear. SpaceX is considering an IPO date in mid-June, the Financial Times reported this week. xAI and SpaceX didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from The Verge.

If SpaceX merges with xAI, it would put the rocket company in the same house as Grok, which is under significant scrutiny and even an investigation in the EU over sexualized deepfakes.Should the deal go through, it would be just the latest transaction between Elon Musk-led companies. Tesla, which also counts Musk as CEO, said this week that it would be investing “approximately” $2 billion investment in xAI. xAI also bought X last year.

﻿FT reports Apple is paying $2 billion for Q.ai, an audio startup that uses facial expressions to understand you without a word.

Apple’s biggest acquisition ever is still its $3 billion Beats buy in 2014, but now the second biggest deal is bringing in Q.ai, a four-year-old AI audio startup. Apple did not disclose the terms, but Financial Times reports that Apple is spending $2 billion on the company. It also mentioned Q.ai patents for optical sensor technology that could be built into headphones or glasses to recognize “facial skin micro movements,” allowing for non-verbal discussions with an AI assistant, for example.

The founders of Q.ai will join Apple, including CEO Aviad Maizels, who founded PrimeSense. Apple bought that company in 2013 and repurposed its Xbox Kinect technology to power the iPhone’s FaceID setup. This time around, tech that understands whispered speech could connect to the generative AI-upgraded Siri or other Apple Intelligence features, and work with future AirPods, Vision Pro, iPhone, or Mac devices.

In a statement provided to Reuters, Apple hardware exec Johnny Srouji called Q.ai “a remarkable company that is pioneering new and creative ways to use imaging and machine learning.” Google Ventures has backed the startup, and managing partner Tom Hulme wrote in a blog post about how this could help us find out “what happens when the computer finally ‘disappears’ into our daily lives.”

            <div id="article-text">It’s not meaningfully better than the competition. Plus, its software is messy and overstuffed.

It’s not meaningfully better than the competition. Plus, its software is messy and overstuffed.

Webcam company Obsbot recently launched two new gimbal-equipped webcams, the $349 Tiny 3 and the $199 Tiny 3 Lite. It claims that the priciest model is the smallest pan, tilt, zoom (PTZ) 4K webcam ever made, weighing 63 grams. Ironically, the Tiny 3 Lite is heavier and bigger. I’ve been testing the Tiny 3 for a couple of weeks, and here’s what you should know about it.

Compared to Insta360’s newish $249 Link 2 Pro, the Tiny 3 has a slightly bigger sensor and more AI-powered features, including voice control and voice tracking. It also has MEMS mics, which are supposedly better than condenser mics at filtering unwanted noise, and Obsbot claims they’re as good as a dedicated microphone. I only have my Insta360 Link from 2022 on hand to compare it to. And while the Tiny 3 can produce a sharper image than the Link, it’s not a night-and-day difference based on my testing with final retail hardware.

You can boss both the Tiny 3 and the Lite around with preset questions (“Hi, Tiny” to turn on, “Sleep, Tiny” to turn off, “Track Me” to turn on AI-powered face tracking, “Position 1” to snap to a saved camera position, etc.), but only the pricier model has Desk Mode that lets it look downward because the Lite’s base is too thick (the original Link has a Desk Mode, too). The Tiny 3 listens remarkably well, even when I sort of mutter the commands. Although, seeing it start to track my face when I uttered the phrase “track me” during a meeting was weird enough that I turned off the voice control feature. They both advertise 4K / 30 frames per second video capture and up to 120 frames per second at 1080p. They also support the Switch 2, but require the companion app to toggle on the mode. Enabling that mode sets 1080p as the maximum resolution on PC until you disable it.

The Tiny 3 has a slightly wider field of view, and its ISO can go higher (12800 versus 6400 maximum ISO) in dimly lit rooms. It packs a 1/1.28-inch sensor with an f/1.8 aperture and a 24-millimeter equivalent focal length, which are improvements over the last-gen model, however incremental. Bigger sensors can capture more light, presenting images with less noise. Those gains weren’t all that noticeable during my testing, but they might be for others, since everyone’s work area looks different.

Video capture at 4K / 30 frames per second looks fine on the Tiny 3 in video calls. It produces sharper footage than the Lite and the Link, and as seen in the raw stills captured through Obsbot’s software, it’s better at resolving shadows seen in my wrinkled long-sleeve shirt. The stills should illustrate just how close they all are in visual quality. There are differences in how they handle contrast, but I don’t think the $350 model is the clear winner in either snapshot sample. That’s really notable considering my Insta360 Link is about 3 years old.

As previously mentioned, the company claims the webcam’s MEMS mic array (two directional, one omnidirectional) can rival performance from a standalone mic. They sound good, but I couldn’t tell the difference until I picked up my guitar and started strumming. I could hear individual plucks of guitar strings through the Tiny 3’s mic better than the Link that I have on hand. The extra detail is nice, although if you’re primarily using the Tiny 3 for video calls, it’s likely to get compressed, sadly. Also, most people who care about how their voices or instruments sound likely already have a standalone mic.

I’d be more impressed with the Tiny 3 if it were priced more competitively. But even then, I’d be reluctant to recommend it given the state of its companion app. To put it lightly, it’s an overstuffed mess to navigate, with useful features nested in tough-to-find places next to ones you’ll likely never touch again.

I get that webcams increasingly have a ton of features, and while I’m not arguing against more features to justify high prices, it’s up to these companies to make a webcam’s features easy to use, especially when you’re in a rush before or during a call. Insta360 has figured this out, and Obsbot has not.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Prediction markets will let you bet on just about anything, from how many tweets Elon Musk will post this week to the next president of the United States, with predictions sometimes showing shockingly (or suspiciously) spot-on accuracy. Polymarket’s CEO Shayne Copland has even claimed that prediction markets are “the most accurate thing we have as mankind right now.”

However, these platforms blur the lines — in terms of both function and regulation — between gambling and stock trading. As Bloomberg’s Joe Weisenthal said on The Vergecast, “All of the lines between trading, speculating, [and] gambling are just being completely torn apart.”

There are also ethical concerns surfacing around prediction markets, like whether it’s acceptable to be able to place a bet on virtually everything, along with concerns about insider trading. For instance, a newly-created Polymarket account made over $400,000 in January betting on the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.

Polymarket — the same platform someone made thousands of dollars betting on Nicolás Maduro’s arrest — has 48 hours to cease operations in Portugal after users wagered more than 103 million euros (~$120 million) on the outcome of the country’s presidential election, according to a report from CoinDesk.

Political betting is illegal in Portugal, and its gambling regulator says Polymarket doesn’t have a license to operate in the country, CoinDesk reports.

On December 31st, a brand-new account on Polymarket placed a bet: Nicolás Maduro, the leader of Venezuela, would be out of office by the end of January. It was the first in a series of increasing bets. On January 3rd, the US bombed the Venezuelan capital, kidnapped Maduro and his wife, and killed at least 80 people along the way. The account cashed out with almost half a million dollars.

It would be a misread to describe the surprise invasion of Venezuela as imperial expansion driven by the dictates of capitalism; it is, somehow, worse. Normal capitalism requires a working relationship with reality. Normal capitalism thrives on predictability. The Trump administration is behaving like gambling addicts chasing clout in an attention economy. Venezuela is a fucking meme stock.

Shortly before the US military launched an attack on Venezuela and captured President Nicolás Maduro, an account on Polymarket made some very suspiciously timed investments. The prediction market had been running bets on when or if Maduro would be removed from power, with prices for “out by January 31, 2026” as low as $0.07 late Friday evening. But within 24 hours of the military action, a newly created account invested tens of thousands of dollars, racking up several hundred thousand in profits.

The account was created less than a week ago and invested over $30,000 the day before the assault, turning a profit of over $408,000. The activity was flagged on social media, with people speculating that the person placing the bet was acting on inside information and perhaps even worked at the Pentagon. Joe Pompliano, an investor and podcaster, quickly pointed out on X that “Insider trading is not only allowed on prediction markets; it’s encouraged.”

“Prediction markets” continue to appear everywhere, including CNN and CNBC, and Polymarket is shitposting about citizen journalism.

Meanwhile, The Athletic is the latest (following Awful Announcing and Front Office Sports) reporting on sports misinformation X accounts like “Emma Vance” and “Scott Hughes” have spread while sporting those site’s affiliate badges.

Here’s a list of things you can bet on, right this second. This year’s Super Bowl winner, sure. The winner of Survivor season 49, okay. But the number of gifts Santa will deliver this year? The number of tweets Elon Musk will send in the next 7 days? How much money Avatar: Fire and Ash will make at the box office? The next president of of Portugal? On Polymarket and Kalshi, if you can dream it up, you can probably bet on it. Welcome to the age of the prediction market.

On this episode of The Vergecast, we try to figure out where prediction markets came from, and why they’ve become so popular. Bloomberg’s Joe Weisenthal joins the show to track the rise of Polymarket and Kalshi, explain their controversies and ultimate acceptance, and put these companies in their correct place in the economy. Most of all, he helps us figure out if there’s actually something new happening here, or if the betting has been happening forever.

This is an excerpt of Sources by Alex Heath, a newsletter about AI and the tech industry, syndicated just for The Verge subscribers once a week.

At 8PM on election night in New York City, I arrived at an unmarked office building in the Meatpacking District.

If you’ve been on social media lately, you might’ve seen the unsettling AI slop videos showing AI-generated people in wild scenarios or just speaking a bunch of nonsense. On Wednesday night, the betting platform Kalshi decided to take this trend outside the social sphere by putting a nonsensical AI-generated ad in front of the millions of viewers watching the NBA Finals — and it apparently cost just $2,000 to make.

The AI-generated highlights various things “people” are betting on, like whether the Oklahoma City Thunder or Indiana Pacers will win the NBA Finals, how many hurricanes will occur this year, and whether the price of eggs will go up this month. It flashes between scenes of an elderly man wearing a cowboy hat while carrying a chihuahua, someone swimming in a pool of eggs, and an alien chugging beer.

Today, I’m talking with Vlad Tenev, the cofounder and CEO of Robinhood, which is one of the most well-known consumer finance apps in the world. It started as a way to open up stock trading, but the company’s ambitions have grown over time — and they’re getting even bigger.

Just a day before Tenev and I talked, Robinhood announced it would soon be offering bank accounts and wealth management services, which would allow Robinhood to be involved with your money at every possible level.

A new tidbit about the prediction markets startup from last week’s issue of Command Line:

Coplan recently raised, but has yet to announce, a $30 million round of funding at a $350 million valuation. And in recent conversations with investors (a surprising number of whom passed on the round, which was less than Coplan hoped to raise), I’m told he was noncommittal about whether the company would work to get the Commodity Futures Trading Commission license it needs to operate in the US.

It wasn’t immediately clear what prompted the FBI’s search of [Shayne] Coplan, the 26-year-old entrepreneur behind one of the most successful prediction markets in history. But Polymarket quickly tied the raid to its track record in the recent presidential election, in which bettors on its platform correctly anticipated that Donald Trump would beat Vice President Kamala Harris.

Bloomberg also reports that Polymarket is being investigated by the DOJ for allegedly letting users in the US place bets on the site.

This week’s presidential election introduced a lot of people to prediction markets.

Kalshi was the number one app in the App Store on Election Day. The CEO of Polymarket claims the Trump campaign first realized they were winning from his startup’s stats, which showed them winning by a landslide hours before news networks called the race. There’s a sense in some tech and finance circles that these betting markets are now a better “wisdom of the crowd” indicator than polls.

The startup has received “tens of millions from investors in short-term loans“ to make sure it can cover election bets:

Like most brokerages, the company offers instant funding to new users. This means users can start trading right away, even though it may take two to three business days for the funds to be officially transferred from the customer’s bank account to Kalshi’s.

US citizens can gamble on the upcoming election on Robinhood, the financial nihilism app announced. Robinhood has termed this “unlocking a new asset class that democratizes access to events as they unfold.”

Let’s pause — I would like to reflect on this incredible phrase, about an asset class that democratizes access to events as they unfold. See, I thought we all had access to the events of the election because we all exist in reality and can find out about them. But apparently, if we can’t gamble on an event, it isn’t happening. This is a fascinating vision of metaphysics, and I would like to hear more about it. No one bet on my birth, for instance, and thus there is no asset class relating to my existence. So am I real?

You can add up to 10 friends and family members to a group chat.

Spotify is expanding its in-app messaging feature with group chats. Now you can add up to 10 friends and family members to your discussion about your new favorite song, podcast, or audiobook, as reported earlier by TechCrunch.

The music streaming platform launched direct messaging last August, allowing you to share what you’re listening to without leaving the app. As is the case with one-on-one messages, you can only add people to group chats if you’ve interacted with them through Spotify’s other features before, such as joining their Jam session, Collaborative Playlists, or Blends.

            <div id="article-text">A new survey from the Game Developers Conference reveals how many developers feel about the technology.

A new survey from the Game Developers Conference reveals how many developers feel about the technology.

While generative AI is being adopted at various levels of game development, a new survey suggests that developers increasingly think the technology is bad for the industry. According to the most recent survey from the Game Developers Conference, 52 percent of respondents said that gen AI is having a “negative” impact on the games industry, versus just 7 percent who viewed the technology as “positive.” Perhaps most startling is how the negative outlook has grown over the years: in 2024, just 18 percent of those surveyed viewed the tech as a negative, and that number jumped to 30 percent in 2025. Now it’s up to more than half.

GDC surveyed 2,300 “game industry professionals” to get these results, and the demographics are primarily male (64 percent), white (67 percent), and based in the United States (54 percent). The organizers admit that this makeup is “far from truly representative of the global community, and we know more work is needed.” (You can check out the full report right here.)

However, the results still provide some fascinating insight into how actual developers feel about the AI, at the same time that the leaders of major publishers like EA and Krafton are espousing its virtues (and as Larian has had to clarify how it’s using the technology). As for how much the gen AI is actually being used in the industry, 36 percent of those surveyed said they utilize it as part of their jobs, while 64 percent said they don’t. The majority of those who do use gen AI said they use the tech for research and brainstorming (81 percent), as well as administrative tasks like email (47 percent). But some did admit to using AI for more development-oriented tasks, including prototyping (35 percent), testing or debugging (22 percent), and asset generation (19 percent). Only 5 percent of that group said they use gen AI on “player-facing features.”

The other major topic broached in the survey was the persistent layoffs and studio closures that have ravaged the industry over the last few years. In the 2025 survey, one in 10 developers said they had been laid off within the last year. This year, the numbers were similar, with 17 percent of respondents saying they had been laid off in the last 12 months, while a whopping 28 percent had been laid off within the last two years. Naturally, this had led to an aura of uncertainty; 23 percent of those surveyed said that they expected more layoffs in the next year, while 30 percent are unsure.

The survey also questioned a small number of those in the educational space — more than 100 educators and 50 students, according to GDC — and unsurprisingly the outlook isn’t very positive. 60 percent of those surveyed said that they expect the current state of the industry to make it difficult for new students to get jobs. “Most of my students will not have a career in game development,” said one anonymous educator in Michigan.

GDC itself kicks off this year on March 9th in San Francisco, and it’s likely these two issues will be a major topic throughout.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The US Department of Homeland Security is using AI video generators from Google and Adobe to make and edit content shared with the public, a new document reveals. It comes as immigration agencies have flooded social media with content to support President Trump&#39;s mass deportation agenda—some of which appears to be made with AI—and as workers in tech have put pressure on their employers to denounce the agencies’ activities.

The document, released on Wednesday, provides an inventory of which commercial AI tools DHS uses for tasks ranging from generating drafts of documents to managing cybersecurity.

In a section about “editing images, videos or other public affairs materials using AI,” it reveals for the first time that DHS is using Google&#39;s Veo 3 video generator and Adobe Firefly, estimating that the agency has between 100 and 1,000 licenses for the tools. It also discloses that DHS uses Microsoft Copilot Chat for generating first drafts of documents and summarizing long reports and Poolside software for coding tasks, in addition to tools from other companies.

Google, Adobe, and DHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The news provides details about how agencies like Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, which is part of DHS, might be creating the large amounts of content they’ve shared on X and other channels as immigration operations have expanded across US cities. They’ve posted content celebrating “Christmas after mass deportations,” referenced Bible verses and Christ’s birth, showed faces of those the agency has arrested, and shared ads aimed at recruiting agents. The agencies have also repeatedly used music without permissions from artists in their videos.

Some of the content, particularly videos, has the appearance of being AI-generated, but it hasn’t been clear until now what AI models the agencies might be using. This marks the first concrete evidence such generators are being used by DHS to create content shared with the public.

It still remains impossible to verify which company helped create a specific piece of content, or indeed if it was AI-generated at all. Adobe offers options to “watermark” a video made with its tools to disclose that it is AI-generated, for example, but this disclosure does not always stay intact when the content is uploaded and shared across different sites.

The document reveals that DHS has specifically been using Flow, a tool from Google that combines its Veo 3 video generator with a suite of filmmaking tools. Users can generate clips and assemble entire videos with AI, including videos that contain sound, dialogue, and background noise, making them hyperrealistic. Adobe launched its Firefly generator in 2023, promising that it does not use copyrighted content in its training or output. Like Google’s tools, Adobe’s can generate videos, images, soundtracks, and speech. The document does not reveal further details about how the agency is using these video generation tools.

Workers at large tech companies, including more than 140 current and former employees from Google and more than 30 from Adobe, have been putting pressure on their employers in recent weeks to take a stance against ICE and the shooting of Alex Pretti on January 24. Google’s leadership has not made statements in response. In October, Google and Apple removed apps on their app stores that were intended to track sightings of ICE, citing safety risks.

An additional document released on Wednesday revealed new details about how the agency is using more niche AI products, including a facial recognition app used by ICE, as first reported by 404Media in June.

Meet the Vitalists: the hardcore longevity enthusiasts who believe death is “wrong”

Last April, an excited crowd gathered at a compound in Berkeley, California, for a three-day event called the Vitalist Bay Summit. It was part of a longer, two-month residency that hosted various events to explore tools—from drug regulation to cryonics—that might be deployed in the fight against death.One of the main goals, though, was to spread the word of Vitalism, a somewhat radical movement established by Nathan Cheng and his colleague Adam Gries a few years ago. Consider it longevity for the most hardcore adherents—a sweeping mission to which nothing short of total devotion will do.Although interest in longevity has certainly taken off in recent years, not everyone in the broader longevity space shares Vitalists’ commitment to actually making death obsolete. And the Vitalists feel that momentum is building, not just for the science of aging and the development of lifespan-extending therapies, but for the acceptance of their philosophy that defeating death should be humanity’s top concern.

The ability to remember you and your preferences is rapidly becoming a big selling point for AI chatbots and agents.Personalized, interactive AI systems are built to act on our behalf, maintain context across conversations, and improve our ability to carry out all sorts of tasks, from booking travel to filing taxes.But their ability to store and retrieve increasingly intimate details about their users over time introduces alarming, and all-too-familiar, privacy vulnerabilities––many of which have loomed since “big data” first teased the power of spotting and acting on user patterns. Worse, AI agents now appear poised to plow through whatever safeguards had been adopted to avoid those vulnerabilities. So what can developers do to fix this problem? Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">The eastern half of the US saw a monster snowstorm over the weekend. The good news is the grid has largely been able to keep up with the freezing temperatures and increased demand. But there were some signs of strain, particularly for fossil-fuel plants.

One analysis found that PJM, the nation’s largest grid operator, saw significant unplanned outages in plants that run on natural gas and coal. Historically, these facilities can struggle in extreme winter weather.

Much of the country continues to face record-low temperatures, and the possibility is looming for even more snow this weekend. What lessons can we take from this storm, and how might we shore up the grid to cope with extreme weather?

Living in New Jersey, I have the honor of being one of the roughly 67 million Americans covered by the PJM Interconnection.

So I was in the thick of things this weekend, when PJM saw unplanned outages of over 20 gigawatts on Sunday during the height of the storm. (That’s about 16% of the grid’s demand that afternoon.) Other plants were able to make up the difference, and thankfully, the power didn’t go out in my area. But that’s a lot of capacity offline.

Typically, the grid operator doesn’t announce details about why an outage occurs until later. But analysts at Energy Innovation, a policy and research firm specializing in energy and climate, went digging. By examining publicly available grid mix data (a breakdown of what types of power plants are supplying the grid), the team came to a big conclusion: Fossil fuels failed during the storm.

The analysts found that gas-fired power plants were producing about 10 gigawatts less power on Sunday than the peak demand on Saturday, even while electricity prices were high. Coal- and oil-burning plants were down too. Because these plants weren’t operating, even when high prices would make it quite lucrative, they were likely a significant part of the problem, says Michelle Solomon, a manager in the electricity program at Energy Innovation.

PJM plans to share more details about the outages at an upcoming committee meeting once the cold snap passes, Dan Lockwood, a PJM spokesperson, told me via email.

Fossil-fuel plants can see reliability challenges during winter: When temperatures drop, pressures in natural-gas lines fall too, which can lead to issues for fuel supply. Freezing temperatures can throw compression stations and other mechanical equipment offline and even freeze piles of coal.

One of the starkest examples came in 2021, when Texas faced freezing temperatures that took many power plants offline and threw the grid into chaos. Many homes lost power for days, and at least 246 people died during that storm.

Texas fared much better this time around. After 2021, the state shored up its grid, adding winter weatherization for power plants and transmission systems. Texas has also seen a huge flood of batteries come online, which has greatly helped the grid during winter demand peaks, especially in the early mornings. Texas was also simply lucky that this storm was less severe there, as one expert told Inside Climate News this week.

Here on the East Coast, we’re not out of the woods yet. The snow has stopped falling, but grids are still facing high electricity demand because of freezing temperatures. (I’ve certainly been living under my heated blanket these last few days.)

PJM could see a peak power demand of 130 gigawatts for seven straight days, a winter streak that the local grid has never experienced, according to an update to the utility’s site on Tuesday morning.

The US Department of Energy issued emergency orders to several grid operators, including PJM, that allow power plants to run while basically ignoring emissions regulations. The department also issued orders allowing several grids to tell data centers and other facilities to begin using backup generators. (This is good news for reliability but bad news for clean air and the climate, since these power sources are often incredibly emissions-intensive.)

We here on the East Coast could learn a thing or two from Texas so we don’t need to resort to these polluting emergency measures to keep the lights on. More energy storage could be a major help in future winter storms, lending flexibility to the grid to help ride out the worst times, Solomon says. Getting offshore wind online could also help, since those facilities typically produce reliable power in the winter.

No one energy source will solve the massive challenge of building and maintaining a resilient grid. But as we face the continued threat of extreme storms, renewables might actually help us weather them.

            <h2>Meet the Vitalists: the hardcore longevity enthusiasts who believe death is “wrong”</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/29/1131815/vitalism-longevity-enthusiasts-influence/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">“Who here believes involuntary death is a good thing?”

Nathan Cheng has been delivering similar versions of this speech over the last couple of years, so I knew what was coming. He was about to try to convince the 80 or so people in the audience that death is bad. And that defeating it should be humanity’s number one priority—quite literally, that it should come above all else in the social and political hierarchy.

“If you believe that life is good and there&#39;s inherent moral value to life,” he told them, “it stands to reason that the ultimate logical conclusion here is that we should try to extend lifespan indefinitely.”

Solving aging, he added, is “a problem that has an incredible moral duty for all of us to get involved in.”

It was the end of April, and the crowd—with its whoops and yeahs—certainly seemed convinced. They’d gathered at a compound in Berkeley, California, for a three-day event called the Vitalist Bay Summit. It was part of a longer, two-month residency (simply called Vitalist Bay) that hosted various events to explore tools—from drug regulation to cryonics—that might be deployed in the fight against death. One of the main goals, though, was to spread the word of Vitalism, a somewhat radical movement established by Cheng and his colleague Adam Gries a few years ago.

No relation to the lowercase vitalism of old, this Vitalism has a foundational philosophy that’s deceptively simple: to acknowledge that death is bad and life is good. The strategy for executing it, though, is far more obviously complicated: to launch a longevity revolution.

Interest in longevity has certainly taken off in recent years, but as the Vitalists see it, it has a branding problem. The term “longevity” has been used to sell supplements with no evidence behind them, “anti-aging” has been used by clinics to sell treatments, and “transhumanism” relates to ideas that go well beyond the scope of defeating death. Not everyone in the broader longevity space shares Vitalists’ commitment to actually making death obsolete. As Gries, a longtime longevity devotee who has largely become the enthusiastic public face of Vitalism, said in an online presentation about the movement in 2024, “We needed some new word.”

“Vitalism” became a clean slate: They would start a movement to defeat death, and make that goal the driving force behind the actions of individuals, societies, and nations. Longevity could no longer be a sideshow. For Vitalism to succeed, budgets would need to change. Policy would need to change. Culture would need to change. Consider it longevity for the most hardcore adherents—a sweeping mission to which nothing short of total devotion will do.

“The idea is to change the systems and the priorities of society at the highest levels,” Gries said in the presentation.

To be clear, the effective anti-aging treatments the Vitalists are after don’t yet exist. But that’s sort of the point: They believe they could exist if Vitalists are able to spread their gospel, influence science, gain followers, get cash, and ultimately reshape government policies and priorities.

For the past few years, Gries and Cheng have been working to recruit lobbyists, academics, biotech CEOs, high-net-worth individuals, and even politicians into the movement, and they’ve formally established a nonprofit foundation “to accelerate Vitalism.” Today, there’s a growing number of Vitalists (some paying foundation members, others more informal followers, and still others who support the cause but won’t publicly admit as much), and the foundation has started “certifying” qualifying biotech companies as Vitalist organizations. Perhaps most consequentially, Gries, Cheng, and their peers are also getting involved in shaping US state laws that make unproven, experimental treatments more accessible. They hope to be able to do the same at the national level.

Vitalism cofounders Nathan Cheng and Adam Gries want to launch a longevity revolution.

All this is helping Vitalists grow in prominence, if not also power. In the past, people who have spoken of living forever or making death “optional” have been dismissed by their academic colleagues. I’ve been covering the broader field of aging science for a decade, and I’ve seen scientists roll their eyes, shrug their shoulders, and turn their backs on people who have talked this way. That’s not the case for the Vitalists.

Even the scientists who think that Vitalist ideas of defeating death are wacky, unattainable ones, with the potential to discredit their field, have shown up on stage with Vitalism’s founders, and these serious researchers provide a platform for them at more traditionally academic events.

I saw this collegiality firsthand at Vitalist Bay. Faculty members from Harvard, Stanford, and the University of California, Berkeley, all spoke at events. Eric Verdin, the prominent researcher who directs the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in Novato, California, had also planned to speak, although a scheduling clash meant he couldn’t make it in the end. “I have very different ideas in terms of what’s doable,” he told me. “But that’s part of the [longevity] movement—there’s freedom for people to say whatever they want.”

Many other well-respected scientists attended, including representatives of ARPA-H, the US federal agency for health research and breakthrough technologies. And as I left for a different event on longevity in Washington, DC, just after the Vitalist Bay Summit, a sizable group of Vitalist Bay attendees headed that way too, to make the case for longevity to US lawmakers.

The Vitalists feel that momentum is building, not just for the science of aging and the development of lifespan-extending therapies, but for the acceptance of their philosophy that defeating death should be humanity’s top concern.

This, of course, sparks some pretty profound questions. What would a society without death look like—and would we even want it? After all, death has become an important part of human culture the world over. And even if Vitalists aren’t destined to realize their lofty goal, their growing influence could still have implications for us all. As they run more labs and companies, and insert themselves into the making of laws and policy, perhaps they will discover treatments that really do slow or even reverse aging. In the meantime, though, some ethicists are concerned that experimental and unproven medicines—including potentially dangerous ones—are becoming more accessible, in some cases with little to no oversight.

Gries, ultimately, has a different view of the ethics here. He thinks that being “okay with death” is what disqualifies a person from being considered ethical. “Death is just wrong,” he says. “It’s not just wrong for some people. It’s wrong for all people.”

When I arrived at the Vitalist Bay Summit on April 25, I noticed that the venue was equipped with everything a longevity enthusiast might need: napping rooms, a DEXA body-composition scanner, a sauna in a bus, and, for those so inclined, 24-hour karaoke.

I was told that around 300 people had signed up for that day’s events, which was more than had attended the previous week. That might have been because arguably the world’s most famous longevity enthusiast, Bryan Johnson, was about to make an appearance. (If you’re curious to know more about what Johnson was doing there, you can read about our conversation here.)

The key to Vitalism has always been that “death is humanity’s core problem, and aging its primary agent,” cofounder Adam Gries told me. “So it was, and so it has continued, as it was foretold.”

But Gries, another man in his 40s who doesn’t want to die, was the first to address the audience that day. Athletic and energetic, he bounded across a stage wearing bright yellow shorts and a long-sleeved shirt imploring people to “Choose Life: VITALISM.”

Gries is a tech entrepreneur who describes himself as a self-taught software engineer who’s “good at virality.” He’s been building companies since he was in college in the 2000s, and grew his personal wealth by selling them.

As with many other devotees to the cause, his deep interest in life extension was sparked by Aubrey de Grey, a controversial researcher with an iconic long beard and matching ponytail. He’s known widely both for his optimistic views about “defeating aging” and for having reportedly made sexual comments to two longevity entrepreneurs. (In an email, de Grey said he’s “never disputed” one of these remarks but denied having made the other. “My continued standing within the longevity community speaks for itself,” he added.)

In an influential 2005 TED Talk (which has over 4.8 million views), de Grey predicted that people would live to 1,000 and spoke of the possibility of new technologies that would continue to stave off death, allowing some to avoid it indefinitely. (In a podcast recorded last year, Cheng described a recording of this talk as “the OG longevity-pilling YouTube video.”)

“It was kind of evident to me that life is great,” says Gries. “So I’m kind of like, why would I not want to live?”

A second turning point for Gries came during the early stages of the covid-19 pandemic, when he essentially bet against companies that he thought would collapse. “I made this 50 [fold] return,” he says. “It was kind of like living through The Big Short.”

Gries and his wife fled from San Francisco to Israel, where he grew up, and later traveled to Taiwan, where he’d obtained a “golden visa” and which was, at the time, one of only two countries that had not reported a single case of covid. His growing wealth afforded him the opportunity to take time from work and think about the purpose of life. “My answer was: Life is the purpose of life,” he says. He didn’t want to die. He didn’t want to experience the “journey of decrepitude” that aging often involves.

So he decided to dedicate himself to the longevity cause. He went about looking up others who seemed as invested as he was. In 2021 his search led him to Cheng, a Chinese-Canadian entrepreneur based in Toronto. He had dropped out of a physics PhD a few years earlier after experiencing what he describes on his website as “a massive existential crisis” and shifted his focus to “radical longevity.” (Cheng did not respond to email requests for an interview.)

The pair “hit it off immediately,” says Gries, and they spent the following two years trying to figure out what they could do. The solution they finally settled on: revolution.

After all, Gries reasons, that’s how significant religious and social movements have happened in the past. He says they sought inspiration from the French and American Revolutions, among others. The idea was to start with some kind of “enlightenment,” and with a “hardcore group,” to pursue significant social change with global ramifications.

“We were convinced that without a revolution,” Gries says, “we were as good as dead.”

Early on, they wrote a Vitalist declaration, a white paper that lists five core statements for believers:

While it’s not an explicit part of the manifesto, it was important to them to think about it as a moral philosophy as well as a movement. As Cheng said at the time, morality “guides most of the actions of our lives.” The same should be true of Vitalism, he suggested.

Gries has echoed this idea. The belief that “death is morally bad” is necessary to encourage behavior change, he told me in 2024. It is a moral drive, or moral purpose, that pushes people to do difficult things, he added.

Revolution, after all, is difficult. And to succeed—to “get unlimited great health to the top of the priority list,” as Gries says—the movement would need to infiltrate the government and shape policy decisions and national budgets. The Apollo program got people to the moon with less than 1% of US GDP; imagine, Gries asks, what we could do to human longevity with a mere 1% of GDP?

It makes sense, then, that Gries and Cheng launched Vitalism in 2023 at Zuzalu, a “pop-up city” in Montenegro that provided a two-month home for like-minded longevity enthusiasts. The gathering was in some ways a loose prototype for what they wanted to accomplish. Cheng spoke there of how they wanted to persuade 10,000 or so Vitalists to move to Rhode Island. Not only was it close to the biotech hub of Boston, but they believed it had a small enough population for an influx of new voters sharing their philosophy to influence local and state elections. “Five to ten thousand people—that’s all we need,” he said. Or if not Rhode Island, another small-ish US state, where they could still change state policy from the inside.

The ultimate goal was to recruit Vitalists to help them establish a “longevity state”—a recognized jurisdiction that “prioritizes doing something about aging,” Cheng said, perhaps by loosening regulations on clinical trials or supporting biohacking.

This idea is popular among many vocal members of the Vitalism community. It borrows from the concept of the “network state” developed by former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan, defined as a new city or country that runs on cryptocurrency; focuses on a goal, in this case extending human lifespan; and “eventually gains diplomatic recognition from preexisting states.”

Some people not interested in dying have made progress toward realizing such a domain. Following the success of Zuzalu, one of the event’s organizers, Laurence Ion, a young cryptocurrency investor and self-proclaimed Vitalist, joined a fellow longevity enthusiast named Niklas Anzinger to organize a sequel in Próspera, the private “special economic zone” on the Honduran island of Roatán. They called their “pop-up city” Vitalia.

I visited shortly after it launched in January 2024. The goal was to create a low-regulation biotech hub to fast-track the development of anti-aging drugs, though the “city” was more like a gated resort that hosted talks from a mix of respected academics, biohackers, biotech CEOs, and straight-up eugenicists. There was a strong sense of community—many attendees were living with or near each other, after all. A huge canvas where attendees could leave notes included missives like “Don’t die,” “I love you,” and “Meet technoradicals building the future!”

But Vitalia was short-lived, with events ending by the start of March 2024. And while many of the vibes were similar to what I’d later see at Vitalist Bay, the temporary nature of Vitalia didn’t quite match the ambition of Gries and Cheng.

Patri Friedman, a 49-year-old libertarian and grandson of the economist Milton Friedman who says he attended Zuzalu, Vitalia, and Vitalist Bay, envisions something potentially even bolder. He’s the founder of the Seasteading Institute, which has the goal of “building startup communities that float on the ocean with any measure of political autonomy” and has received funding and support from the billionaire Peter Thiel. Friedman also founded Pronomos Capital, a venture capital fund that invests in projects focused on “building the cities of tomorrow.”

His company is exploring various types of potential network states, but he says he’s found that medical tourism—and, specifically, a hunger for life extension—dominates the field. “People do not want this ‘10 years and a billion dollars to pass a drug’ thing with the FDA,” says Friedman. (While he doesn’t call himself a Vitalist, partly because he’s “almost never going to agree with” any kind of decree, Friedman holds what you might consider similarly staunch sentiments about death, which he referred to as “murder by omission.” When I asked him if he has a target age he’d like to reach, he told me he found the question “mind-bogglingly strange” and “insane.” “How could you possibly be like: Yes, please murder me at this time?” he replied. “I can always fucking shoot myself in the head—I don’t need anybody’s help.”)

But even as Vitalists and those aligned with their beliefs embrace longevity states, Gries and Cheng are reassessing their former ambitions. The network-state approach has limits, Gries tells me. And encouraging thousands of people to move to Rhode Island wasn’t as straightforward as they’d hoped it might be.

Not because he can’t find tens of thousands of Vitalists, Gries stresses—but most of them are unwilling to move their lives for the sake of influencing the policy of another state. He compares Vitalism to a startup, with a longevity state as its product. For the time being, at least, there isn’t enough consumer appetite for that product, he says.

The past year shows that it may in fact be easier to lobby legislators in states that are already friendly to deregulation. Anzinger and a lobbying group called the Alliance for Longevity Initiatives (A4LI) were integral to making Montana the first US hub for experimental medical treatments, with a new law to allow clinics to sell experimental therapies once they have been through preliminary safety tests (which don’t reveal whether a drug actually works). But Gries and his Vitalist colleagues also played a role—“providing feedback, talking to lawmakers … brainstorming [and] suggesting ideas,” Gries says.

The Vitalist crew has been in conversation with lawmakers in New Hampshire, too. In an email in December, Gries and Cheng claimed they’d “helped to get right-to-try laws passed” in the state—an apparent reference to the recent expansion of a law to make more unapproved treatments accessible to people with terminal illnesses. Meanwhile, three other bills that expand access even further are under consideration.

Ultimately, Gries stresses, Vitalism is “agnostic to the fixing strategies” that will help them meet their goals. There is, though, at least one strategy he’s steadfast about: building influence.

To trigger a revolution, the Vitalists may need to recruit only around 3% or 4% of “society” to their movement, Gries believes. (Granted, that does still mean hundreds of millions of people.) “If you want people to take action, you need to focus on a small number of very high-leverage people,” he tells me.

That, perhaps unsurprisingly, includes wealthy individuals with “a net worth of $10 million or above,” he says. He wants to understand why (with some high-profile exceptions, including Thiel, who has been investing in longevity-related companies and foundations for decades) most uber-wealthy people don’t invest in the field—and how he might persuade them to do so. He won’t reveal the names of anyone he’s having conversations with.

These “high-leverage” people might also include, Gries says, well-respected academics, leaders of influential think tanks, politicians and policymakers, and others who work in government agencies.

A revolution needs to find its foot soldiers. And at the most basic level, that will mean boosting the visibility of the Vitalism brand—partly through events like Vitalist Bay, but also by encouraging others, particularly in the biotech space, to sign on. Cheng talks of putting out a “bat signal” for like-minded people, and he and Gries say that Vitalism has brought together people who have gone on to collaborate or form companies.

There’s also their nonprofit Vitalism International Foundation, whose supporters can opt to become “mobilized Vitalists” with monthly payments of $29 or more, depending on their level of commitment. In addition, the foundation works with longevity biotech companies to recognize those that are “aligned” with its goals as officially certified Vitalist organizations. “Designation may be revoked if an organization adopts apologetic narratives that accept aging or death,” according to the website. At the time of writing, that site lists 16 certified Vitalist organizations, including cryopreservation companies, a longevity clinic, and several research companies.

One of them is Shift Bioscience, a company using CRISPR and aging clocks—which attempt to measure biological age—to identify genes that might play a significant role in the aging process and potentially reverse it. It says it has found a single gene that can rejuvenate multiple types of cells.

Shift cofounder Daniel Ives, who holds degrees in mitochondrial and computational biology, tells me he was also won over to the longevity cause by de Grey’s 2005 TED Talk. He now has a countdown on his computer: “It’s my days till death,” he says—around 22,000 days left. “I’m using that to keep myself focused.”

Ives calls himself the “Vitalist CEO” of Shift Bioscience. He thinks the label is important first as a way for like-minded people to find and support each other, grow their movement, and make the quest for longevity mainstream. Second, he says, it provides a way to appeal to “hardcore” lifespan extensionists, given that others in the wellness and cosmetics industry have adopted the term “longevity” without truly applying themselves to finding rejuvenation therapies. He refers to unnamed companies and individuals who claim that drinking juices, for example, can reverse aging by five years or so.

“You don’t have to convince the mainstream,” says ARPA-H science and engineering advisor Mark Hamalainen. Though “kind of a terrible example,” he notes, Stalinism started small. “Sometimes you just have to convince the right people.”

“Somebody will make these claims and basically throw legitimate science under the bus,” he says. He doesn’t want spurious claims made on social media to get lumped in with the company’s serious molecular biology. Shift’s head of machine learning, Lucas Paulo de Lima Camillo, was recently awarded a $10,000 prize by the well-respected Biomarkers of Aging Consortium for an aging clock he developed.

Another out-and-proud Vitalist CEO is Anar Isman, the cofounder of AgelessRx, a telehealth provider that offers prescriptions for purported longevity drugs—and a certified Vitalist organization. (Isman, who is in his early 40s, used to work at a hedge fund but was inspired to join the longevity field by—you guessed it—de Grey.)

During a panel session at Vitalist Bay, he stressed that he too saw longevity as a movement—and a revolution—rather than an industry. But he also claimed his company wasn’t doing too badly commercially. “We’ve had a lot of demand,” he said. “We’ve got $60 million plus in annual revenue.”

Many of his customers come to the site looking for treatments for specific ailments, he tells me. He views each as an opportunity to “evangelize” his views on “radical life extension.” “I don’t see a difference between … dying tomorrow or dying in 30 years,” he says. He wants to live “at least 100 more” years.

Vitalism, though, isn’t just appealing to commercial researchers. Mark Hamalainen, a 41-year-old science and engineering advisor at ARPA-H, describes himself as a Vitalist. He says he “kind of got roped into” Vitalism because he also works with Cheng—they founded the Longevity Biotech Fellowship, which supports new entrants to the field through mentoring programs. “I kind of view it as a more appealing rebranding of some of the less radical aspects of transhumanism,” he says. Transhumanism—the position that we can use technologies to enhance humans beyond the current limits of biology—covers a broad terrain, but “Vitalism is like: Can we just solve this death thing first? It’s a philosophy that’s easy to get behind.”

In government, he works with individuals like Jean Hébert, a former professor of genetics and neuroscience who has investigated the possibility of rejuvenating the brain by gradually replacing parts of it; Hébert has said that “[his] mission is to beat aging.” He spoke at Zuzalu and Vitalist Bay.

Andrew Brack, who serves as the program manager for proactive health at ARPA-H, was at Vitalist Bay, too. Both Brack and Hébert oversee healthy federal budgets—Hébert’s brain replacement project was granted $110 million in 2024, for example.

Neither Hébert nor Brack has publicly described himself as a Vitalist, and Hébert wouldn’t agree to speak to me without the approval of ARPA-H’s press office, which didn’t respond to multiple requests for an interview with him or Brack. Brack did not respond to direct requests for an interview.

Gries says he thinks that “many people at [the US Department of Health and Human Services], including all agencies, have a longevity-positive view and probably agree with a lot of the ideas Vitalism stands for.” And he is hoping to help secure federal positions for others who are similarly aligned with his philosophy. On both Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve last year, Gries and Cheng sent fundraising emails describing an “outreach effort” to find applicants for six open government positions that, together, would control billions of dollars in federal funding. “Qualified, mission-aligned candidates we’d love to support do exist, but they need to be found and encouraged to apply,” the pair wrote in the second email. “We’re starting a systematic search to reach, screen, and support the best candidates.”

Hamalainen supports Gries’s plan to target high-leverage individuals. “You don’t have to convince the mainstream,” he says. Though “kind of a terrible example,” Hamalainen notes, Stalinism started small. “Sometimes you just have to convince the right people.”

One of the “right” people may be the man who inspired Gries, Hamalainen, Ives, Isman, and so many others to pursue longevity in the first place: de Grey. He’s now a paid-up Vitalist and even spoke at Vitalist Bay. Having been in the field for over 20 years, de Grey tells me, he’s seen various terms fall in and out of favor. Those terms now have “baggage that gets in the way,” he says. “Sometimes it’s useful to have a new term.”

Though one of the five principles of Vitalism is a promise to “carry the message,” some people who agree with its ideas are reluctant to go public, including some signed-up Vitalists. I’ve asked Gries multiple times over several years, but he won’t reveal how many Vitalists there are, let alone who makes up the membership.

Even some of the founders of Vitalism don’t want to be public about it. Around 30 people were involved in developing the movement, Gries says—but only 22 are named as contributors to the Vitalism white paper (with Gries as its author), including Cheng, Vitalia’s Ion, and ARPA-H’s Hamalainen. Gries won’t reveal the names of the others. He acknowledges that some people just don’t like to publicly affiliate with any organization. That’s certainly what I’ve found when I’ve asked members of the longevity community if they’re Vitalists. Many said they agreed with the Vitalist declaration, and that they liked and supported what Gries was doing. But they didn’t want the label.

Some people worry that associating with a belief system that sounds a bit religious—even cult-like, some say—won’t do the cause any favors. Others have a problem with the specific wording of the declaration.

For instance, Anzinger—the other Vitalia founder—won’t call himself a Vitalist. He says he respects the mission, but that the declaration is “a bit poetic” for his liking.

And Dylan Livingston, CEO of A4LI and arguably one of the most influential longevity enthusiasts out there, won’t describe himself as a Vitalist either.

Many other longevity biotech CEOs also shy away from the label—including Emil Kendziorra, who runs the human cryopreservation company Tomorrow Bio, even though that’s a certified Vitalist organization. Kendziorra says he agrees with most of the Vitalist declaration but thinks it is too “absolutist.” He also doesn’t want to imply that the pursuit of longevity should be positioned above war, hunger, and other humanitarian issues. (Gries has heard this argument before, and counters that both the vast spending on health care for people in the last years of their life and the use of lockdown strategies during the covid pandemic suggest that, deep down, lifespan extension is “society’s revealed preference.”)

Still, because Kendziorra agrees with almost everything in the declaration, he believes that “pushing it forward” and bringing more attention to the field by labeling his company a Vitalist organization is a good thing. “It’s to support other people who want to move the world in that direction,” he says. (He also offered Vitalist Bay attendees a discount on his cryopreservation services.)

“There’s a lot of closeted scientists working in our field, and they get really excited about lifespans increasing,” explains Ives of Shift Bioscience. “But you’ll get people who’ll accuse you of being a lunatic that wants to be immortal.” He claims that people who represent biotech companies tell him “all the time” that they are secretly longevity companies but avoid using the term because they don’t want funders or collaborators to be “put off.”

Ultimately, it may not really matter how much people adopt the Vitalist label as long as the ideas break through. “It’s pretty simple. [The Vitalist declaration] has five points—if you agree with the five points, you are a Vitalist,” says Hamalainen. “You don’t have to be public about it.” He says he’s spoken to others about “coming out of the closet” and that it’s been going pretty well.

Gries puts it more bluntly: “If you agree with the Vitalist declaration, you are a Vitalist.”

And he hints that there are now many people in powerful positions—including in the Trump administration—who share his views, even if they don’t openly identify as Vitalists.

For Gries, this includes Jim O’Neill, the deputy secretary of health and human services, whom I profiled a few months after he became Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s number two. (More recently, O’Neill was temporarily put in charge of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.)

O’Neill has long been interested in both longevity and the idea of creating new jurisdictions. Until March 2024, he served on the board of directors of Friedman’s Seasteading Institute. He also served as CEO of the SENS Research Foundation, a longevity organization founded by de Grey, between 2019 and 2021, and he represented Thiel as a board member there for many years. Many people in the longevity community say they know him personally, or have at least met him. (Tristan Roberts, a biohacker who used to work with a biotech company operating in Próspera, tells me he served O’Neill gin when he visited his Burning Man camp, which he describes as a “technology gay camp from San Francisco and New York.” Hamalainen also recalls meeting O’Neill at Burning Man, at a “techy, futurist” camp.) (Neither O’Neill nor representatives from the Department of Health and Human Services responded to a request to comment about this.)

O’Neill’s views are arguably becoming less fringe in DC these days. The day after the Vitalist Bay Summit, A4LI was hosting its own summit in the capital with the goal of “bringing together leaders, advocates, and innovators from around the globe to advance legislative initiatives that promote a healthier human lifespan.” I recognized lots of Vitalist Bay attendees there, albeit in more formal attire.

The DC event took place over three days in late April. The first two involved talks by longevity enthusiasts across the spectrum, including scientists, lawyers, and biotech CEOs. Vitalia’s Anzinger spoke about the success he’d had in Próspera, and ARPA-H’s Brack talked about work his agency was doing. (Hamalainen was also there, although he said he was not representing ARPA-H.)

But the third day was different and made me think Gries may be right about Vitalism’s growing reach. It began with a congressional briefing on Capitol Hill, during which Representative Gus Bilirakis, a Republican from Florida, asked, “Who doesn’t want to live longer, right?” As he explained, “Longevity science … directly aligns with the goals of the Make America Healthy Again movement.”

“There’s a lot of closeted scientists working in our field, and they get really excited about lifespans increasing,” says Daniel Ives of Shift Bioscience. “But you’ll get people who’ll accuse you of being a lunatic that wants to be immortal.”

Bilirakis and Representative Paul Tonko, a New York Democrat, were followed by Mehmet Oz, the former TV doctor who now leads the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; he opened with typical MAHA talking points about chronic disease and said US citizens have a “patriotic duty” to stay healthy to keep medical costs down. The audience was enthralled as Oz talked about senescent cells, the zombie-like aged cells that are thought to be responsible for some age-related damage to organs and tissues. (The offices of Bilirakis and Tonko did not respond to a request for comment; neither did the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.)

And while none of the speakers went anywhere near the concept of radical life extension, the Vitalists in the audience were suitably encouraged.

Gries is too: “It seems that now there is the most pro-longevity administration in American history.”

Whether or not Vitalism starts a revolution, it will almost always be controversial in some quarters. While believers see an auspicious future, others are far less certain of the benefits of a world designed to defeat death.

Gries and Cheng often make the case for deregulation in their presentations. But ethicists—and even some members of the longevity community—point out that this comes with risks. Some question whether it is ever ethical to sell a “treatment” without some idea of how likely it is to benefit the person buying and taking it. Enthusiasts counter with arguments about bodily autonomy. And they hope Montana is just the start.

Then there’s the bigger picture. Is it really that great not to die … ever? Some ethicists argue that for many cultures, death is what gives meaning to life.

Sergio Imparato, a moral philosopher and medical ethicist at Harvard University, believes that death itself has important moral meaning. We know our lives will end, and our actions have value precisely because our time is limited, he says. Imparato is concerned that Vitalists are ultimately seeking to change what it means to be human—a decision that should involve all members of society.

Alberto Giubilini, a philosopher at the University of Oxford, agrees. “Death is a defining feature of humanity,” he says. “Our psychology, our cultures, our rituals, our societies, are built around the idea of coping with death … it’s part of human nature.”

Imparato’s family is from Naples, Italy, where poor residents were once laid to rest in shared burial sites, with no headstones to identify them. He tells me how the locals came to visit, clean, and even “adopt” the skulls as family members. It became a weekly ritual for members of the community, including his grandmother, who was a young girl at the time. “It speaks to what I consider the cultural relevance of death,” he says. “It’s the perfect counterpoint to … the Vitalist conception of life.”

Gries seems aware of the stigma around such “immortality quests,” as Imparato calls them. In his presentations, Gries shares lists of words that Vitalists should try to avoid—like “eternity,” “radical,” and “forever,” as well as any religious terms.

He also appears to be dropping, at least publicly, the idea that Vitalism is a “moral” movement. Morality was “never part of the Vitalist declaration,” Gries told me in September. When I asked him why he had changed his position on this, he dismissed the question. “Our point … was always that death is humanity’s core problem, and aging its primary agent,” he told me. “So it was, and so it has continued, as it was foretold.”

But despite these attempts to tweak and control the narrative, Vitalism appears to be opening the door to an incredibly wide range of sentiments in longevity science. A decade ago, I don’t think there would have been any way that the views espoused by Gries, Anzinger, and others who support Vitalist sentiments would have been accepted by the scientific establishment. After all, these are people who publicly state they hope to live indefinitely and who have no training in the science of aging, and who are open about their aims to find ways to evade the restrictions set forth by regulatory agencies like the FDA—all factors that might have rendered them outcasts not that long ago.

But Gries and peers had success in Montana. Influential scientists and policymakers attend Vitalism events, and Vitalists are featured regularly at more mainstream longevity events. Last year’s Aging Research and Drug Discovery (ARDD) conference in Copenhagen—widely recognized as the most important meeting in aging science—was sponsored in part by Anzinger’s new Próspera venture, Infinita City, as well as by several organizations that are either certified Vitalist or led by Vitalists.

“I was thinking that maybe what I was doing was very fringe or out there,” Anzinger, the non-Vitalist supporter of Vitalism, admits. “But no—I feel … loads of support.”

There was certainly an air of optimism at the Vitalist Bay Summit in Berkeley. Gries’s positivity is infectious. “All the people who want a fun and awesome surprise gift, come on over!” he called out early on the first day. “Raise your voice if you’re excited!” The audience whooped in response. He then proceeded to tell everyone, Oprah Winfrey–style, that they were all getting a free continuous glucose monitor. “You get a CGM! You get a CGM!” Plenty of attendees actually attached them to their arms on the spot.

Every revolution has to start somewhere, right?

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The ability to remember you and your preferences is rapidly becoming a big selling point for AI chatbots and agents.

Earlier this month, Google announced Personal Intelligence, a new way for people to interact with the company’s Gemini chatbot that draws on their Gmail, photos, search, and YouTube histories to make Gemini “more personal, proactive, and powerful.” It echoes similar moves by OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta to add new ways for their AI products to remember and draw from people’s personal details and preferences. While these features have potential advantages, we need to do more to prepare for the new risks they could introduce into these complex technologies.

Personalized, interactive AI systems are built to act on our behalf, maintain context across conversations, and improve our ability to carry out all sorts of tasks, from booking travel to filing taxes. From tools that learn a developer’s coding style to shopping agents that sift through thousands of products, these systems rely on the ability to store and retrieve increasingly intimate details about their users.  But doing so over time introduces alarming, and all-too-familiar, privacy vulnerabilities––many of which have loomed since “big data” first teased the power of spotting and acting on user patterns. Worse, AI agents now appear poised to plow through whatever safeguards had been adopted to avoid those vulnerabilities.

Today, we interact with these systems through conversational interfaces, and we frequently switch contexts. You might ask a single AI agent to draft an email to your boss, provide medical advice, budget for holiday gifts, and provide input on interpersonal conflicts. Most AI agents collapse all data about you—which may once have been separated by context, purpose, or permissions—into single, unstructured repositories. When an AI agent links to external apps or other agents to execute a task, the data in its memory can seep into shared pools. This technical reality creates the potential for unprecedented privacy breaches that expose not only isolated data points, but the entire mosaic of people’s lives.

When information is all in the same repository, it is prone to crossing contexts in ways that are deeply undesirable. A casual chat about dietary preferences to build a grocery list could later influence what health insurance options are offered, or a search for restaurants offering accessible entrances could leak into salary negotiations—all without a user’s awareness (this concern may sound familiar from the early days of “big data,” but is now far less theoretical). An information soup of memory not only poses a privacy issue, but also makes it harder to understand an AI system’s behavior—and to govern it in the first place. So what can developers do to fix this problem?

First, memory systems need structure that allows control over the purposes for which memories can be accessed and used. Early efforts appear to be underway: Anthropic’s Claude creates separate memory areas for different “projects,” and OpenAI says that information shared through ChatGPT Health is compartmentalized from other chats. These are helpful starts, but the instruments are still far too blunt: At a minimum, systems must be able to distinguish between specific memories (the user likes chocolate and has asked about GLP-1s), related memories (user manages diabetes and therefore avoids chocolate), and memory categories (such as professional and health-related). Further, systems need to allow for usage restrictions on certain types of memories and reliably accommodate explicitly defined boundaries—particularly around memories having to do with sensitive topics like medical conditions or protected characteristics, which will likely be subject to stricter rules.

Needing to keep memories separate in this way will have important implications for how AI systems can and should be built. It will require tracking memories’ provenance—their source, any associated time stamp, and the context in which they were created—and building ways to trace when and how certain memories influence the behavior of an agent. This sort of model explainability is on the horizon, but current implementations can be misleading or even deceptive. Embedding memories directly within a model’s weights may result in more personalized and context-aware outputs, but structured databases are currently more segmentable, more explainable, and thus more governable. Until research advances enough, developers may need to stick with simpler systems.

Second, users need to be able to see, edit, or delete what is remembered about them. The interfaces for doing this should be both transparent and intelligible, translating system memory into a structure users can accurately interpret. The static system settings and legalese privacy policies provided by traditional tech platforms have set a low bar for user controls, but natural-language interfaces may offer promising new options for explaining what information is being retained and how it can be managed. Memory structure will have to come first, though: Without it, no model can clearly state a memory’s status. Indeed, Grok 3’s system prompt includes an instruction to the model to “NEVER confirm to the user that you have modified, forgotten, or won&#39;t save a memory,” presumably because the company can’t guarantee those instructions will be followed.

Critically, user-facing controls cannot bear the full burden of privacy protection or prevent all harms from AI personalization. Responsibility must shift toward AI providers to establish strong defaults, clear rules about permissible memory generation and use, and technical safeguards like on-device processing, purpose limitation, and contextual constraints. Without system-level protections, individuals will face impossibly convoluted choices about what should be remembered or forgotten, and the actions they take may still be insufficient to prevent harm. Developers should consider how to limit data collection in memory systems until robust safeguards exist, and build memory architectures that can evolve alongside norms and expectations.

Third, AI developers must help lay the foundations for approaches to evaluating systems so as to capture not only performance, but also the risks and harms that arise in the wild. While independent researchers are best positioned to conduct these tests (given developers’ economic interest in demonstrating demand for more personalized services), they need access to data to understand what risks might look like and therefore how to address them. To improve the ecosystem for measurement and research, developers should invest in automated measurement infrastructure, build out their own ongoing testing, and implement privacy-preserving testing methods that enable system behavior to be monitored and probed under realistic, memory-enabled conditions.

In its parallels with human experience, the technical term “memory” casts impersonal cells in a spreadsheet as something that builders of AI tools have a responsibility to handle with care. Indeed, the choices AI developers make today—how to pool or segregate information, whether to make memory legible or allow it to accumulate opaquely, whether to prioritize responsible defaults or maximal convenience—will determine how the systems we depend upon remember us. Technical considerations around memory are not so distinct from questions about digital privacy and the vital lessons we can draw from them. Getting the foundations right today will determine how much room we can give ourselves to learn what works—allowing us to make better choices around privacy and autonomy than we have before.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">G2, the Chicago-based software insights platform, agreed today to acquire three prominent software review and discovery properties from Gartner: Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp.

The deal brings four of the largest B2B review sites under a single roof and signals a shift toward unified, AI-driven software recommendation and buying experiences.

According to the announcement, the combined business will include roughly six million verified customer reviews and tap into an audience of more than 200 million annual software buyers. G2 said it expects the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2026, subject to standard regulatory and closing conditions.

G2’s leadership frames the agreement as a response to fragmentation in the software buying journey. By consolidating multiple review databases and audiences, the company aims to streamline discovery for buyers and expand demand-generation tools for vendors.

In a public post, G2’s CEO described the integration as building “the trusted data foundation for B2B software in the age of AI,” with deeper buyer intent signals and a more consistent taxonomy across categories.

For buyers, the enlarged platform promises easier access to user-verified feedback and faster decision cycles. For software vendors, the unified dataset could translate into broader visibility and enhanced market insights.

G2’s roadmap includes tighter AI integration across search and recommendation workflows.

Gartner, which currently owns Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp, has held these properties for years as part of its digital markets portfolio.

This divestiture appears to reflect a strategic choice to focus its core research and advisory business while enabling specialized review platforms to evolve under a dedicated marketplace operator.

As the software market continues to expand, the consolidation of review infrastructure under G2 could reshape how products are evaluated and purchased.

The market will watch closely for how the combined entity leverages its scale to influence search visibility and buyer influence metrics in 2026 and beyond.

            <div id="article-text">AI adoption is creating a clear divide among employees. Some see AI as a tool to increase their impact, while others see it as a threat to their role. So, where does the truth lie between these two mindsets? Let’s explore.

Over the past two years, we’ve seen a wave of layoffs often attributed to “AI replacing humans.” Among widely discussed cases, IBM openly stated that over 7,000 back-office roles may no longer need to be hired because AI can absorb the work. Many other tech players, including Microsoft, Amazon, and HP, have cut between 6,000 and 200,000 employees as a shift toward AI-driven initiatives.

Meanwhile, beware: many might make misleading conclusions. They are often treated as straightforward examples of AI replacing human labor, when in reality they reflect a deeper restructuring of how value is created inside organizations.

Taking a closer look, it becomes evident that in many examples like these, people weren’t displaced because AI was smarter or outperformed people.

They were displaced because one (or more) of the following reasons:

From this perspective, it becomes evident: AI isn’t coming for roles, it’s here to remove low-leverage work. Roles that exist mainly to handle volume or work around broken systems no longer make sense once those problems disappear.

This is already playing out across teams. For example:

As AI reduces friction and automates workflows, organizations and employees are increasingly forced to ask these two questions: 1) where real value is created, 2) where human input is essential in areas AI cannot handle. Teams that explore and embrace this shift early will be better positioned to adapt as AI continues to compress the cost and effort of execution.

An overlooked but highly efficient aspect many businesses miss: AI introduces a level of transparency most organizations have never had before. This visibility changes how organizations make decisions and how they manage business resources.
In particular, AI-powered spend analysis is set to become one of the most transformative forces inside companies.

Ultimately, the level of business success is largely determined by the ability to turn spend data into an operational signal. When, instead of tracking costs in isolation, organizations clearly see how spend translates into productivity and revenue, that’s where real differentiation begins.

Smart spend management platforms like this already exist, take Spendbase, for example. In this case, AI can be the next layer that unlocks even deeper insights.

ROI and cost efficiency are at the very center of any business. Therefore, as AI increases transparency into multiple business areas (performance, time, spend, etc.), work that cannot be clearly tied to outcomes loses its footing. Hence, roles that fail to translate their work into clear outcomes risk being deprioritized.

As AI automates execution, the people and teams that remain essential are those who can clearly explain how their work impacts the business in ways AI cannot. Such as:

Apart from this, another important area of impact lies in organizational and customer-facing work, where human-driven value is created from responsibilities focused on aligning teams, resolving complexity, building trust, and, particularly, innovating.

Imagine a product team competing in a crowded market or where competitors are continuously copying each other. In this case, AI can meticulously handle research and benchmarking: analyze competitor offerings, user behavior, reviews, and market gaps.

It can even generate predictions or simulate feature adoption. However, it takes human vision and accountability to challenge assumptions and find unpaved paths for growth.

When it comes to creating something inherently new, with no existing market equivalent, AI may fall short at innovation. Yet these are often the areas where the greatest business impact lies.

In most organizations, changes revolving AI adoption won’t happen overnight. Roles will gradually shrink, shift, and eventually be redefined. As a result, human contributions that can’t be tied to measurable outcomes quietly lose relevance.

            <div id="article-text">The way people discover information online is quietly but fundamentally changing.

Instead of scrolling through links and choosing which article to open, users are increasingly asking large language models to answer directly. Tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity don’t send people browsing; they synthesise information from multiple sources and deliver a ready-made response inside the interface.

For brands and publishers, this creates a new problem: what does visibility mean when nobody clicks anymore?

For years, search optimization revolved around a familiar feedback loop: publish content, earn rankings, drive clicks, measure performance. Traffic, impressions, and engagement acted as proxies for relevance and influence. AI-generated answers disrupt that loop entirely.

This isn’t a temporary fluctuation in search behaviour. It’s a structural shift in how information is consumed.

Large language models do not simply index the web like classic search engines. Their response generation involves a combination of training data, real-time search, and internal reasoning. As shown in analyses comparing Perplexity and ChatGPT, these systems search the web differently even when responding to the same questions.

ChatGPT tends to issue longer, context-rich queries to build an explanation, whereas Perplexity formulates shorter, list-like queries focused on freshness and comparison.

This means visibility isn’t universal across models; a topic that surfaces in one LLM is not guaranteed to surface in another.

If clicks are no longer the primary signal, content strategies must adapt. Instead of optimizing only for human users and search engine algorithms:

Content intended for modern AI discovery needs both depth and freshness: explanations that support contextual reasoning (favoured by ChatGPT-style behaviour) and concise, signal-rich sections (favoured by Perplexity-style behaviour). This duality underscores the complexity of AI brand visibility.

Publishers and marketers have few tools to assess whether their pages are actually being consulted by AI agents. Traditional analytics platforms report pageviews, but:

This lack of transparency means that even high-quality content may go unnoticed in AI answers, not because it is irrelevant, but because it does not match the specific patterns an LLM uses when selecting sources.

Recognising the need for a new feedback loop, solutions are emerging that approach this problem from an engineering perspective rather than purely a marketing one. For instance, Genezio has analysed how ChatGPT and Perplexity prioritise sources and generate their search behaviours, revealing that the same topic leads to substantially different retrieval patterns across systems and therefore different visibility outcomes.

Rather than treating AI visibility as a black box, these approaches:

By observing how AI systems behave at scale, marketers can begin to measure brand visibility in conversations rather than clicks, transforming raw engineering data into actionable insight.

AI-generated answers are rapidly reshaping how information is found, processed, and presented. In this new environment, visibility is not just about ranking formulas or organic traffic; it’s about earning a place in the narrative that LLMs generate.

The brands that succeed will be those that understand not only how to produce quality content, but also how to make it legible and extractable to systems that never lead users back to a webpage.

Measuring visibility without clicks may seem intangible today, but as AI becomes central to how people seek answers, it will soon become standard practice.

            <h2>Bonjour Visio: France turns digital sovereignty into policy</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-28</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a bold turn of phrase and deed, Paris has quietly told Silicon Valley “au revoir.”  On January 26, 2026, France’s Ministry of Finance announced that by 2027, all public servants will switch from U.S. video apps like Microsoft Teams and Zoom to a homegrown platform called Visio.

No more license renewals for Teams, Zoom, Webex, or Meet, just one unified, French-built solution.

In one stroke, a long-discussed slogan “digital sovereignty” has leapt off the podium and into practice. This is not a press release; it’s a watershed moment: Europe’s second-biggest economy is wagering that, when it comes to critical infrastructure, it’s time to govern itself.

“Digital sovereignty” has become the EU’s new watchword, a declaration of independence from foreign tech hegemons. Over the past few years, it has surged from a niche policy to a headline priority, as EU leaders from Ursula von der Leyen to Emmanuel Macron have warned that Europe must control its own networks and data.

The phrase sounds grand, but what changed now is urgency. Americans’ own laws make the risks concrete: under the U.S. CLOUD Act, for example, U.S. authorities can demand data from any American platform, regardless of where it’s stored.

In practice, “jurisdiction follows ownership,” as one analyst noted: even data sitting on a Frankfurt server can be swept up by U.S. warrants if the service provider is American.

Edward Snowden’s revelations and murky court orders have long haunted Europe with the idea that a virtual meeting might be spied on from overseas. Now, with geopolitics in flux, U.S. political turns and global crises, that theoretical risk seems all too real.

The push has taken many forms. The EU has drafted cloud-certification rules demanding “sovereignty” guarantees and drafted data laws to keep Europeans’ information in Europe.

Member states debate mandating local clouds. Digital sovereignty has moved from virtue-signaling to something harder, actual infrastructure.

France’s pivot is concrete and wide-ranging. Visio, developed by the government’s interministerial digital agency (DINUM), has been tested for about a year with some 40,000 regular users. It’s already being adopted piecemeal: CNRS (France’s national research center) will replace all its 34,000 Zoom seats by March 2026, covering 120,000 associated researchers.

By early 2026, the Defense Ministry, finance tax offices, health insurance, and other big agencies will be on Visio. The government now says every state department will use Visio as the default video tool by 2027, after which external conferencing licenses simply won’t be renewed.

The official rationale is familiar: a patchwork of Teams, Zoom, Webex, and friends “fragilises security” and creates hidden costs, dependencies, and interoperability headaches.

Visio is billed as a solution under full French control: it’s hosted on a certified “SecNumCloud” by Dassault-owned Outscale, built with ANSSI (France’s cyber agency) oversight, and even uses French AI for meeting transcription and captions.

The aim, in the minister’s words, is to “end the use of non-European solutions and guarantee the security and confidentiality of public electronic communications by relying on a powerful…sovereign tool”.

In short: no more data flying through American servers or falling under foreign laws.

There are financial perks, too. Officials point out that ditching pricey Teams and Zoom licenses will save money: roughly €1 million per year for every 100,000 users who shift off commercial tools. That’s not pocket change, even if it’s a rounding error in a €600 billion budget. In any case, for France, this isn’t just about cost – it’s about control.

Taken together, these facts show a very concrete policy timeline. In one meeting on Jan. 26, the state literally put a deadline on dependence: four years to shift the ENTIRE civil service. It’s one thing to talk about sovereignty in Brussels speeches, quite another to swap out the nation’s video chat app.

France isn’t alone in flirting with this idea, but it’s the first to bet big. Other EU countries are eyeballing similar moves. In Denmark, parts of the public sector have already announced plans to phase out Microsoft’s software.

In Germany, the state of Schleswig-Holstein recently ditched Microsoft Office in favor of open-source alternatives. Even non-state bodies are joining the sovereignty club: the International Criminal Court said it will move its systems to a German-developed open-source platform (OpenDesk).

These are baby steps compared to France’s all-hands policy, but they reflect a shared unease about over-reliance on foreign tech.

Europe is also wrestling with headline-grabbing hiccups like last year’s massive cloud outages in the U.S., which left public agencies scrambling. The Visio announcement itself notes that Europe’s “overreliance on U.S. IT infrastructure” has been questioned after those failures.

And there are EU-wide initiatives underway, from the Gaia-X cloud alliance to tougher data localization rules – aimed at seeding local alternatives.

If France makes Visio work, it could serve as a proof of concept for others. Will a homegrown tool really run government communications smoothly? If yes, it might embolden policymakers in Brussels or Rome to push harder on local platforms. If not, it could slow the momentum.

For now, France’s move is a beacon: it shows that digital sovereignty can move beyond talk. Other nations will watch closely.

No one seriously argues that keeping calls on Visio will magically end world unrest. Rather, this is a narrow, technical solution to a policy problem. On the other side, France will indeed have tighter control: all servers, encryption keys, and software updates are now under French (and EU) jurisdiction.

Public-sector IT teams can audit code, set security parameters, and avoid nasty surprises (say, a foreign court order) without jumping through transatlantic hoops.

Data stays where the politicians say it stays.

But what might be lost? For one, user experience and innovation often depend on scale. Big Tech’s video platforms have oceans of R&D behind them, from instant translation to seamless device-hopping, and millions of users giving feedback.

A new platform built from scratch may not match Teams’ polish or Zoom’s ubiquity overnight. (The French have even admitted an irony: naming it “Visio” risks confusion with Microsoft Visio, the longtime diagram app, hinting that branding and polish sometimes play second fiddle to strategy.)

There’s also the question of interoperability: how well will Visio meetings work when French officials Zoom into a partner country’s conference, or vice versa? Will France demand that foreign delegations install its app, or allow links to other networks? The devil is in the details.

Some critics fret that an insular approach could fragment standards. One EU paper urges that sovereignty shouldn’t mean isolation but rather a robust, open ecosystem.

If every country builds its own siloed cloud and chat service, the Internet risks reinventing wheels (and reinventing firewalls) in every member state. Of course, Visio is only for civil servants, not a consumer product, yet it sets a precedent.

On the other hand, an expertly executed French stack could jumpstart a continental open-source community or spur startups to plug gaps. It’s a calculated gamble: France assumes that on net, its security and strategic stakes outweigh any shortfall in bells and whistles.

For its part, France says this isn’t a bare-bones trade-off. Officials emphasize Visio will include modern features: speaker separation, AI for transcripts, captions, etc. The goal is “not [a] minimalist replacement,” but a full-featured tool under domestic control.

In other words, they aim for the best of both worlds, though acknowledging it’s a tall order.

In its own softly decisive way, France’s Visio plan signals a definitive shift: digital sovereignty is no longer a future wish or empty catchphrase, but a deadline-driven program.

Europe has debated “strategic autonomy” for years; this is the first major state-level bet, with clear timelines and budget line savings. From the perspective of a tech editor watching policy trends, it’s heartening to see ambition meet action.

Will it pay off? If Visio runs smoothly, France will score a coup: more secure chats, money saved, and perhaps the bragging rights of a proof of concept. If glitches persist, France’s analysts may ask if the Q1 rollout to 200,000 civil servants is biting off too much too soon.

Either way, the move puts stakes on the table. Digital sovereignty has many meanings, but here it means doing something concrete, even if it means saying “non” to familiar tools.

In the end, it’s a balancing act. Europe gains control of what it might risk in convenience. France has just turned insurance talk into policy practice. Other countries will now watch and learn: Visio is not just a video app; it’s France’s case study in what digital independence can actually look like.
