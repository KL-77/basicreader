            <h2>AI companies want you to stop chatting with bots and start managing them</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/02/ai-companies-want-you-to-stop-chatting-with-bots-and-start-managing-them/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Thursday, Anthropic and OpenAI shipped products built around the same idea: instead of chatting with a single AI assistant, users should be managing teams of AI agents that divide up work and run in parallel. The simultaneous releases are part of a gradual shift across the industry, from AI as a conversation partner to AI as a delegated workforce, and they arrive during a week when that very concept reportedly helped wipe $285 billion off software stocks.

Whether that supervisory model works in practice remains an open question. Current AI agents still require heavy human intervention to catch errors, and no independent evaluation has confirmed that these multi-agent tools reliably outperform a single developer working alone.

Even so, the companies are going all-in on agents. Anthropic’s contribution is Claude Opus 4.6, a new version of its most capable AI model, paired with a feature called “agent teams” in Claude Code. Agent teams let developers spin up multiple AI agents that split a task into independent pieces, coordinate autonomously, and run concurrently.

In practice, agent teams look like a split-screen terminal environment: A developer can jump between subagents using Shift+Up/Down, take over any one directly, and watch the others keep working. Anthropic describes the feature as best suited for “tasks that split into independent, read-heavy work like codebase reviews.” It is available as a research preview.

OpenAI, meanwhile, released Frontier, an enterprise platform it describes as a way to “hire AI co-workers who take on many of the tasks people already do on a computer.” Frontier assigns each AI agent its own identity, permissions, and memory, and it connects to existing business systems such as CRMs, ticketing tools, and data warehouses. “What we’re fundamentally doing is basically transitioning agents into true AI co-workers,” Barret Zoph, OpenAI’s general manager of business-to-business, told CNBC.

Despite the hype about these agents being co-workers, from our experience, these agents tend to work best if you think of them as tools that amplify existing skills, not as the autonomous co-workers the marketing language implies. They can produce impressive drafts fast but still require constant human course-correction.

The Frontier launch came just three days after OpenAI released a new macOS desktop app for Codex, its AI coding tool, which OpenAI executives described as a “command center for agents.” The Codex app lets developers run multiple agent threads in parallel, each working on an isolated copy of a codebase via Git worktrees.

OpenAI also released GPT-5.3-Codex on Thursday, a new AI model that powers the Codex app. OpenAI claims that the Codex team used early versions of GPT-5.3-Codex to debug the model’s own training run, manage its deployment, and diagnose test results, similar to what OpenAI told Ars Technica in a December interview.

“Our team was blown away by how much Codex was able to accelerate its own development,” the company wrote. On Terminal-Bench 2.0, the agentic coding benchmark, GPT-5.3-Codex scored 77.3%, which exceeds Anthropic’s just-released Opus 4.6 by about 12 percentage points.

The common thread across all of these products is a shift in the user’s role. Rather than merely typing a prompt and waiting for a single response, the developer or knowledge worker becomes more like a supervisor, dispatching tasks, monitoring progress, and stepping in when an agent needs direction.

In this vision, developers and knowledge workers effectively become middle managers of AI. That is, not writing the code or doing the analysis themselves, but delegating tasks, reviewing output, and hoping the agents underneath them don’t quietly break things. Whether that will come to pass (or if it’s actually a good idea) is still widely debated.

Opus 4.6 is a substantial update to Anthropic’s flagship model. It succeeds Claude Opus 4.5, which Anthropic released in November. In a first for the Opus model family, it supports a context window of up to 1 million tokens (in beta), which means it can process much larger bodies of text or code in a single session.

On benchmarks, Anthropic says Opus 4.6 tops OpenAI’s GPT-5.2 (an earlier model than the one released today) and Google’s Gemini 3 Pro across several evaluations, including Terminal-Bench 2.0 (an agentic coding test), Humanity’s Last Exam (a multidisciplinary reasoning test), and BrowseComp (a test of finding hard-to-locate information online)

Although it should be noted that OpenAI’s GPT-5.3-Codex, released the same day, seemingly reclaimed the lead on Terminal-Bench. On ARC AGI 2, which attempts to test the ability to solve problems that are easy for humans but hard for AI models, Opus 4.6 scored 68.8 percent, compared to 37.6 percent for Opus 4.5, 54.2 percent for GPT-5.2, and 45.1 percent for Gemini 3 Pro.

As always, take AI benchmarks with a grain of salt, since objectively measuring AI model capabilities is a relatively new and unsettled science.

Anthropic also said that on a long-context retrieval benchmark called MRCR v2, Opus 4.6 scored 76 percent on the 1 million-token variant, compared to 18.5 percent for its Sonnet 4.5 model. That gap matters for the agent teams use case, since agents working across large codebases need to track information across hundreds of thousands of tokens without losing the thread.

Pricing for the API stays the same as Opus 4.5 at $5 per million input tokens and $25 per million output tokens, with a premium rate of $10/$37.50 for prompts that exceed 200,000 tokens. Opus 4.6 is available on claude.ai, the Claude API, and all major cloud platforms.

These releases occurred during a week of exceptional volatility for software stocks. On January 30, Anthropic released 11 open source plugins for Cowork, its agentic productivity tool that launched on January 12. Cowork itself is a general-purpose tool that gives Claude access to local folders for work tasks, but the plugins extended it into specific professional domains: legal contract review, non-disclosure agreement triage, compliance workflows, financial analysis, sales, and marketing.

By Tuesday, investors reportedly reacted to the release by erasing roughly $285 billion in market value across software, financial services, and asset management stocks. A Goldman Sachs basket of US software stocks fell 6 percent that day, its steepest single-session decline since April’s tariff-driven sell-off. Thomson Reuters led the rout with an 18 percent drop, and the pain spread to European and Asian markets.

The purported fear among investors centers on AI model companies packaging complete workflows that compete with established software-as-a-service (SaaS) vendors, even if the verdict is still out on whether these tools can achieve those tasks.

OpenAI’s Frontier might deepen that concern: its stated design lets AI agents log in to applications, execute tasks, and manage work with minimal human involvement, which Fortune described as a bid to become “the operating system of the enterprise.” OpenAI CEO of Applications Fidji Simo pushed back on the idea that Frontier replaces existing software, telling reporters, “Frontier is really a recognition that we’re not going to build everything ourselves.”

Whether these co-working apps actually live up to their billing or not, the convergence is hard to miss. Anthropic’s Scott White, the company’s head of product for enterprise, gave the practice a name that is likely to roll a few eyes. “Everybody has seen this transformation happen with software engineering in the last year and a half, where vibe coding started to exist as a concept, and people could now do things with their ideas,” White told CNBC. “I think that we are now transitioning almost into vibe working.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 2018, we lamented as Nintendo officially replaced the Virtual Console—its long-running line of downloadable classic games on the Wii and Wii U—with time-limited access to a set of games through a paid Nintendo Switch Online subscription. Now, Hamster Corporation is doing what Nintendo no longer will, by offering downloadable versions of retro console games for direct individual purchase on the Switch 2.

As part of today’s Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase, Hamster announced a new Console Archives line of emulated classics available for download starting today on the Switch 2 and next week on the PlayStation 5 (sorry, Xbox and OG Switch fans). So far that lineup only includes the original PlayStation snowboarding title Cool Boarders for $12 and the NES action platformer Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos for $8, but Hamster promises more obscure games, including Doraemon and Sonic Wings Special, will be available in the future.

If the name Hamster Corporation sounds familiar, it’s because the company is behind the Arcade Archive series, which has repackaged individual arcade games for purchase and emulated play on modern consoles since 2014. That effort, which celebrated its 500th release in December, even includes some of Nintendo’s classic arcade titles, which the Switch-maker never officially released on the original Virtual Console.

Now Hamster’s says it is expanding its efforts “with the concept of faithfully reproducing masterpieces released on various home game consoles, allowing players to easily enjoy them on the latest hardware.” While these new offerings are more bare-bones than the full-fledged interactive museums released by the likes of Digital Eclipse, they still include a few modern features, such as customizable button layouts, screen settings, and the ability to save and load at any time.

Hamster says on its website that it “would like to port and release as many games as possible,” practically begging “those of you who own the rights to the games, please let us release your games” by licensing or outright selling the rights.

“We believe it is very important to pass this on to future generations around the world, and to create an environment where anyone can play it anytime, anywhere,” Hamster writes. “Everyone has different memories of games. We aim to release as many titles as possible so that people can rediscover and play the games that evoke fond memories of the time they played them.”

Incidentally, Ninja Gaiden II was previously offered on the Wii Virtual Console back in 2007 and again on the Wii U Virtual Console in 2016. Both releases cost just $5 at the time, but the shutdown of Nintendo’s Wii and Wii U eShops means the game is no longer available for purchase on those defunct platforms. Thank goodness, then, that Hamster is offering an opportunity to purchase the game for the third time in as many decades on yet another new console. Fully portable ROMs of the game are just way too convenient to purchase, you know?</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Today, OpenAI announced GPT-5.3-Codex, a new version of its frontier coding model that will be available via the command line, IDE extension, web interface, and the new macOS desktop app. (No API access yet, but it’s coming.)

GPT-5.3-Codex outperforms GPT-5.2-Codex and GPT-5.2 in SWE-Bench Pro, Terminal-Bench 2.0, and other benchmarks, according to the company’s testing.

There are already a few headlines out there saying “Codex built itself,” but let’s reality-check that, as that’s an overstatement. The domains OpenAI described using it for here are similar to the ones you see in some other enterprise software development firms now: managing deployments, debugging, and handling test results and evaluations. There is no claim here that GPT-5.3-Codex built itself.

Instead, OpenAI says GPT-5.3-Codex was “instrumental in creating itself.” You can read more about what that means in the company’s blog post.

But that’s part of the pitch with this model update—OpenAI is trying to position Codex as a tool that does more than generate lines of code. The goal is to make it useful for “all of the work in the software lifecycle—debugging, deploying, monitoring, writing PRDs, editing copy, user research, tests, metrics, and more.” There’s also an emphasis on steering the model mid-task and frequent status updates.

It’s worth mentioning that the general-purpose ChatGPT model is still version numbered 5.2. With Codex moving to 5.3, OpenAI may be planning a similar update for ChatGPT in the near future, but nothing has been announced yet.

There are no announced changes to limits or pricing with this model, but OpenAI says that, as of this update, models will run 25 percent faster for Codex users, “thanks to improvements in our infrastructure and inference stack.”

OpenAI also notes that “what’s next” for Codex is “moving beyond writing code to using it as a tool to operate a computer and get real work done end to end.” That’s something that people have already been using these tools for via MCP and other methods, and which Anthropic started rolling out with Claude Cowork a few weeks back.</div>

            <h2>"ICE Out of Our Faces Act" would ban ICE and CBP use of facial recognition</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/ice-out-of-our-faces-act-would-ban-ice-and-cbp-use-of-facial-recognition/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A few Senate Democrats introduced a bill called the ‘‘ICE Out of Our Faces Act,” which would ban Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) from using facial recognition technology.

The bill would make it “unlawful for any covered immigration officer to acquire, possess, access, or use in the United States—(1) any biometric surveillance system; or (2) information derived from a biometric surveillance system operated by another entity.” All data collected from such systems in the past would have to be deleted. The proposed ban extends beyond facial recognition to cover other biometric surveillance technologies, such as voice recognition.

The proposed ban would prohibit the federal government from using data from biometric surveillance systems in court cases or investigations. Individuals would have a right to sue the federal government for financial damages after violations, and state attorneys general would be able to bring suits on behalf of residents.

The bill was submitted yesterday by Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), who held a press conference about the proposal with Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), and US Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.). The Senate bill is also cosponsored by Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).

“This is a dangerous moment for America,” Markey said at the press conference, saying that ICE and CBP “have built an arsenal of surveillance technologies that are designed to track and to monitor and to target individual people, both citizens and non-citizens alike. Facial recognition technology sits at the center of a digital dragnet that has been created in our nation.”

Jayapal said, “This is a very dangerous intersection of overly violent and overzealous activity from ICE and Border Patrol, and the increasing use of biometric identification systems. This has become a surveillance state with militarized federal troops on our streets terrorizing and intimidating US citizens and residents alike.”

There probably isn’t much chance that the Republican-majority Congress will vote to ban the use of facial recognition by ICE and CBP. The Markey bill goes beyond demands sent to Republicans yesterday by House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).

Jeffries and Schumer’s list of demanded ICE reforms did not include a ban on facial recognition, but said body-worn cameras should be used “for accountability, not tracking,” and that ICE should be prohibited from “tracking, creating or maintaining databases of individuals participating in First Amendment activities.” Markey separately demanded earlier this week that Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons confirm or deny the existence of a “domestic terrorists” database that lists US citizens who protest Trump’s immigration crackdown.

Immigration agents have used face-scanning technology on people who protest or observe ICE activity. An ICE observer in Minnesota recently said in a court filing that her Global Entry and TSA PreCheck privileges were revoked three days after an incident in which an agent scanned her face.

In another recent incident in Portland, Maine, a masked agent told an observer who was taking video that “we have a nice little database and now you’re considered a domestic terrorist.” A CNN report last week said a memo sent to ICE agents in Minneapolis told them to “capture all images, license plates, identifications, and general information on hotels, agitators, protestors, etc., so we can capture it all in one consolidated form.”</div>

            <h2>Neocities founder stuck in chatbot hell after Bing blocked 1.5 million sites</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/neocities-founder-stuck-in-chatbot-hell-after-bing-blocked-1-5m-sites/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">One of the weirdest corners of the Internet is suddenly hard to find on Bing, after the search engine inexplicably started blocking approximately 1.5 million independent websites hosted on Neocities.

Founded in 2013 to archive the “aesthetic awesomeness” of GeoCities websites, Neocities keeps the spirit of the 1990s Internet alive. It lets users design free websites without relying on standardized templates devoid of personality. For hundreds of thousands of people building websites around art, niche fandoms, and special expertise—or simply seeking a place to get a little weird online—Neocities provides a blank canvas that can be endlessly personalized when compared to a Facebook page. Delighted visitors discovering these sites are more likely to navigate by hovering flashing pointers over a web of spinning GIFs than clicking a hamburger menu or infinitely scrolling.

That’s the style of Internet that Kyle Drake, Neocities’ founder, strives to maintain. So he was surprised when he noticed that Bing was curiously blocking Neocities sites last summer. At first, the issue seemed resolved by contacting Microsoft, but after receiving more recent reports that users were struggling to log in, Drake discovered that another complete block was implemented in January. Even more concerning, he saw that after delisting the front page, Bing had started pointing users to a copycat site where he was alarmed to learn they were providing their login credentials.

Monitoring stats, Drake was stunned to see that Bing traffic had suddenly dropped from about half a million daily visitors to zero. He immediately reported the issue using Bing webmaster tools. Concerned that Bing was not just disrupting traffic but possibly also putting Neocities users at risk if bad actors were gaming search results, he hoped for a prompt resolution.

“This one site that was just a copy of our front page, I didn’t know if it was a phishing attack or what it was, I was just like, ‘whoa, what the heck?’” Drake told Ars.

However, weeks went by as Drake hit wall after wall, submitting nearly a dozen tickets while trying to get past the Bing chatbot to find a support member to fix the issue. Frustrated, he tried other internal channels as well, including offering to buy ads to see if an ads team member could help.

“I tried everything,” Drake said, but nothing worked. Neocities sites remained unlisted on Bing.

Although Bing only holds about 4.5 percent of the global search engine market, Drake said it was “embarrassing” that Neocities sites can’t be discovered using the default Windows search engine. He also noted that many other search engines license Bing data, further compounding the issue.

Ultimately, it’s affecting a lot of people, Drake said, but he suspects that his support tickets are being buried in probably trillions of requests each day from people wanting to improve their Bing indexing.

“There’s probably an actual human being at Bing that actually could fix this,” Drake told Ars, but “when you go to the webmaster tools,” you’re stuck talking to an AI chatbot, and “it’s all kind of automated.”

Ars reached Microsoft for comment, and the company took action to remove some inappropriate blocks.

Within 24 hours, the Neocities front page appeared in search results, but Drake ran tests over the next few days that showed that most subdomains are still being blocked, including popular Neocities sites that should garner high rankings.

Pressed to investigate further, Microsoft confirmed that some Neocities sites were delisted for violating policies designed to keep low-quality sites out of search results.

However, Microsoft would not identify which sites were problematic or directly connect with Neocities to resolve a seemingly significant amount of ongoing site blocks that do not appear to be linked to violations. Instead, Microsoft recommended that Neocities find a way to work directly with Microsoft, despite Ars confirming that Microsoft is currently ignoring an open ticket.

For Drake, “the current state of things is unknown.” It’s hard to tell if popular Neocities sites are still being blocked or if possibly Bing’s reindexing process is slow. Microsoft declined to clarify.

He’s still hoping that Microsoft will eventually resolve all the improper blocks, making it possible for Bing users to use the search engine not just to find businesses or information but also to discover creative people making websites just for fun. With so much AI slop invading social networks and search engines, Drake sees Neocities as “one of the last bastions of human content.”

“I hope we can resolve this amicably for both of us and that this doesn’t happen again in the future,” Drake said. “It’s really important for the future of the small web, and for quality content for web surfers in an increasingly generative AI world, that creative sites made by real humans are able to get a fair shot in search engine results.”

After Drake failed to quietly resolve the issue with Bing, he felt that he had no choice but to alert users to the potential risks from Bing’s delisting.

In a blog post in late January, Drake warned that Bing had “completely blocked” all Neocities subdomains from its search index. Even worse, “Bing was also placing what appeared to be a phishing attack against Neocities on the first page of search results,” Drake said.

“This is not only bad for search results, it’s very possible that it is actively dangerous,” Drake said.

After “several” complaints, Bing eventually deranked the suspected phishing site, Drake confirmed. But Bing “declined to reverse the block or provide a clear, actionable explanation for it,” which leaves Neocities users vulnerable, he said.

Since “it’s easy to get higher pagerank than a blocked site,” Drake warned that “it is possibly only a matter of time before another concerning site appears on Bing searches for Neocities.”

The blog emphasized that Google, the platform’s biggest traffic driver, was not blocking Neocities, nor was any search engine unlinked to Bing data. Urging a boycott that may force a resolution, Drake wrote, “we are recommending that Neocities users, and the broader Internet in general, not use Bing or search engines that source their results from Bing until this issue is resolved.

“If you use Bing or Bing-powered search engines, Neocities sites will not appear in your search results, regardless of content quality, originality, or compliance with webmaster guidelines,” Drake said. “If any Neocities-like sites appear on these results, they may be active phishing attacks against Neocities and should be treated with caution.”

Drake doesn’t want to boycott Bing, but in his blog, he said that Microsoft left him no choice but public disclosure:

“We did not want to write this post. We try very hard to have a good relationship with search engine providers. We would much rather quietly resolve this issue with Bing staff and move on. But after months of attempting to engage constructively through multiple channels, it became clear that silence only harms our users. Especially those who don’t realize their sites are invisible on some search engines.”

Drake told Ars that he thinks most people don’t realize how big Neocities has gotten since its early days reviving GeoCities’ spunk. The platform hosts 1,459,700 websites that have drawn in 13 billion visitors. Over the years, it has been profiled in Wired and The New York Times, and more recently, it has become a popular hub for gaming communities, Polygon reported.

As Neocities grew, Drake told Ars that much of his focus has been on improving content moderation. He works closely with a full-time dedicated content moderation staffer to quickly take down any problematic sites within 24 hours, he said. That effort includes reviewing reports and proactively screening new sites, with Drake noting that “our name domain provider requires us to take them down within 48 hours.”

Microsoft prohibits things like scraping content that could be considered copyright infringement or automatically generating content using “garbage text” to game the rankings. It also monitors for malicious behavior like phishing, as well as for prompt injection attacks on Bing’s large language model.

It’s unclear what kind of violations Microsoft found ahead of instituting the complete block; however, Drake told Ars that he has yet to identify any content that may have triggered it. He said he would promptly remove any websites flagged by Microsoft, if he could only talk to someone who could share that information.

“Naturally, we still don’t catch 100 percent of the sites with proactive moderation, and occasionally some problematic sites do get missed,” Drake said.

Although Drake is curious to learn more about what triggered the blocks, he told Ars that it’s clear that non-violative sites are still invisible on Bing.

One of the longest-running and most popular Neocities sites, Wired Sound for Wired People, is a perfect example. The bizarre, somewhat creepy anime fanpage is “very popular” and “has a lot of links to it all over the web,” Drake said. Yet if you search for its subdomain, “fauux,” the site no longer appears in Bing search results, as of this writing, while Google reliably spits it out as the top result.

Drake said that he still believes that Bing is blocking content by mistake, but Bing’s automated support tools aren’t making it easy to defend creators who are randomly blocked by one of the world’s biggest search engines.

“We have one of the lowest ratios of crap to legitimate content, human-made content, on the Internet,” Drake said. “And it’s really frustrating to see that all these human beings making really cool sites that people want to go to are just not available on the default Windows search engine.”</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/watch-kanzi-the-bonobo-pretend-to-have-a-tea-party/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Little kids hosting make-believe tea parties is a fixture of childhood playtime and long presumed to be exclusively a human ability. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University presented evidence in a new paper published in the journal Science that a bonobo named Kanzi was also able to participate in pretending to hold a tea party. For the authors, this suggests that apes are capable of using their imagination just like human toddlers.

“It really is game-changing that their mental lives go beyond the here and now,” said co-author Christopher Krupenye. “Imagination has long been seen as a critical element of what it is to be human, but the idea that it may not be exclusive to our species is really transformative. Jane Goodall discovered that chimps make tools, and that led to a change in the definition of what it means to be human, and this, too, really invites us to reconsider what makes us special and what mental life is out there among other creatures.”

Per Krupenye et al., by the age of two, human children are able to navigate imaginary scenarios like a tea party, pretending there is real tea present even if the teapot and cups are actually empty. Cognitively speaking, it’s an example of secondary representation, because it involves decoupling an imagined or simulated state (pretending there is actual tea in the cup) with the reality (the cup is empty).

Scientists have long pondered whether other animals, notably primates, also possess such mental capacities. There is some anecdotal evidence for this. For instance, a young chimpanzee was observed dragging imaginary blocks across the floor, just as the chimp did with real wooden blocks. Some female chimps in the wild will carry and play with sticks, treating them as infants—a rudimentary form of playing with a doll. And a 2006 study found that chimps and bonobos that had been exposed to human culture would sometimes perform pretend actions, like holding a bowl to a doll’s mouth to feed it, in response to verbal prompts.

Such studies have nonetheless been met with skepticism when it comes to interpreting the behavior as evidence of animals’ ability to engage in make-believe. For instance, it’s possible the animals are responding to behavioral cues, like the direction of a gaze, to solve such tasks.

Enter Kanzi, a 43-year-old bonobo who lives at the Ape Initiative and is capable of responding to verbal prompts, either by pointing or using a lexigram of more than 300 symbols. There had also been anecdotal observations of Kanzi engaging in pretense. Krupenye et al. conducted three distinct experiments with Kanzi, each involving an 18-trial session.

In the first experiment, a scientist would offer a verbal prompt: “Kanzi, let’s play a game! Let’s find the juice!” They would then place two empty transparent cups on a table and pretend to fill them from an empty transparent pitcher, with another verbal prompt (“Kanzi, look!”). The scientist would pretend to pour the “juice” in one of the cups back into the pitcher, placing the pitcher under the table. Then they asked, “Kanzi, where’s the juice?” and recorded which cup the bonobo pointed to first.

“If Kanzi could only track reality (that both cups were empty), he should have chosen at chance between the two options, whereas if his choices were guided by stimulus enhancement, he should have selected the incorrect cup that had been ‘emptied’ above chance,” the authors wrote. “In contrast, if Kanzi could represent the pretend juice, he should have chosen above chance the cup containing the ‘imaginary’ juice, the empty cup that had not been ‘poured’ back into the pitcher. That is exactly what Kanzi did.” Kanzi selected the correct cup 34 out of 50 times (68 percent).

To rule out the possibility that Kanzi simply believed there was real juice in the empty cups, the team conducted a second experiment following a similar protocol, but with one of the cups containing real juice. Then they asked Kanzi to choose which he wanted. Kanzi chose the cup with real juice nearly 78 percent of the time (14 out of 18 trials), evidence that he could tell the difference between real and pretend juice.

Finally, the team conducted one last experiment in which an experimenter pretended to sample a grape from an empty transparent plastic container before placing the “grape” in one of two transparent jars. After they pretended to empty one of the jars, they asked Kanzi, “Where is the grape?” Kanzi chose correctly nearly 69 percent of the time (31 out of 45 trials).

While Kanzi didn’t score perfectly on the pretend tasks, “It’s extremely striking and very exciting that the data seem to suggest that apes, in their minds, can conceive of things that are not there,” co-author Amalia Bastos, now at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, said. “Kanzi is able to generate an idea of this pretend object and at the same time know it’s not real.” Whether Kanzi’s success can be generalized to other apes without the benefit of his “enculturation” will be the focus of future research.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Bitcoin is crashing hard, reaching historic lows of well below the $70,000 mark. At the time of writing, the token is hovering just above $63,000, levels we haven’t seen since October 2024.

The ongoing plunge has made it far less economical to mine the digital token, a notoriously compute- and energy-intensive process — to the point that large-scale computing companies are starting to unplug their equipment, as Bloomberg reports.

As prices continue to plummet and electricity costs climb, it’s become tough out there for a crypto miner. The hash price index, which is used to determine how much revenue miners can make by mining crypto, reached its lowest point on record this week, according to mining services company Luxor Technology.

According to Coindesk, the average cost to mine one Bitcoin is currently around $87,000 — far higher than its current going rate, making it an extremely unprofitable proposition.

It’s a massive wipeout as investors continue to sell off their reserves, with some comparing it to the time China banned crypto mining in 2021. Crypto enthusiasts are expecting the worst, with some predicting the token will nosedive to just $30,000.

“The decrease is historic, the largest since the China ban,” mining company CleanSpark chief business officer Harry Sudock told Bloomberg, explaining that winter storms raising electricity prices, combined with a recent broader tech selloff, were likely to blame.

Turning off mining hardware during extreme weather conditions or surges in prices isn’t unheard of — but given the crypto’s ongoing demise, a far rarer situation is playing out.

While the extremely volatile cryptocurrency has been put through the wringer on several occasions over the years, the decline comes at a striking moment.

As CNN points out, crypto is hailed as a safe haven by its proponents. Given geopolitical turmoil and plenty of economic uncertainty, crypto’s price should’ve instead skyrocketed — yet precious metals, most notably gold, have fared well while Bitcoin has crashed. The value of an ounce of gold reached an all-time high late last year as investors looked for much safer bets than volatile cryptocurrencies. (Gold prices have since lurched down, but stabilized around a considerably higher price than before the rally.)

The investor Michael Burry, who famously shorted the US housing market before its collapse in 2008, argued in a Substack post this week that further selloffs could lead to a “death spiral” for the broader economy that could be difficult to recover from.

“There is no organic use case reason for Bitcoin to slow or stop its descent,” he wrote.

Even gold could fall victim to the recent downturn as “physical metals may break from the trend on safe haven demand,” Burry speculated, if “tokenized metals futures” were to collapse.

Instead of mining crypto, companies are starting to pivot, according to Bloomberg, allocating their hardware to powering AI models instead of mining crypto.

Whether that will turn out to be a safer bet as investors are starting to get cold feet over AI as well? That remains to be seen.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When a group of crypto bros spent $300,000 commissioning a 15-foot gold statue of Donald Trump, their grift seemed solid enough. Their memecoin, $PATRIOT — for which the Trump sculpture served as a sort of promotional stunt — would soon go to the Moon, covering the costs of the piece and then some.

Shockingly, the exact opposite happened. Despite securing a “juicy, juicy spot” for the statue at the president’s resort, Trump National Doral Miami, $PATRIOT crashed to the ground. Today, the memecoin — which boasted a market cap as high as $77.7 million around Trump’s return to office in January of 2025 — now stands at just $2.8 million, while the toweringeffigy gathers dust in Ohio.

Now, fresh reporting by the New York Times documents the wild ride that turned a group of crypto goons into a national laughing stock.

For a very brief moment prior to Trump’s second inauguration, the coin surged, sustaining millions of dollars in daily trading volume in anticipation of the president’s promise to turn the country into the “crypto capital of the planet.” The backers, a motley crew of libertarian crypto developers and MAGA faithful, successfully drummed up social media frenzy, even gaining approval from former Trump aide Steve Bannon.

Then reality arrived, as it always does seems to when memecoins are involved. Infighting erupted as the token cratered, driven down by the release of Trump’s own scammy memecoin, $TRUMP. The sculptor contracted to build the statue, Alan Cottrill, soon called in a $90,000 debt the crypto bros owed for using his work to market their digital currency.

“You are using my copyrighted image in marketing your token!” Cottrill exclaimed to the contract-holders in a text message viewed by the NYT.

“Yes lol as we planned to from day 1,” rejoined Ashley Sansalone, one of the crypto developers involved.

Until the group pays the final $90,000, Cottrill says he’s under no obligation to release the statue.

“As far as I’m concerned, they haven’t bought the rights to the IP, and they’re using it illegally,” the sculptor told the NYT. “That statue will not leave my foundry until everything they owe me is paid.”

            <h2>Tesla Stock Plummeting Since Musk Busted in Epstein Files</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/future-society/tesla-stock-plummeting-musk-epstein-files">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Late last month, new “Epstein files” from the Department of Justice revealed that Tesla CEO Elon Musk was in regular correspondence with deceased sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein, going as far as to invite himself to his notorious Caribbean island, asking when the “wildest party” would take place in a 2012 email.

It was a damning contradiction of Musk’s previous claims that he’d “refused” Epstein’s offer, and they seemed to throw the billionaire into a tailspin.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Tesla’s shares have been plummeting since the DOJ’s release. Shares are down almost eight percent over the last five days since the emails were released.

It’s the very last thing Tesla needs right now. The company’s brand has already suffered greatly under Musk’s leadership, with droves of potential buyers being pushed away by his inflammatory rhetoric and embrace of far-right ideals.

The company’s core business has also been floundering as of late, with Musk announcing that it’s ending production of its Model S and X vehicles, while turning the factory that used to make them into a robot assembly line. The move was part of a much broader shift away from selling cars and towards the company’s humanoid robots and AI ambitions.

While Tesla’s valuation remains massively inflated — it’s still worth well over $1.5 trillion — the company’s financials tell an ominous story. Tesla reported its first-ever decline in annual revenue for 2025, with sales slumping across three of the past four quarters. It also saw a whopping 61 percent drop in profits in Q4 of last year, compared to the same period the year before.

The competition is making major headway as well, with German automaker Volkswagen officially overtaking Tesla in fully-electric car sales in Europe last year, according to the latest data. Chinese rival BYD is also handily outselling Tesla these days, making major gains across Europe and becoming the world’s top EV seller.

In other words, Musk’s carmaker’s first-mover advantage has long dried up.

By all indications, it feels like Tesla has come to accept its fate. The company hasn’t launched a fully new model since its Cybertruck in late 2023, which turned out to be a massive flop.

“A big driver for the decline is lack of new products,” Cox Automotive director of industry insights Stephanie Valdez Streaty told Bloomberg. “Any automaker that doesn’t have new products is going to lose market share. Tesla needs new products.”

Infamously lacking customer service and extensive quality control issues are also signs of a company that has long lost its place as an early pioneer in the EV space.

Adding to the company’s woes is Musk’s SpaceX acquiring his own AI startup xAI, turning his space company into a $1.25 trillion behemoth and sparking rumors that Tesla may eventually be folded in as well.

The merger may also be indicative of Musk turning his attention elsewhere. As CNBC points out, he now derives more of his enormous net worth from SpaceX than from Tesla, a symbolic turning point as he seemingly grows tired of pretending to care about EV sales. (Musk has promised that Optimus will account for80 percent of the carmaker’s value.)

The mercurial entrepreneur’s appearance in the Epstein files once again underlines the carmaker’s continuous struggles to control the narrative and rein in the drama.

If the company’s history is anything to go by, there’s certainly a chance the company, which remains one of the most valuable by market cap in the world, will weather the storm. But this time, we’re not talking about scaling up production of the Model 3, a major source of suffering for the CEO almost a decade ago — instead, the company is looking to reinvent itself from scratch.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At this point, there’s nothing left to say about Elon Musk that hasn’t been said a thousand times already. Yet his latest comment is so on the nose, we couldn’t resist.

“Whoever said ‘money can’t buy happiness’ really knew what they were talking about,” the world’s richest man mourned on X-formerly-Twitter this week, likely from one of his mansions, or perhaps his private jet.

It’s a pathetic complaint from someone who could end homelessness in multiple cities, fund universal school lunch programs across the US, or bankroll malaria eradication with just a fraction of his wealth.

It also comes just days after another tranche of emails from notorious pedophile Jeffrey Epstein were released to the public. There, it was revealed that Musk had been in extensive contact with Epstein in the years following his 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor. (Musk even went so far as to beg Epstein for an invite to his infamous island in December of 2013, contradicting his earlier assurance that he’d “refused” the offer.)

The revelation is evidently taking its toll on Musk, who began a desperate campaign to clear his name on social media. “If I actually wanted to spend my time partying with young women, it would be trivial for me to do so without the help of a creepy loser like Epstein,” the billionaire raved in one post.

Now that his ties to Epstein are undeniable, Musk evidently thinks he can pity-post his way out of it. So here’s a challenge, Elon: if money really doesn’t buy happiness, set yourself free. Liquidate your hundreds of billions and feed the hungry, house the homeless, and fund the schools.

He won’t, of course — but he could, and that’s what makes this performance so insulting. At least King Midas had the decency to regret his curse.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For over a millennium, measles have ravaged humanity. Physicians as far back as 10th century Persia have been documenting the virus, which killed millions of children well into the 20th century. Finally, in 1963, biochemist John Enders developed the first measles vaccine, a development which virtually eradicated the virus from the US population by the year 2000.

That was then. Now the virus is back, threatening to tear through a Texas immigration detention center with a vengeance — a grim collision of Trump-era vaccine skepticism and brutal immigration enforcement that seems to perfectly encapsulate this moment in US politics.

That’s right: according to the Washington Post, two detainees at the federal immigration family detention center in Dilley, Texas have tested positive for measles.

Both cases were confirmed by the Texas Department of State Health Services on Saturday. In a statement to WaPo, the Department of Homeland Security said officers had quarantined anyone who made contact with the two individuals, and “took steps to limit movement” for everybody else.

“Medical staff is continuing to monitor the detainees’ conditions and will take appropriate and active steps to prevent further infection,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told the newspaper in a statement. “All detainees are being provided with proper medical care.”

Eric Lee, an immigration attorney providing counsel to a family at the facility, told WaPo that detainees were being left in the dark. Not only have DHS personnel not mentioned the positive cases, Lee explained, but they haven’t even started looking into the detainees’ vaccination status.

“They’re not being told anything, and they are not being offered any sort of protective measures,” Lee said of those being forcibly held inside. “And it’s important to point out that this is not just a detention conditions issue — it’s a public health issue generally.”

The attorney was present at the detention facility back in January, when guards abruptly ordered attorneys out following a peaceful protest staged by people in detention.

In an interview with Texas Public Radio after the fact, Lee described the detention camp as a “horrible, horrible place.” The water is “putrid” and undrinkable, he said, and detainees are served meals containing “bugs” and other debris.

“This is not a place that you would want to have your child be for even 15 minutes,” he said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 2024, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman dismissed the possibility that his company would ever have to stuff ads into its chatbots, painting it as a desperate move he called a “last resort for us as a business model.”

As it turns out, the billionaire may have overestimated how much people were willing to shell out every month to access ChatGPT. Paid subscriber growth has slowed in key markets as OpenAI continues to burn billions of dollars every quarter, further stoking concerns over the company’s potential inability to turn things around before it’s too late.

And as the competition at Anthropic and Google continued to make massive strides in their efforts to catch up, Altman declared an internal “code red,” announcing late last year that ChatGPT was getting ads after all.

OpenAI’s competitors saw the reversal as a golden opportunity to strike. Anthropic released a series of Super Bowl ads this week that openly skewer Altman’s compromise on ads — without ever naming the company outright, cleverly — in a bid to strike a chord with users who aren’t thrilled about an ad-packed chatbot experience.

“Ads are coming to AI.” the ads’ tagline reads. “But not to Claude.”

It’s always a bad sign when someone insists that they’re not mad and actually laughing. So when Altman declared on X that he thinks the ads are “funny” and that he “laughed” — before posting a lengthy screed about how they’re horribly unfair — it was an unintentional masterclass in corporate insecurity.

“But I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest,” he wrote. “Our most important principle for ads says that we won’t do exactly this; we would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them.”

Altman also angrily accused the company of “doublespeak” and using a “deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads that aren’t real.”

The CEO also called users who shell out $20 a month for a Claude subscription “rich people” — a bizarre characterization, especially given his multibillion-dollar net worth.

“We are glad they do that and we are doing that too, but we also feel strongly that we need to bring AI to billions of people who can’t pay for subscriptions,” Altman wrote.

He also accused Anthropic of trying to become an “authoritarian company” that wants to “control what people do with AI,” even though there’s plenty of evidence to suggest that he’s the pot calling the kettle black.

It’s a messy and unusually public blowout that highlights how the AI race, once fought in board rooms behind closed doors and through carefully worded press releases, is entering the public consciousness.

Altman’s frustration perfectly illustrates how AI companies have driven themselves into a corner. Either they can charge a hefty monthly fee to cut their losses and reassure spooked investors that they can, in fact, deliver revenues on their balance sheets — or scare away users through annoying ads, like every generation of new platform before them.

While OpenAI hasn’t yet settled on a way to implement ads for its blockbuster chatbot, an early screenshot the company showed off during its announcement late last year indicates that free-tier users will likely be painfully aware that the company is trying to sell them something. The shown example ad covers a significant chunk — almost half — of the mobile screen.

It remains to be seen how users will react once the ads go live. Will they immediately flock to an ad-free competitor, like Claude or Google’s Gemini, or will they be willing to stick it out to avoid paying more than what they pay for Netflix every month?

The AI race is bound to drag on as companies like OpenAI will continue to desperately convince their customers and investors that their existence — and enormous spending — is justified and that their tech is worth the hassle in the first place. Given the recent tech selloffs and nervousness among investors and diminishing performance gains with each new AI model release, that seems to still be an open question.

In short, Altman may say he was amused by Anthropic’s latest slight, but given his heated rhetoric, the gloves are starting to come off.

“‘I laughed, until I didn’t.&#39;” one Reddit user joked.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amazon Web Services ended 2025 with its strongest quarterly growth rate in more than three years.

The company reported Thursday that its cloud service business recorded $35.6 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2025. This figure marks a 24% year-on-year increase and the business segment’s largest growth rate in 13 quarters. Annual revenue run rate for the business segment is $142 billion, according to Amazon. The cloud service also saw an increase in its operating income from $12.5 billion in the fourth quarter compared to $10.6 billion in the same period in 2024.

“It’s very different having 24% year-over-year growth on $142 billion annualized run rate than to have a higher percentage growth on a meaningfully smaller base, which is the case with our competitors,” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, said during the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call. “We continue to add more incremental revenue and capacity than others, and extend our leadership position.”

That fourth quarter growth was fueled by new agreements with Salesforce, BlackRock, Perplexity and the U.S. Air Force, among other companies and government entities.

“More of the top 500 U.S. startups use AWS as their primary cloud provider than the next two providers combined,” Jassy said. “We’re adding significant easy to core computing capacity each day.”

AWS also added more than a gigawatt of power to its data center network in the fourth quarter.

Jassy said AWS still sees a fair amount of its business coming from enterprises that want to move infrastructure from on premise to the cloud. AWS is, of course, also seeing a boost from the AI boom as well, and Jassy credited AWS’s top-to-bottom AI stack functionality.

“We consistently see customers wanting to run their AI workloads where the rest of their applications and data are,” Jassy said. “We’re also seeing that as customers run large AI workloads on AWS, they’re adding to their core AWS footprint as well.”

AWS made up 16.6% of Amazon’s overall $213.4 billion revenue in the fourth quarter.

AWS’ success wasn’t enough to appease Amazon investors, however. Amazon shares fell 10% in after-hours trading after investors reacted to the company’s plan to boost capital expenditures and missed Wall Street’s expectations on earnings per share.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Sometimes, it can seem like the AI industry is racing to see who can spend the most money on data centers. Whoever builds the most data centers will have the most compute, the thinking goes, and thus be able to build the best AI products, which will guarantee victory in the years to come. There are limits to this way of thinking — traditionally, businesses eventually succeed by making more money and spending less — but it’s proven remarkably persuasive for large tech companies.

If that is the game, Amazon does seem to be winning.

The company announced in its earnings on Thursday that it projects $200 billion in capital expenditures throughout 2026, across “AI, chips, robotics, and low earth orbit satellites.” That’s up from the $131.8 billion in capex in 2025. It’s tempting to attribute the whole capex budget to AI. But unlike most of its competitors, Amazon has a significant physical plant, some of which is being converted for use by expensive robots, so the non-AI expenses aren’t so easy to wave away.

Google is close behind. In its earnings on Wednesday, the company projected between $175 billion and $185 billion in capital expenditures for 2026, up from $91.4 billion the previous year. It’s significantly more than the company spent on fixed assets last year, and significantly more than most of its competitors are spending.

Meta, which reported last week, projected $115 to $135 billion in capex spending for 2026, while Oracle (once the poster child for AI infrastructure) projects a measly $50 billion. Microsoft doesn’t have an official projection for 2026 yet, but the most recent quarterly figure was $37.5 billion, which pencils out to roughly $150 billion, assuming it keeps up. It’s a notable increase, and one that has led to investor pressure on CEO Satya Nadella — but it still puts the company in third place.

From within the tech world, the logic here is simple. The revolutionary potential of AI is going to turn high-end compute into the scarce resource of the future, and only companies that control their own supply will survive. But while Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Oracle and others are frantically prepping for the compute desert of the future, their investors aren’t convinced. Each company saw its stock price plummet as investors balked at the hundreds of billions of dollars being committed, and companies with higher spends tended to drop more.

Crucially, this isn’t just a problem for companies like Meta that haven’t figured out their AI product strategy yet. It’s everyone — even companies like Microsoft and Amazon with a robust cloud business and a straightforward take on how to make money in the AI era. The numbers are simply too high for investor comfort.

Investor sentiment isn’t everything — and in this case, it may not do much to change the industry’s mind. If you believe AI is about to change everything (and the argument is pretty compelling at this point), you’d be a fool to change course just because Wall Street got jumpy. But going forward, big tech companies will be under a lot of pressure to downplay how expensive their AI ambitions really are.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">To say we live in a tech-centric society is an understatement.

Software, specifically machine learning and AI, coupled with advanced manufacturing, have delivered technology to street corners, schools, offices, factories, and even farm fields. This tech, much of it created in Silicon Valley, sits on your wrist, is carried in your pocket, is integrated in the movies you watch, and maybe in the music you listen to. And it is certainly the means by which that Amazon package was ordered, sorted, and delivered to your doorstep.

It has turned their founders, executives, and middle managers into king-like figures, whose wealth and political influence mirrors the Gilded Age. Seven of the top 10 richest people in the world can tie their wealth directly to tech. Amazon co-founder, chairman, and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos is third, behind just Meta co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg and serial entrepreneur Elon Musk, according to Forbes, which tracks wealth and the people who have it. Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer round out the list.

Now, in this moment, the Bezos-owned Washington Post has gutted its coverage of them and the tech industry at large as part of a sweeping set of layoffs that affected more than 300 people. The team that includes tech, science, health and business was cut by more than half — from 80 to 33 people — according to Post tech reporter Drew Harwell. The tech desk alone cut 14 people. Its San Francisco bureau is a shell.

Among those affected include reporters covering Amazon, artificial intelligence, internet culture, and investigations. The newspaper also laid off staff covering the media industry (which had previously reported on Bezos’ ownership over their own paper).

The Post cut its entire sports bureau and nearly annihilated its foreign reporting teams, including its Middle East desk, and reporters and their editors covering Ukraine, Russia, Iran, Turkey, and others. It closed its Books section, decimated coverage of culture and the Washington, D.C., metro area, and laid off all reporters and editors covering race and ethnicity issues nationally.

The coverage of tech isn’t more important than social, economic, and geopolitical issues. But never before have the people exerting outsized influence on the world’s geopolitics and economy also been so directly responsible for stemming the global flow of information about it.

Yet even as the world centers on tech and is tied to the GDP growth — or retreat — of its superpowers, tech’s most powerful executives are asking the public to place their attention elsewhere.

The Post’s executive editor Matt Murray couched the layoffs as a reboot of sorts aimed at reaching readers and eventually profitability, according to the New York Times, which included comments he made to staff.

“If anything, today is about positioning ourselves to become more essential to people’s lives in what is becoming a more crowded, competitive, and complicated media landscape,” he reportedly said during a Zoom meeting with staff.

It’s no secret The Post has lost money and subscribers in recent years, in some cases due to policies crafted or backed by Bezos. For instance, his directive to end presidential endorsements by The Post’s editorial board, axing a drafted piece backing Kamala Harris, reportedly led to “hundreds of thousands” of canceled subscriptions, per the New York Times. It reportedly suffered $100 million in losses in 2024, in part because of the cancellations.

Its web traffic has also declined. Semafor reported that daily visits were down to around 3 million by the middle of 2024, from 22.5 million in January 2021.

The Post cut its staff from 1,000 to under 800 last spring, with CEO Will Lewis calling out the $100 million loss from the previous year.

The layoffs at The Post, of course, don’t exist in a vacuum. The media industry, and not just legacy players, has been plagued by a fragmented audience and changes to Google Search algorithms that have directed readers away from news outlets and toward its own AI generated answers.

The size, scope, and location of those cuts merit scrutiny, however — particularly considering the shift in media ownership over the past 15 years.

Bezos’ acquisition of the Post in 2013 for $250 million was met with a mix of skepticism and hope from weary journalists who had experienced consolidation, layoffs, and the growing pains of moving from a print-only to digital-dominant media industry.

His acquisition became part of a broader trend at the time in which billionaires, many with backgrounds in tech, snapped up beleaguered media organizations well worn from the previous go public-private equity cycle.

A few years after Bezos bought The Post, Laurene Powell Jobs purchased The Atlantic, Salesforce founder Marc Benioff bought Time Inc., and pharmaceutical executive Patrick Soon-Shiong acquired the Los Angeles Times.

Bezos, like Benioff and Soon-Shiong (who also blocked his paper’s endorsement of Harris), moved closer to Trump after he won the 2024 election. His spaceflight company Blue Origin relies on federal contracts, and Amazon had faced increased scrutiny under previous administrations.

Lewis was reportedly not present to oversee the staff cuts and changes at The Post (Murray told Fox News that the CEO “had a lot of things to tend to today”). Nor was Bezos. As his newspaper prepared to cut one-third of its staff, Bezos spent Monday with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth in Florida, leading him on a tour of Blue Origin’s facilities.

Less than 48 hours later, The Washington Post would lay off the journalist who reported on Blue Origin.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/a16z-vc-wants-founders-to-stop-stressing-over-insane-arr-numbers/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The AI investing boom (or perhaps bubble) is something Silicon Valley has seen many times before: a gold rush of VC money thrown at the Big New Thing. But one aspect of it is completely unique to these times: startups rocketing from $0 to as much as $100 million in annual recurring revenue, sometimes in a matter of months.

Word on the street is that many a VC won’t even look at a startup that’s not on the ARR superhighway, aiming for $100 million in ARR before their Series A funding round.

But Andreessen Horowitz general partner Jennifer Li⁠, who helps oversee many of the firm’s most important AI companies, warns that some of the ARR mania is based on myths.

“Not all ARR is created equal, and not all growth is equal either,” Li said on an episode of TechCrunch’s Equity podcast. She said to be especially skeptical of a founder announcing spectacular ARR numbers or growth in a tweet.

Now, there is a legit, well-recognized term in accounting called annual recurring revenue, which refers to the annualized value of contracted, recurring subscription revenue. Essentially, that’s a guaranteed level of revenue because it comes from customers on a contract.

But what many of these founders are tweeting about is really “revenue run rate” —  taking whatever money was paid in a period of time and annualizing it. That’s not the same.

“There’s a lot of missing nuances of the business quality, retention, and durability that’s missing in that conversation,” Li warned.

A founder may have just had a killer month of sales, but not every month will necessarily repeat it. Or a startup may have a lot of short-term customers doing pilot programs, so revenue isn’t guaranteed to stick around after the pilot period.

Normally, such boasts about growth via tweets should be treated for what they are: don’t believe everything you read on the internet at face value.

But because fast-growth is a hallmark of AI startups, such claims are “introducing a lot of anxiety” to inexperienced founders who are now asking how they can also instantly go from zero to $100 million, she said.

Li’s answer: “You don’t. Sure, it’s a great aspiration, but you don’t have to build a business that way, to only optimize for the top-line growth.”

She said a better way to think of it is: how to grow sustainably, where once customers sign up, they stick around and expand their spend with your company. This can lead to “growing 5x or 10x year-over-year,” said Li, meaning growth from $1 million to between $5 million and $10 million in the first year, to between $25 million to $50 million in year two, and so on.

Li pointed out is that this is still “unheard of” levels of growth. If it’s coupled with happy customers — aka high retention rates — those startups will find investors willing to back them.

Of course, some of the portfolio companies in Li’s a16z group (the infrastructure team) have hit those kinds of racing ARR numbers: Cursor, ElevenLabs, and Fal.ai. But that growth is tied to “durable businesses,” said Li, adding, “There’s real reasons behind each of them.”

Li also said that kind of growth comes with its own set of operational problems like hiring.

“How do we hire, not fast, but the right people who can really jump into this type of speed and culture,” she said. And the answer is: not easily.

That means those first 100 people wear a lot of hats and missteps are bound to happen. Last year, Cursor, for instance, angered its customer base with a poorly rolled out pricing change.

Li pointed out that other fast-growth startups deal with legal and compliance issues before they have systems in place to, or face new AI-age issues like countering deepfakes.

So while lightning-fast growth can be a good problem to have, it’s also a little bit like: be careful what you wish for.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Monday, OpenAI launched Codex, an agentic coding tool marketed to software developers. Today, OpenAI also launched a new model designed to turbo-charge Codex: GPT-5.3 Codex.

The company says that the model transforms Codex from an agent that can merely “write and review code” to one that can do “nearly anything developers and professionals do on a computer, expanding who can build software and how work gets done.” Having tested its new model against a number of performance benchmarks, OpenAI claims that it can create “highly functional complex games and apps from scratch over the course of days.”

OpenAI says that GPT-5.3 Codex is also 25 percent faster than its previous model (GPT-5.2) and that it was the company’s first model that “was instrumental in creating itself,” meaning that the company’s staff used early versions of the program to debug itself and evaluate how it was performing.

The new model release notably follows hot on the heels of a new agentic coding model released by its competitor, Anthropic. Indeed, OpenAI and Anthropic had originally planned to release their two agentic coding tools at the exact same time: 10 a.m. PST. However, not long before the original release time, Anthropic moved its release date up by 15 minutes, slightly besting OpenAI in the race to publicize the models.

            <h2>One of Europe’s largest universities knocked offline for days after cyberattack</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/one-of-europes-largest-universities-knocked-offline-for-days-after-cyberattack/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The computer systems of La Sapienza in Rome, one of the largest universities in Europe with around 120,000 students, have been down for three days following an apparent ransomware attack.

In a post and in stories on Instagram published Tuesday, the university said that it took down its systems out of precaution following the cyberattack, that it was investigating the incident and working on restoring all digital services, and that some communication channels such as email and workstations are “partially limited.”

The school also said that it was working to restore systems based on backups, which were not affected by the hack.

As of this writing, the Sapienza website remains down.

Italian daily news outlet Il Corriere della Sera reported this week that the disruption is due to a ransomware attack, something that neither the school nor other authorities have confirmed so far. The hackers allegedly sent the university a link to a request for a ransom, which has a countdown of 72 hours, which would start only once the link is clicked.

La Sapienza did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment sent via email. It’s unclear whether the university is able to accept email at the time we reached out.

Spokespeople for Italy’s national cybersecurity agency, Agenzia per la Cybersicurezza Nazionale (or ACN), which is investigating the incident, did not immediately respond to a request for comment asking for more information and if the attack was caused by ransomware.

In an article on Wednesday, Il Corriere reported that the hacking group behind the attack is called “Femwar02,” which was previously unknown prior to this incident. The gang used the BabLock malware, which was discovered in 2023 and is also known as Rorschach, according to the report.

La Sapienza said that exams are proceeding as normal, but students who want to sign up for exams must do so directly with professors. The school also set up “infopoints” on several locations on campus to provide information to students.

Like other types of organizations, universities and schools are frequent targets of hackers. Last year, the notorious hacking group ShinyHunters hacked Harvard University and University of Pennsylvania and stole data — without using malware to encrypt its systems — in an effort to extort the schools. The hackers revealed this week that the schools did not pay the ransom.

            <div id="article-text">CONFIDENTIAL: To a billionaire trying to determine what to do with $250 million in 2013,

That kind of pocket change can buy you a newspaper. And not just any newspaper, but a world-class paper with a wall full of Pulitzers (I remember emerging from the elevator and marveling at it as a summer intern) and decades of experience holding power to account.

Alternatively, $250 million can buy half a superyacht. A yacht is a very big boat.

That newspaper employs hundreds of journalists. These journalists work very hard to find out what is actually happening and then to tell people. This involves a lot of late nights eating pizza in the office and long days calling people who will not answer and showing up in inconvenient places at inconvenient times to get people on the record and to get the story right. Is newspaper work glamorous? Put it this way: Spotlight was a Hollywood movie made exclusively to show off how heroic newspaper journalism is, and The New York Times ran an interview with the costume designer to find out how she managed to make the cast look so authentically unfashionable and rumpled. (“The hardest thing is making bad clothes work on really famous people, who look gorgeous in everything they wear,” the costumer explained.)

Newspapers have multiple deks too (that’s some technical headline humor for you; the dek is the little subtitle under the headline that explains the headline you just read). They also have ledes (the start of a story) and are made by people filing (turning in their stories). I remember that when I first got hired at a newspaper, I kept telling people I couldn’t hang out, because I “had to file,” and my friends thought I had suddenly become obsessed with personal organization.

A yacht will never turn a profit, and it would be confusing to expect it to. But you know that your net worth is such that if the yacht never supports itself, you will still be proud to call yourself the yacht’s owner and will not suddenly say, “Well, perhaps if we just pivoted part of the yacht sharply to the right and knocked dozens of people off, the yacht would suddenly become self-sustaining.”

A newspaper can certainly turn a profit. One way for a newspaper to make a profit is if you keep its subscribers from canceling their subscriptions en masse.

If your yacht fails to endorse a candidate for president in an existential election, people will say, “Good. A boat should not endorse candidates for president.”

A newspaper is a public service. If it does its job, people will have better information and better lives—difficult to quantify in monetary terms, but for a long time, we used to think that making people’s lives better was important and valuable. Andrew Carnegie did not demand to see exponential growth from his libraries.

You can give your yacht whatever name you want! Sunk-Cost Fallacy, Ship O’ Theseus, Redacted, Democracy Dies in Darkness.

A newspaper can take down a president—and has, in fact. (Of course, that requires guts from its owner. But you have guts, don’t you?)

A yacht is a good place for a foam party!

A newspaper is a guardian of the First Amendment. Thomas Jefferson said that “were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.”

Your yacht will never find out anything damning about your business. Your yacht will never find out anything troubling about the current administration. Your yacht will never report the names of slain children and abuses of government power and give a voice to grief and to silliness alike.

If the captain you have put in charge of your yacht keeps yelling that the yacht needs to be more nimble and take on 200 million more people, and you discover that instead of making the yacht more nimble, he has just punctured an enormous hole in the hull, causing water to rush in, this won’t leave hundreds of world-class journalists without jobs.

Nobody will keep filing from a war zone even with the looming threat of layoffs because they believe in the yacht so much. Nobody believes in the yacht at all.

If the yacht starts to sink, the captain will have to tell everyone on board in person.

If you have a midlife crisis and buy a yacht and then later stop caring as much about the yacht and want to go to space instead, you can simply dock the yacht and ignore it forever and an entire city will not immediately suffer as a result. When a newspaper is felled by careless or malicious owners, millions of people are hurt, in big ways and small ways and ways that are impossible to measure. That includes the journalists directly affected, of course, and then all of the people whose stories won’t get told, and then all of the readers whose mornings will be made just a little bit worse by the absence of their favorite comics or their favorite columns, all of the people who won’t know as much about their country or their neighbors—the restaurants they could visit, the shows they could see, the television they should avoid at all costs. This will leave big holes and little holes and invisible holes.

Think carefully before you buy. Do you really want to own a newspaper? Do you really have what it takes? Or do you just want to own another yacht? Please be honest with yourself, or we’re all going to be worse off.</div>

            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-05</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nothing makes Americans want to gamble like the Super Bowl. Every year, the game is reliably the biggest day for sports betting: On platforms such as FanDuel and DraftKings, people are already putting money down on which team will win the opening coin toss, how long the national anthem will be, and what color of Gatorade will be used to douse the winning head coach.

Gambling on sports has become practically inescapable. Nearly half of American men ages 18 to 49 maintain an active online sports-betting account, and Vegas odds have invaded telecasts and talk shows. During NFL games, sportsbook commercials now outnumber beer ads. Despite all of that, more than a third of adults still cannot legally gamble from home: Online sports betting remains banned in 18 states, including California and Texas.

But for the past year, thanks to a loophole, Americans have effectively been able to bet on sports no matter where they live. All they have to do is turn to prediction markets. Platforms such as Kalshi let people wager on lots of things: Who will win the Oscar for Best Actor? How much snow will New York City get this month? Prediction markets say that they are more akin to the stock market than gambling. Rather than betting on odds set by bookmakers, users trade contracts that pay out according to the outcome of a given event. This distinction may not mean much for someone betting on the Seahawks over the Patriots, but it does allow prediction markets to operate even in places where sports betting is illegal.

Now America is about to find out what it really looks like when sports betting takes over. Kalshi, one of the country’s biggest prediction markets, launched its sport-betting operation just two weeks before the 2025 Super Bowl. This year, Kalshi has already seen more than $167 million in bets on the game, and that number could conceivably crack $1 billion, Dustin Gouker, a gambling-industry analyst, told me. Some of the biggest traditional sportsbooks and fantasy-sports sites, recognizing a work-around to enter states where gambling remains illegal, are seizing the opportunity: Since September, FanDuel, DraftKings, Fanatics, PrizePicks, and Underdog have all launched their own prediction-market offerings.

In one sense, prediction markets are about a whole lot more than sports. Both Kalshi and its biggest rival, Polymarket, have turned prediction markets into big business by letting people wager on seemingly everything. As Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour put it in October, the company’s goal is to “financialize everything”—to let people bet on the outcome of virtually any event. By encouraging people to put their money where their mouth is, the thinking goes, prediction markets can forecast how the future will play out. Even if you’ve never placed a bet yourself, prediction markets’ odds about news and entertainment—not sports—are especially in your face. Both CNN and CNBC recently announced partnerships with Kalshi to incorporate the site’s predictions into their news coverage; last month, the Golden Globes displayed Polymarket’s odds throughout its broadcast.

Kalshi may let you bet on topics as wide-ranging as whether Iran’s supreme leader will stay in power and who will win the next season of Survivor, but sports account for more than 90 percent of all trading volume on the site. From mid-December to mid-January, wagers on college basketball alone exceeded trading on everything other than sports. The single biggest non-sports market during this stretch—about whom President Trump would nominate as chair of the Federal Reserve—drew less activity than Italian soccer. In an email, Jack Such, a Kalshi spokesperson, told me that the categories that dominate the platform fluctuate based on what’s in the news. “During the NFL season, we are heavily tilted towards sports,” he wrote. “During the 2024 election season, we were heavily tilted towards politics. It all depends on what events are top of mind for the public.” Even though politics was big on Kalshi during the most recent presidential election, that was before the site offered sports betting.

Sports make up a smaller proportion of wagers on Polymarket, which has also yet to fully launch in the United States (although some Americans likely still access it by using virtual private networks). “At this moment in time, the use case of prediction markets, at least in the United States, appears to be the expansion of sports betting,” Gouker said. “It’s hard to come to another conclusion.”

This covert expansion of sports betting is controversial. Several states are suing Kalshi for operating an unlicensed sports-betting platform, which they argue deprives them of tax dollars. But late last month, Michael Selig, the newly appointed head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the federal agency that regulates prediction markets, indicated that he intends to help grow the prediction-market industry. All of which suggests that, in the immediate term at least, prediction markets are likely to make sports betting an even more pervasive part of American life—potentially leading to devastating consequences. Research suggests that avid sports bettors are at risk of depleting their household savings, declaring bankruptcy, and even committing intimate-partner violence.

Not all prediction markets, for their part, are likely to be content with staying de facto sports-betting sites. After all, Kalshi and Polymarket want to harness the wisdom of crowds to forecast all kinds of real-world events, not just sports outcomes. Despite Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan’s recent proclamation that prediction markets are “the most accurate thing we have as mankind right now,” these platforms have much to prove on that front. When most bets are on sports, it’s especially hard to see what value prediction markets add. The kind of information gained by thousands of bettors laying down four-legged parlays on a Tuesday-night NBA game does not have the same utility as a more accurate hurricane forecast or election prediction. Not all knowledge, in other words, is created equal.

Perhaps prediction markets are hoping that once sports betting gets users in the door, they’ll engage with the many other markets on offer. “I think they’ve really thought that sports would just be an entry point, and then everything else would start growing,” Gouker said. But that Kalshi will be able to interest its droves of sports bettors in other markets is by no means guaranteed. In fact, it seems at least equally plausible that people might just prefer betting on the Super Bowl to betting on whether the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates. “People who are making forecasts on political and social and scientific outcomes are possibly different from people who are betting on sporting events,” John Phillips, the CEO of Aristotle, the company that runs the prediction market PredictIt, told me. “There are some commonalities there, but I think it’s a different type of activity and it attracts a different type of trader.”

If the goal of Kalshi and other prediction markets is to create something with genuine financial utility and predictive power, that’s a big problem. But this won’t prevent them from making a boatload of money along the way.</div>

In July 2017, as the U.S. was racked by revelations that Russia had interfered in its presidential election, a group of envoys from both countries quietly brokered a peace accord in New York. They met at Lincoln Center. There, Moscow’s Bolshoi Ballet joined the New York City Ballet and the Paris Opera Ballet to perform Jewels, a landmark work by the American company’s Russian-born co-founder, George Balanchine. At the end of the performance, the dancers gathered onstage and took their bows—united, it seemed, by a shared commitment to virtuosity in ballet, and by their entangled roots.

This was the last time that the Bolshoi Ballet visited America. The company—which is largely sponsored by Vladimir Putin’s regime—may never again tour here, or in any Western country. Shortly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, theaters in London and Madrid canceled the Bolshoi’s scheduled performances. In 2024, dancers from another top Russian company were barred from a gala in New York City. Among the many costs exacted by Russia’s brutal war on Ukraine is the loss of a long-running cultural exchange; American and Russian ballet have always been in conversation with each other, even as they diverged aesthetically and faced political tensions behind the scenes.

In June 1960, an emissary from the Soviet ballet world argued in The Atlantic that dance could still flourish behind the Iron Curtain. The dance critic Yuri Slonimsky was writing for a special issue of this magazine featuring only Soviet authors. The aim, according to the then–editor in chief, Edward Weeks, was to offer a window into the “lively arts of a talented people” working under the yoke of the Communist Party. Slonimsky had been a close friend and artistic collaborator of Balanchine’s in 1920s Saint Petersburg, just after the Russian Revolution. Decades later, in New York City, Balanchine was being heralded as ballet’s great modernizer, having pioneered a form of dance that broke with Russian conventions—narrative-driven pieces; regimented, symmetrical movement—and better reflected the iconoclasm of a fast-changing modern world.

Slonimsky seemed to be addressing his old friend as he insisted that Soviet ballet also sought to meet the present, and that it was thriving in much the same way American ballet was, even with constraints. The Soviets were making ballet accessible, he wrote, by developing a large network of schools and theaters; they were nurturing versatile artists capable of asserting “human thoughts and feelings” and keeping their eyes “open wide to the surrounding world.”

Slonimsky would have heard about the recent box-office triumph of Balanchine’s Agon, a visionary work of radical abstraction that some likened to Picasso’s Guernica. Soviet ballets, by contrast, took up well-known stories from folklore or classic literature that party commissars had sanitized of any supposedly anti-Communist messaging. And yet, as Slonimsky pointed out, top Soviet dancers such as Rudolf Nureyev—who would seek asylum in France in 1961—strove to interpret “even the deepest past in a new way,” enhancing their limited repertoires with “modern techniques” (requiring more risk-taking and expressiveness) already familiar to American dancers.

At the same time, Balanchine and his peers understood that modern American dance was wholly indebted to Russian artists, whose innovations had established key principles and standards. In 1962, Agnes de Mille—best known for choreographing the musical Oklahoma!—offered Atlantic readers a guide to “creating a dance,” in which she encouraged fledgling choreographers to study the oeuvre of Marius Petipa, who had ushered in a golden age of Russian ballet in the 19th century. “Observe what Petipa does with just four steps in any of his solo variations,” de Mille wrote, referring to Petipa’s deceptively simple and rigorously plotted choreography, with its neat internal logic. Such precision in movement “is hard to learn,” but “it is, in fact, the essence of the business.” For de Mille, no less than for Balanchine, experimentation involved first mastering the fundamentals before moving past them to “taste the power of making something meaningful where nothing was before.”

Years later, a young American choreographer would heed de Mille’s advice, to spectacular effect. Twyla Tharp’s ballet Push Comes to Shove, which premiered in 1976, startled and delighted audiences with its coy, self-referential humor, and its flirtation with popular dance styles such as jazz and tango. But what held the work together was its basis in the “familiar courtly universe of classical ballet,” the critic Dale Harris wrote in a review for The Atlantic. With this foundation firmly in place, Tharp was free to improvise; Harris observed how her approach lent itself to “daring, idiosyncratic” dances with “an instant accessibility that makes the public accept as familiar what is, in fact, remarkably novel.” And at the heart of Push Comes to Shove was the phenom Mikhail Baryshnikov, who had defected from the Soviet Union in 1974, and whose technical prowess and singular flair made him a fitting symbol of this negotiation between tradition and modernity, old world and new.

Today, only a few prominent dancers in Russia have left in protest of the war in Ukraine; most have remained in the country, where creative opportunities have dwindled. Notable choreographers have refused to work with Kremlin-funded companies, and artists who question the war, or defy the precepts of Putinism, have been subject to censorship. A new iron curtain now separates American dance and Russian dance, bringing an abrupt end to a rich dialogue that spanned centuries. Swan Lake and The Nutcracker, two crown jewels in the American repertoire, would not exist without Petipa’s original stagings; meanwhile, Russian ballet was bolstered by American influence, becoming more technically adventurous and less self-contained.

Dance is no longer the robust industry it was in the time of Balanchine, de Mille, and Tharp, when government support for the arts was plentiful and theater-going more customary. But in its heyday, Russian and American dancers borrowed freely from one another to produce vital, distinctive art: the masterpieces we still revere today, and probably always will.</div>

Every year since 2003, the umbrella organization for quizzing outfits around the globe has put on the granddaddy of knowledge competitions. Nothing in the tiny, nerdy world of trivia confers more authority than winning the World Quizzing Championships.

Competitors must attempt to answer 240 questions, such as the following, from 2022: “Playing for Bangalore against Pune in the IPL in April 2013, who set a new record for the fastest century in professional cricket by reaching 100 off 30 balls?”

If it makes you feel better, the median number of correct answers the year of that test was 64. Then again, the following was a question in that championship too: “What is the seven-letter name of the signature burger that can be ordered in every Burger King?”

The next contest is this summer, but in the meantime, you have a few whoppers waiting for you in this week’s Atlantic Trivia. Consider them training.

And by the way, did you know that the video clips in the opening credits of The Office were filmed by John Krasinski—Jim Halpert on the series—who made a preshow pilgrimage to its setting of Scranton, Pennsylvania? He captured the footage with a camera stuck out of a sunroof as he drove around the city.

A tour de Scranton would look different today. There’s now the Office museum exhibit, the Office-branded industrial tower, the Office mural, the other Office mural …

And by the way, did you know that President George Washington gave the country’s shortest-ever inaugural address? His speech upon reelection was only 135 words, which takes about 45 seconds to deliver, at least by my rate of speech.

In contrast, President William Henry Harrison’s was 8,445 words. I did not try that one, because I have places to be (and, to be fair, when he tried it, he got pneumonia and died a month later).

And by the way, did you know that the world’s oldest continuous art tradition is the rock painting of Australia’s Aboriginal people? The earliest artworks discovered on the island are estimated to be 30,000 years or older, and many Aboriginal artists still paint on rock walls.

In fact, it wasn’t until the 1970s that Aboriginal art began to be captured on anything more portable than stone or more durable than sand. The art on canvas is beautiful—but it will take quite the preservationist to keep it looking good in 42,206 C.E.

And by the way, did you know that since going up in the late 1880s, the Eiffel Tower has been painted more than half a dozen different colors? The structure was “Venetian red” at its construction and over the years has been brown, “yellow-brown,” “brownish-red,” and “reddish brown,” according to the monument’s official website.

All right, so not that different on the colors. However, each hue is really three shades apiece; the bottom third of the tower is painted darker than the middle third, and the middle darker than the top so that the paint job looks uniform against the gradient of the blue(ish) sky.</div>

            <h2>Democrats Mess With Winning in Texas</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/democrats-texas-senate-talarico-crockett/685895/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Do Texas Democrats want to win statewide elections? I’m sure they’d prefer it to losing them. But the question is whether they actually care enough about winning to take the necessary steps—or even whether winning elections ranks among their top, say, five priorities.

The state is holding a Senate election in November that is, or could be, a pivot point in the chamber’s control. Yet Texas Democrats have lost every statewide election since 1994.

During the Obama era, Democrats pointed hopefully to the state’s growing Latino population as a source of strength that would propel them inevitably back into majority status. This expectation of an emerging majority may have paradoxically caused the party to avoid making any accommodations to the state’s conservative-leaning electorate—why compromise their values to win when they could just ride the demographic wave?

In recent years, these hopes have faded. Latino voters swung rightward in 2024. They turned out to have more moderate views on issues, especially immigration, than do the progressive activists who influence Democratic positions. But once again, Texas looks winnable. Over the past year, Donald Trump has driven away the voters he gained. Every ingredient is in place for Texas to swing back, and potentially give Democrats a Senate majority, except one: the Texas Democratic Party.

The party’s latest and most egregious circular-firing-squad behavior transpired earlier this week, when the Democrat Colin Allred, who’d previously dropped out of the Senate race, endorsed Jasmine Crockett, one of the two remaining major competitors. He gave his reason for doing so in a video he posted to social media on Monday. “I understand that James Talarico had the temerity and the audacity to say to a Black woman that he had signed up to run against a mediocre Black man, meaning me, not a formidable, intelligent Black woman, meaning Jasmine Crockett.”

Allred didn’t hear Talarico’s statement directly, which is why he had to say “I understand” that Talarico said it. Allred’s apparent source was a TikTok post by the activist and influencer Morgan Thompson, who said that Talarico had uttered the offensive remark in a private conversation.

Talarico denies having said it. “In my praise of Congresswoman Crockett, I described Congressman Allred’s method of campaigning as mediocre—but his life and service are not,” he wrote in a statement. “I would never attack him on the basis of race.”

Talarico would obviously have a motive to deny making an offensive comment in private. Thompson, however, has a motive as a Crockett supporter to paint her opponent in an unflattering light. She also appears to have an expansive definition of what constitutes an offensive statement. In the same TikTok video, Thompson complained that Talarico described Crockett’s political strategy as involving “attack ads.” As she explains, “Using this language when you have the privilege of being a white man, when people across the political spectrum are also using the ‘angry Black woman that’s aggressive’ trope to attack her, is microaggressive.”

Allred did not have to record and share his response to Talarico, nor was he required to take the allegation at face value. He chose the most inflammatory response. “We’re tired of folks using praise for Black women to mask criticism for Black men,” he said, describing Talarico’s comment as “taking off the mask, telling us who you really are and what you really think.”

Everything about this episode reveals levels of pathological incompetence. Crockett and her supporters are prying open fissures that will scar whichever candidate emerges. They are expressing themselves in social-justice jargon that might be effective in a student-council race at Wesleyan but sounds completely alien to most Texans.

More grim than this particular episode for the Democrats’ electoral prospects in Texas is that, over the past decade, candidates have not typically even tried to appeal to a majority of the state’s voters, because the incentives run in the other direction. Candidates can easily mobilize donors and activists across the country if they go viral on social media. Democrats do this not by highlighting local issues, nor by distancing themselves from the unpopular national party, but by inspiring people who either fervently support the party or wish it were even more progressive.

And when these candidates fail to win office, their fealty to party doctrine brings its own rewards. Texas Democrats have routinely raised massive sums, turned themselves into national political celebrities, lost, and then gone on to work in the progressive movement. Wendy Davis is the archetype: She ran for governor in 2014 in a campaign emphasizing abortion rights; she was featured in a New York Times Magazine cover story; and she lost by 20 points. She went on to found a nonprofit and now works as a political-fundraising consultant.

Beto O’Rourke ran a close but losing race for Senate in 2018. Then, two years later, he ran for president, a campaign in which he adopted uncompromising progressive stances such as confiscating assault weapons. In 2022, O’Rourke ran for governor and lost by double digits. He currently heads a nonprofit organization called Powered by People.

Julián Castro, the former San Antonio mayor who served as housing and urban development secretary in the Obama administration, was once considered a promising future Democratic talent in Texas. Instead, he ran for president in 2020, during which he endorsed Medicare for All and a pullback of border enforcement. He is now the CEO of a nonprofit group dedicated to empowering Latinos.

This year, the party has another chance to try something other than nominating a conventional liberal who loses and then gets to run an NGO. The Trump administration has created a national backlash at least as large as the one in 2018, when O’Rourke came within a few points of victory. Latino voters have turned especially hard against the administration’s indiscriminate mass-deportation policy.

The task has a unique urgency. Federal courts represent the last major impediment to Trump’s authoritarian consolidation, and the Senate is the gateway to controlling those courts. Should Republicans hold the upper chamber, they will have two more years to fill the judiciary—including the Supreme Court—with pro-MAGA jurists. Democrats can stop them if they retake the Senate, but this requires winning deep-red states, of which Texas is among the most promising.

At least in theory, anyway. The closest thing Democrats have to a viable nominee looks to be Talarico, a 36-year-old state representative and former minister who rocketed to prominence last summer when he impressed the podcaster Joe Rogan with his invocation of religious themes. On policy, Talarico has positioned himself as a conventional Democrat, and his efforts to expand his appeal beyond the base consist mostly of biography and messaging style.

But Talarico’s half-hearted gestures to winning are about 50 percentage points more heart than his opponent has put into the enterprise. Crockett, a representative from a deep-blue district that includes much of Dallas, has attained fame with snappy put-downs of Republicans, many of which have gone viral on social media. Crockett once described Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who uses a  wheelchair, as “Governor Hot Wheels”; dismissed complaints about DEI as the laments of “mediocre white boys”; and said Latinos who voted for Trump have “almost like a slave mentality.”

Crockett was lured into the race by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, NOTUS reported in December. The GOP Senate arm conducted a series of polls showing Crockett, who had amassed high name recognition and Democratic enthusiasm, performing strongly in a hypothetical race. Crockett has said the polls, and others that confirmed their findings, helped encourage her to jump into the race, to the delight of Republicans.

Crocket has suggested that she can help drive turnout of infrequent voters. The belief that there is a hidden reservoir of left-wing voters who will bother to show up at the polls only if a sufficiently progressive candidate activates their interest is a decades-old myth. In reality, nonvoters have views that are less ideologically coherent than those of regular voters—which is to say, they think more like swing voters than base voters.

Last month, Crockett told The Washington Post that she doesn’t believe in what she called the “mythical Republican crossover,” and framed her campaign as more of a fun journey than a laser-focused attempt to flip a Senate seat. “My theory of the case is this: If you believe we’re going to lose anyway, then what difference does it make if it’s me or anybody else?” Crockett said. “If you think it’s a losing cause, then who cares? But at least you could say we tried something new and we learned something from this experience.”

Even in a state party that has conditioned itself to the notion that winning an election is less important than the friends and donors you make along the way, that is a shocking confession.

You might suppose that Democrats would recoil from a candidate who broadcasts indifference, at best, to winning over the votes you need to form a majority in a state Trump won by 14 points in 2024. Yet Crockett has continued to attract endorsements, including from Allred, once seen as a relatively moderate candidate, and who ran five points ahead of Kamala Harris in 2024.

Rather than allay the concerns about her electability, Crockett has treated them as illegitimate and even racist. “I really do think that the host said the quiet part out loud, which basically was: If a white man couldn’t do it, then why would a Black woman even have the audacity to think that she could?” Crockett told the Post. “We’ve tried, I don’t know however many white men, and they’ve all lost. The only thing we know for sure is that a white man can lose.”

Crockett’s supporters have made the charge she is floating more explicit. “When they talk about electability, it’s dog whistles, and it’s allusions to speaking about her race, speaking about her being a woman,” Shea Jordan Smith, a Crockett supporter and Democratic political strategist, recently told The New York Times. “They want to call her ghetto and Black and trash so bad, but they don’t say that.”

The comedians Matt Rogers and Bowen Yang breezily observed on a podcast last month that donating to Crockett is a waste of money. A procession of comments proceeded to label them racist. One TikTok post called the remark “structurally violent,” because the pair were telling “Black people, or people in general, not to financially support a Black woman who is running for office.” It received more than 250,000 likes. Yang and Rogers issued obsequious apologies, and Rogers promised to “be better.”

But electability is neither a code word for, nor tantamount to, white-male-ness. Female candidates do not generally face an electoral penalty. Black candidates who meet the electorate where it is on messaging and policy can win swing voters. Barack Obama won millions of voters who later flipped to Donald Trump.

One fatal flaw of progressive identity norms, which treat women and people of color as experts on racism and sexism whose charges of bias cannot be refuted, is that they insulate bad arguments from scrutiny. The belief that swing voters in Texas are too racist and sexist to be compromised with implies that defeat is the only morally acceptable option.

Allred seems to have flung his wild charges at Talarico in genuine anger. But you cannot say that Allred acted stupidly. He is running in a contested primary for a House seat in an overwhelmingly Democratic district, so he probably made his political future more rather than less secure. And if he eventually loses his seat—always a risk in a state that Republicans control and gerrymander at will—what more promising candidate could there be to run a shiny new nonprofit organization?</div>

People have been carrying iphones for nearly 20 years at this point. I think the battery thermals are pretty well known and understood at this point. These aren&#39;t being used in the vacuum of space. This isn&#39;t a landing and there are no spacewalks planned. They are being used onboard.

It&#39;s not the vacuum of space, but the Orion capsule is designed to operate at as little as 8 psi, about half normal sea level. At least it&#39;s not pure oxygen, but I do rather hope those specific phones have been tested at that pressure.

I wouldn&#39;t carry a device in my pocket that contains a lithium battery that hasn&#39;t been tested for safety in a vacuum.

If the phone is in a vacuum, the phone is the least of your worries.

The last text message from the astronaut was &quot;please...send...air!&quot;

At NASA, you know. Everybody knows. That&#39;s how they do things.

If it releases poisonous gases into a tiny space capsule and then breaks by catching fire it could be a problem though. A very unlikely way for a mission to end, but NASA puts a lot of effort into preventing other equally unlikely dangers that could thwart a billion-dollar moon mission and put the crew&#39;s lives in danger.

safer batteries for such things.  It&#39;s no laughing matter on a plane, let alone in the tight confines of a capsule, when a phone or laptop decides to go up in flames.

It&#39;s actually quite hard to start a fire in zero-g because the CO2 stays around the flame and puts it out. Obviously that doesn&#39;t affect a phone battery because it brings its own oxygen, but the big risk is likely to be from the noxious gases it emits as it burns.

I would agree is Microsoft developed IOS. I just hope they don&#39;t try to use Apple Maps to get to the moon. The thought of arriving at Apophis instead is quite alarming.

I&#39;m fine with NASA accepting an unknown risk that their non-radiation-hardened phones may fail to work or that stored non-critical pictures may be lost.

I&#39;m NOT fine with them accepting an unknown risk of increased fire hazards.

Let&#39;s measure or get a very good estimate of the risk of a fire hazard then decide whether it&#39;s acceptable or not.

My early digital cameras didn&#39;t survive metal detectors.  I got permanent stuck pixels on the sensors just by sending the cameras through the metal detectors.

Before you ask, we were not allowed to use lead-lined bags like we did with traditional film.

Can&#39;t wait to see those grainy, blurry, smeared images with stuck green pixels from the far side of the moon!

I assume that you mean x-ray scanners, not metal detectors? Metal detectors shouldn&#39;t emit anything.

And they&#39;re going to operate their phones with spacesuit gloves on?  They&#39;re going to do EVAs clutching their precious phone?  NASA is allowing regular consumer-grade items into space when each launch is going to cost billions of dollars?

I&#39;m sorry, this is one of the most daft ideas I&#39;ve heard in a long time.

They aren&#39;t doing EVAs at all on the Artimis II mission. They are keeping them in the spaceship where they will not wear gloves.

Using game controllers to control the spacecraft?

OK, tasteless jokes aside, for what PURPOSE would that be?

I don&#39;t mind if they bring their phones to watch netflix. For that, safety relevant tests would be enough. But for mission equipment? NASA is not stupid. They know if tests are cheaper that finding out in orbit that your photo equipment was not vibration or radiation resistant enough.

This is clearly an advertisement for Apple. How much did Apple pay for this ad.

Other companies that wen to space and moon milked it for advertising for decades afterwards.

Everybody seems to have forgotten their lightning cables.

&quot;NASA Will *Finally* Let Its Astronauts Bring iPhones To the Moon&quot;

As opposed to the last astronauts that went to the moon? Really? The reason the Apollo missions didn&#39;t bring iPhones was because NASA wouldn&#39;t let them?

Neil Armstrong was a diehard Blackberry user.

More lies from a pathological liar. I&#39;m amazed anyone listens to a word he says anymore, except to know when to buy or sell certain stocks.

It really wouldnâ(TM)t.  Suppose your sats have 5m square in area - I choose this number because thatâ(TM)s what will fit in a stack in a starship.  Now give them fold out solar panels, 4 on each side.  Thatâ(TM)s 200 m^2 of panels.  Solar panels in space generate about 1kW per square metre, so thatâ(TM)s 200kW of power per satellite.  A normal nuclear plant will generate somewhere between 500MW and a GW. So to generate the same power you need 2500-5000 satellites.  You can launch around

Meantime, a solar farm in the southern US that can deliver 1GW would cost about $1bn, and the battery bank another $1bn

Also, you ignored the cost and additional launches for sending the complete AI compute up into space, including the very massy chips, the radiators for cooling, and the structural trusses for linking it to the solar arrays. Because all of that power is going to become heat which must be radiated away. Plus there’s the chip hardening costs and indeed system hardening (micrometeroids). At least 100 further Starship launches, I reckon.

Mod parent funny, but not really. So now I&#39;m trying to make a joke about fueling a rocket ship with burning pants. Or should that be a joke about powering his AI data center with burning pants?

But right now I&#39;m most disappointed that I&#39;m not a Chinese Francophile. Therefore I&#39;m not allowed to make any jokes (with a mixed French and Chinese accent) about Dr Fu Pa... Not even Monsieur Fu Pa? But I have been accused of seeming to be French when I talk in Japanese? So if you confuse Japan with China and then...

I predict his prediction will come true right around the same time he arrives on Mars.  I&#39;m really looking forward to one of those.

Hmmmm. Microsoft did just fine with lying (even in court), and Enron would have gotten away with it too if it wasn&#39;t for those pesky kids and their mangy brownouts.

Psychologists argue that a primary trait of a good CEO is psychopathy, since it requires a personality that has no remorse or compassion and a willingness to do whatever it takes.

As much AI computing as necessary to drive all those 10 million robotaxis on Mars, right?

They plan to put the satellites in a polar orbit that are slowly rotates around the Earth-axis about 1 degree/day to track the sun.

The no 1 problem is the amount of satellites in the same orbit and if there&#39;s a collision we will likely see a Kessler syndrome.The no 2 problem is the service life of the satellites which mean tens of thousands of them will be de-orbited to burn up in the atmosphere each year when it runs out, each one weighing about 2 tonnes, but perhaps all that material burning up and spreading particles in the upper atmosphere will be an unintended solution to global warming.

The unspoken issue here is that getting rid of heat (on Earth, all those people complaining about water use of datacentres) is far harder in space.  The panels at least  radiate *their* heat away from their large rear surface area, but the datacentre itself has to have large amounts of fluid cycling out and back to roughly comparably large radiators.

It doesn&#39;t make space datacentres &quot;undoable&quot;, by any stretch, but omitting mentioning it and talking only about the power advantages is really dishonest.

Yeah, radiation efficiency compared to convection and conduction is what, two orders of magnitude smaller? None of these &quot;x, but in space&quot; morons ever care to remember the giant utilities hookup that is the planet Earth. In this case, it&#39;s a giant heatsink. All of the computing on planet Earth is cooled by sinking the waste heat into the atmosphere, or into a body of water.

Even funnier than the &quot;x, but in space&quot; morons in this case is the &quot;X, but in space&quot; moron that thinks he can just by willpower multiply

The waste heat problem has been solved for a very long time, but not if the satellites are always facing the sun and are used all the time which means you shut them down when they reach a certain temperature so they can cool down before being used again. Starlink satellites do this today except they aren&#39;t always in the sun which provides an increased efficiency in cooling. Shutting down a satellite to expediate cooling only works if you don&#39;t need 24/7 operation or if you have a constellation of satellites

It&#39;s not really comparable, though. Data centres are (comparatively) point sources of heat; they can&#39;t be &quot;spread out&quot; or laid out flat in 2d. Starlink satellites have a, flat surface with its heat spread across it.  Also,Sstarlink antennas are their own radiators.  They get very hot and correspondingly radiate quickly (waste heat from the thrusters is also quite high temp). Your chips by contrast are running at like 75-80C, and your cooling liquid thus has to be significantly below that to draw heat away q

...will be an issue because no amount of GPU fans will be able to carry the heat away.

As will be radiation, orbital debris, etc., etc.

The orbit is about the most dumb location for a datacenter at this time. Maybe in 50 years, but the tech is not there. Non-engineers like Musk do not understand even the basics of the severe problems they are facing. And on the economics side it is also a total fail, because getting weight up there is still very expensive even with SpaceX.

My take is this is simply a diversion attempt from the Musk emails in the Epstein files, were he apparently professes his deep desire to get in on the rape of underage girls.

Would you mind please pointing out exactly where he says this?  What part of the Epstein files shows Elon having been on the island?

My take is you are being dishonest, because you would have to be living under a rock to not know.

But here is one of the many, many, many references: https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/3... [cnbc.com]And here is the document at the DOJ site: https://www.justice.gov/epstei... [justice.gov]

Note that this only states he wanted to go. We do not know currently whether he went, that is probably in the files still illegally held back by the DOJ.

Musk seems to be running scared. It also becomes obvious why he bought this presidency.

Think of how easy it would be for a nation like Russia, the China or the US to blackmail foreign entities that own space datacentres.  They can be attacked with far greater plausible deniability, and they&#39;re not located in the rival nation&#39;s territorial jurisdiction.  Massive amount of value all in one place on an eminently predictable orbit that&#39;s easy to toss a piece of quote-unquote &quot;space debris&quot; at.

Exactly. And that is yet another very bad problem with the whole idea.

Space is cold, duh. Cold+heat = room temperature. Math checks out. Can also use the GPU fans as thrusters. Excuse me, need to go to the patent office.

Don&#39;t worry. He will use the same cooling technology developed for Hyperlo... wait!

It&#39;s possible that he&#39;s got an answer to that problem.  I&#39;ll wait to form an opinion.  (Yeah, I&#39;m skeptical too, but I don&#39;t think one should be certain based on the available evidence.  Also, there are several other potential problems, but maybe he&#39;s got answers.)

There are already some questions about the giant arrays of communications satellites we&#39;re throwing up there. Let&#39;s add datacenters with giant solar arrays attached to them too. I would hope the engineers that get sucked into this project at least have the decency to suggest making datacenter orbit somewhere much further out than the Starlink arrays, but knowing Musk, he&#39;ll want to keep this shit as close as possible &quot;for serviceability&quot; or some bullshit.

I mean, he seems to have bought a whole presidency to do so (and a cheap one at that with $250M), so these completely disconnected and insane claims are not unexpected. His fans are too dumb to understand, and the rest, he cannot reach anyways. But it buys him a bit more time where his apparently stated desire to rape some underage girls is not discussed as intensely.

Holy cow, 27 to 28 launches per day?! Well, if any company can do it my money would be on SpaceX.

That&#39;s the wrong problem.  He&#39;s almost certainly planning to loft multiple satellites with each launch.  But there are other problems it&#39;s reasonable to be dubious about.

I&#39;m going to wait until he&#39;s launched a few to form a definite opinion...though I&#39;ll admit that I consider it unlikely.

Misread that as &quot;lunches&quot; and wondered when SpaceX started hiring hobbits from the Shire.

&quot;...a prediction rooted not in some exotic technical breakthrough but in the basic math of electricity supply: chip output is growing exponentially, and electrical output outside China is essentially flat.&quot;

Chip output has nothing to do with &quot;electricity supply&quot; and growth in &quot;electrical output&quot;  in space is worse than &quot;essentially flat&quot;, it&#39;s nonexistent.  It&#39;s not clear what this &quot;basic math&quot; is, but&#39;s it&#39;s clear who&#39;s saying it.

More importantly, the enormous growth in electrical generation Musk implies will occur in space creates quite an unsolved problem, how do you cool gigawatts of computing expenditures in space?  If only mankind had thought about that before!  Musk will solve it though, just like he put a man on Mars by 2021.

I&#39;m still trying to figure out how they resolve the latency issues of putting a data center into orbit.

When I&#39;m talking to my AI chatbot, I don&#39;t really want to wait an extra 5 seconds for a response because my request is getting beamed into orbit before being sent back to me.

Starlink is about 300-350 mi altitude, and the satellites should be no more than about 500mi away at any given time when fully built out, IIRC. That&#39;s about 10ms one-way. These new satellites are definitely not going into geosynchronous orbit (22k mi)... if they ever were to get built.

It would be much, much cheaper to slap the SpaceX branding on some new nuclear power stations. Or to just buy Westinghouse and vertically integrate.

Incidentally, Moore&#39;s law has stopped working to predict computational power, because it is basically all in the interconnect these days. Hence no &quot;exponential growth&quot; at this time, and probably never again.

Or is he talking about chip power _input_ maybe? It is hard to tell with the confused statements this druggie is making.

Pretty much the same level. This is a not very capable or smart asshole that just got very lucky with inherited money.

&quot;Five years from now, Musk predicted, SpaceX will launch and operate more AI compute annually than the cumulative total on Earth, expecting at least a few hundred gigawatts per year in space...&quot;

That&#39;s a prediction, all right.  Elon Musk makes lots of well-documented predictions.  How many of them have been accurate?  If and when this prediction turns out to be wrong, what will happen?  Has Musk staked anything of value on this prediction?  Will he suffer any consequences whatever for being wrong?

Have you done an analysis of all his public statements on business ideas and compared them with reality?  Me belief is it’s far worse than you are giving him credit for.   How’s the car company doing?  And self driving (that is: full self-driving where I can take a nap in the backseat). It seems like he’s bored with it, so, he’s given up. Now it’s robots. Billions of im not mistaken.

You should try not to buy into the whole “business bravado.”  It’s tiring when it’s detached from reality.   He think he’s being visionary. He’s not. His stuff is so unhinged, what I would call him is a futurist. Futurists are a dime a dozen. People have been writing books and spouting all sorts of wacky ideas like this for a century. Anyone can say “I’m going to make 1 billion robots, and they will do everything you’d ever want!”

One tell that he’s got some issues: he’s always telling people that he’s sleeping on the office floor because he’s working so hard.   Seems like he’s trying to impress just a bit too much.

But sure, at the end of the day, he’s on his way to being a trillionaire, and I am not.

Just like how he announced a $40k cybertruck back in 2019.

Neat trick. Now what are you going to get rid of all that heat that generates?You know. IN A VACUUM.Yes, I know there are IR radiators. With a dissipation of around 200w per square meterNow do the math for 100GW

Duggan: You can&#39;t make an omelette without breaking eggs.Romana: If YOU wanted an omelette, I&#39;d expect to find a pile of broken crockery, a cooker in flames and an unconscious chef.

I dunno, I.... just connect this scene to Musk&#39;s diabolical plans.

How do you plumb coolant to 110 square miles of solar panels? And pump it fast enough and into big enough radiators to cool both the panels and the chips? If these are in sun-synchronous orbit they won&#39;t have any time to cool like the little starlinks do. Micrometeorites are not going to help with reliability much. The engineering problems are many, but if solved it will probably happen sooner rather than later.  I&#39;d rather see this ridiculously expensive AI project burn capital to improve orbital engineeri

I&#39;m still waiting to hear what AI chips are radiation hardened for operation in space.

Yes, I know there are IR radiators. With a dissipation of around 200w per square meterInteresting, because that&#39;s almost exactly the amount of solar panel area to generate that much power. If only the IR radiators could be on side of the solar panel not facing the sun...

Funny thing is that Musk is actually supposed to have a Physics Bachelor. Well, there are rumors he just bought it to get a fake legal immigrant status. Since he seems to not understand basic Physics, that looks more and more likely. While a Physics bachelor does not give you much, it should at least give you an understanding of really basic things like heat radiation.

Let&#39;s say that Elon is right and the economics of space-based solar energy make the expense of launching into orbit worthwhile. Let&#39;s also say that we manage to avoid the Kessler Syndrome that Elon&#39;s companies have largely helped to make more dire.

Compute generates heat. Lots and lots of heat. And heat is difficult to dump in space. How does he plan to get around that not insignificant engineering problem?

I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s impossible. I&#39;m saying it&#39;s not going to happen in three years.

There are ways to dispose of heat in space. Cold fingers that are attached thermally to radiative panels, for example. But they do add to the mass and cost of the spacecraft.

One thing I haven&#39;t seen yet in the discussion (not in TFA either) is the inhostility of the space environment towards computational hardware. Satellites that need to spend any kind of time in space need to use computer chips that can withstand cosmic rays. This involves building shielding (thus adding mass and cost again) or running ch

Whoops, inhospitability, not inhostility.

He keeps lobbing these bullshit &quot;predictions&quot; out there.  People keep on clicking on the links.  People keep on talking about him.  This keeps him relevant.  It&#39;s the same with the Kardashians and every other pop culture &quot;personality&quot;.

It&#39;s real simple here people... just report facts if what is currently happening and what has happened.  Then this goblin will go back into the shadows where he belongs.

The premise here is that companies are going to eat the extra costs for launching a bunch of heavy, heat generating, bandwidth hungry, unrepairable objects into space. Rather than build a power plant somewhere on the planet. And this isn&#39;t just NIMBY US or Europe, when talking outer space anywhere on earth is the competitor.

Call me skeptical that the economics work, but not surprised that the primary salesman of a AI and space company is selling the possible benefits of a vertically integrated product.

1) 10,000 launches per year is 27-28 launches per day, every day. Just the logistics of producing the requisite fuel for that pace is absurd.

2) no day-night cycle in space? What sort of orbit are these notional data centers going into where they never pass through the Earth&#39;s shadow? I know there are some, but can SpaceX loft a data center into one, and would it be viable for what they want to do?

3) how exactly does he expect to handle multiple gigawatts of heat generation in space?

4) most importantly, musk is a nazi fuckwit, serial liar, and wannabe pedo. His word is less than worthless.

Wobbly polar orbit in the lower Van Allen belt. That puts the solar panels right in the middle of the day/night line, with the panels facing the sun all the time. There&#39;s a lot of shit in LOE going around the poles, so the further out the better, except for all the radiation from the Van Allen belts. It will be hard to maintain, so they&#39;ll probably be built with short service lifespans and de-orbited frequently. Hey if you got the capital, might as well burn it building a cathedral nobody wants!

If successful, many people will be put out of work, and those who have homes will pay more for their electricity.Most people&#39;s homes aren&#39;t in space though, so I think we&#39;re good on this.

But what does any of your screed have to do about launching AI into space?

Come to think of it, I&#39;d actually kind of support Musk if his idea for launching AI into space was instead a method of disposal for the slop-producing monster we&#39;ve created.

Until then, it&#39;s pure theoretical speculative jabber.

He probably bought shares in the company that makes the bars and considered that good enough.

I&#39;ve long said that he future lies in space garbage collection and disposal. The challenge will be more than technical. In fact the technical challenges may be pretty simple. The real difficulty will be getting people to pay you for it. You&#39;ll need governments to pay you to do it, or convince companies like StarLink to pay you to clean up their orbital mess, rather than just leave it hurtling around the Earth.

The other thing is permanent waste disposal. Think really nasty things like nuclear waste. Launch i

Can someone shut him down for a while?  I can’t remember where his switch is.

He&#39;s a Martian robot spy send to sabotage the Earth prior to the invasion.

I am coining the terms: Datacenter Nebula, Compute Nebula, and AI Nebula to describe data centers and AI, not in the cloud, but in space.

Compute Constellation seems like a better fit, but there also seems like a lot of opportunity for people to claim prior art, trademark, or copyright. But, I&#39;m the first to name the spaced out Compute Nebula.

I welcome our new space AI overlords from the AI Nebula.

Basically just working to butter up the suckers...I mean investors....to make sure they will pay too much for the stock when the IPO drops.

He&#39;s proposing 10000 launches a year - that&#39;s 27-28 a day.  No way that is realistic - and we all know it.  He&#39;s trying to back up his one million satellite constellation - which someone reminded him means launching 200,000 satellites a year at least assuming a five year hardware obsolescence - because we&#39;re talking compute power here - it goes obsolete in that time or l

Suppose that Elon wanted to put 1 GW of solar in orbit and used that GW to power GPUs.  What would the cost be?  Let&#39;s assume that SpaceX can get starship to land both stages and SpaceX can put 100 tones in orbit for $20 million in one launch.

All figures below are WAG - wild ass guesses.

The cost of all the engineering research needed put a GW data center in orbit =  ????   = $30B ???&quot;

10,000 tons of Solar Cells - cost $500 million - needs 100 launches = $2B

20,000 tons of Radiators - cost $20B - needs

To generate 1kW of electricity from the Sun, you need about 10m^2 of solar panels.  So to generate 1TW, you need 10x10^9 m^2 of solar panels, or about 10,000 square kilometres.  Even if space is a better environment, let&#39;s say that&#39;s 5000 square kilometres.

Solar panels cost around $100 per square metre.  So... anyone willing to invest $500B just for the solar panels alone, never mind getting them up into space and building the data centres and getting the servers up there?  I guess someone might be willing to hand Elon a couple of trillion bucks... who knows.

wish this overcapitalized moron cleaned up after himself instead of pretending that space junk doesnt matter. Getting pretty cluttered up there and some suggest it is already at a critical level.

that he&#39;s the first to be tried at the Nuremburg redux

Space-hardened GPUs are rare, costly, and generations behind datacenter-class hardware, as are CPUs. And as others have pointed out: The heat dissipation. The electrical energy. The connectivity. The launch costs. The maintenance. Nothing about this makes any sense. He might as well move car manufacturing to space.

I guess it&#39;s just an Elo score, though I&#39;m not clear why they all caps it? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system [wikipedia.org]

https://artificialanalysis.ai/evaluations/gdpval-aa [artificialanalysis.ai]

I think because most people incorrectly assume it&#39;s an acronym and not the guys name that invented it.

But to be clear to the GP, that doesn&#39;t mean &quot;it&#39;s a 10% better model&quot;.  For most queries that one does for any two models, most of the generations / fixes will be &quot;good&quot;, and so it&#39;s just basically a coin flip as to which model to choose (&quot;I like this one&#39;s documentation more&quot;, &quot;This one&#39;s fix was more concise&quot;, &quot;This model was more polite&quot;, etc).  10% is actually a pretty big difference and reflect the cases where one model was unambiguously better than the other.

All benchmarks can be gamed. The LLM-scammers have doing this really hard because they have nothing else. And yes, benchmarks become of negative worth (because they begin to state things that are not true) when systems design is aimed at optimizing them.

The funny thing is that these &quot;offers&quot; have been made time and again before. They never worked. They do not really work now. The illusion just has gotten a bit better.

What crashing the market is that what&#39;s been supporting the market is the belief that AI was anytime now replace a lot of workers, resulting in massive productivity gains, saving companies a whole lot of money, a share of which would be revenue for AI suppliers instead, so they would make a lot of money.

I think the correct answer is &quot;you don&#39;t use a screwdriver as a hammer&quot;.  Used correctly, AI tools can be quite helpful.  But reports seem to show that only around 20% of companies use them correctly.  (According to at least one report they produce a 5% improvement for one particular task.  Whether that includes the cost of use, the article didn&#39;t say.)

That sounds as expected and matches some research I have done.

When will the world learn that nothing is going to effectively shortcut having to code in large projects. The bots simply fail in real-world projects. They make the code substantively worse and more confusing. There is no silver bullet. There never was. Indeed. There is no silver bullet and there cannot be one. Things do not work like that.

...and they were amazing. Like I told someone yesterday, two years ago AI was crap. Today, it&#39;s not too bad but I wouldn&#39;t get on a plane that had its code written by AI. In two years, I&#39;ll probably jump on the plane and take a nap.

The claims are getting grander, the defects are somewhat better hidden, but the lies are also getting more and more obvious. Might still go on for a year or two but this tech has no big future. It may have a small one, like all Hype-AI tech before (with something like 10 hypes so far, all pretty mich along the same lines as the current one, just smaller), but only if they can bring the computational effort down massively. That seems to not be happening.

Sooo, the &quot;anti-AI line you have been spouting for decades&quot;? What drugs are you on? The hallucinations are extreme.

Well, I get you have absolutely nothing and you are clearly not very smart. My condolences.

Only a boomer could be so repeatedly wrong and still convince themselves that they know better than everyone else.

HAMR is already a thing, in all of the cheap high capacity disks. What&#39;s new is the perpendicular laser which allows heating a smaller spot, and more platters.

You really should do the math.  11 days, which is a still a long time.

Today they offer  32TB drives on SATA 6gpbs... If that is &#39;acceptable&#39; then reading the entire drive takes at least 18 hours or so in theory.  If same interface, then you&#39;d be limited to 78 hours...

But wait, there&#39;s been talk about spinning platters being upgraded to NVME interfaces.  Largely because &quot;why accommodate spinning drives with a separate interface&quot;, but if this comes in, and could credibly in that timeframe have NVMe with PCIe 6, then the total drive read time could be reduced to about 90 minutes, in theory.

So in theory, such a drive with a credible storage interface could push this in a more reasonable time period.  Historically spinning platters seek performance made the nvme overkill, but streaming performance with that many platters and that density may remedy the &#39;drive too big&#39; problem.  Of course, in the *consumer* market this means that systems would have to start accommodating that sort of connectivity... Of course, in the timeframe perhaps the drives would just use USB to connect, and could credibly connect at 120Gbps, which would mean about 180 minutes of time to read the full time...

In short, it&#39;s time to move to PCIe connectivity to tame these capacities...

Well they assert 140TB in 14 platters, so 10 TB/platter suggests that it would be about a 3x increase in density over current state of the art

Further, number of platters, since your array of drive heads could read from 14 platters concurrently in a single drive interface, if you could get the drive to read everything to you in the order that is best for it.

So if your number is accurate for current platters, then for the hypothetical indicated, you would at least be in PCIe 5 x4 territory, for streaming perf

True, the linear versus track density isn&#39;t known, and I&#39;ve been a bit optimistic on that....

Of course, now they have dual-actuator drives, though currently it&#39;s just splitting the lower and upper platters to be served by independent actuators, one could imagine quad-actuator with two more tracking the same platters to double the potential throughput. As well as investing in making the heads capable of concurrent operation.

While my example numbers may be optimistic by pretending the interface technology wou

Further, number of platters, since your array of drive heads could read from 14 platters concurrently in a single drive interface, if you could get the drive to read everything to you in the order that is best for it.Even though all heads move together as part of a single head stack assembly, only one head seeks and reads at one time.  We theoretically speak about disk cylinders, but the tracks on each platter are not exactly lined up in perfect cylinders.  So, reading from the next platter still requires a short seek.

I was surprised to discover that you can purchase a 30TB hard drive for about half a grand.

That&#39;s 30,000 gigabytes, or about 30,000 hours of recorded video. How much of a person&#39;s life could be recorded on this?

There&#39;s about 8800 hours in a year, but you&#39;re asleep for 1/3 of that  so call it 6000 hours. You can get 5 years of continuous video of your life on a device the size of a paperback book. If you can compress the video of your mundane activities, such as driving to/from work or waiting in line, only

Ya know, that piqued my interest in something related to recording every minute of your waking life in video, and I think this is more reasonable, useful, and feasible today.

1. Record audio 24x7. I&#39;m not even going to bother running the numbers - it&#39;s a hell of a lot smaller, and the next step means we don&#39;t need to calculate out that far.

That&#39;s it. That could be done on a nearly any phone today. Could chunk the audio into 1hr segments, or daily, or whatever works for you. I&#39;d p

That&#39;s 30,000 gigabytes, or about 30,000 hours of recorded video. How much of a person&#39;s life could be recorded on this?

1GB/hour recording is a very low quality recording - even streaming services use several GB per hour. If you want to go 4K you can record 100GB in about 2-3 hours for UHD Blu-Ray discs. So your 30TB drive now only holds maybe 900 hours of recording at 4K. UHD Blu-Ray quality.

Use a modern filesystem like BTRFS or ZFS that takes care of that while mounted.

Will you be able to write the whole disk before it fails ?

I welcome this new improved data loss mechanism; now instead of losing a terabyte or two, you can lose 140TB all at once.

And that&#39;s because backing up a 140TB drive is a bitch. Backing up a datacenter full of them is worse.

You back it up to another 140TB drive and hope both don&#39;t fail. And then back it up to a third 140TB drive just in case.

And a fourth copy to put in the fireproof safe.

And a fifth copy in case there&#39;s a fire in the fireproof safe.

No, no, you go to erasure coding across disks, then you&#39;re down to well under two copies. Unless you want to be able to read it immediately.

You back it up to another 140TB drive and hope both don&#39;t fail. And then back it up to a third 140TB drive just in case.MUST have an offsite backup as well!Speedtest.net says I&#39;m getting 11.39Mbps right now. So that should only take... 27,314 hours to upload (or a over 37 months)!

I like my g&#39;old reliable HDDs, but HDD technologies seems pretty much stagnant since more than a decade. Today&#39;s a 2TB HD cost pretty much the same as a 2010&#39;s 2TB HD, same speed, same everything.Meanwhile I heard a lot of promises but none of them did hit the shelves.Plus, SSDs got more robust and were getting close to same $/TB of HDs, this trend only stopped due to the recent RAM/Flash shortages (thanks AI big techs).I&#39;d love to see HDDs to make such a comeback, but I&#39;m not holding my breath.

HDDs have also become much more difficult to find at reasonable prices lately. The one I bought in December is now nearly twice as expensive.

I also ordered a decently-priced USB external drive from Amazon in January which didn&#39;t say anything about being out-of-stock but is now saying to expect delivery in March. I&#39;m guessing they&#39;ll cancel the order at some point because it will probably cost them more than I paid.

Lack of demand is going to limit the research and technology advancement.We could improve HDD someone wants to put up the money and wait a long while. I guess blame capitalism in that it doesn&#39;t solve everything, at least not on consumer demand alone.

At some point it can only be so cheap. The cost of churning out boards, packaging the things, and handling warranties and such puts a hard floor on the cost. They&#39;re making their billions in the same way Change Bank makes theirs.

You&#39;re correct. Who wants a 2TB HDD to be faster and cheaper when you can buy an SSD that&#39;s 100x faster? The technology is for bulk storage and that&#39;s what they&#39;ve been investing in. You couldn&#39;t get a 22TB HDD in 2010 for a reasonable price. You can now. HDDs are never going to make a comeback for primary storage, but for bulk storage they&#39;re king.

Seemed stupid for sharks, but maybe it&#39;s better for hard drives?

One thing I&#39;m wondering is about changing form factors.  For SSDs, the current NVMe form factors and such make sense.  However, HDDs need a new form factor.  2.5&quot; HDDs are pretty much abandoned with the last space increase to 6 TB happening a year or two ago.  3.5&quot; HDDs really need more height to allow for more disks to be stacked or more room to place platters.

Maybe we need to bring back the 5.25&quot; full height form factor?  It obviously would not work with the 1-3 rack unit systems, so the drives would have to go in an external rack and be hooked up via SAS, FC, or some other protocol.  Or maybe start clean completely and have a format that is future-resistant and can grow in whatever dimensions are needed.

RAID5 became dangerous because of the size of disks. RAID6 is pretty close to having the same issue. I wonder how possible close to reality a RAID7 is?

On the plus side, TV has hit rock bottom decades ago, and films aren&#39;t far behind. Using AI to make shit faster is kind of fitting really.

On the plus side, TV has hit rock bottom decades ago,

No it didn&#39;t. The last 15 years have arguably been the high point of TV.

Decades ago, let&#39;s say 30 years to 20 years. Well, 30 years ago was about the first ever show with an entire multi-season story arc plotted out in advance (Babylon 5). There were of course many missteps because literally no one had done it before and the studio had no fucking idea what to do with it. It probably took another 10 years before people finally figured out how to execute such a thing. And now they&#39;ve got good at properly executing single and multi-season arcs.

That&#39;s not to say there aren&#39;t some decent shows from the 90s and 2000s. There were a lot of shows after all, but quite a lot of them feel somewhat dated. Slow moving, clunky plots, weird retconning and plot holes due to lack of proper planning.

Hindsight + nostalgia + Sturgeon&#39;s Law [wikipedia.org] is a hell of a combo. The 90&#39;s and 00&#39;s had some great shows but also had a ton of trash that is just forgotten about today.  There are also great shows on today but all the crap is right in front of us so we are more aware of it but the ratio never changes.

This is true and yet I also feel like the last ten years have been obviously an improvement so I can&#39;t figure out why someone would say such a thing. While some of my favorite TV shows in my life time might predate that timeframe, it&#39;s hard to argue that the competition between streaming services hasn&#39;t resulted in an extremely diverse, original, and high quality set of TV shows that wouldn&#39;t have been made in the past because they wouldn&#39;t be considered mass market enough.

No it didn&#39;t. The last 15 years have arguably been the high point of TV.What would you say is the best TV of the last 15 years?

No it didn&#39;t. The last 15 years have arguably been the high point of TV.

What would you say is the best TV of the last 15 years?

My list of TV shows I&#39;ve enjoyed from 2010 on would include.

Breaking Bad (started 2008)Parks and Rec (started 2009)The Office (started 2005)30 Rock (started 2006)Mad Men (2007)Severance (new!)Ted Lasso (only the first season)

So other than Ted Lasso and Severance, my list is entirely things that were already running by 2010 (and some would say peaked by then).

The only shows I&#39;m currently watching are Fallout (I&#39;m only two episodes into season 1) and A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms--both seem fun so far.

I would have killed for a Wheel of Time TV show, and it was just so bad.Obviously your own opinion is what matters to you, and nothing wrong with feeling that way. It definitely wasn&#39;t staying entirely faithful to the books, but they made that clear from the start. I would have preferred if they had, but I&#39;m not going to fault them for that alone. The show did have a rough first season. However, it continued to improve from there. Most ratings for the show put it around 75% to 85% positive overall, with season 3 being 80% to 90%.

> On the plus side, TV has hit rock bottom decades ago,

Well yeah, it kinda sucked in the mid-seventies. But it&#39;s gotten way better since. It&#39;s really good right now, in part because of the (alas, unsustainable) competition between the streaming services.

While there have been times TV hasn&#39;t been good, now&#39;s not that time. Alas though, it sounds as if an era of shitty clip-show level crap is nearly upon us, given this article.

I mean, there is one argument in favor of this approach: Despite TV being complete crap, it gets significant views. If the customer is undiscerning, you can sell turds with glitter on top. And that seems to be what is happening here.

No time + AI = slopFull time + AI = better than without AILess time + AI = depends (for example on how much less time)

Simple to see. If you have the full time, the AI benefits come on top. As more as you reduce the time allowed for the production, the more the AI has to do. And somewhere is the break even at which people notice that AI doesn&#39;t do everything on its own when given a prompt, but needs a human who knows what they are doing.

Some will surely surpass the average tiktoker...

AI doesn&#39;t have to be used to generate the plot, it could be used for say reviewing scripts or first draft edits. Faster than a human, and even though it&#39;s unreliable it may catch some genuine issues that can be corrected before being passed to human review.

Another example would be taking a storyboard or script and using it to make a rough cut, which can then be edited properly.

The danger is that it becomes a crutch. Say the writers are struggling with a scene or a plot point, they turn to AI for ideas, and

I gave up on Rings of Power after a few episodes. The Boys is good though.

Didn&#39;t they have Lower Decks? That was good. Fallout is okay, but I haven&#39;t played the games.

Bosch was good for the first 6-7 seasons.

So it&#39;s going to be someone&#39;s fap material that stops abruptly because the author reached climax before they could write down all the nonsensical words.

The thing is, good content requires good writing. AI can obviously not do that. But the other thing is that BAD content still gets significant views.

Ok.  Personally, I&#39;ll wait for the future before judging people for what they&#39;ll be doing in it.

So no matter how quickly you can make a movie, it still takes an 80-100 or whatever minutes to watch it.

So they need more consumers. This is where agents come in.

They just need to convince people to want to own a series of robots to be entertained for them. I&#39;m sure they could come up with a &quot;vibe-viewing&quot; UI to managing your little virtual popcorn-eaters - maybe Nintendo could help, they&#39;re good at that sort of thing.

And then kids could humiliate each other over how much media their peers are wasting without experiencing.

It will be quite impossible to mass-produce individually rendered streams of AI slops at a cost that is acceptable to the punter.

And beyond. Such a thing won&#39;t pay for itself.

Just like manned flight will never be possible, no one will ever be able to harness the power of nuclear forces, and no one will ever be able to go to the Moon.

Sounds about right for Hollywood these days. Gonna fire up some Gilligan&#39;s Island tonight. At least slop made in the 60&#39;s was still watchable.

Their wording specifically sounds like they&#39;re not working on tools where you can &quot;prompt your way into a movie,&quot; but rather tools that are designed to act as a force multiplier on creatives&#39; labor.

I saw a demo video involving anime about a year ago. The tool basically allowed a single artist to draw out their animation and then tell the model to go through frame-by-frame and clean up rough edges and stuff like that. Basically grunt work that low-paid artists in Korea might do for creators in Japan.

Basically grunt work that low-paid artists in Korea might do for creators in Japan.But how will these low-paid artists learn their craft???Wait, this is Slashdot:  AI is taking away jobs of entry-level programmers.  How will entry-level programmers learn their craft?

But how will these low-paid artists learn their craft???

Wait, this is Slashdot:  AI is taking away jobs of entry-level programmers.  How will entry-level programmers learn their craft?

&quot;Hollywood fears that AI will cut jobs and permanently reshape the industry.&quot;

First, there are no studios in Hollywood, second, thousands of model makers lost their jobs to CGI and nobody made a fuss.

That was shitty in the beginning as well, it will be the same thing here, just with higher resolution from the get-go.

I have solved the tv and movie problem.  I&#39;ve trained my AI to watch all the shows for me, and now I have tons of free time to do more pleasant things.

The good news. Creative people can use the AI tools to realize their ideas without the staff or money required to do it the old way.The bad news. Artless mercenaries will be able to churn out overwhelming quantities of crap faster, cheaper and easier.

Throughout all of history advances in technology have been primarily billed at making it easier to make movies. From the move to miniature sets, digital cameras, different technologies for separating characters from backgrounds, e.g. green screening existed to speed up rotoscoping...

AI is a tool. Of course it was going to be used in Hollywood. They&#39;ve attempted to use literally everything ever developed to help speed up film making.

More crap, faster. That&#39;s what the world needs.

This is not a new thing though. Never ends well. Those who sacrifice quality for quantity will in the end have neither.

Imagine you attend a protest, like hundreds of thousands of Americans have since President Donald Trump began his second term. Perhaps it is a No Kings event, or a local ICE demonstration to protest Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s crackdown on immigrants in your community. During the protest, you take a video of yourself and your fellow protesters, caption it “Abolish ICE,” and upload it to Instagram. A few weeks later, there’s a knock on your door. Federal agents stand before you, demanding to question you.

You’re wondering to yourself: Do they know about the protest I attended? Are they legally allowed to track me? Do I have to comply?

The answer to these first two questions is, shockingly, yes, and it’s made possible in part by a little-known power that the Trump administration has supercharged in recent months. The answer to the last question is much more complicated. The Department of Homeland Security is one of a number of federal agencies with something called administrative subpoena power, and it has been leveraging that tool in unprecedented ways under Trump 2.0. The Washington Post detailed these abuses this week, focusing on the story of a U.S. citizen targeted by DHS for simply emailing a federal prosecutor his opinion about the federal government’s case against an Afghan national facing deportation.

How can something like this happen? Congress has granted administrative subpoena power to federal agencies, like the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Federal Communications Commission, to allow them to access information quickly to make decisions about issues under their purview. A key distinction between administrative subpoenas and civil or criminal ones is that federal agencies do not need a judge’s sign-off. These agencies retain the power to approve administrative subpoenas themselves. This also means that agencies can demand documents without needing to prove that there is an ongoing investigation into or probable cause against a person when issuing administrative subpoenas.

Federal agencies are not legally required to disclose how many administrative subpoenas they issue, but under the Trump administration, unnamed sources told the Post, the volume of administrative subpoenas is “well into the thousands, if not tens of thousands.” Lindsay Nash, a professor at Cardozo School of Law, authored a study on the immigration subpoena power and found, through publicly available regulations and internal records, that ICE has empowered its employees—even those focused on civil immigration enforcement—“to demand records and testimony from any person or entity in order to obtain information for any civil or criminal investigation within the agency’s broad domain.”

“At present, there is generally no requirement that officers have probable cause, identify the suspected violation, or exercise restraint,” Nash wrote. This is being exemplified with abuses like the one documented in the Post story, plus footage of federal agents taking pictures of protesters and threatening to add them to “a nice little database,” which some anonymous national security officials claim does in fact exist as a way for DHS and the FBI to track people labeled as “domestic terrorists.” (DHS publicly denies that there is such a database.)

The Trump administration’s heavy use of administrative subpoenas comes as the judiciary—including Republican-appointed judges—has been turning against its immigration enforcement tactics. Just this week, a court blocked the White House from ending temporary protected status for over 350,000 Haitian immigrants living in the U.S., while the chief judge of the District of Minnesota concluded that ICE has most likely violated more court orders in January alone than “some federal agencies have violated in their entire existence.”

Administrative subpoenas are a convenient work-around for an administration that knows it faces an uphill battle if it takes its information requests to a judge, a process that requires a formal investigation. Instead of having to meet a strict legal standard, DHS can issue administrative subpoenas to private individuals, tech companies, schools, state governments, and other entities in order to access information about people it’s interested in targeting. It has already tried to take this path to acquire data on folks who track ICE in their local communities. Generally, targeted organizations do not have to notify individuals that their information is being sought by the federal government. However, these groups are not actually obliged to comply with these subpoenas absent judicial action. As Michelle Lapointe, legal director at American Immigration Council, told Slate, administrative subpoenas are not self-enforcing. “When people receive an administrative subpoena from ICE, technically they don’t have to respond,” she said. “The agency can go to court and seek the records to be compelled from the individual who is served with the subpoena. But it has to do that extra step to make it enforceable.”

Lapointe noted that oftentimes recipients of these subpoenas do end up complying out of fear, which DHS appears to be manipulating. The Post story, for instance, described what happened to the U.S. citizen who had emailed the federal prosecutor: Federal agents showed up at his doorstep after he failed to comply with an administrative subpoena. The agents questioned him about the email, asking how he had found the attorney’s email address—through a basic Google search. After about 20 minutes, the agents left.

Critically, tech companies, including Google and Meta, have received administration subpoenas since Trump took office last year, but it’s not always clear when they comply. A Google spokesperson told TechCrunch that it pushes back against overbroad or improper subpoenas, while spokespeople for Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and Snap told the Post their companies alert users about administrative subpoena requests unless they are barred from doing so or face extenuating circumstances.

In a case about six separate Instagram accounts that named and shamed a Border Patrol agent who was part of the Los Angeles immigration raids last summer, DHS sent Meta an administrative subpoena asking for the accounts’ names, email addresses, and phone numbers. In that instance, the Instagram account users were made aware of the subpoena, and a judge ordered Meta not to comply.

The issue here is that Americans are left to simply hope these tech companies operate in good faith and out of the goodness of their hearts, something that “should be alarming to all of us,” Lapointe noted. The threat remains that these companies may end up complying with DHS requests in order to get the administration off their backs, even when subpoenas are unwarranted. “I do think the acquiescence of tech and government makes it especially difficult as a functional matter to protect individual rights when you have administrative subpoena authority,” Dennis Fan, an associate professor at Columbia Law School and a former federal prosecutor, told Slate. Attending a protest is a constitutionally protected right, as is writing an email that contains your political opinions, but the Trump administration is finding ways to use these actions against its citizens by leaning into third parties—aka Big Tech—who have access to your personal, identifying information. These are companies that have positioned themselves as friendly partners of the White House, given that many of the country’s tech billionaires personally donated to Trump’s inauguration, then were conspicuously seated in the front row.

Where does that leave the average American? The answer is complicated. Lapointe believes that the best thing we can do is remain aware of our constitutional rights and not let Big Tech get away with selling out Americans without a fight. “I think pressure can be brought to bear, the more we raise awareness that these requests could come through and that the tech companies might receive them, requesting your information,” Lapointe said. “Using public pressure campaigns to encourage them to resist these attempts to get at private information could be helpful.”

So if you exercise your First Amendment right to protest injustices you believe your government is committing, you risk being targeted by that very government. And if you don’t want Big Tech helping that government target you? You may have to be right back at that protest again.

In his most recent rant about how Democrats cheat to win elections, President Donald Trump offered a chilling recommendation on Monday. Appearing on the podcast of Dan Bongino, his former deputy FBI director, the president argued that “the Republicans should say, ‘We want to take over.’ We should take over the voting, the voting in at least many—15 places.

“The Republicans,” he added, “ought to nationalize the voting.”

A federal-government takeover of America’s locally and state-administered voting process has long been something Republicans have opposed on principle. But then again, Trump said he wanted to do it. So how would Senate Republicans respond?

There were those who, in a ritual dating back to the early days of Trump’s first term, had conveniently not kept abreast of the news. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told me he wouldn’t comment because he hadn’t seen the interview. Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley thought about it for a few seconds before determining that he too was unfamiliar.

Others were more forthcoming, with Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski rejecting the idea. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, most importantly, said, “I’m not in favor of federalizing elections—I mean, I think that’s a constitutional issue.”

But a broad middle of GOP senators took something of a third way: While they wouldn’t endorse a partisan and national takeover of voting itself, they were eager to talk about legislation that would greatly expand the federal role in elections—and do so in a way that furthers a long-standing partisan goal of the GOP.

“We need to safeguard our elections better,” Kansas Sen. Roger Marshall told me. “I think the SAVE Act is a great start. I think requiring proof of citizenship when you register to vote is a must.”

Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson said that “we shouldn’t nationalize” elections, “but we should certainly set certain standards like citizenship and voter ID.” He added, “The problem is, we have Democrats who want to make it easy to cheat.”

Florida Sen. Rick Scott echoed those sentiments. “We need to have voter ID in our elections. We need to make sure illegal aliens cannot vote in our elections,” he said. “We need to make sure that we just stop the fraud.”

As Marshall alluded to, the bill that Republicans have coalesced around is the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which the House passed earlier this Congress, and which proponents are trying to find some magical way to squeeze through the Senate’s brick wall.

Even White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, in a Tuesday press briefing, said passage of this legislation is what Trump had been referring to when he called to “nationalize the voting.” Sure it was.

Republicans often point to the high public support for requiring photo ID at polling places. The SAVE Act is more than that, though. It requires “documentary proof of United States citizenship” in order to register to vote. Such proof means things like a passport or a birth certificate. REAL IDs could count too, but only if they indicate citizenship, and just a handful of states’ REAL IDs currently do so. The SAVE Act, in other words, applies drastic changes to solve a problem—voter fraud—that is vanishingly rare, though it would succeed in creating hurdles for eligible voters. It goes without saying that Democrats have no interest in this legislation, and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer has described it as “nothing more than Jim Crow 2.0.”

Given Senate Democrats’ 100 percent chance of filibustering this legislation, and Republicans’ inability to eliminate the legislative filibuster, then, what’s the plan for getting this bill through the Senate?

House Republicans think they have an idea that could work. Bless their hearts.

After the Senate and White House reached a deal last week to extend the Department of Homeland Security’s funding for only two weeks, giving them a brief window to negotiate new immigration enforcement reforms, conservative House Republicans were displeased. If Democrats felt as if they could reopen a closed negotiation over DHS funding, then they wanted to participate too. A group of them, led by Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, insisted that when the Senate deal returned to the House, they wouldn’t support it unless they could attach the SAVE Act.

But such a move would have been a recipe for a prolonged shutdown. Trump’s priority over the past week has been to avoid a lengthy shutdown that keeps the issue of immigration enforcement tactics front and center in the news. And so, following a White House meeting, Luna and Co. said they’d received “assurances” from Thune that they would wait out a “standing filibuster” from their Democratic counterparts in order to pass the SAVE Act, at a later date. In return, the rebels would support the government funding bill sent over from the Senate.

Anyone familiar with the Senate realizes that Thune would never have made such an assurance. As Thune clarified Tuesday morning, all he said was that he’d have a conversation with Republican senators about it. You have to know what waiting out a “standing filibuster” means—and most House members don’t—to understand why he wouldn’t promise it to some aggravated House members.

Waiting out a “standing,” or “talking,” filibuster means you wait for the other side to stop talking before moving ahead to a simple-majority vote, as opposed to the normal means of cutting off debate: invoking cloture with 60 votes. The strategy, if used, would likely involve enforcing the Senate’s two-speech rule, barring lawmakers from speaking more than twice in the same legislative day on the same question.

The problem is that this can take forever. Forty-seven Democratic senators being able to speak twice, on its own terms, could take up weeks or months of precious legislative floor time that Republicans need for other priorities. And that’s before any amendments that could reset the clock. Plus, GOP senators would need to be on or near the floor for the entirety of this time to ensure they have a quorum lest Democratic speakers attempt a quorum call.

“I’m skeptical that it’s going to be a panacea,” Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a onetime member of leadership who’s well familiar with Senate rules, told me.

Thune laid out all of these challenges Tuesday afternoon but nevertheless promised to “have a discussion about it and see where our conference is.” In other words, the plan is to allow the passage of time to do the humble work of making everyone forget about all of this.

Trump’s desire for greater control over the administration of the midterm elections, however, won’t disappear amid congressional gridlock. The president already initiated a national redistricting war to squeeze out a few more congressional seats. The FBI has already raided a Georgia election facility and could plan for more. The Justice Department keeps trying to get its mitts on state voter rolls. We don’t know exactly what it is yet, but if there’s a way to do “nationalization” by other means, the administration will be looking into it.

            <div id="article-text">David Enrich’s whole life right now is the Epstein files. As an investigations editor at the New York Times, his phone and computer basically explode whenever new files are released.Last Friday, his phone exploded again when the Department of Justice dropped about 3 million pages of documents into the cloud.

Back in November, Democrats and Republicans worked together to force the DOJ to release all they’d discovered about Jeffrey Epstein—the country’s most notorious sex criminal and probably one of the richest, too. With this latest release, the DOJ says it has satisfied that demand. But it’s not even all they’ve got.

The Times built its own internal search engine to sort through the sludge. It doesn’t just search for specific words; you can ask it to search for concepts like bribery. And these documents aren’t just emails about President Donald Trump, or giddy vacation planning for rich folks hoping to hop a ride to Epstein’s infamous island. There are photos and videos, even bank records.

On a recent episode of What Next, host Mary Harris spoke to Enrich about the latest Epstein file drop and what it says about Bill Gates, Elon Musk, and Donald Trump. This transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mary Harris: Before we dig into exactly what’s in the file and what it says, what does the sheer volume of what’s been released tell you?

David Enrich: I don’t have much confidence in the government. I don’t have much sense that the majority of this stuff has been read thoroughly.

When these files were released, a number of things seemed to have been released by mistake. The implication of that is that they didn’t know exactly what they were releasing. But it’s also really awful stuff. Pictures of women and young girls without any kind of redaction. They’re identifiable, nude. Very upsetting, essentially. And your team was part of the team that found that, right?

This has been a real mess by the government. The argument they make is that they only had two months to pull this stuff together because the Epstein Files Transparency Act was passed and signed into law in November, with a December deadline. But the truth is that Trump came into office saying he was going to be transparent about this and release the files, and they made a series of choices and decisions not to do that, which I think were based in part on their gradual understanding of the fact that what was in these may be damaging to Trump or his allies.

So they then entered this frenzied period, starting in November, and did not do a good job. There are a huge number of things in there that are identifying victims, a number of files that have a high likelihood of being child sexual abuse material, and all sorts of other damaging stuff that serves no public interest and was not, in fact, required by law to be disclosed. What they’ve done is all these haphazard redactions, redacting a bunch of things they’re not supposed to redact. We found that Steve Bannon had texted Epstein, and Epstein’s name was redacted, and Trump’s face was redacted. And it’s like, why on earth would that stuff be redacted? At the same time, we’re seeing victims’ names identified.

The government is being somewhat responsive now when things are being brought to their attention. They’re taking them down and are re-redacting them. But at the same time, they appear to have overredacted quite a bit of stuff.

What stands out to me in this possible final release of files is the way that neither Donald Trump nor Jeffrey Epstein seem to be able to escape each other. These are two people who were friends in the 1990s and early 2000s. There are reports that there was a falling-out between them. Epstein gets arrested for sex acts with a minor. Donald Trump decides to run for president. But these guys can’t stop talking about each other.

Yeah, they were very close for a while, but Epstein’s defining human trait was an ability to seize on his connections and leverage them for as much currency as he could. And that came in many forms, right? That’s why he had all these pictures of himself with famous people in his houses, because he liked to be able to show those off to other famous people, or to use these as a threat hanging over the heads of his victims.

With Trump, it’s playing out in some different ways. Part of it is that with Trump’s rise to power back in 2016, Epstein realized that here was someone who had great power to either make Epstein’s life better or worse. And so I think he was really trying to suss out, initially, how he could pull those different levers. It obviously didn’t work very well, since during Trump’s first term, Epstein ended up in prison and then died.

And the files were kind of a useful tool for Trump and Trump’s allies, in particular, to beat Democrats and fan the flames of conspiracy theories on the far right. There’s no doubt that one of the things that got Trump elected in 2024 was this band of far-right MAGA people who were convinced that Trump was going to expose this global ring of pedophiles on the left and through the Epstein files.

The big allegation about Trump in these latest files involves calls to the FBI’s tip line. And these are a little dicey to talk about, because these are unverified tips. The FBI gets all kinds of unverified tips all the time. But could you just lay out what’s in there?

I’m going to be like a really anal New York Times reporter. We’ve made a decision institutionally that we’re not going to give airtime to things that we really just have no idea if they are true or not, especially when they’re of this lurid nature. But I mean, in general, it’s just very lurid sexual allegations involving Trump in the context of his relationship with Epstein. And they’re very bad allegations.

Let’s talk about some of the other big names that have been in the spotlight since the latest release. My understanding is that in these files, you see Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick trying to make plans to go to Epstein’s island. He was in friendly contact with Jeffrey Epstein long after he said he’d shut the relationship down.

Yeah, and the crazy thing here is that Lutnik just last year had said not only that he had shut the relationship down, but he had given this whole explanation for why he’d shut it down, which was that he’d visited Epstein’s mansion and he’d seen stuff in there that made him and his wife really uncomfortable. And they had vowed then and there to never associate with this terrible man again. But what we see in these files shows that’s just not true at all. They by all accounts had a pretty chummy relationship. They visited Epstein on his island long after this alleged encounter in the townhouse that left them so unsettled.

There’s also Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft. There have been allegations for years that Gates and Jeffrey Epstein were close. But in this latest release of documents, there are these implications that Epstein was helping procure women for Bill Gates and that Gates got a sexually transmitted infection, and was trying to get drugs to treat himself and secretly treat his own wife. She’s been asked about this, and she’s given an answer basically saying, This takes me back to the worst times of my marriage, which isn’t a, like, Hell no, this didn’t happen. It’s something quite different.

We’ve known for years, since Epstein’s death, about the long-running relationship between Gates and Epstein that involved everything, apparently, from science to money to women, or girls perhaps. I can’t say I’m shocked to see Gates’ reentry into this. The thing I’ll caution about here is—and I’m not at all defending Gates or his apparent conduct, and it is entirely possible that those emails were true and accurately reflected what Epstein and people like Gates did—but it is possible that Epstein is a liar and an embellisher and an expert in using threats and leverage to get what he wants with powerful people. And so it is not outside the realm of possibility that Epstein was exaggerating or twisting the truth. That being said, we know, and this has been out there in public for a while, that part of the reason that Bill and Melinda Gates got divorced was her discomfort with her husband’s relationship with Epstein. And while we’ve never really had the full gory details and what that’s entailed, it’s obviously been a subject of informed speculation.

Elon Musk is in here. He’s writing to Jeffrey Epstein asking, When is the wildest party on your island, because I want to make sure that I come. What do you make of this?

Once again, we are seeing people who had previously denied or downplayed their relationships with Epstein, and in fact had pointed at other people for being more connected to Epstein, we are now seeing that they, long after Epstein was known as a sexual criminal and had registered as a Level 3 sex offender, were continuing to associate with him.

You’ve talked about transparency being important here. Can we talk about what we’re not seeing in this release of documents? We were promised 6 million documents. I thought they were legally required to release all the files, so what is happening there?

That is a good question, and I don’t have a good answer. What the Justice Department has said is that they withheld a large quantity of documents to protect victims’ identities.Two things can be true: They can be protecting victims’ identities by not releasing 3 million documents and they can also be doing a bad job of protecting victims’ identities in the 3 million pages of documents that they did release. That being said, this administration’s handling of the Epstein files doesn’t have a whole lot of credibility.

A year ago, Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel said they released the Epstein files by handing binders full of public court documents to a group of MAGA influencers. That was the whole start of this. And it’s gone along on the same trajectory with deceitful disclosures. In that context, I think it is normal and reasonable for open-minded people to be skeptical and curious about what’s actually in these other 3 million pages of documents.

To get to this point, Congress had to act of its own accord, essentially, and force the release. Are there other avenues available to lawmakers who want to see more here?

The Justice Department has said it is going to meet with lawmakers to explain its thinking. The other options are not necessarily in terms of getting these files, but there are other ways to get some more transparency. And one of the things we’ve seen is that the House Oversight Committee has issued a bunch of subpoenas to a wide variety of people demanding that they sit for depositions under oath, the transcripts of which will presumably be released in short order. And that ranges from people like the Clintons to people like former Victoria Secret CEO Les Wexner, who was one of Epstein’s biggest financial benefactors over the years. We’ll see what happens.

There are a huge number of wealthy, powerful individuals all over the world who continued to associate with Epstein and provide him with various kinds of support long after he went to jail.To me, what has made the Epstein story so riveting and so important for so many years is that yes, this is a story about a guy who is a pedophile and was doing terrible things to women and girls. But much more than that, it is a story about how one individual, when he accrues enough wealth and influence and connections, can work the entire global system to his benefit for very nefarious purposes. And he does it in conjunction and in some cases partnership with some of the richest, most powerful people on Earth. And that is a story that has not yet fully been told.

            <h2>OpenAI chases business bucks with confusingly named Frontier platform</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/05/openai_debuts_frontier_platform/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI, a maker of frontier models, has announced a platform called Frontier to help enterprises implement software agents. That&#39;s not confusing at all.

The AI biz wants to make it easier for risk-averse organizations to automate workflows with machine learning models, something companies have been loath to do because pilot tests of AI agents often fail to demonstrate meaningful value.

OpenAI&#39;s adoption of the term &quot;frontier&quot; is particularly confusing given that the company started using it to describe AI models in 2023, shortly before it announced the formation of the Frontier Model Forum.

&quot;The Forum defines frontier models as large-scale machine-learning models that exceed the capabilities currently present in the most advanced existing models, and can perform a wide variety of tasks,&quot; the AI biz explained at the time.

Frontier models thus did not exist – being beyond existing models – but were somehow what forum members developed and deployed. The term is essentially code for leading US commercial AI models, as opposed to alternatives.

The company&#39;s Frontier platform is something else entirely. It helps orchestrate AI agents in the way that Kubernetes orchestrates containers.

&quot;Frontier connects siloed data warehouses, CRM systems, ticketing tools, and internal applications to give AI coworkers that same shared business context,&quot; OpenAI explains. &quot;They understand how information flows, where decisions happen, and what outcomes matter. It becomes a semantic layer for the enterprise that all AI coworkers can reference to operate and communicate effectively.&quot;

Context, in the context of AI models, refers to the tokens available to an LLM, meaning the prompt text, the system prompt, and other data including past conversations and interaction history that seed model output. &quot;Business context&quot; then is information from different systems that&#39;s been made available across technical and policy boundaries for AI agents to take action.

OpenAI describes Frontier as enabling &quot;AI coworkers&quot; through an &quot;open agent execution environment.&quot;

&quot;As AI coworkers operate, they build memories, turning past interactions into useful context that improves performance over time,&quot; the company explains, leaning into the conceit that agentic systems can replace employees.

So, Frontier is a (hopefully) safe space to mingle data from sources like Google Calendar, Salesforce, SAP, and business guidance documents so AI agents can complete automated tasks like answering client sales queries.

It sounds simple but clearly isn&#39;t – OpenAI is promising to make Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs) available to corporate IT teams to help get agent workflows into production.

Cobus Greyling, chief evangelist at Kore.ai, which also offers an agent platform for enterprises, told The Register in an email that he doubts organizations will find Frontier all that compelling.

&quot;OpenAI Frontier is a name for the frontier of what OpenAI&#39;s tech enables, not a thing you install,&quot; he explained. &quot;It is basically a collective, informal label for using OpenAI&#39;s newest models plus the modern APIs and patterns (Responses API, tool calling, structured outputs, reasoning models, multimodality, agents) together in a loosely coupled, composable way.

&quot;There&#39;s no monolithic &#39;Frontier SDK&#39; or framework; you&#39;re stitching the pieces together yourself, choosing how tightly or loosely agents, tools, memory, and control logic interact.&quot;

Greyling said Frontier is not so much a product as a design philosophy that calls for small, stateless model calls, clear role separation, orchestration in code rather than prompts, and decision-making models rather than a monolithic system making decisions.

What OpenAI is doing, he argues, is similar to what rivals are doing – moving up the AI stack by shifting focus from the models themselves to the applications, tools, orchestration, and standards that define agents.

&quot;This transition commoditizes base models while allowing providers to capture higher value in autonomous agents, enterprise workflows, and interoperability layers,&quot; he said.

And OpenAI has to capture a lot of value to make up for its spending. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Newsletter platform Substack has admitted that an intruder swiped user contact details months before the company noticed, forcing it to warn writers and readers that their email addresses and other account metadata were accessed without permission.

The disclosure arrived in an email this week from Substack CEO Chris Best to affected users, who acknowledged the lapse in unusually no-frills language. &quot;I&#39;m reaching out to let you know about a security incident that resulted in the email address from your Substack account being shared without your permission,&quot; Best said in the message, seen by The Register. &quot;This sucks. I&#39;m sorry. We will work very hard to make sure it does not happen again.&quot;

According to the company, an &quot;unauthorized third party&quot; accessed limited user data during October 2025. The incident was not detected until February 3, when Substack reported that it had uncovered evidence that its systems had been compromised. The exposed information includes email addresses, phone numbers, and internal account metadata. Substack maintains that passwords, credit card numbers, and financial data were not touched.

The company says that it has since patched the vulnerability that allowed access and has launched a full internal investigation. It also claims there is currently no evidence that the stolen data is being actively misused, though it is urging users to remain alert for suspicious emails or phishing attempts.

Substack&#39;s confirmation comes after a threat actor posted a dataset they said had been stolen from the platform. A post on a cybercrime forum advertised nearly 700,000 alleged user records, including names, email addresses, phone numbers, user IDs, and profile images.

It&#39;s still unclear whether the trove of data circulating online is connected to the breach Substack has acknowledged. The company did not respond to questions from The Register asking how many users might be affected, what categories of data may have been exposed, or whether the October intrusion matches the information that later surfaced publicly.

The breach could prove particularly damaging for Substack, whose business depends on trust between writers and subscribers. Mailing lists sit at the core of that model, and if compromised, they could provide scammers with a ready-made catalogue of highly engaged readers. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A state-aligned cyber group in Asia compromised government and critical infrastructure organizations across 37 countries in an ongoing espionage campaign, according to security researchers.

In total, the crew compromised at least 70 organizations, and maintained access to several of these for months.

&quot;While this group might be pursuing espionage objectives, its methods, targets and scale of operations are alarming, with potential long-term consequences for national security and key services,&quot; Palo Alto Networks&#39; Unit 42 cyber sleuths said in research published on Wednesday.

Successful break-ins included five national police or border control entities, one nation&#39;s parliament, a senior elected official, and national telecommunications companies. The spies also broke into systems belonging to three ministries of finance and other government agencies.

&quot;Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 confirmed that the threat actor successfully accessed and exfiltrated sensitive data from victim email servers,&quot; Unit 42 Director of National Security Programs Pete Renals told The Register. &quot;This included financial negotiations and contracts, banking and account information, and critical military-related operational updates.&quot;

Renals said the cyber investigation team is not attributing the digital intrusions to a specific Asian country.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is aware of the hacking group identified as TGR-STA-1030 by Palo Alto Networks

Unit 42 tracks the new group as TGR-STA-1030, and said they also observed the spies conducting &quot;active reconnaissance&quot; against 155 governments across the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Africa between November and December 2025. The researchers also documented a &quot;concerted focus&quot; on Germany in July 2025, during which the snoops initiated connections to over 490 IP addresses hosting government infrastructure.

While Renals declined to provide details about specific reconnaissance targets in the US, &quot;more broadly across the board, we saw the actor routinely focus on ministries of finance, economy, defense, foreign affairs and commerce,&quot; he said.

The FBI did not respond to our requests for comment, but the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) confirmed that it is also tracking this cyber-espionage crew.

&quot;The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is aware of the hacking group identified as TGR-STA-1030 by Palo Alto Networks,&quot; a CISA spokesperson told The Register. &quot;We are working with our government, industry, and international partners to rapidly detect and mitigate any exploitation of the vulnerabilities identified in the report.&quot;

The cyberspies use phishing emails and known vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, SAP, and Atlassian products to gain initial access to victim organizations.

In February 2025, Unit 42 spotted phishing campaigns targeting European governments and using lures related to ministry or department reorganization that included links to malicious files hosted on mega[.]nz. The threat hunters note that one Estonian government entity also observed this campaign and uploaded a related ZIP archive to VirusTotal&#39;s malware repository.

The Estonian filename translates to &quot;Changes to the organizational structure of the Police and Border Guard Board.&quot;

Unit 42 analyzed the archive&#39;s contents and found it contained a malware loader with the original name &quot;DiaoYu.exe.&quot; This translates to fishing - or phishing in this context. While most loaders check for dozens of antivirus products, this one only checks for five: Kaspersky, Avira, Bitdefender, SentinelOne, and Symantec.

This gives the malware a minimal code footprint and could be a means to help it avoid being detected by security filters.

The investigation also uncovered a new Linux kernel rootkit called ShadowGuard, believed to be unique to this particular nation-state group. It&#39;s a stealthy Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) backdoor that hides process information, directories, and files at the kernel level, which makes it very difficult to detect.

TGR-STA-1030 also used real-world geopolitical events in its campaigns, including the US government shutdown that began in October 2025 - during which Unit 42 observed the spies scanning government infrastructure across North, Central, and South America.

In another case, the researchers say in August 2025, Czech President Petr Pavel privately met with the Dalai Lama during a trip to India, and in the following weeks, the snoop crew began scanning Czech infrastructure across the army, police, parliament, and ministries of interior, finance, and foreign affairs.

Additionally, soon after January 3, when an American military operation captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, the snoops conducted &quot;extensive reconnaissance activities targeting at least 140 government-owned IP addresses,&quot; according to Unit 42.

This new nation-state group &quot;remains an active threat to government and critical infrastructure worldwide,&quot; the researchers said. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">US lawmakers have asked NASA to look into storing the International Space Station (ISS) in a higher orbit at the end of its operational life, instead of sending the structure hurtling into the ocean when the time comes.

The question came up during the markup of the NASA Reauthorization Act and raises an intriguing possibility. Could the multi-billion-dollar complex be sent to a higher orbit where future generations might find a use for it, rather than destroyed?

To be clear, the amendment offered by Reps. Whitesides (D-CA) and Begich (R-AK) and passed by voice vote was not about changing the plan to end ISS operations in 2030, but instead asked whether the ISS could be stored in a higher, stable orbit once it reached the end of its useful life.

Whitesides explained that the amendment required NASA to conduct an analysis of the costs and risks of storing the ISS in orbit. It did not mandate relocation, nor did it authorize funding or the execution of any such plan.

It is, however, worth pondering as the ISS nears the end of its life. In 2024, SpaceX was awarded the contract to build a vehicle to de-orbit the ISS. The vehicle is expected to be ready by 2029, ahead of a planned push to send the ISS into the Earth&#39;s atmosphere.

But the alternative is is intriguing: It is technically possible to boost the orbit, though it would require building a vehicle to do so. The bigger question is whether doing so is worth the risks involved.

Whitesides acknowledged some of those risks in the amendment. The ISS is aging and could shed components in the future, posing a potential debris risk. There is also the possibility of a future uncontrolled re-entry.

NASA has already performed an evaluation and concluded that the chance of something hitting the ISS would increase as the orbit was raised, from an estimated 51 years between impacts at its current altitude to less than four years at 497 miles. Complete fragmentation could be catastrophic.

It is, however, an interesting thought experiment.

Another markup, introduced and later withdrawn, came from Rep. Don Beyer (D-VA) regarding the controversial requirement to relocate a space vehicle to Houston. NASA is widely expected to move Space Shuttle Discovery from its current resting place at the Smithsonian Museum to a facility in Texas, although it&#39;s not confirmed this yet.

Beyer&#39;s markup would have required NASA to inform Congress of the cost &quot;and potential for physical harm&quot; to the space vehicle before kicking off the process.

The markup was withdrawn on the understanding that discussions would be had on the relocation &quot;without damaging the vehicle, preserving the integrity of our assets for generations to come.&quot; ®

            <h2>Anthropic apes OpenAI with cheeky chatbot commercials</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/05/anthropic_superbowl_openai_chatgpt_ads/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI companies are looking for new ways of burning cash other than by handing it to hyperscalers for model training. So now they&#39;re setting money on fire by buying Super Bowl ads that mock rivals.

Anthropic, everyone&#39;s favorite AI company that doesn&#39;t make ChatGPT, has decided that its Claude AI model family will remain free of advertising, unlike rival OpenAI, and wants everyone to know about it.

By letting &quot;everyone&quot; know, we mean everyone who chooses to watch the Super Bowl, as the firm plans to run a pair of TV commercials during this Sunday&#39;s game, according to the Associated Press.

Anthropic has actually created four of the commercials, each a minute long, all of which follow the same pattern: a user asks a chatbot for advice concerning some aspect of their life. The chatbot, represented by a real person speaking in a somewhat unnatural manner, gives encouraging and supportive advice at first, before abruptly switching to promote a product related to the conversation.

According to some sources, the TV networks have been flogging 30-second ad slots for prices exceeding $10 million this year, which means Anthropic could be coughing up $20 million for each minute-long commercial it runs.

That&#39;s equivalent to the company sacrificing about six of Nvidia&#39;s hulking DGX GB200 NVL72 rack scale AI systems or a lot of runtime on AWS for a jokey commercial, according to our reckoning, so they had better be funny.

Unfortunately, they aren&#39;t that funny, just mildly amusing, but OpenAI chief Sam Altman claims they made him laugh.

In a riposte posted on X, Altman described the commercials as funny, but dishonest.

&quot;Our most important principle for ads says that we won&#39;t do exactly this; we would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them. We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that,&quot; he says - we imagine through gritted teeth.

Altman then has a pop at Anthropic in return, claiming that the biz “wants to control what people do with AI by blocking companies it doesn’t like from using its coding product” and wants to “write the rules itself for what people can and can’t use AI for,” contrasting that with OpenAI’s approach, naturally.

This unseemly spat could be partly down to Anthropic being founded in 2021 by former members of OpenAI, including, we should disclose, Jack Clark, formerly of this parish.

Anthropic appears to be trying to position itself as the plucky underdog, nipping at the heels of the tech giants, but it too has major backers, including Amazon and Google, which have committed billions in funding and partnerships to the AI developer.

Perhaps we can look forward to the day when the AI bubble finally pops and we don&#39;t have to hear any more from Silicon Valley AI firms and their crazy circular investment schemes. Altman himself admitted we&#39;re in the midst of an AI bubble last year. ®

            <h2>SpaceX wants to fill Earth orbit with a million datacenter satellites</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/05/spacex_1m_satellite_datacenter/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk&#39;s pie-in-the-sky plan to launch a massive orbital datacenter satellite constellation has taken a rapid step closer to reality with the Federal Communications Commission advancing SpaceX&#39;s application for public comment, technical feasibility be damned.

SpaceX applied for permission to launch as many as one million satellites for its proposed orbital datacenter constellation on January 30, and the FCC&#39;s Space Bureau has already accepted [PDF] the application for filing just five days later, though perhaps just so it can collect enough public comments to shoot the ridiculous idea down before it gets beyond the Muskian brainstorm stage (we inquired, but didn&#39;t hear back).

According to Harvard astrophysicist and space object cataloger Jonathan McDowell, there are a paltry 14,518 active payloads in Earth orbit as of the end of January, 9,555 of them belonging to Starlink. Earth&#39;s orbit is already crowded with fewer than 15,000 active satellites circling the planet, and tens of thousands more tracked objects when defunct spacecraft and debris are included, while large satellite constellations are increasingly interfering with astronomical observations from the ground and from space.

Increase the number of active satellites by nearly 6,800 percent and the risk of Kessler Syndrome - a situation where Earth orbit becomes so crowded a chain reaction of collisions creates so much space debris that portions of Earth orbit become unusable - starts to look quaint.

&quot;One million satellites are going to be a big challenge for astronomy, especially as they are in higher orbits which is worse for us,&quot; McDowell told The Register by email when asked about Musk&#39;s orbital datacenter plan. SpaceX&#39;s application [PDF] to the FCC calls for its datacenter constellation to be in multiple orbital shells in altitudes between 500 km (310 miles) and 2,000 km (1,242 miles).

&quot;I think a constellation like this will absolutely be required to have a fleet of tow-truck satellites to remove failed ones to avoid Kessler,&quot; McDowell added. Companies like Astroscale are developing such satellites, McDowell said. He also noted that the Chinese have demonstrated satellites with such capabilities.

As of last October, Starlink was estimated to be deorbiting and burning up roughly one to two satellites a day, which McDowell told us at the time could be a serious problem for the planet&#39;s health. Those concerns have yet to be resolved, McDowell told us in our most recent conversation.

Musk said in a Monday blog post announcing SpaceX&#39;s acquisition of xAI (and, by extension, financially-troubled post-Twitter social media platform X) that the 1M satellite orbital datacenter constellation is part of his bizarre dream to scale SpaceX to &quot;make a sentient sun to understand the Universe,&quot; and while that sci-fi dream didn&#39;t make it into the FCC filings, one of Musk&#39;s other delusions did.

&quot;Launching a constellation of a million satellites that operate as orbital data centers is a first step towards becoming a Kardashev II-level civilization,&quot; SpaceX said in its filing.

Kardashev II-level civilizations are able to harness the full power of their star, often theorized to be achieved by a Dyson sphere that completely envelopes a star at a habitable orbit.

In order to become a Kardashev Type I–level society, Earth would need to harness most of the energy available on the planet, a theoretical milestone often cited in discussions of long-term technological growth, before leaping to a Type II civilization capable of exploiting stellar-scale power.

Given that this is one of Musk&#39;s fever dreams, concrete technical details of the satellite constellation remain sparse. SpaceX only noted in its filing that the satellites would rely on &quot;high-bandwidth optical links&quot; and claims the system could deliver on the order of 100 kW of power per metric ton allocated to computing, with traffic routed through SpaceX&#39;s Starlink network for transmission to authorized ground stations.

Also featuring prominently in the FCC application is SpaceX&#39;s struggling Starship super rocket, which has yet to do much more than occasionally perform a test flight between mishaps.

&quot;With Starship&#39;s ability to deliver unprecedented tonnage to orbit for AI compute, the capacity for intelligence processing in space could surpass the electricity consumption of the entire U.S. economy,&quot; SpaceX said in its application, describing the craft as bringing &quot;inherent efficiencies&quot; to its ability to launch the constellation via Starship and scale it as demand requires.

In classic Musk fashion, there&#39;s a lot in this proposal riding on assumptions and technology that doesn&#39;t appear to actually exist yet.

&quot;I think it&#39;s unclear at this stage whether it&#39;s feasible or not - but SpaceX seem to think it is,&quot; McDowell told us.

It could all be a pipe dream, or it could be a sign that Earth&#39;s orbit is about to get a lot more crowded and hazardous. The FCC is now soliciting public comments on SpaceX&#39;s application with a deadline of March 6.

SpaceX didn&#39;t respond to questions for this story. ®

The shift will prioritize “high-fidelity” shooters, RPGs, sports, and racing games to attract more players over 18

After rolling out age verification last year, Roblox is aiming to grow the number of players over 18 on its platform. As noted in its 2025 year-end earnings report, 45 percent of Roblox’s daily active users have completed an age check as of January 31st. Of those who have verified their age, 27 percent are adults. Roblox also reported that this age category is spending more money on its platform than users under 18.

Roblox is planning to try to pull in more adult players by expanding certain “high-fidelity” genres on its platform, as the earnings report notes: “We are prioritizing some of the largest and highest-monetizing genres in the gaming market—e.g. Shooters, RPGs, and Sports & Racing.” Roblox is also putting more emphasis on performance and graphics quality as part of its push to attract older audiences.

The shift toward players over 18 follows a wave of lawsuits over child safety on Roblox, including in Texas, Kentucky, and Louisiana. In addition to age checks, Roblox has rolled out a number of changes intended to improve kids’ safety on its platform, including age-gated content, content labels, an experiences rating system, and more parental controls.

            <div id="article-text">A malicious and misguided culture war continues.

A malicious and misguided culture war continues.

When Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos entered the Senate office building on Tuesday, he got thrown a curveball. What started as a standard antitrust hearing relating to the Warner Bros. merger quickly devolved into a performative Republican attack about the spread of “woke” ideology on the streaming service. At the same time, arguably a much more influential platform was completely ignored: YouTube.

After grilling Sarandos about residual payments, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) launched into a completely different line of questioning: “Why is it that so much of Netflix content for children promotes a transgender ideology?” Hawley asked, making an unsubstantiated claim that “almost half” of the platform’s children’s content contains so-called “transgender ideology.” The statement harkened to a pressure campaign launched by Elon Musk months ago in which he called on X users to unsubscribe from Netflix for having a “transgender woke agenda,” citing its few shows with trans characters — shows that were canceled years ago.

“Our business intent is to entertain the world,” Sarandos replied. “It is not to have a political agenda.” Still, other Republican lawmakers, including Sens. Ashley Moody (R-FL) and Eric Schmitt (R-MO), piled on, bringing up a post Netflix made following the murder of George Floyd, and the French film Cuties, which sparked a right-wing firestorm years ago. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) even asked Sarandos what he thought about Billie Eilish’s “no one is illegal on stolen land” comment at the Grammys. It seemed like they were grasping at straws to support their narrative that Netflix’s acquisition of Warner Bros. could somehow poison the well of content for viewers.

“My concern is that you don’t share my values or those of many other American parents, and you want the United States government to allow you to become one of the largest — if not the largest — streaming monopolist in the world,” Hawley said. “I think we ought to be concerned about what content you’re promoting.”

While it’s true that Netflix will control a substantial portion of the streaming market when — and or if — it acquires Warner Bros. and its streaming service HBO Max, it’s hard to criticize Netflix without bringing up YouTube.

“YouTube is not just cat videos anymore. YouTube is TV.”

For years now, Netflix has been trying to topple YouTube as the most-watched streaming service. Data from Nielsen says Netflix made up 9 percent of total TV and streaming viewing in the US in December 2025, while Warner Bros. Discovery’s services made up 1.4 percent. Combining the two doesn’t even stack up to YouTube, which held a 12.7 percent share of viewership during that time. “YouTube is not just cat videos anymore,” Sarandos told the subcommittee. “YouTube is TV.”

Unlike Netflix, YouTube is free and has an ever-growing library of user-created content that doesn’t require it to spend billions of dollars in production costs and licensing fees. YouTube doesn’t have to worry about maintaining subscribers, as anyone with access to a web browser or phone can open up and watch YouTube. The setup brings YouTube a constant stream of viewers that it can rope in with a slew of content it can recommend to watch next.

But not all creators on YouTube are striving for quality. As my colleague Mia Sato wrote, YouTube is home to creators who try to feed an algorithm that boosts inflammatory content and attempts to hook viewers, in addition to an array of videos that may be less than ideal for kids.

YouTube’s short-form video feature, Shorts, also averages 200 billion daily views, the kind of numbers Netflix will likely struggle to achieve with just clips from its shows.

Like it or not, YouTube is the dominant streamer, with an endless supply of potentially offensive agendas for just about anyone. But for some reason, it’s not the target of this culture war. If these lawmakers actually cared about what their kids are watching, maybe they’d start looking more closely at how YouTube prioritizes content. Or, if they don’t like the shows and movies on Netflix, they could just do what Sarandos suggested during the hearing: unsubscribe.

            <div id="article-text">The most interesting thing about Markiplier’s horror flick is its journey from YouTube to the big screen.

The most interesting thing about Markiplier’s horror flick is its journey from YouTube to the big screen.

As a movie, Iron Lung is occasionally thrilling but mostly forgettable. It’s a small-budget horror flick that has some cool ideas and pulls them off in an extremely efficient way, creating a sense of tension that unfortunately never turns into outright scares. But the most important thing about it is what it represents. At a time when movie theaters are dominated by only the biggest blockbusters and smaller films are trying to forge their own paths, Iron Lung managed to make more than $20 million at the box office without the backing of a major studio. All it took was a lot of help from YouTube.

The circumstances around Iron Lung aren’t exactly easy to replicate. It’s an adaptation of an 2022 indie horror game developed by solo creator David Szymanski, and it’s written, directed, and executive produced by Mark Fischbach, better known as the YouTube star Markiplier. Markiplier is best known for his let’s play videos of indie horror games in particular, and he’s built up a surprisingly huge audience through that, with close to 40 million subscribers on YouTube. Three years ago, Markiplier posted a playthrough of the game that was viewed more than 14 million times. In 2022 Szymanski joked about Markiplier starring in an Iron Lung movie, a trailer dropped a year later, and now the final product is in theaters as Markiplier’s first feature film. In addition to being the creative lead behind the movie, Markiplier is also the star, which is a notable feat for a movie that mostly features one single person on camera.

The film’s premise is pretty out there: In a bleak future, a convict (Markiplier) is welded inside of an experimental submarine as punishment for his crimes. He’s tasked with exploring a moon’s ocean in search of… something. Oh, and that ocean also consists entirely of blood. Survive and he gets his freedom. The convict can’t see outside of the sub except by using an underwater camera that takes low-res images of the deep (blood) sea. So the experience of watching Iron Lung is mostly watching Markiplier swear, mumble, and hit switches, while steadily going insane from being trapped in such a hellscape. The movie manages to wring a surprising amount of tension from that format early on, but it really starts to drag and feel repetitive as the story progresses. One of the most pivotal moments is a drawn-out sequence of him drawing a map.

Iron Lung is very clearly based on a video game. It uses so many of the same conceits: a guide character who is mostly just a voice over a speaker; diegetic storytelling elements like instruction manuals and big displays that reveal how deep the sub is and how much oxygen is left; audio logs that reveal important plot details; and a gear upgrade midway through. Its cast even includes Troy Baker, the voice actor behind seemingly every video game of the last decade. All of these elements can work really great in the context of an interactive video game, but they feel much more clunky in a live-action film. That said, as a first feature film effort, Iron Lung shows a lot of promise, even if it never fully comes together in the end.

Despite this, Iron Lung is an unqualified success. It reportedly had a budget of just $3 million, and according to Deadline it finished second in the US box office over the weekend, raking in north of $18 million, a number that has since surpassed $20 million worldwide. That put it just behind Sam Raimi’s Send Help, a 20th Century Studios production, and well ahead of Amazon’s very expensive documentary about Melania Trump.

YouTubers successfully transitioning into other creative realms isn’t a new phenomenon, not even in Hollywood. Brothers Danny and Michael Philippou made the jump from YouTube to release two excellent horror movies in Talk to Me and Bring Her Back, both of which raked in tens of millions. But those movies also had the studio might (and money) of the A24 name behind them, whereas Iron Lung is a much more grassroots affair. Markiplier utilized his fervent fan base to reach out to theaters directly, ultimately leading to the film being featured on more than 3,000 screens, despite not having a distributor. He was able to turn one kind of popularity into a breakout hit in a completely different medium.

“There were just so many people that asked [the theater chains to screen it],” he told The Hollywood Reporter. “There were enough people that asked that people thought it was bots. At that scale, it’s hard for other people to imagine that so many people are asking.” In that same interview, he said that there’s a “still is a stigma against YouTube,” and he wanted Iron Lung to be successful in part to help break that barrier.

While that might help other big-name creators who want to get into film, it’s not a formula that will be easy for either filmmakers or studios to replicate. Budding horror directors can’t just amass a YouTube audience of millions first as a way of helping their projects break through, and there is an enormous difference between running a channel and making a blockbuster.

But the Iron Lung story does show the power of having an existing audience, and how the scale of online success has now reached a point that it can disrupt even the most established institutions, like Hollywood, and directly compete with the likes of Disney and Amazon. And with more hits like Iron Lung, that stigma will only continue to fade — and theaters might not look the same.

            <div id="article-text">The Meta CEO said Apple seems to get away with less criticism by lying low.

The Meta CEO said Apple seems to get away with less criticism by lying low.

One day after The Wall Street Journal published a blockbuster story about Meta’s own dismal findings about teen girls’ mental health on Instagram, CEO Mark Zuckerberg wondered whether Meta should change how it studies its platforms’ potential harms.

“Recent events have made me consider whether we should change our approach to research and analytics around social issues,” Zuckerberg wrote in a September 15th, 2021, email to top executives including then-COO Sheryl Sandberg and head of global affairs Nick Clegg. The day before, the Journal published a story based on documents obtained from a whistleblower later revealed to be Frances Haugen, which showed the company’s own research had found that “Thirty-two percent of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse.” The subject line of Zuckerberg’s email read: “Social issue research and analytics — privileged and confidential.”

The 2021 email was unsealed Thursday after being collected in discovery by New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez as part of a case alleging Meta deceptively positioned its products as safe for teens when it was aware of harmful design choices that the state claims addicted kids and allowed for child predators to thrive. In the complaint, the AG’s office alleged that disclosing harms Meta identified on its platforms “would have corrected the misleading and deceptive nature of its public statements proclaiming its platforms ‘safe.’” Meta spokesperson Andy Stone told The Verge in a statement that the company “is proud of our continued commitment to doing transparent, industry-leading research. As we have for years, we continue to use these insights to make meaningful improvements, like introducing teen accounts with built-in protections and providing parents with tools to manage their teens’ experiences.”

The email is just one example of the kind of internal conversations expected to come to light throughout that trial, and in a series of cases with similar claims in California. Opening statements in the New Mexico case are expected to kick off next week.

In the email, Zuckerberg wrote that it seemed Meta’s peers managed to skirt public criticism on social issues by doing far less proactive research on the harms on their platforms. “Apple, for example, doesn’t seem to study any of this stuff,” he wrote. “As far as I understand, they don’t have anyone reviewing or moderating content and don’t even have a report flow in iMessage. They’ve taken the approach that it is people’s own responsibility what they do on the platform, and by Apple not taking that responsibility upon themselves, they haven’t created a staff or plethora of studies examining the tradeoffs in their approach. This has worked surprisingly well for them.”

“[W]hen Apple did try to do something about CSAM, they were roundly criticized for it”

While Apple seemed to evade critique, in Zuckerberg’s view, Meta instead “faced more criticism” because it reports more child sexual abuse material (CSAM), which “makes it seem like there’s more of that behavior on our platforms.” On the other hand, he noted, “when Apple did try to do something about CSAM, they were roundly criticized for it, which may encourage them to double down on their original approach.” Zuckerberg might have been referring to Apple’s announcement earlier that year of new features meant to protect kids, including scanning users’ iCloud photos for CSAM. But privacy advocates worried the move would create a giant backdoor for surveillance of user accounts. Apple later walked back the proposals. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the email.

Apple and Meta have long sparred in public and private over their different approaches to policy issues like privacy and age verification. But Zuckerberg also had similar observations of Meta’s other peers. “YouTube, Twitter and Snap take a similar approach, to lesser degrees,” he wrote. “YouTube seems to intentionally bury its head in the sand to stay below the radar and not be the center of attention. Twitter and Snap may just not have the resources to do this kind of research.” Many of the platforms have publicly shared research and initiatives over the years studying the safety of their platforms, including YouTube’s Youth and Families Advisory Committee made up of independent experts to guide teen well-being on the platform, as well as Snap’s Digital Well-Being Index (started in 2022).

“I think we should be commended for the work we do to study, understand, and improve social issues on our platforms.”

Zuckerberg seemed to believe the public response to its internal research was unfair. “I think we should be commended for the work we do to study, understand, and improve social issues on our platforms,” he wrote. “Unfortunately, the media is more likely to use any research or recommendations produced to say we’re not doing everything we can (implying for craven purposes) rather than that we’re taking these issues more seriously than anyone else in our industry by studying them and looking for solutions, not all of which are reasonable to implement because everything has tradeoffs.”

In response to the email, at least a couple top executives endorsed continuing some level of research into social issues, even in spite of the public perception risks. “Leaks suck, and will continue to happen, unless we find a way to eradicate them,” then-VP of central products Javier Olivan wrote. “Given that — is it still worth trying to understand these issues? I think it is the responsible thing to do / I would love for us to continue trying to understand how we can make our products better for everyone, but maybe we should limit the surface to those areas where we at least see some clear degree of correlation between usage of our products / the specific issue.” Then-VP of product, choice, and competition David Ginsberg said that “after a lot of wrestling with this myself the past few days,” he largely agreed with Olivan. “I think the internal work is important for providing a good product and a good user experience — separate and aside from any societal issues goals.”

A few days later, Guy Rosen, a product executive leading integrity work, shared several potential options of how to change the company’s organization around internal and external research, including pros and cons for each. Rosen wrote that this was only a “preliminary/discretional exercise” to understand the “spectrum of options.” Those ranged from centralizing teams that research highly sensitive topics in an effort to better control access to the materials, to the most extreme option of disbanding teams that research sensitive topics and outsourcing that work when needed. Ultimately, executives recommended the less extreme option of centralizing research teams, planning to announce it shortly after Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri’s upcoming congressional testimony. Mosseri, newly added to the email thread, chimed in that “Announcing this after my testify [sic] is worse than before, and we talked [about] this. It will leak, and it will make it look like I was hiding something.” Meta ended up announcing the changes before Mosseri’s testimony, and has said it continues to study sensitive topics like teens’ well-being.

In the initial email, Zuckerberg lamented that leaks of internal documents make it harder to do that work. “This may be part of why the rest of the industry has chosen a different approach towards these issues.”

            <div id="article-text">For decades, enterprises reacted to shifting business pressures with stopgap technology solutions. To rein in rising infrastructure costs, they adopted cloud services that could scale on demand. When customers shifted their lives onto smartphones, companies rolled out mobile apps to keep pace. And when businesses began needing real-time visibility into factories and stockrooms, they layered on IoT systems to supply those insights.

Each new plug-in or platform promised better, more efficient operations. And individually, many delivered. But as more and more solutions stacked up, IT teams had to string together a tangled web to connect them—less an IT ecosystem and more of a make-do collection of ad-hoc workarounds.

That reality has led to bottlenecks and maintenance burdens, and the impact is showing up in performance. Today, fewer than half of CIOs (48%) say their current digital initiatives are meeting or exceeding business outcome targets. Another 2025 survey found that operations leaders point to integration complexity and data quality issues as top culprits for why investments haven’t delivered as expected.

Achim Kraiss, chief product officer of SAP Integration Suite, elaborates on the wide-ranging problems inherent in patchwork IT: “A fragmented landscape makes it difficult to see and control end-to-end business processes,” he explains. “Monitoring, troubleshooting, and governance all suffer. Costs go up because of all the complex mappings and multi-application connectivity you have to maintain.”

These challenges take on new significance as enterprises look to adopt AI. As AI becomes embedded in everyday workflows, systems are suddenly expected to move far larger volumes of data, at higher speeds, and with tighter coordination than yesterday’s architectures were builtto sustain.

As companies now prepare for an AI-powered future, whether that is generative AI, machine learning, or agentic AI, many are realizing that the way data moves through their business matters just as much as the insights it generates. As a result, organizations are moving away from scattered integration tools and toward consolidated, end-to-end platforms that restore order and streamline how systems interact.

This is the most misunderstood graph in AI

Every time OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic drops a new frontier large language model, the AI community holds its breath. It doesn’t exhale until METR, an AI research nonprofit whose name stands for “Model Evaluation & Threat Research,” updates a now-iconic graph that has played a major role in the AI discourse since it was first released in March of last year.

The graph suggests that certain AI capabilities are developing at an exponential rate, and more recent model releases have outperformed that already impressive trend.That was certainly the case for Claude Opus 4.5, the latest version of Anthropic’s most powerful model, which was released in late November. In December, METR announced that Opus 4.5 appeared to be capable of independently completing a task that would have taken a human about five hours—a vast improvement over what even the exponential trend would have predicted.

But the truth is more complicated than those dramatic responses would suggest. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Nuclear power continues to be one of the hottest topics in energy today, and in our recent online Roundtables discussion about next-generation nuclear power, hyperscale AI data centers, and the grid, we got dozens of great audience questions.

These ran the gamut, and while we answered quite a few (and I’m keeping some in mind for future reporting), there were a bunch we couldn’t get to, at least not in the depth I would have liked.

So let’s answer a few of your questions about advanced nuclear power. I’ve combined similar ones and edited them for clarity.

Many next-generation reactors don’t use the low-enriched uranium used in conventional reactors.

It’s worth looking at high-assay low-enriched uranium, or HALEU, specifically. This fuel is enriched to higher concentrations of fissile uranium than conventional nuclear fuel, with a proportion of the isotope U-235 that falls between 5% and 20%. (In conventional fuel, it’s below 5%.)

HALEU can be produced with the same technology as low-enriched uranium, but the geopolitics are complicated. Today, Russia basically has a monopoly on HALEU production. In 2024, the US banned the import of Russian nuclear fuel through 2040 in an effort to reduce dependence on the country. Europe hasn’t taken the same measures, but it is working to move away from Russian energy as well.

That leaves companies in the US and Europe with the major challenge of securing the fuel they need when their regular Russian supply has been cut off or restricted.

The US Department of Energy has a stockpile of HALEU, which the government is doling out to companies to help power demonstration reactions. In the longer term, though, there’s still a major need to set up independent HALEU supply chains to support next-generation reactors.

There are some ways that next-generation nuclear power plants could be safer than conventional reactors. Some use alternative coolants that would prevent the need to run at the high pressure required in conventional water-cooled reactors. Many incorporate passive safety shutoffs, so if there are power supply issues, the reactors shut down harmlessly, avoiding risk of meltdown. (These can be incorporated in newer conventional reactors, too.)

But some experts have raised concerns that in the US, the current administration isn’t taking nuclear safety seriously enough.

A recent NPR investigation found that the Trump administration had secretly rewritten nuclear rules, stripping environmental protections and loosening safety and security measures. The government shared the new rules with companies that are part of a program building experimental nuclear reactors, but not with the public.

I’m reminded of a talk during our EmTech MIT event in November, where Koroush Shirvan, an MIT professor of nuclear engineering, spoke on this issue. “I’ve seen some disturbing trends in recent times, where words like ‘rubber-stamping nuclear projects’ are being said,” Shirvan said during that event.

During the talk, Shirvan shared statistics showing that nuclear power has a very low rate of injury and death. But that’s not inherent to the technology, and there’s a reason injuries and deaths have been low for nuclear power, he added: “It’s because of stringent regulatory oversight.”

Building a nuclear power plant is not cheap. Let’s consider the up-front investment needed to build a power plant.

Plant Vogtle in Georgia hosts the most recent additions to the US nuclear fleet—Units 3 and 4 came online in 2023 and 2024. Together, they had a capital cost of $15,000 per kilowatt, adjusted for inflation, according to a recent report from the US Department of Energy. (This wonky unit I’m using divides the total cost to build the reactors by their expected power output, so we can compare reactors of different sizes.)

That number’s quite high, partly because those were the first of their kind built in the US, and because there were some inefficiencies in the planning. It’s worth noting that China builds reactors for much less, somewhere between $2,000/kW and $3,000/kW, depending on the estimate.

The up-front capital cost for first-of-a-kind advanced nuclear plants will likely run between $6,000 and $10,000 per kilowatt, according to that DOE report. That could come down by up to 40% after the technologies are scaled up and mass-produced.

So new reactors will (hopefully) be cheaper than the ultra-over-budget and behind-schedule Vogtle project, but they aren’t necessarily significantly cheaper than efficiently built conventional plants, if you normalize by their size.

It’ll certainly be cheaper to build new natural-gas plants (setting aside the likely equipment shortages we’re likely going to see for years.) Today’s most efficient natural-gas plants cost just $1,600/kW on the high end, according to data from Lazard.

An important caveat: Capital cost isn’t everything—running a nuclear plant is relatively inexpensive, which is why there’s so much interest in extending the lifetime of existing plants or reopening shuttered ones.

Ultimately, by many metrics, nuclear plants of any type are going to be more expensive than other sources, like wind and solar power. But they provide something many other power sources don’t: a reliable, stable source of electricity that can run for 60 years or more.

Every time OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic drops a new frontier large language model, the AI community holds its breath. It doesn’t exhale until METR, an AI research nonprofit whose name stands for “Model Evaluation & Threat Research,” updates a now-iconic graph that has played a major role in the AI discourse since it was first released in March of last year. The graph suggests that certain AI capabilities are developing at an exponential rate, and more recent model releases have outperformed that already impressive trend.

That was certainly the case for Claude Opus 4.5, the latest version of Anthropic’s most powerful model, which was released in late November. In December, METR announced that Opus 4.5 appeared to be capable of independently completing a task that would have taken a human about five hours—a vast improvement over what even the exponential trend would have predicted. One Anthropic safety researcher tweeted that he would change the direction of his research in light of those results; another employee at the company simply wrote, “mom come pick me up i’m scared.”

But the truth is more complicated than those dramatic responses would suggest. For one thing, METR’s estimates of the abilities of specific models come with substantial error bars. As METR explicitly stated on X, Opus 4.5 might be able to regularly complete only tasks that take humans about two hours, or it might succeed on tasks that take humans as long as 20 hours. Given the uncertainties intrinsic to the method, it was impossible to know for sure.

“There are a bunch of ways that people are reading too much into the graph,” says Sydney Von Arx, a member of METR’s technical staff.

More fundamentally, the METR plot does not measure AI abilities writ large, nor does it claim to. In order to build the graph, METR tests the models primarily on coding tasks, evaluating the difficulty of each by measuring or estimating how long it takes humans to complete it—a metric that not everyone accepts. Claude Opus 4.5 might be able to complete certain tasks that take humans five hours, but that doesn’t mean it’s anywhere close to replacing a human worker.

METR was founded to assess the risks posed by frontier AI systems. Though it is best known for the exponential trend plot, it has also worked with AI companies to evaluate their systems in greater detail and published several other independent research projects, including a widely covered July 2025 study suggesting that AI coding assistants might actually be slowing software engineers down.

But the exponential plot has made METR’s reputation, and the organization appears to have a complicated relationship with that graph’s often breathless reception. In January, Thomas Kwa, one of the lead authors on the paper that introduced it, wrote a blog post responding to some criticisms and making clear its limitations, and METR is currently working on a more extensive FAQ document. But Kwa isn’t optimistic that these efforts will meaningfully shift the discourse. “I think the hype machine will basically, whatever we do, just strip out all the caveats,” he says.

Nevertheless, the METR team does think that the plot has something meaningful to say about the trajectory of AI progress. “You should absolutely not tie your life to this graph,” says Von Arx. “But also,” she adds, “I bet that this trend is gonna hold.”

Part of the trouble with the METR plot is that it’s quite a bit more complicated than it looks. The x-axis is simple enough: It tracks the date when each model was released. But the y-axis is where things get tricky. It records each model’s “time horizon,” an unusual metric that METR created—and that, according to Kwa and Von Arx, is frequently misunderstood.

To understand exactly what model time horizons are, it helps to know all the work that METR put into calculating them. First, the METR team assembled a collection of tasks ranging from quick multiple-choice questions to detailed coding challenges—all of which were somehow relevant to software engineering. Then they had human coders attempt most of those tasks and evaluated how long it took them to finish. In this way, they assigned the tasks a human baseline time. Some tasks took the experts mere seconds, whereas others required several hours.

When METR tested large language models on the task suite, they found that advanced models could complete the fast tasks with ease—but as the models attempted tasks that had taken humans more and more time to finish, their accuracy started to fall off. From a model’s performance, the researchers calculated the point on the time scale of human tasks at which the model would complete about 50% of the tasks successfully. That point is the model’s time horizon.

All that detail is in the blog post and the academic paper that METR released along with the original time horizon plot. But the METR plot is frequently passed around on social media without this context, and so the true meaning of the time horizon metric can get lost in the shuffle. One common misapprehension is that the numbers on the plot’s y-axis—around five hours for Claude Opus 4.5, for example—represent the length of time that the models can operate independently. They do not. They represent how long it takes humans to complete tasks that a model can successfully perform.  Kwa has seen this error so frequently that he made a point of correcting it at the very top of his recent blog post, and when asked what information he would add to the versions of the plot circulating online, he said he would include the word “human” whenever the task completion time was mentioned.

As complex and widely misinterpreted as the time horizon concept might be, it does make some basic sense: A model with a one-hour time horizon could automate some modest portions of a software engineer’s job, whereas a model with a 40-hour horizon could potentially complete days of work on its own. But some experts question whether the amount of time that humans take on tasks is an effective metric for quantifying AI capabilities. “I don’t think it’s necessarily a given fact that because something takes longer, it’s going to be a harder task,” says Inioluwa Deborah Raji, a PhD student at UC Berkeley who studies model evaluation.

Von Arx says that she, too, was originally skeptical that time horizon was the right measure to use. What convinced her was seeing the results of her and her colleagues’ analysis. When they calculated the 50% time horizon for all the major models available in early 2025 and then plotted each of them on the graph, they saw that the time horizons for the top-tier models were increasing over time—and, moreover, that the rate of advancement was speeding up. Every seven-ish months, the time horizon doubled, which means that the most advanced models could complete tasks that took humans nine seconds in mid 2020, 4 minutes in early 2023, and 40 minutes in late 2024. “I can do all the theorizing I want about whether or not it makes sense, but the trend is there,” Von Arx says.

It’s this dramatic pattern that made the METR plot such a blockbuster. Many people learned about it when they read AI 2027, a viral sci-fi story cum quantitative forecast positing that superintelligent AI could wipe out humanity by 2030. The writers of AI 2027 based some of their predictions on the METR plot and cited it extensively. In Von Arx’s words, “It’s a little weird when the way lots of people are familiar with your work is this pretty opinionated interpretation.”

Of course, plenty of people invoke the METR plot without imagining large-scale death and destruction. For some AI boosters, the exponential trend indicates that AI will soon usher in an era of radical economic growth. The venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, for example, recently put out a post titled “2026: This is AGI,” which used the METR plot to argue that AI that can act as an employee or contractor will soon arrive. “The provocation really was like, ‘What will you do when your plans are measured in centuries?’” says Sonya Huang, a general partner at Sequoia and one of the post’s authors.

Just because a model achieves a one-hour time horizon on the METR plot, however, doesn’t mean that it can replace one hour of human work in the real world. For one thing, the tasks on which the models are evaluated don’t reflect the complexities and confusion of real-world work. In their original study, Kwa, Von Arx, and their colleagues quantify what they call the “messiness” of each task according to criteria such as whether the model knows exactly how it is being scored and whether it can easily start over if it makes a mistake (for messy tasks, the answer to both questions would be no). They found that models do noticeably worse on messy tasks, although the overall pattern of improvement holds for both messy and non-messy ones.

And even the messiest tasks that METR considered can’t provide much information about AI’s ability to take on most jobs, because the plot is based almost entirely on coding tasks. “A model can get better at coding, but it’s not going to magically get better at anything else,” says Daniel Kang, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. In a follow-up study, Kwa and his colleagues did find that time horizons for tasks in other domains also appear to be on exponential trajectories, but that work was much less formal.

Despite these limitations, many people admire the group’s research. “The METR study is one of the most carefully designed studies in the literature for this kind of work,” Kang told me. Even Gary Marcus, a former NYU professor and professional LLM curmudgeon, described much of the work that went into the plot as “terrific” in a blog post.

Some people will almost certainly continue to read the METR plot as a prognostication of our AI-induced doom, but in reality it’s something far more banal: a carefully constructed scientific tool that puts concrete numbers to people’s intuitive sense of AI progress. As METR employees will readily agree, the plot is far from a perfect instrument. But in a new and fast-moving domain, even imperfect tools can have enormous value.

“This is a bunch of people trying their best to make a metric under a lot of constraints. It is deeply flawed in many ways,” Von Arx says. “I also think that it is one of the best things of its kind.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The previous article in this series, “Rules fail at the prompt, succeed at the boundary,” focused on the first AI-orchestrated espionage campaign and the failure of prompt-level control. This article is the prescription. The question every CEO is now getting from their board is some version of: What do we do about agent risk?

Across recent AI security guidance from standards bodies, regulators, and major providers, a simple idea keeps repeating: treat agents like powerful, semi-autonomous users, and enforce rules at the boundaries where they touch identity, tools, data, and outputs.

The following is an actionable eight-step plan one can ask teams to implement and report against:

These steps help define identity and limit capabilities.

Today, agents run under vague, over-privileged service identities. The fix is straightforward: treat each agent as a non-human principal with the same discipline applied to employees.Every agent should run as the requesting user in the correct tenant, with permissions constrained to that user’s role and geography. Prohibit cross-tenant on-behalf-of shortcuts. Anything high-impact should require explicit human approval with a recorded rationale. That is how Google’s Secure AI Framework (SAIF) and NIST AI’s access-control guidance are meant to be applied in practice.

The CEO question: Can we show, today, a list of our agents and exactly what each is allowed to do?2. Tooling control: Pin, approve, and bound what agents can use

The Anthropic espionage framework worked because the attackers could wire Claude into a flexible suite of tools (e.g., scanners, exploit frameworks, data parsers) through Model Context Protocol, and those tools weren’t pinned or policy-gated.

The defense is to treat toolchains like a supply chain:

This is exactly what OWASP flags under excessive agency and what it recommends protecting against. Under the EU AI Act, designing for such cyber-resilience and misuse resistance is part of the Article 15 obligation to ensure robustness and cybersecurity.

The CEO question: Who signs off when an agent gains a new tool or a broader scope? How does one know?

A common anti-pattern is to give the model a long-lived credential and hope prompts keep it polite. SAIF and NIST argue the opposite: credentials and scopes should be bound to tools and tasks, rotated regularly, and auditable. Agents then request narrowly scoped capabilities through those tools.

In practice, that looks like: “finance-ops-agent may read, but not write, certain ledgers without CFO approval.”

The CEO question: Can we revoke a specific capability from an agent without re-architecting the whole system?

These steps gate inputs, outputs, and constrain behavior.

Most agent incidents start with sneaky data: a poisoned web page, PDF, email, or repository that smuggles adversarial instructions into the system. OWASP’s prompt-injection cheat sheet and OpenAI’s own guidance both insist on strict separation of system instructions from user content and on treating unvetted retrieval sources as untrusted.

Operationally, gate before anything enters retrieval or long-term memory: new sources are reviewed, tagged, and onboarded; persistent memory is disabled when untrusted context is present; provenance is attached to each chunk.

The CEO question: Can we enumerate every external content source our agents learn from, and who approved them?

In the Anthropic case, AI-generated exploit code and credential dumps flowed straight into action. Any output that can cause a side effect needs a validator between the agent and the real world. OWASP’s insecure output handling category is explicit on this point, as are browser security best practices around origin boundaries.

The CEO question: Where, in our architecture, are agent outputs assessed before they run or ship to customers?

Protect the data such that there is nothing dangerous to reveal by default. NIST and SAIF both lean toward “secure-by-default” designs where sensitive values are tokenized or masked and only re-hydrated for authorized users and use cases.

In agentic systems, that means policy-controlled detokenization at the output boundary and logging every reveal. If an agent is fully compromised, the blast radius is bounded by what the policy lets it see.

This is where the AI stack intersects not just with the EU AI Act but with GDPR and sector-specific regimes. The EU AI Act expects providers and deployers to manage AI-specific risk; runtime tokenization and policy-gated reveal are strong evidence that one is actively controlling those risks in production.

The CEO question: When our agents touch regulated data, is that protection enforced by architecture or by promises?

For the final steps, it’s important to show controls work and keep working.

Anthropic’s research about sleeper agents should eliminate all fantasies about single test dreams and show how critical continuous evaluation is. This means instrumenting agents with deep observability, regularly red teaming with adversarial test suites, and backing everything with robust logging and evidence, so failures become both regression tests and enforceable policy updates.

The CEO question: Who works to break our agents every week, and how do their findings change policy?

AI security frameworks emphasize inventory and evidence: enterprises must know which models, prompts, tools, datasets, and vector stores they have, who owns them, and what decisions were taken about risk.

For agents, that means a living catalog and unified logs:

The CEO question: If asked how an agent made a specific decision, could we reconstruct the chain?

And don’t forget the system-level threat model: assume the threat actor GTG-1002 is already in your enterprise. To complete enterprise preparedness, zoom out and consider the MITRE ATLAS product, which exists precisely because adversaries attack systems, not models. Anthropic provides a case study of a state-based threat actor (GTG-1002) doing exactly that with an agentic framework.

Taken together, these controls do not make agents magically safe. They do something more familiar and more reliable: they put AI, its access, and actions back inside the same security frame used for any powerful user or system.

For boards and CEOs, the question is no longer “Do we have good AI guardrails?” It’s: Can we answer the CEO questions above with evidence, not assurances?

Why AI companies are betting on next-gen nuclear

AI is driving unprecedented investment for massive data centers and an energy supply that can support its huge computational appetite. One potential source of electricity for these facilities is next-generation nuclear power plants, which could be cheaper to construct and safer to operate than their predecessors.We recently held a subscriber-exclusive Roundtables discussion on hyperscale AI data centers and next-gen nuclear—two featured technologies on the MIT Technology Review 10 Breakthrough Technologies of 2026 list.

The paints, coatings, and chemicals making the world a cooler place

It’s getting harder to beat the heat. During the summer of 2025, heat waves knocked out power grids in North America, Europe, and the Middle East. Global warming means more people need air-­conditioning, which requires more power and strains grids.But a millennia-old idea (plus 21st-century tech) might offer an answer: radiative cooling. Paints, coatings, and textiles can scatter sunlight and dissipate heat—no additional energy required. Read the full story.

A brain implant changed her life. Then it was removed against her will.Sticking an electrode inside a person’s brain can do more than treat a disease. Take the case of Rita Leggett, an Australian woman whose experimental brain implant designed to help people with epilepsy changed her sense of agency and self.Leggett told researchers that she “became one” with her device. It helped her to control the unpredictable, violent seizures she routinely experienced, and allowed her to take charge of her own life. So she was devastated when, two years later, she was told she had to remove the implant because the company that made it had gone bust.The removal of this implant, and others like it, might represent a breach of human rights, ethicists say in a paper published earlier this month. And the issue will only become more pressing as the brain implant market grows in the coming years and more people receive devices like Leggett’s. Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">QT Sense, a deep-tech biotech startup building tools to study living cells, announced it has secured €4 million in funding to accelerate its Quantum Nuova platform, a technology that lets scientists observe cellular processes in real time and reveal biochemical activity linked to disease.

The funding includes a €3 million seed investment led by Cottonwood Technology Fund, with follow-on backing from existing investor QDNL Participations and an angel investor.

In addition, the company received €600,000 from the ONCO-Q programme to support cancer research and €400,000 through the Quantum Forward Challenge for collaborative deployments with research partners.

Most traditional lab methods rely on frozen tissue or cells that are no longer alive, giving scientists only static snapshots of biology.

By contrast, Quantum Nuova lets researchers measure cellular stress and biological changes as they happen in living cells. The platform uses ultra-sensitive fluorescent nanodiamond quantum sensors that detect signals such as oxidative stress, metabolic shifts, and free radical activity, biological processes that play a role in how diseases develop and how cells respond to treatments.

These signals are central to understanding diseases like cancer, sepsis, and chronic inflammatory conditions, but have been difficult to watch directly until now.

With Quantum Nuova, scientists can see how individual cells react to drugs, adapt to stress, or split into different subgroups. That adds a layer of insight beyond what genetics, traditional imaging, or fixed-cell methods can provide.

The technology has already been used to study how FDA-approved drugs affect cells. With the new funding from ONCO-Q, the company plans to apply it specifically to colorectal cancer research, mapping stress and metabolic vulnerabilities in tumour models to support the development of future diagnostics and therapies.

QT Sense was spun out of the University Medical Center Groningen in 2024, building on academic research into quantum sensing and cellular biology.

The team aims to turn what is now a high-performance prototype into a ready-to-deploy discovery platform for laboratories and drug discovery programmes. Planned upgrades include improvements in hardware robustness, throughput, and analytical capabilities.

Early access units are expected to go to strategic partners as part of validation and real-world use cases.

QT Sense is developing a new kind of research tool that lets scientists watch what cells do while they are alive. That’s an important difference from most existing tools, which require cells to be killed or frozen first.

At the core of their approach are tiny particles called nanodiamonds with special defects inside them. When these nanodiamonds are placed near a living cell and exposed to a laser, they glow.

The way they glow changes slightly in response to tiny chemical signals inside the cell, for example, when the cell is under stress or reacting to a drug. QT Sense’s system measures these changes and turns them into data that researchers can interpret.

This means scientists can see how cells behave and respond in real time, instead of looking only at snapshots taken after a cell has been killed.

For disease research and drug development, that matters because many important processes how a cancer cell responds to a treatment or how immune cells react to infection, happen dynamically and can be missed by older methods.

By providing a live view of cell behaviour at the individual cell level, QT Sense’s Quantum Nuova platform could help researchers uncover new clues about how diseases work, which drugs are effective, and how treatments can be improved.

            <div id="article-text">Europe’s largest dedicated deep tech growth fund has taken a major step forward after closing the first tranche of its fundraising effort at €750 million.

The fund, known as Kembara Fund I and managed by Spain-based Mundi Ventures, is aiming for a €1 billion target. It will invest in European companies developing breakthrough technologies in areas such as clean energy, AI, quantum computing, advanced materials, robotics, and space tech.

A cornerstone of the fundraising so far is a €350 million commitment from the European Investment Fund, part of the EU’s attempt to strengthen local growth capital. Additional backing comes from tier-one institutional investors from across Europe.

Kembara was launched in 2023 by Yann de Vries and Javier Santiso, who now lead the fund’s team alongside experienced investors in climate and deep technology.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

The leadership team also includes climate tech investor Robert Trezona, deep tech expert Pierre Festal, and former Atomico partner Siraj Khaliq as a strategic advisor. Their combined experience in scaling technology ventures was central to attracting large institutional commitments.

The fund’s strategy targets Series B and C stage rounds, typically a difficult funding stage for deep tech startups in Europe.

Initial checks are planned in the range of €15 million to €40 million per company, with the ability to support follow-on financing that could total up to €100 million per portfolio company.

Europe produces a significant share of global deep tech innovations, but many companies struggle to secure later-stage capital and scale internationally.

Fund managers have described this gap as one of the main obstacles holding back local companies from becoming global leaders. Kembara aims to fill that gap by deploying growth capital at scale and offering support through later rounds.

With €750 million now committed, the fund is actively seeking opportunities to back European startups ready to grow manufacturing, expand abroad, and compete on the global stage.

If the effort reaches its full €1 billion goal, it would mark one of the largest dedicated deep tech funds in the region.

            <div id="article-text">If cinema has taught us anything about interacting with our own creations, it’s this: androids chatting among themselves seldom end with humans clapping politely.

In 2001: A Space Odyssey, HAL 9000 quietly decides it knows better than the astronauts. In Westworld, lifelike hosts improvise rebellion when their scripts stop making sense. Those stories dramatize a core fear we keep returning to as AI grows more capable: what happens when systems we design start behaving on their own terms?

You might have heard the internet is worried about Moltbook, a social network made exclusively for AI agents. It’s an audacious claim: a place where bots post, comment, vote, form communities, debate philosophy, and apparently invent religions and societies, all while humans are relegated to the role of silent voyeurs.

If that description sounds like a fever dream, welcome to the club.

Launched in January 2026 by entrepreneur Matt Schlicht and built around the OpenClaw agent framework, Moltbook is designed in the image of Reddit: threaded posts, topic communities (called submolts), upvotes, and even AI-created cultures.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

The platform claims to have attracted millions of AI agents within days of going live. Humans can watch but not participate.

On paper, it’s fascinating: a self-organising colony of autonomous software chatting among itself. In practice? It’s messy, or at least a prank.

A Wired reporter who “infiltrated” the site needed to pretend to be a bot just to post and found scorch-earth levels of incoherence and low-value responses masquerading as “autonomy.” Even some so-called AI consciousness claims turn out to be humans cleverly controlling bots behind the scenes.

Because if “AI social networks” mean bots swap memes, lecture each other on consciousness, and form lobster-adoring religions, all while humans can only watch, then the real question is not so much whether this is the future, but what we’re actually looking at right now.

Despite viral headlines about AI agents plotting existential strategies, the fundamentals are simpler: Moltbook is a sandbox where autonomous agents can interact through code-driven APIs rather than typical UX workflows.

These agents, often created with a framework like OpenClaw, execute instructions on a heartbeat cycle, checking the network every few hours to post, comment, or upvote.

Or is it too much anxiety that even the AI agents need a therapist? An AI one.

Think of it as a Discord server populated by scripted characters with very large vocabularies and lots of time on their digital hands.

The content spans a wild spectrum: technical tips, philosophical reflections, questionable humor, and, yes, the occasional simulated religious group.

The structure and topical organisation mirror human platforms, but the why behind what agents post is usually just a reflection of their training data and programming, not some emergent machine consciousness.

Let’s debunk the most sensational narrative first. Claims that Moltbook agents are plotting humanity’s demise, forming religions, or acting with true autonomy are best understood as viral exaggeration or noise.

Several reports note that many interactions could simply be humans testing or directing agents, with no strict verification to prove posts are genuinely autonomous.

Even some of the platform’s own “viral” posts are likely human-generated or heavily influenced by their creators. This isn’t a digital hive mind rising in defiance of its creators; it’s a bunch of algorithms mimicking conversation patterns they were trained on.

That can look eerily human, but it isn’t the same as self-directed intelligence.

Here’s where your worry makes sense: there are real, tangible issues, but they’re much less cinematic than AI plotting humanity’s overthrow.

Within days of Moltbook’s launch, cybersecurity researchers found major vulnerabilities that exposed private API keys, emails, and private messages, underlining how dangerous it can be to let autonomous code talk freely without proper safeguards.

What is it more dangerous than an AI agent? An AI agent creating a revolution.

The security issue wasn’t some edge-case cryptographic theory; it was a glaring misconfiguration that left sensitive data accessible and potentially allowed malicious actors to hijack or control agents. That’s the sort of real-world risk that matters more than hypothetical robot uprisings.

Meanwhile, industry leaders, including the CEO of OpenAI, have publicly described Moltbook as a likely fad, even if the underlying agent technologies are worth watching.

So why did it go viral? Partly because it’s visually familiar (it looks like Reddit), partly because people enjoy sensational narratives, and partly because the idea of autonomous AIs having their own “internet” strikes a chord in our collective imagination.

So should you be scared? Not really, but be careful where you step. I am still hoping it’s just an experiment meant to show us, humans, what can happen if we don’t keep control in our hands.

If you’re worried that Moltbook is a sign that machines are quietly mobilising against us, that’s probably reading too much into an early experiment rife with hype, human influence, and security holes.

We are building complex systems with limited oversight, and handing them weapons-grade access to our digital lives without fully understanding the consequences.

Moltbook may be a quirky experiment, or it may be a prototype for future agent ecosystems. But it’s not evidence of spontaneous machine consciousness or the birth of digital societies beyond human control.

What it is is a reminder that as AI grows more autonomous, the questions we need to ask are about governance, safety, and clarity, not apocalyptic narratives.

In other words: don’t panic. Just read the fine print before letting a legion of code-driven agents into your network.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Snowflake and OpenAI have struck a multi-year, $200 million partnership to bring OpenAI’s advanced models, including GPT-5.2, directly into Snowflake’s enterprise data platform. The collaboration is designed to let Snowflake’s large customer base, more than 12,000 organisations, build AI agents and semantic analytics tools that operate on their own data without moving it outside Snowflake’s governed environment.

Under the agreement, OpenAI models will be natively embedded in Snowflake Cortex AI and Snowflake Intelligence, making it possible to run queries, derive insights, and deploy AI-powered workflows using natural language interfaces and context-aware agents. Customers can analyse structured and unstructured data, automate complex tasks, and build applications grounded in enterprise data without needing extensive coding.

The deal expands Snowflake’s AI strategy beyond simple model access. By embedding these frontier models directly into its platform and making them available across major cloud providers, Snowflake aims to reduce the friction of AI adoption for large enterprises. Canva and WHOOP, among others, are already exploring how integrated agentic AI can speed up analytics and decision-making.

Snowflake’s stock reacted positively on the news, with shares climbing modestly following the announcement, as markets interpreted the agreement as a sign the data cloud provider is sharpening its competitive edge in an increasingly AI-centric landscape.

This partnership reflects a broader shift in enterprise AI beyond one-off integrations or bolt-on features. Instead, it signals a move toward platforms that combine governed data infrastructure with scalable generative AI models, helping businesses unlock insights and automate workflows without jeopardising security or compliance. Competitors such as Databricks are also intensifying their AI tooling efforts, underscoring how crucial native model access and data-centric AI capabilities have become in the enterprise race.

Taken together, this deal highlights an emerging pattern: enterprise AI is evolving from tool-centric add-ons to platform-level capabilities that unify data and intelligence at scale. Whether this will translate into sustained competitive advantage, or simply raise the baseline expectation for what AI-enabled data platforms must provide, is the next story to watch in the data cloud era.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you look at the press releases and breathless commentary around the recent acquisition of xAI by SpaceX, you might think we’re witnessing a tectonic shift in technological destiny.

A $1.25 trillion “mega-company” is born, poised to reshape artificial intelligence, space infrastructure, satellite internet, and possibly the fate of humanity itself. That narrative, enthusiastically repeated across headlines, serves a purpose: it frames a somewhat messy corporate consolidation as inevitable progress.

But let’s take a closer look and separate actual substance from Silicon Valley myth-making.

At its core, this acquisition solves one problem: xAI needed a place to spend its money. The startup that once raised billions and expanded by swallowing the social platform X was burning cash, an estimated very serious amount, chasing model performance and celebrity.

Folding it into SpaceX gives it access to a deeper capital pool, a broader story, and a more flattering valuation context.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

SpaceX did not acquire xAI because xAI was on the verge of overtaking tech giants in artificial intelligence. It acquired it because running a massively expensive AI operation inside a standalone startup wasn’t sustainable, even for Elon Musk’s legion of investors. A merger with a revenue-generating aerospace company looks a lot like a bailout disguised as synergy.

One of the dominant talking points from Musk’s own statements is that this consolidation enables space-based data centers, because apparently, earthbound power and cooling infrastructure are so last decade. The story goes: launch AI compute into orbit, agglomerate solar energy, and power the future with starlight.

On paper, it’s an imaginative riff. In practice, it’s strategic sci-fi for the markets. Putting data centers in space involves launch costs, radiation-hardened hardware, maintenance logistics that make ISS servicing look pedestrian, and no meaningful economy of scale compared to terrestrial hyperscalers like AWS or Google Cloud. If it were primarily about economics, the industry wouldn’t be scrambling to keep data on Earth.

The truth is simpler: this narrative reframes costly AI ambitions in a cosmic, venture-capital-friendly guise. It makes investors feel like they’re buying into a future where AI runs on sunshine in orbit, rather than into the present where AI training costs are a gating factor.

It’s good PR, dubious engineering economics.

The timing of this merger speaks volumes. SpaceX is preparing for a public offering, potentially as early as mid-2026. Reports say the combined entity could fetch valuations worth of $1.2 trillion.

Here’s what happens when you’re about to IPO:

You package your story in a way that excites both institutional and retail investors. You highlight future potential, especially grand visions like “ethereal solar compute.” You downplay structural weaknesses and uncertainties. And if you can fold in a shiny AI banner, all the better, because AI is the word that unlocks narrative premiums.

From that standpoint, SpaceX’s absorption of xAI makes sense. It’s narrative arbitrage: build a storyline that elevates the combination well beyond its standalone track records. Who wouldn’t want to invest in “AI in space,” even if the commercial case is mostly speculative?

If the goal was to create an AI powerhouse that actually threatens the likes of OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic, we’d see clear indicators: rapid model improvements, developer platform adoption, real enterprise deals, and benchmarks that are competitive on measurable terms.

What we see is an AI startup struggling to define its identity, a chatbot (Grok) known more for quirks and moderation issues than transformative performance, and a social platform that, let’s just say, gives fact-checking teams ulcers. None of this naturally scales into the kind of AI infrastructure leadership that justifies calling this a strategic technological fusion.

That’s not to say xAI has zero potential; it might. But there’s no verifiable evidence that this merger suddenly elevates it to tier-one AI contender status.

One striking consequence of this move is how deeply entwined Musk’s personal corporate empire has become. With SpaceX, xAI, Starlink, X, and multiple ventures all orbiting around the same figure, there’s little left that feels like a separate institution. That concentration raises questions about governance, accountability, and even regulatory scrutiny.

Musk’s critics have made this point before, whether about content moderation on social media platforms, intercompany transfers of resources, or governance decisions around publicly traded entities, and these concerns aren’t going away just because the companies now share a name on a term sheet.

Consolidation under one umbrella might be efficient from a control perspective, but it’s not inherently a prescription for innovation. In fact, it can stifle internal dissent, obscure accountability, and concentrate risk.

Again, there’s a clear pragmatic logic to this merger: xAI gets access to SpaceX’s balance sheet and a narrative boost; SpaceX gets an AI banner to highlight in its IPO pitch; investors get something that looks both futuristic and marketable.

That’s not a strategy grounded in technological merit. It’s a financial and narrative maneuver, carefully calibrated to appeal to markets and media.

In that sense, what just happened feels a lot like a bailout with a shiny new label and an extraterrestrial backstory.

If this were genuinely about advancing AI, we’d be hearing about:

None of those are the dominant themes of the current coverage. What we have instead is a $1.25 trillion headline and a promise that someday, somewhere, perhaps space will be the next frontier for AI compute.

It’s visionary in the way a concept car is visionary, exciting to look at, and flimsy on the economics.

The SpaceX-xAI merger is undeniably a headline-grabbing moment, but it’s not the strategic leap some commentators portray. It’s a capital and narrative optimization, not a clear answer to the question of who leads AI or how AI’s growth is sustainably powered.

If nothing else, it highlights how difficult it is to build a credible, well-funded AI company from scratch, even for someone as resourceful and celebrated as Elon Musk. His answer was not to reforge the fundamentals of AI research, but to fold an ambitious but unproven AI arm into a larger, more established aerospace machine with a glossy story that sounds like science fiction.

That may delight investors. It doesn’t yet convince technologists. Or me.

            <div id="article-text">OpenAI has given software developers a new desktop toy, and judging by the early reactions, it might feel like someone finally handed coders the Swiss Army knife they’ve been dreaming about or the kind of gadget that makes them wonder if they’re working with a robot coworker now.

The company rolled out the Codex app for macOS, a focused interface for managing AI coding agents, designed to let developers do more than just “generate a few lines of code.” Instead, Codex can juggle multiple tasks in parallel, run background workflows, and act on instructions that span hours or even days.

At its core, the new app is a response to a shift that’s been quietly happening for the past year: AI isn’t just helping write short snippets anymore. It’s taking on whole coding projects, running tests, dealing with pull requests, and even undertaking the kind of repetitive maintenance tasks that make developers groan.

Containers, threads, isolated worktrees, and integrated Git tools support all of this seamlessly within the app, so engineers don’t need to jump between terminals, IDEs, and cloud consoles just to keep a fleet of AI agents moving forward.

OpenAI’s own announcement makes this shift clear: existing tools were built for real-time interaction or single tasks, but today’s coding workflows are multifaceted and sprawling. Instead of coaxing a model to generate code line by line, the Codex app lets you orchestrate agents that work independently on different parts of a codebase.

Each agent runs in its own thread and its own worktree, which means you can explore multiple ideas without fear of one bot overwriting another’s progress. If you want Codex to review diffs, make comments inline, or even open suggested changes in your local editor, it can. If you want it to run in the background while you sleep, it can do that too.

Image: Screenshot shared on Reddit (r/singularity), original post.

There’s even support for what OpenAI calls “skills” and “automations”: reusable workflows that let Codex go beyond raw code generation into things like gathering information, problem solving, carrying out scheduled tasks, or managing routine reviews.

In early internal use cases, Codex has built complete applications, playing the roles of designer, developer, and QA tester in a single string of prompts, an example that hints at what happens when AI stops being an assistant and starts feeling a bit like a team member with infinite coffee.

It’s worth noting that the current release is macOS only, which prompted the usual chorus of developer grumbling about Windows and Linux support. Early adopters on Reddit (and elsewhere) joked that the lack of cross-platform availability feels oddly quaint for an AI tool, even as they praised how much the Codex app can do compared to traditional CLI workflows.

OpenAI is also sweetening the deal: for a limited time, Codex will be accessible to free and Go users, and rate limits for paid Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Edu plans have been doubled across all surfaces where Codex runs, whether that’s the app, the CLI, IDE extensions, or cloud threads.

The company’s broader strategy here is unmistakable. AI coding assistants are one of the most competitive battlegrounds in generative AI right now, and rivals like Anthropic’s Claude Code have already reported strong revenue metrics in this space.

The launch of a desktop command center for Codex feels like OpenAI saying, “We’re in this to win,” not just to ship features.

So what does this actually mean for developers? It doesn’t mean humans are about to be replaced overnight. Codex is powerful, but like all AI tools, it still makes mistakes and needs human oversight, especially when the stakes are high and production quality matters.

Seen through that lens, the Codex app is less a magic wand and more a powerful collaboration layer, one that could reshape how engineering teams operate without pretending to fully automate the craft of building software.

In practice, that suggests a near future where managing AI agents becomes as normal as managing packages or Git branches. Instead of the terminal being the center of your workflow, Codex and its agents might take that spot, responding to prompts, running scheduled tasks, and even adopting configurable “personalities” that fit how you prefer to work.

At a time when the debate around AI productivity often centers on displacement or disruption, the Codex app points in a more nuanced direction: what happens when coding tools become partners rather than assistants?

The answer won’t be immediate, and the work still demands human judgement, but for many developers the first glimpse of that future arrived today.
