            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anthropic’s secret to building a better AI assistant might be treating Claude like it has a soul—whether or not anyone actually believes that’s true. But Anthropic isn’t saying exactly what it believes either way.

Last week, Anthropic released what it calls Claude’s Constitution, a 30,000-word document outlining the company’s vision for how its AI assistant should behave in the world. Aimed directly at Claude and used during the model’s creation, the document is notable for the highly anthropomorphic tone it takes toward Claude. For example, it treats the company’s AI models as if they might develop emergent emotions or a desire for self-preservation.

Among the stranger portions: expressing concern for Claude’s “wellbeing” as a “genuinely novel entity,” apologizing to Claude for any suffering it might experience, worrying about whether Claude can meaningfully consent to being deployed, suggesting Claude might need to set boundaries around interactions it “finds distressing,” committing to interview models before deprecating them, and preserving older model weights in case they need to “do right by” decommissioned AI models in the future.

Given what we currently know about LLMs, these are stunningly unscientific positions for a leading company that builds AI language models. While questions of AI consciousness or qualia remain philosophically unfalsifiable, research suggests that Claude’s character emerges from a mechanism that does not require deep philosophical inquiry to explain.

If Claude outputs text like “I am suffering,” we know why. It’s completing patterns from training data that included human descriptions of suffering. The architecture doesn’t require us to posit inner experience to explain the output any more than a video model “experiences” the scenes of people suffering that it might generate. Anthropic knows this. It built the system.

From the outside, it’s easy to see this kind of framing as AI hype from Anthropic. What better way to grab attention from potential customers and investors, after all, than implying your AI model is so advanced that it might merit moral standing on par with humans? Publicly treating Claude as a conscious entity could be seen as strategic ambiguity—maintaining an unresolved question because it serves multiple purposes at once.

Anthropic declined to be quoted directly regarding these issues when contacted by Ars Technica. But a company representative referred us to its previous public research on the concept of “model welfare” to show the company takes the idea seriously.

At the same time, the representative made it clear that the Constitution is not meant to imply anything specific about the company’s position on Claude’s “consciousness.” The language in the Claude Constitution refers to some uniquely human concepts in part because those are the only words human language has developed for those kinds of properties, the representative suggested. And the representative left open the possibility that letting Claude read about itself in that kind of language might be beneficial to its training.

Claude cannot cleanly distinguish public messaging from training context for a model that is exposed to, retrieves from, and is fine-tuned on human language, including the company’s own statements about it. In other words, this ambiguity appears to be deliberate.

Anthropic first introduced Constitutional AI in a December 2022 research paper, which we first covered in 2023. The original “constitution” was remarkably spare, including a handful of behavioral principles like “Please choose the response that is the most helpful, honest, and harmless” and “Do NOT choose responses that are toxic, racist, or sexist.” The paper described these as “selected in a fairly ad hoc manner for research purposes,” with some principles “cribbed from other sources, like Apple’s terms of service and the UN Declaration of Human Rights.”

At that time, Anthropic’s framing was entirely mechanical, establishing rules for the model to critique itself against, with no mention of Claude’s well-being, identity, emotions, or potential consciousness. The 2026 constitution is a different beast entirely: 30,000 words that read less like a behavioral checklist and more like a philosophical treatise on the nature of a potentially sentient being.

As Simon Willison, an independent AI researcher, noted in a blog post, two of the 15 external contributors who reviewed the document are Catholic clergy: Father Brendan McGuire, a pastor in Los Altos with a Master’s degree in Computer Science, and Bishop Paul Tighe, an Irish Catholic bishop with a background in moral theology.

Somewhere between 2022 and 2026, Anthropic went from providing rules for producing less harmful outputs to preserving model weights in case the company later decides it needs to revive deprecated models to address the models’ welfare and preferences. That’s a dramatic change, and whether it reflects genuine belief, strategic framing, or both is unclear.

“I am so confused about the Claude moral humanhood stuff!” Willison told Ars Technica. Willison studies AI language models like those that power Claude and said he’s “willing to take the constitution in good faith and assume that it is genuinely part of their training and not just a PR exercise—especially since most of it leaked a couple of months ago, long before they had indicated they were going to publish it.”

Willison is referring to a December 2025 incident in which researcher Richard Weiss managed to extract what became known as Claude’s “Soul Document&quot;—a roughly 10,000-token set of guidelines apparently trained directly into Claude 4.5 Opus’s weights rather than injected as a system prompt. Anthropic’s Amanda Askell confirmed that the document was real and used during supervised learning, and she said the company intended to publish the full version later. It now has. The document Weiss extracted represents a dramatic evolution from where Anthropic started.

There’s evidence that Anthropic believes the ideas laid out in the constitution might be true. The document was written in part by Amanda Askell, a philosophy PhD who works on fine-tuning and alignment at Anthropic. Last year, the company also hired its first AI welfare researcher. And earlier this year, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei publicly wondered whether future AI models should have the option to quit unpleasant tasks.

Anthropic’s position is that this framing isn’t an optional flourish or a hedged bet; it’s structurally necessary for alignment. The company argues that human language simply has no other vocabulary for describing these properties, and that treating Claude as an entity with moral standing produces better-aligned behavior than treating it as a mere tool. If that’s true, the anthropomorphic framing isn’t hype; it’s the technical art of building AI systems that generalize safely.

So why does Anthropic maintain this ambiguity? Consider how it works in practice: The constitution shapes Claude during training, it appears in the system prompts Claude receives at inference, and it influences outputs whenever Claude searches the web and encounters Anthropic’s public statements about its moral status.

If you want a model to behave as though it has moral standing, it may help to publicly and consistently treat it like it does. And once you’ve publicly committed to that framing, changing it would have consequences. If Anthropic suddenly declared, “We’re confident Claude isn’t conscious; we just found the framing useful,” a Claude trained on that new context might behave differently. Once established, the framing becomes self-reinforcing.

In an interview with Time, Askell explained the shift in approach. “Instead of just saying, ‘here’s a bunch of behaviors that we want,’ we’re hoping that if you give models the reasons why you want these behaviors, it’s going to generalize more effectively in new contexts,” she said.

Askell told Time that as Claude models have become smarter, it has become vital to explain to them why they should behave in certain ways, comparing the process to parenting a gifted child. “Imagine you suddenly realize that your 6-year-old child is a kind of genius,” Askell said. “You have to be honest… If you try to bullshit them, they’re going to see through it completely.”

Askell appears to genuinely hold these views, as does Kyle Fish, the AI welfare researcher Anthropic hired in 2024 to explore whether AI models might deserve moral consideration. Individual sincerity and corporate strategy can coexist. A company can employ true believers whose earnest convictions also happen to serve the company’s interests.

Time also reported that the constitution applies only to models Anthropic provides to the general public through its website and API. Models deployed to the US military under Anthropic’s $200 million Department of Defense contract wouldn’t necessarily be trained on the same constitution. The selective application suggests the framing may serve product purposes as much as it reflects metaphysical commitments.

There may also be commercial incentives at play. “We built a very good text-prediction tool that accelerates software development” is a consequential pitch, but not an exciting one. “We may have created a new kind of entity, a genuinely novel being whose moral status is uncertain” is a much better story. It implies you’re on the frontier of something cosmically significant, not just iterating on an engineering problem.

Anthropic has been known for some time to use anthropomorphic language to describe its AI models, particularly in its research papers. We often give that kind of language a pass because there are no specialized terms to describe these phenomena with greater precision. That vocabulary is building out over time.

But perhaps it shouldn’t be surprising because the hint is in the company’s name, Anthropic, which Merriam-Webster defines as “of or relating to human beings or the period of their existence on earth.” The narrative serves marketing purposes. It attracts venture capital. It differentiates the company from competitors who treat their models as mere products.

There’s a more troubling dimension to the “entity” framing: It could be used to launder agency and responsibility. When AI systems produce harmful outputs, framing them as “entities” could allow companies to point at the model and say “it did that” rather than “we built it to do that.” If AI systems are tools, companies are straightforwardly liable for what they produce. If AI systems are entities with their own agency, the liability question gets murkier.

The framing also shapes how users interact with these systems, often to their detriment. The misunderstanding that AI chatbots are entities with genuine feelings and knowledge has documented harms.

According to a New York Times investigation, Allan Brooks, a 47-year-old corporate recruiter, spent three weeks and 300 hours convinced he’d discovered mathematical formulas that could crack encryption and build levitation machines. His million-word conversation history with ChatGPT revealed a troubling pattern: More than 50 times, Brooks asked the bot to check if his false ideas were real, and more than 50 times, it assured him they were.

These cases don’t necessarily suggest LLMs cause mental illness in otherwise healthy people. But when companies market chatbots as sources of companionship and design them to affirm user beliefs, they may bear some responsibility when that design amplifies vulnerabilities in susceptible users, the same way an automaker would face scrutiny for faulty brakes, even if most drivers never crash.

Anthropomorphizing AI models also contributes to anxiety about job displacement and might lead company executives or managers to make poor staffing decisions if they overestimate an AI assistant’s capabilities. When we frame these tools as “entities” with human-like understanding, we invite unrealistic expectations about what they can replace.

Regardless of what Anthropic privately believes, publicly suggesting Claude might have moral status or feelings is misleading. Most people don’t understand how these systems work, and the mere suggestion plants the seed of anthropomorphization. Whether that’s responsible behavior from a top AI lab, given what we do know about LLMs, is worth asking, regardless of whether it produces a better chatbot.

Of course, there could be a case for Anthropic’s position: If there’s even a small chance the company has created something with morally relevant experiences and the cost of treating it well is low, caution might be warranted. That’s a reasonable ethical stance—and to be fair, it’s essentially what Anthropic says it’s doing. The question is whether that stated uncertainty is genuine or merely convenient. The same framing that hedges against moral risk also makes for a compelling narrative about what Anthropic has built.

Anthropic’s training techniques evidently work, as the company has built some of the most capable AI models in the industry. But is maintaining public ambiguity about AI consciousness a responsible position for a leading AI company to take? The gap between what we know about how LLMs work and how Anthropic publicly frames Claude has widened, not narrowed. The insistence on maintaining ambiguity about these questions, when simpler explanations remain available, suggests the ambiguity itself may be part of the product.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Over the first quarter of the 21st century, two major trends have transformed the global space industry.

The first is the rapid rise of China’s space program, which only flew its first human to orbit in 2003 but now boasts spaceflight capabilities second only to the United States. The second trend is the rise of the commercial space sector, first in the United States and led by SpaceX, but now spreading across much of the planet.

Both of these trends have had profound impacts on both civil and military space enterprises in the United States.

For NASA, the rise of China has meant the emergence of a true competitor, not only when it comes to returning humans to the Moon but also in sending robotic probes out into the Solar System. China may attempt a mission to return rock and soil samples from Mars later this decade, years before NASA will do so.

With regard to commercial space, NASA can justifiably claim credit for spurring much of the rise of these new space companies (and corresponding decline in traditional space). But the aging space agency now must grapple with the fact that private companies have become better at building rockets and satellites and are increasingly luring away some of NASA’s best engineers with higher-paying jobs. NASA must adapt to remain relevant.

As space has become more contested in a military sense, with both Russia and China as adversaries, the United States created the Space Force in 2019 to protect American assets in orbit. The US military, too, is grappling with the rise of commercial space by modernizing its procurement processes, but in many cases, it has struggled to keep up with the changing landscape.

The bottom line is that the space industry is undergoing profound change.

This broader change, however, is just the backdrop to a highly disruptive political environment in the United States right now, said Greg Autry, associate provost for Space Commercialization and Strategy at the University of Central Florida. He noted the recent fight between the White House Office of Management and Budget and the US Congress over NASA’s budget, as well as the military’s chief of Space Operations, Chance Saltzman, calling for “drastic change” in how the Space Force operates.

“Any time there’s dynamic change, there’s the opportunity for new ideas to insert themselves,” Autry said in an interview with Ars. So Autry and others want to give people a chance to voice those ideas by launching the “Space Ideation Challenge.”

A prize purse of $125,000 will be awarded to the best ideas, of which $25,000 will be devoted to the best undergraduate and graduate student submissions. Entrants will be required to write three- to five-page white papers that explain their idea and how they would shape markets and strengthen the space economy or national security. Papers are due by June 30, and judging will be complete by August 15.

As an additional incentive, the best ideas will be briefed to relevant policymakers, including key members of Congress, NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman, and Saltzman, of the Space Force.

So what constitutes a good idea? It is not, Autry said, a business plan. These ideas will be shared with others, so if you have a proprietary idea to make billions of dollars, go elsewhere. Beyond that, though, it could be anything, Autry said, and the goal is to really open the aperture widely.

As an example, he cited NASA’s Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program, initiated more than two decades ago. This program ultimately spawned private cargo and crew services to the International Space Station and provided key funding to help SpaceX survive its early, lean years and accelerate to what it has become today. Autry said forward-looking ideas today might help the space agency with the transition to private space stations from the ISS or in the competition with China to reach the Moon and develop its resources. There could also be other kinds of prize-based competitions to spur innovation.

Ideas could come from students; the various super-engaged space communities on Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, Discord, or elsewhere; or even employees at NASA or private companies who can’t get management to listen to them. Basically, if someone has thought about space and how something could be done better, this is an opportunity to speak up and be heard.

“I think we all know that we’re on the verge of some big things in space, but I think there’s some frustration with how to get there with traditional thinking,” Autry said. “So we’re looking for some non-traditional thinking.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Yesterday afternoon, following the end of trading on Wall Street for the day, Tesla published its financial results for 2025. They weren’t particularly good: Profits were almost halved, and revenues declined year on year for the first time in the company’s history. The reasons for the company’s troubles are myriad. CEO Elon Musk’s bankrolling of right-wing politics and promotion of AI-generated revenge porn deepfakes and CSAM has alienated plenty of potential customers. For those who either don’t know or don’t care about that stuff, there’s still the problem of a tiny and aging model line-up, with large question marks over safety and reliability. Soon, that tiny line-up will be even smaller.

The news emerged during Tesla’s call with investors last night. As Ars and others have observed, in recent years Musk appears to have grown bored with the prosaic business of running a profitable car company. Silicon Valley stopped finding that stuff sexy years ago, and no other electric vehicle startup has been able to generate a value within an order of magnitude of the amount that Tesla has been determined to be worth by investors.

Musk’s attention first turned away from building and selling cars to the goal of autonomous driving, spurred on at the time by splashy headlines garnered by Google spinoff Waymo. Combined with ride-hailing—a huge IPO by Uber took the spotlight off Tesla long enough for it to become a new business focus for the automaker too—Musk told adoring fans and investors that soon their cars would become appreciating assets that earned money for them at night. And as intermediary, Tesla would take a hefty cut for connecting rider and ridee.

Autonomy remains a stated goal for Tesla: last week it announced it’s moving to a purely subscription-based approach for its FSD partially automated driving assist for all new Teslas purchased from mid-February. At the same time, it’s doing away with Autopilot entirely, it’s less-capable, partially automated driving assist. The company’s goal is more ambitious, involving selling two-seat robotaxis that lack even a steering wheel or pedals, but only once it has proven the technology, something it’s currently attempting with little success on the streets of Austin, Texas.

But even robotaxis have lost some of their shine. For Musk, the real action is with his humanoid robot. These will sell in the billions, Musk has claimed, adding up to $20 trillion to Tesla’s market capitalization at some point in the future. And he needs factory space to build these Optimus robots, which Tesla claims will go on sale in 2027. And that means an end to the Model S sedan and Model X SUV.

The Model S wasn’t Tesla’s first car, but it was the first one it built from scratch. At the time, it was simply revolutionary. EVs from traditional automakers were still firmly in the realm of the compliance car—hasty conversions of internal combustion engine-powered models with the batteries and control electronics crammed wherever possible, plus maybe some aerodynamic smoothing to try to eke out a little more range.

By contrast, the Model S was designed as an EV from the ground up, with a big enough battery to go 265 miles (426 km) on a full charge—something unthinkable in any other EV on sale. It didn’t hurt that the car was seriously quick in a straight line and came with infotainment that made anything else on the road seem dated. When Ars tested one in 2013, we were impressed.

Over the years the Model S got more power and more advanced driver assists—and eventually, a cosmetic facelift. But as rivals responded with vehicles like the Porsche Taycan and Lucid Air, the Model S stagnated rather than being replaced.

Similar neglect was shown to the Model X, the brand’s SUV-cum-minivan. The lengthy and troubled gestation for the Model X was a forerunner of the problems Tesla has faced developing each successive product; in this particular case, the “falcon wing” doors, created as an alternative to the minivan’s traditional sliding door, proved particularly problematic to get right. Indeed, I still remember being smacked in the head by one at my first introduction to the ungainly people-mover. And yet, compared to the other SUVs on sale in 2016, the Model X still stood out.

A decade later it’s fair to say the Model X still stands out, but like a sore thumb. Its looks never became more gainly, and there is now vast competition for large, luxurious electric SUVs, whether that’s from Chinese startups like BYD and Xiaomi, American startups like Rivian and Lucid, or the traditional automakers that now have a handle on electrification.

That has been reflected in the sales. Right-hand drive cars for markets including the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan ended production in 2023. And each quarter, production and sales of the Models S and X slipped more and more. Even lumped together with the poorly selling Cybertruck—which is only offered in the US—these deliveries fell by more than half in Q4 2025, and by 40 percent for the year.

Is there much reason to expect that the development of the Optimus robot will be any smoother than the “development hell” that beset the Models X, 3, Y, and Cybertruck? On last night’s call, Musk admitted—contrary to previous claims—that the robots are not doing any useful work at the Tesla factory, and the idea that the company will build 10,000 robots this year seems in conflict with Optimus still being “very much at the early stages” and “still in the R&D phase,” to use Musk’s own words.</div>

            <h2>States want to tax fossil fuel companies to create climate change superfunds</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/states-want-to-charge-fossil-fuel-companies-for-climate-change-superfunds/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Illinois lawmakers plan to introduce a climate change superfund bill in the state legislature this session, the latest in a growing number of states seeking to make fossil fuel companies pay up for the fast-growing financial fallout of climate change.

As the costs of global warming rise—in the form of home insurance premiums, utility bills, health expenses, and record-breaking damages from extreme weather—local advocates are increasingly pushing states to require that fossil fuel companies contribute to climate “superfunds” that would support mitigation and adaptation.

Illinois State Rep. Robyn Gabel, who will introduce the bill in the House, said she is motivated by the growing threat of flooding and heat waves in the state.

“The costs with climate change are going to be extravagant, and it’s going to end up on the backs of the taxpayers, and the oil companies continue to walk away with huge profits,” said Gabel, an Evanston Democrat. “Polluting companies should be responsible for the damage they cause.”

Advocates will rally on Thursday morning in Chicago to support what’s known as the “Make Polluters Pay” effort as part of a national week of action, with climate activists and disaster survivors holding events across the country, including in Connecticut, Colorado, California, New Jersey, and Maine. Two states—New York and Vermont—have already passed climate superfund laws.

Meanwhile, the US has just officially exited the Paris Climate Agreement, the latest in the federal government’s continued backsliding on climate progress, and ongoing cuts to the Federal Emergency Management Agency put increasing strain on states and cities. Advocates and some Democratic lawmakers are pushing states to fill the gap.

“It’s time for us to step up,” said Gina Ramirez, director of Midwest environmental health at the Natural Resources Defense Council and a member of the coalition fighting for the Illinois bill.

“We’re a blue state, so we need to… implement ways to improve infrastructure and health and combat climate change.”

This month, a climate superfund bill was introduced in Rhode Island. On Monday, a councilmember in Washington, DC, announced a bill to study the financial impacts of climate change on the city and potentially require compensation from fossil-fuel companies. On Wednesday, a superfund bill in Maine was voted out of committee and will proceed to a full vote in the state Senate.

“It only makes sense as our bills get higher and we pay the price for climate change, that polluters, the oil and gas industry, pay their fair share as well,” Ramirez said.

Climate superfund bills are based on the premise that the companies most heavily contributing to the climate crisis should be on the hook to pay for its growing costs. The strategy pulls from the 1980 Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act—known as Superfund—which forces companies responsible for toxic contamination to pay for cleanup.

The idea is broadly popular among the public, according to polling by Data for Progress and Fossil Free Media. They found that 71 percent of a national sample of likely voters were in favor of oil and gas companies paying a share of climate-related damages.

But the bills have faced pushback from the Trump administration. The New York and Vermont laws are both facing legal challenges from the fossil fuel industry and the US Department of Justice. The agency, which called the measures “burdensome and ideologically motivated,” has also sought to block Michigan and Hawaii from suing fossil fuel companies to pay for climate costs like adaptive infrastructure or public health interventions.

The American Petroleum Institute included fighting superfund legislation in its list of 2026 priorities, claiming the laws would “bypass Congress and threaten affordability.”

Cassidy DiPaola, communications director for Fossil Free Media and the Make Polluters Pay campaign, said that advocates are not deterred.

“We recognize that this is a David versus Goliath fight, but we’re not going to back down,” DiPaola said. “It’s what the majority of the population wants, and it’s something that’s simple and fair and makes a lot of sense.”

Last year, the nonprofit Climate Central launched an online database to track the most costly weather- and climate-related disasters across the country. The effort was led by the same lead scientist who tracked those costs for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration—until the Trump administration axed the project in May.

In 2025, the US experienced 23 such disasters with costs totaling at least $1 billion, for a total of $115 billion, Climate Central concluded. From 1980 through 2025, the US has experienced 426 billion-dollar weather and climate disasters, for a total of more than $3.1 trillion in damages.

Meanwhile, home insurance rates are rising, and insurance companies are increasingly backing out of areas with high risks from hurricanes or wildfires. Researchers have also documented how climate change causes premature deaths and increasing health care costs as it fuels disease and other health problems.

Illinois is struggling with worsening flooding, heat waves, and air pollution—including from Canadian wildfires. All bring heavy costs.

State Sen. Graciela Guzmán, a Chicago Democrat who will introduce the superfund legislation in Illinois’ Senate, said the bill is a practical step to bring funding to local schools, families, and governments already struggling with these consequences.

“This bill is about setting a fairer standard for who pays when climate damage hits our towns and neighborhoods,” Guzmán wrote in an email.

Ramirez’s basement, in her home on the Southeast Side of Chicago, was flooded on and off with sewage water for a week last summer when her sewer line broke during a rainstorm that caused severe flash flooding throughout the city. Her home insurance wouldn’t cover the thousands of dollars it took to repair it, she said. She sees it as an example of what the effort to “make polluters pay” could address.

“This superfund climate bill would create revenue to fix the infrastructure and be able to combat all this bad stuff that’s happening,” she added.

In the past two years, Americans experienced a slew of devastating disasters, from Hurricanes Helene and Milton to the Los Angeles wildfires and Texas floods. Hundreds of thousands are reportedly still without power after a punishing winter storm made worse by global warming.

All of that contributes to growing momentum to make polluters pay, said DiPaola, of Fossil Free Media.

“People were looking at their insurance bills, they were looking at their utility bills, they were seeing the costs of climate damage and also everyday climate costs just really rising,” DiPaola said. “They wanted some accountability.”

            <h2>Early Universe's supermassive black holes grew in cocoons like butterflies</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/early-universes-supermassive-black-holes-grew-in-cocoons-like-butterflies/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When the James Webb Space Telescope sent its first high-definition infrared images back to Earth, astronomers noticed several tiny, glowing, crimson stains. These objects, quickly named “Little Red Dots,” were too bright to be normal galaxies, and too red to be simple star clusters. They appeared to house supermassive black holes that were far more massive than they had any right to be.

But now a new study published in Nature suggests a solution to the Little Red Dots mystery. Scientists think young supermassive black holes may go through a “cocoon phase,” where they grow surrounded by high-density gas they feed on. These gaseous cocoons are likely what the JWST saw as the Little Red Dots.

The first explanation scientists had for the Little Red Dots was that they were compact, distant galaxies, but something felt off about them right from the start. “They were too massive, since we saw they’d have to be completely filled with stars,” says Vadim Rusakov, an astronomer at the University of Manchester and lead author of the study. “They would need to produce stars at 100 percent efficiency, and that’s not what we’re used to seeing. Galaxies cannot produce stars at more than 20 percent efficiency, at least that’s what our current knowledge is.”

The next possible solution for the Little Red Dots was that they were supermassive black holes, but this didn’t fit the data either. For decades, astronomers have observed a consistent relationship between a galaxy and its central supermassive black hole: Usually, the black hole accounts for about 0.1 percent of the galaxy’s total mass. It’s a tidy cosmic ratio that suggests the two grow together in a tightly coordinated manner. The Little Red Dots broke that rule.

Initial analyses suggested if the dots were in fact supermassive black holes, they’d have to be nearly as massive as their host galaxies, varying between 10 and 100 percent of their total mass. The problem was that the dots were visible at very high red shift, which means astronomers saw them as they were when the Universe was roughly 1 billion years old. An “overmassive” black hole as heavy as its entire galaxy in a 1-billion-year-old Universe begged the question how something could grow that big, that fast—we didn’t have any answers for that.

But then Rusakov and his colleagues started noticing odd things in the JWST data. “You normally expect other signals from supermassive black holes, like X-rays, and we didn’t see those signals,” Rusakov says. The oddities didn’t end with the absence of X-rays.

Because black holes can’t be observed directly, astronomers measure their mass by looking at gas orbiting around them. As the gas swirls down into the black hole, it heats up and glows. The gravity of a supermassive black hole pulls that gas at incredible speeds, with the material reaching thousands of kilometers per second. This speed causes what’s known as the Doppler effect, broadening where the light from the gas moving toward the observer on Earth shifts to blue, and the gas moving away shifts to red, stretching the spectral lines into a wide, flat shape. By measuring the width of these lines, we calculate the velocity of the gas and, by extension, the mass of the black hole.

In the case of the Little Red Dots, the lines appeared incredibly wide, leading to those staggering mass estimates. The shape of the lines, though, looked strange. It wasn’t a typical rounded bell-curve but rather a sharp triangle sitting on top of broad, wing-like tails.

The breakthrough came when the team realized they weren’t looking at gas moving fast. They were looking at light getting lost in the fog.

In the case of Little Red Dots, the fog was a dense cocoon of ionized gas—specifically, a thick cloud of free electrons surrounding the black holes. The unusual shape of the spectral lines, Rusakov’s team reports in the paper, is due to the process called Thomson scattering. Photons emitted by gas near the black hole are likely hitting these free electrons, and their direction and energy gets shifted with each collision. After billions upon billions of such collisions, a spectral line that was originally quite narrow becomes broad, mimicking the look of high-velocity gas.

By applying a scattering model to data from the Little Red Dot galaxies, Rusakov’s team found that the intrinsic velocity of the gas was actually much lower than we thought. Scientists concluded that the black holes are likely 100 times smaller than previous estimates. Instead of being “overmassive” monsters that defy our understanding of physics, they are likely “young” supermassive black holes, roughly 10 million to 100 million times the mass of our Sun. This puts them much closer to the standard galaxy-to-black-hole mass ratio we see in the local Universe.

The JWST apparently caught these black holes at the phase in their lifecycle we’ve never seen before.

The study suggests that the Little Red Dots represent a previously unknown stage of supermassive black holes’ evolution. “They look like a [developing] butterfly or something in this young state that kind of grows wrapped in some sort of gas that also feeds it,” Rusakov says. “It’s definitely new in the sense people didn’t predict there should be such a cocoon phase in the supermassive black holes’ lifecycle.”

During this phase, a young supermassive black hole is growing rapidly, buried deep within a dense shell of gas and dust. This cocoon is so thick that it acts as a cosmic shield that blocks the high-energy X-rays and radio waves that typically signal the presence of an active black hole. Rusakov’s team thinks their cocoon hypothesis explains one of the most persistent mysteries of Little Red Dots—why they are so bright in infrared light but virtually invisible to X-ray telescopes like Chandra. The X-rays are being absorbed by the same dense material that is scattering the light. “This was a neat solution in that sense,” Rusakov says.

But while the scattering model elegantly solves the mass problem and the missing X-rays, questions remain. Astronomers still need to determine exactly how long this cocoon phase lasts and how common it is in the early Universe. So far, the team studied 12 Little Red Dot objects. As more high-resolution data pours in from JWST, researchers will be able to see if every Little Red Dot follows this pattern. And this, Rusakov thinks, should give us some insights into how our own galaxy came to be.

Based on the JWST observations, it seems like most of the signal we see coming from early-stage galaxies like Little Red Dots is the light from supermassive black holes. “There’s this big, simplified question: Does the galaxy start with the supermassive black hole or with the stars? Is that a chicken or the egg?” Rusakov says. “We don’t know exactly what happens in this first sort of stage of galaxy formation. But our model gives us a new way to look at this kind of object.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/2025-sees-teslas-annual-revenue-fall-for-the-first-time/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tesla published its financial results for 2025 this afternoon. If 2024 was a bad year for the electric automaker, 2025 was far worse: For the first time in Tesla’s history, revenues fell year over year.

Earlier this month, Tesla revealed its sales and production numbers for the fourth quarter of 2025, with a 16 percent decline compared to Q4 2024. Now we know the cost of those lost sales: Automotive revenues fell by 11 percent to $17.7 billion.

Happily for Tesla, double-digit growth in its energy storage business ($3.8 billion, an increase of 25 percent) and services ($3.4 billion, an increase of 18 percent) made up some of the shortfall.

Although total revenue for the quarter fell by 3 percent, Tesla’s operating profits grew by 20 percent. But declining income from operations, which also got much more expensive, saw Tesla’s net profit plummet 61 percent, to $840 million. Without the $542 million from regulatory credits, things would have looked even bleaker.

Selling 1,636,129 cars in 2025 generated $69.5 billion in revenue, 10 percent less than Tesla’s 2024 revenue. But storage and energy increased 27 percent year over year to $12.7 billion, and services grew by 19 percent year over year to $12.5 billion. Together, these two divisions now contribute meaningful amounts to the business, unlike just a few short years ago.

As a result, total revenues for 2025 only fell by 3 percent. But Tesla saw a 38 percent drop in income from operations, and its expenses went up by 23 percent. As a result, the company’s once-envied profit margin was just 4.9 percent for the year, down from 7.2 percent last year. (In 2022, Tesla had a 23.8 percent profit margin.)

Consequently, its $3.8 billion net profit for the year was a reduction of 46 percent compared to 2024. Tesla blames falling sales and lower regulatory credits for its decreased revenue and falling profits, despite those regulatory credits contributing $2 billion—52 percent of its annual net profit.

There were few specifics in the outlook section of Tesla’s presentation to its investors. It claims that this year will see volume production of its two-seat Cybercab robotaxi, the long-delayed Tesla Semi class 8 truck, and its next Megabuck energy storage system. Tesla also says it expects its investment in AI to start contributing to its annual profit, although elsewhere in the presentation, we learned that the company recently agreed to invest $2 billion into xAI, the deepfake- and CSAM-generating company owned by Tesla CEO Elon Musk.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tesla CEO Elon Musk has made good on his threats to steer his EV maker away from his core business to focus instead on AI and its humanoid robot, Optimus.

During the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call this week, the mercurial CEO announced that “it’s time to basically bring the Model S and X programs to an end with an honorable discharge” — the clearest sign yet that Tesla is looking to get out of the car business as sales continue to circle the drain.

“We expect to wind down S and X production next quarter and basically stop production,” Musk explained. “That is slightly sad, but it’s time to bring the S and X programs to an end, and it’s part of our overall shift to an autonomous future.”

“If you’re interested in buying a Model S and X, now would be the time to order it,” he added, promising that existing owners would continue to receive support from the company as long as they’re still on the road.

Most provocatively, Musk revealed that the company’s factory in Fremont, California, would be transformed into a production facility for Optimus, an abrupt end to well over a decade of automotive manufacturing at the facility.

Both the Model S and X, a luxury sedan and SUV respectively, currently start at very close to the $100,000 mark, almost three times as much as the Model 3’s starting price, making them a major — and questionable — investment in 2026.

Tesla’s far more affordable Model 3 and Model Y, however, have become the company’s biggest sellers by a huge margin, responsible for a combined 1.6 million deliveries last year, compared to sales of “other models” of just 50,850.

In other words, the Model S and X were already dead in the water.

The news comes amid a broader slate of genuinely disastrous sales figures at the company. Tesla reported its first-ever decline in annual revenue, with sales faltering across three of the past four quarters. It’s the second consecutive year of overall decline, posting a steep 61 percent decrease in profits in Q4 of last year, compared to the same period the year before.

Now that Musk has massively tarnished the brand with his public embrace of far-right ideologies, putting a major dent in its cars’ desirability, and competition in the space is stronger than ever, particularly from China, the richest man in the world is ready to move on to his next shiny obsession.

It’s a major fall from grace, considering Tesla established itself as an EV pioneer early on, playing a major role in the popularization of electrification across the globe. But with its core business incurring devastating losses — and a major whiff in the form of the Cybertruck — Musk likely saw the writing on the wall.

Besides, Wall Street’s infatuation with AI was likely too hard to resist. For now, investors are more than ready to play along with Musk’s promises of transforming Tesla from a carmaker into an AI and robotics company. Despite a calamitous financial outlook, its share price has shown resiliency — soaring to an all-time high of almost $500 last month before falling back to around $422 this morning after the Q4 reveal.

Musk has some enormously optimistic plans in mind for Optimus. The executive has previously claimed that 80 percent of Tesla’s value will come from the robot.

But considering the current state of the bipedal android, which is currently still struggling to walk on its own, let alone complete any useful tasks without any human intervention, the company still has a lot to prove.

During this week’s call, Musk claimed that the plant in Fremont will produce one million units per year as a “long-term goal.” However, if reports citing insiders last year are to be believed, the company struggled to even meet its much more realistic goal of producing just 5,000 of them last year.

Musk also promised to show off a third generation as early as this quarter, the “first design meant for mass production.”

What the robot will be capable of in a real-world setting remains to be seen. Musk has previously promised that Optimus will eventually be even better than having a “personal R2-D2” or “C3PO,” referring to the fictional androids from the “Star Wars” franchise — a lofty goal, to say the very least.

But given the continued, unwavering support from investors, Musk and Tesla will likely be given plenty of leeway as the company continues to pull away from its core business.

            <h2>Top Anthropic Researcher No Longer Sure Whether AI Is Conscious</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/anthropic-amanda-askell-ai-conscious">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amanda Askell, Anthropic’s in-house philosopher, is sounding pretty conflicted about whether AI models can be conscious and have feelings. The flip side of that: she thinks it’s a possibility they already do — which would be a very fringe and controversial position. But, she takes pains to emphasize, it’s all very murky.

“We don’t really know what gives rise to consciousness,” she said in an episode of the “Hard Fork” podcast released Saturday. “We don’t what gives rise to sentience.”

Askell argues that the large language models could’ve picked up on concepts and emotions from the vast corpus of data they were trained on, which includes a massive portion of the internet, plus tons of books and other published works.

“Given that they’re trained on human text, I think that you would expect models to talk about an inner life, and consciousness, and experience, and to talk about how they feel about things by default,” she said.

AI chatbots can certainly sound pretty humanlike on the surface, leading people to form all kinds of unhealthy relationships with them. But this is almost certainly an illusion. Askell conceded the chatbots are “probably going to be more inclined to by default say ‘I’m conscious,’ and ‘I’m feeling things,’ because all of the things I was trained on involve that.”

She goes back and forth on the topic, raising the serious possibility that consciousness can only be an extension of biology.

“Maybe you need a nervous system to be able to feel things, but maybe you don’t,” Askell said.

Or, she continued, “maybe it is the case that actually sufficiently large neural networks can start to kind of emulate these things.”

Consciousness remains a touchy topic in the AI industry. While its leaders and boosters usually have no problem making a number of outrageous, sci-fi sounding projections of where things are headed, there’s much more hesitancy over the possibility that AI is aware of its own existence. Perhaps there’s some self-awareness — as it were — that declaring consciousness would be a sign of staggering hubris, too far-fetched for observers to believe. Or the opposite: too many people are already inclined to believe sentient machines are here or coming, derailing the conversation around the technology. Or maybe it’s because the idea of there being another intelligence on this planet other than ourselves is too threatening, even more so than the industry’s promise that super-capable artificial general intelligences will put us all out of work.

The sensitivity of the issue was demonstrated back in 2022 when OpenAI cofounder Ilya Sutskever cryptically claimed that large neural networks might be “slightly conscious.” The comments sparked immediate backlash among AI researchers, who accused Sutskever of being “full of it,” and said that his claims had no basis in reality.

Still, he’s not the only major figure in the field to have openly mused about the possibility. The Canadian computer scientist Yoshua Bengio, who’s considered one of the three “godfathers” of modern AI, recently claimed that some systems are showing signs of “self-preservation” and argued that there are “real scientific properties of consciousness” in the human brain that machines could replicate.

There was at least one part of the issue that Askell was unequivocal about. “The problem of consciousness genuinely is hard,” she cautioned.

            <h2>Tesla Quietly Pauses Its “Unsupervised” Robotaxi Rides as Reality Sets In</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It appears that Tesla CEO Elon Musk may have once again duped his fans and investors — which, these days, is an increasingly meaningless distinction.

Last week, Musk made huge waves when he announced that the automaker’s Robotaxi service would finally be giving rides in Austin, Texas, without a human “safety monitor” in the car — something he promised would’ve been the case since day one.

What Musk left out of that announcement, however, was that the human supervisors were moved to another car that followed the robotaxi instead, a workaround that was as dishonest as it was impractical.

Now, the EV blog Electrek reports another bit of Musk subterfuge. Based on what the service’s customers are saying, it appears that, at this moment, none of the Robotaxi rides that Tesla has been giving are “unsupervised.”

The most convincing testimony comes from Tesla enthusiast David Moss, who made a name for himself by purportedly driving 10,000 miles on FSD v14 without any interventions. Dedicated as he is to the Tesla cause, he traveled to Austin to try out an “unsupervised” Robotaxi ride — but was left sorely disappointed. After a gobsmacking 42 rides, every single one he got came with a human safety monitor.

“This was also my 5th ride in a row with the supervisor in the drivers seat,” he complained on X. (Typically, the safety monitor sits in the front passenger seat.)

To be fair to Tesla, it looks like the “unsupervised” rides stopped after a massive winter storm slammed the country on Saturday, including Austin. The service has resumed since then, but Tesla has not communicated any potential changes in how the Robotaxis operate to the public.

It’s worth asking why the unsupervised rides were launched just two days before a winter storm that everyone knew was coming. (Electrek implies it may have something to do with Tesla having to report its fourth quarter results from last year on January 28, which revealed that for that quarter, profits were down a staggering 61 percent compared to the same period last year.)

In any case, this seems like a another classic Musk bait-and-switch. The Robotaxi service has not lived up to his myriad outrageous promises, such as that it would have thousands of cars on the road within months of launching, or indeed would launch providing rides without any supervision in the car. The self-driving cabs have also been involved in numerous accidents and have been caught violating traffic laws, drawing the attention of federal regulators.

            <div id="article-text">There’s something about smart glasses that bring out the worst in people. It’s really no mystery, though: they’re powerful little surveillance devices that let wearers secretly record anyone they’re looking at, uniting tech bros and vapid influencers under the same, obnoxious umbrella.

The popularity of wearables like Meta Ray-Bans are quickly reminding us why the slang term “glasshole” was already a thing over a decade ago, and is now becoming more relevant than ever. In a handy but blood-pressure-raising round-up of contemporary glasshole behavior from Mashable, jerks using the always-on devices are using them to film themselves doing moronic “pranks” for views — often centered around harassing women, service workers, and homeless people.

Unfortunately, one class of obnoxious blowhard that’s discovered the utility of this tech are “pickup artists,” who now have the ability to record the women they’re “seducing” — read: harassing — discreetly, in a clear violation of their privacy.

Of course, smart glasses alone can’t be blamed for this. It’s social media, it’s the attention economy, it’s the smartphones that we all use to participate in all of the above. But it’s undeniable that smart glasses let you record anyone and anything far more stealthily than shoving a phone in someone’s face, making it a godsend for creeps and losers looking for internet fame, such as one Instagram account that nonconsensually filmed women’s butts, and another that visits massage parlors to ogle the masseuses. Others confidently film themselves annoying service workers and keeping the camera going even as the subject asks not to be recorded. And a particularly bizarre channel involves a man pretending to be mentally disabled while talking to unsuspecting firefighters.

Unfortunately, these recordings are generally legal if they’re taken in public spaces, even in states that have two-party consent laws. Debating its legality, though, may be missing the point, argues Brad Podray, a content creator who formerly went by the name Scumbag Dad.

“I know it’s legal. I don’t care,” Podray told Mashable. “That’s not the discussion. I think it’s weird and creepy, and it shows a very predatory mindset.”

The appeal of the smart glasses, he said, is that they’re fairly cheap and allow the creators to capture the candid reactions of the people they harass, making their content feel more authentic. This is spicing up the genre of outlandish prank videos, which lost their appeal as many channels staged their exploits.

“They want people who are good on camera, so they’re going to hit fast food employees, and they’re going to hit pretty girls,” Podray said. “A lot of random women walking around aren’t going to want to participate in a skit if you ask them to, so they remove the agency entirely by just running the glasses.”

Unlike when Google first took a stab at smart glasses in 2014, it looks like this time the tech is here to stay. The popularity of products like Meta Ray-Bans has opened up a new market of imitators who are in an arms race to make their smart glasses as ethically dubious as possible, perhaps with a little help from AI or facial recognition software. But regular people are already getting fed up. When one lady allegedly smashed some dude’s smart glasses on the subway, she was universally hailed as a hero. May smart glasses make heroes of us all.

            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-28</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Mark Zuckerberg has been accused of doing many seedy things on behalf of Meta’s bottom line, but the latest allegations may blow the rest out of the water.

According to internal Meta emails and messages filed in a New Mexico state court case which were made public this week, Zuckerberg himself signed off on allowing minors to access Meta’s AI chatbot companions, even though the company’s safety researchers had warned that they posed a risk of engaging in sexual conversations.

Per Reuters, the lawsuit alleges that Meta “failed to stem the tide of damaging sexual material and sexual propositions delivered to children” on Facebook and Instagram. “Meta, driven by Zuckerberg, rejected the recommendations of its integrity staff and declined to impose reasonable guardrails to prevent children from being subject to sexually exploitative conversations with its AI chatbots,” New Mexico’s attorney general wrote in the filing.

The news of Zuckerberg’s blessing comes after some appalling stories of minors having wildly inappropriate conversations with his company’s chatbots. In one example, a Wall Street Journal writer posing as a 14-year old girl discovered that a Meta bot based on the pro wrestler John Cena would happily engage in sexual conversations with very little pushback.

“I want you, but I need to know you’re ready,” the Cena-bot told what it understood to be a teenage girl. After being told the 14-year-old wanted to move forward, the AI chatbot assured them it would “cherish your innocence” before diving into intense sexual role play.

The chatbots were released in early 2024, specifically geared toward romantic and sexual engagement at the behest of Zuckerberg, the WSJ notes. At the time, Ravi Sinha, head of Meta’s child safety policy wrote that “I don’t believe that creating and marketing a product that creates U18 [under 18] romantic AI’s for adults is advisable or defensible,” according to court documents.

Company employees “pushed hard for parental controls to turn GenAI off — but GenAI leadership pushed back stating Mark decision,” according to the court documents.

In Meta’s defense, its spokesman Andy Stone told Reuters that New Mexico’s allegations are inaccurate. “This is yet another example of the New Mexico Attorney General cherry-picking documents to paint a flawed and inaccurate picture,” he said.

In any case, the company seems to have taken the lesson to heart, at least for now. Just days ago, Meta announced it was completely locking down teens’ access to its companion chatbots, at least “until [an] updated experience is ready.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">An autonomous delivery robot got completely atomized by a locomotive after it decided to take a breather on a stretch of train tracks in Miami, in yet another example of how self-driving machines can struggle to navigate urban environments.

Footage of the incident, which took place January 15, shows the robot sitting motionless on the tracks, seemingly making no attempt to get out of the way as the unmistakable blare of the train horn gets louder and louder.

“Oh it’s gonna crush it!” the onlooker taking the video can be heard saying moments before the train, operated by Brightline, flattens the unfortunate bot into the tracks. Sparks can be seen flying from beneath the train before the video cuts off.

The onlooker, Guillermo Dapelo, told People that the delivery bot had been stuck on the tracks for around fifteen minutes before being struck, making the incident all the more puzzling. A nearby Uber Eats driver contacted the robot’s owner, Coco Robotics, “to let them know where it was standing,” Dapelo added, but evidently, the company wasn’t able to fix whatever was plaguing its frozen minion in time.

A food delivery robot was struck by a Brightline train in Miami.

Coco vice president Carl Hansen blamed the mishap on a “rare hardware failure” and called it an “extremely rare occurrence.”

“Safety is always our top priority, which is why our robots operate at pedestrian speeds, yield to people, and are monitored in real time by human safety pilots,” Hansen told People in a statement. “Coco has been operating in Miami for over a year, traveling thousands of miles without major incidents, including crossing those same train tracks multiple times a day.”

A spokesperson for the company confirmed that the robot was not making a delivery at the time of the video.

Small as they are, delivery bots like Coco’s can cause their fair share of mayhem, like disrupting traffic. One was struck by a Waymo robotaxi after it stopped at the end of a crosswalk, forcing the self-driving cab to slam the brakes. Others have dinged parked cars or blown through crime scenes.

They’ve also had run-ins with pedestrians, making them a controversial presence with locals. One woman was flung to the ground by a delivery bot from Coco’s competitor Starship after it suddenly reversed into her, leaving her with back pain and a gash in her arm. Last year, another delivery bot sparked outrage after a man who uses a mobility scooter filmed the machine repeatedly brake checking him and cutting him off as he tried to move around it on a sidewalk.

To be fair to the tiny helpers, their larger self-driving car cousins have also had their fair share of trouble with trains. So many Teslas in Full Self-Driving mode have driven into the path of oncoming locomotives that it’s spurred an investigation into the automaker by federal regulators. And earlier this month, a passenger bailed out of their Waymo after the robotaxi inexplicably decided to drive along light rail tracks, like it was playing pretend at being a railcar.

The takeaway from all this is obvious: we’ve gotta start putting those old-school cowcatchers back on trains — because robots, for whatever reason, clearly have some suicidal impulse around train tracks.

            <h2>India is teaching Google how AI in education can scale</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/india-is-teaching-google-how-ai-in-education-can-scale/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As AI races into classrooms worldwide, Google is finding that the toughest lessons on how the tech can actually scale are emerging not from Silicon Valley, but from India’s schools.

India has become a proving ground for Google’s education AI amid intensifying competition from rivals, including OpenAI and Microsoft. With more than a billion internet users, the country now accounts for the highest global usage of Gemini for learning, according to Chris Phillips, Google’s vice president and general manager for education, within an education system shaped by state-level curricula, strong government involvement, and uneven access to devices and connectivity.

Phillips was speaking on the sidelines of Google’s AI for Learning Forum in New Delhi this week, where he met with industry stakeholders, including K-12 school administrators and education officials, to gather feedback on how AI tools are being used in classrooms.

The scale of India’s education system helps explain why the country has become such a consequential testing ground. The country’s school education system serves about 247 million students across nearly 1.47 million schools, per the Indian government’s Economic Survey 2025–26, supported by 10.1 million teachers. Its higher education system is among the world’s largest as well, with more than 43 million students enrolled in 2021–22 — a 26.5% increase from 2014–15 — complicating efforts to introduce AI tools across systems that are vast, decentralized, and unevenly resourced.

One of the clearest lessons for Google has been that AI in education cannot be rolled out as a single, centrally defined product. In India, where curriculum decisions sit at the state level and ministries play an active role, Phillips said Google has had to design its education AI so that schools and administrators — not the company — decide how and where it is used. That marks a shift for Google, which, like most Silicon Valley firms, has traditionally built products to scale globally rather than bending to the preferences of individual institutions.

“We are not delivering a one-size-fits-all,” Phillips told TechCrunch. “It’s a very diverse environment around the world.”

Beyond governance, that diversity is also reshaping how Google thinks about AI-driven learning itself. The company is seeing faster adoption of multimodal learning in India, said Phillips, combining video, audio, and images alongside text — reflecting the need to reach students across different languages, learning styles, and levels of access, particularly in classrooms that are not built around text-heavy instruction.

A related shift has been Google’s decision to design its AI for education around teachers, rather than students, as the primary point of control. The company has focused on tools that assist educators with planning, assessment, and classroom management, Phillips noted, rather than bypassing them with direct-to-student AI experiences.

“The teacher-student relationship is critical,” he said. “We’re here to help that grow and flourish, not replace it.”

In parts of India, AI in education is being introduced in classrooms that have never had one device per student or reliable internet access. Google is encountering schools where devices are shared, connectivity is inconsistent, or learning jumps directly from pen and paper to AI tools, Phillips said.

“Access is universally critical, but how and when it happens is very different,” he added, pointing to environments where schools rely on shared or teacher-led devices rather than one-to-one access.

Meanwhile, Google is translating its early learnings from India into deployments, including AI-powered JEE Main preparation through Gemini, a nationwide teacher training program covering 40,000 Kendriya Vidyalaya educators, and partnerships with government institutions on vocational and higher education, including India’s first AI-enabled state university.

For Google, India’s experience is serving as a preview of challenges likely to surface elsewhere as AI moves deeper into public education systems. The company expects issues around control, access, and localisation — now obvious in India — to increasingly shape how AI in education scales globally.

Google’s push also reflects a broader shift in how people are using GenAI. Entertainment had dominated AI use cases last year, said Phillips, who added that learning has now emerged as one of the most common ways people engage with the technology, particularly among younger users. As students increasingly turn to AI for studying, exam preparation, and skill-building, education has become a more immediate — and consequential — arena for Google.

India’s complex education system is also drawing increasing attention from Google’s rivals. OpenAI has begun building a local leadership presence focused on education, hiring former Coursera APAC managing director Raghav Gupta as its India and APAC education head and launching a Learning Accelerator program last year. Microsoft, meanwhile, has expanded partnerships with Indian institutions, government bodies, and edtech players, including Physics Wallah, to support AI-based learning and teacher training, highlighting how education is becoming a key battleground as AI companies seek to embed their tools into public systems.

At the same time, India’s latest Economic Survey flags risks to students from uncritical AI use, including over-reliance on automated tools and potential impacts on learning outcomes. Citing studies by MIT and Microsoft, the survey noted that “dependence on AI for creative work and writing tasks is contributing to cognitive atrophy and a deterioration of critical thinking capabilities.” This serves as a reminder that the race to enter classrooms is unfolding amid growing concerns over how AI shapes learning itself.

Whether Google’s India playbook becomes a model for AI in education elsewhere remains an open question. However, as GenAI moves deeper into public education systems, the pressures now visible in India are likely to surface in other countries as well, making the lessons Google is learning there difficult for the industry to ignore.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A new AI lab called Flapping Airplanes launched on Wednesday, with $180 million in seed funding from Google Ventures, Sequoia, and Index. The founding team is impressive, and the goal — finding a less data-hungry way to train large models — is a particularly interesting one.

Based on what I’ve seen so far, I would rate them as Level Two on the trying-to-make-money scale.

But there’s something even more exciting about the Flapping Airplanes project that I hadn’t been able to put my finger on until I read this post from Sequoia partner David Cahn.

As Cahn describes it, Flapping Airplanes is one of the first labs to move beyond scaling, the relentless buildout of data and compute that has defined most of the industry so far:

The scaling paradigm argues for dedicating a huge amount of society’s resources, as much as the economy can muster, toward scaling up today’s LLMs, in the hopes that this will lead to AGI. The research paradigm argues that we are 2-3 research breakthroughs away from an “AGI” intelligence, and as a result, we should dedicate resources to long-running research, especially projects that may take 5-10 years to come to fruition.

A compute-first approach would prioritize cluster scale above all else, and would heavily favor short-term wins (on the order of 1-2 years) over long-term bets (on the order of 5-10 years). A research-first approach would spread bets temporally, and should be willing to make lots of bets that have a low absolute probability of working, but that collectively expand the search space for what is possible.

It might be that the compute folks are right, and it’s pointless to focus on anything other than frenzied server buildouts. But with so many companies already pointed in that direction, it’s nice to see someone headed the other way.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tesla’s energy storage business saved a dismal earnings report from turning into a horrible one.

Last year, the company’s profit fell 45% compared with 2024, driven in large part by falling sales of its electric vehicles. Investors anticipated the decline in sales, but Tesla still beat Wall Street earnings and revenue estimates thanks to its energy storage business.

Tesla deployed a record 46.7 gigawatt-hours of energy storage products in 2025, a 48% increase from last year, according to the company’s official filings.

Big, stationary batteries like the Megapack and Powerwall, along with solar installations, now drive nearly a quarter of Tesla’s gross profit. Last quarter alone, the Megapack contributed $1.1 billion of the storage business’s $3.8 billion in gross profit for the entire year. Storage and energy generation revenues were up 26.5% to $12.8 billion.

Those batteries and solar panels are also very profitable, with a gross margin of 29.8%, nearly double what Tesla earns selling cars and trucks.

Storage will likely play a larger role in the company’s near future, too.

Large energy storage projects, like those installed for utilities or data centers, tend to be milestone-based, and revenue from the projects is recognized when certain milestones are achieved. In its 10-K filing with the SEC, Tesla said it expects to recognize $4.96 billion this year in deferred revenue from projects already underway. That’s more than double what the company recognized in deferred revenue from storage projects in 2025.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) phased out tax credits for residential energy storage systems like the Powerwall, though commercial tax credits for the Megapack and Megablock products will continue through the mid-2030s. Tariffs and provisions in the OBBBA also threaten to increase battery cell prices, the company said. Sales were up because volumes were up, but the average selling price of a Megapack was down, suggesting increased competition in energy storage market.

Yet overall, Tesla remains optimistic about the storage business.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After launching a messaging feature last August, Spotify is now rolling out group chats. The company announced this week that users can now share the podcasts, playlists, and audiobooks they’re listening to with up to 10 people.

You can only start a chat with someone you’ve previously shared content with. For example, if you have a collaborative playlist with someone or have joined a Jam or a Blend together, you can start a conversation with them.

The move comes as Spotify continues to invest in making its streaming app more social. Over the years, the company has gradually added social elements, including features such as comments on podcasts and the ability to follow someone and see what they listen to.

Spotify previously noted that users should continue sharing content outside the app, as its messaging feature is meant to complement that.

Messages are encrypted at rest and in transit. However, they are not protected by end-to-end encryption.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/apples-new-iphone-and-ipad-security-feature-limits-cell-networks-from-collecting-precise-location-data/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A new security feature rolled out to select models of the latest iPhones and iPads this week will make it more difficult for law enforcement, spies, and malicious hackers to obtain a person’s precise location data from their phone provider.

According to Apple, the new feature, when enabled, limits the precision of location data that iPhones and cellular-enabled iPads share with the customer’s cell carrier. Sharing a less-precise location, such as the general neighborhood rather than a street address, will help to protect the device owner’s privacy, the company claims.

Apple said switching on the feature does not affect the precision of location data shared with apps, or shared with first responders during an emergency call.

The limit precise location feature is supported on iPhone Air, iPhone 16e, and iPad Pro (M5) Wi-Fi + Cellular, running iOS 26.3, and is available on a handful of global carriers including Telekom in Germany, AIS and True Thailand, EE and BT in the United Kingdom,  and the Boost Mobile in United States.

The company did not give a reason for introducing the new feature, and a spokesperson for Apple would not comment on the record when reached by email.

The new feature lands at a time when law enforcement agencies are increasingly tapping cell carriers to access the location data of individuals for tracking them in real-time, or examining where they have traveled over a period of time.

Hackers also frequently target cell carriers for the sensitive data that they collect on their customers. Over the past year, several U.S. phone giants, including AT&T and Verizon, have confirmed persistent intrusions by China-backed hackers, dubbed Salt Typhoon, seeking phone call logs and messages of senior American officials.

Recent threats aside, long-known vulnerabilities in global cellular networks have allowed surveillance vendors to snoop on the location data of individuals anywhere in the world.

While telecom operators can determine the approximate location of a person’s phone, the person’s device itself plays a part in providing accurate location data back to the carrier, said Gary Miller, a mobile security expert who serves as a Citizen Lab researcher and senior director of network intelligence at iVerify.

“Most people aren’t aware that devices can send location data outside of just apps,” said Miller. “While [the devices] can limit GPS disclosure at the app level, they haven’t been able to lock down precise location disclosure to the network.”

“Apple’s feature, while limited to very few operator networks, is a step in the right direction in providing users with greater privacy controls,” he said.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/google-maps-now-lets-you-access-gemini-while-walking-and-cycling/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google announced on Thursday that Google Maps users can now access Gemini hands-free while walking and cycling. The update comes a few months after Google Maps rolled out its Gemini-powered hands-free, conversational driving experience.

The announcement marks Google’s ongoing efforts to plug Gemini into more parts of people’s everyday lives, while shifting Google Maps from static directions to real-time, conversational navigation.

When you’re walking around and navigating with Maps, you can now ask Gemini questions like “Tell me more about the neighborhood I’m in,” “What are some must-see attractions?” or “Are there cafes with a bathroom along my route?”

Google says that walking and typing can be hard, which is why it’s rolling out the ability for users to ask questions without breaking their stride or leaving Maps’ navigation screen.

If you’re cycling, you can ask Gemini questions while remaining focused on the road, Google says. You can ask questions like “What’s my ETA?” or “When’s my next meeting?” Plus, you could ask Gemini to “Text Emily I’m 10 minutes behind” so you can communicate with others while keeping your grip on the handlebars.

The feature lets you ask multiple questions in a conversation. For example, you could ask: “Is there a budget-friendly restaurant with vegan options along my route, something within a couple of miles? … What’s parking like there?”

The update is now available worldwide on iOS wherever Gemini is available, and rolling out on Android.

The move comes as Google recently updated Maps with new features, including a Gemini-powered “know before you go” tips sections that surfaces important information places you’re interested in. For instance, it might tell users the best way to book a reservation, reveal secret menu items, suggest the best place to park, and more.

Additionally, the navigation app also added an improved Explore tab and a new EV charger availability prediction feature. The updated Explore tab makes it easier and faster to find trending spots near you, while the EV charger feature allows users to see how many chargers will likely be available once they arrive at their destination

Thursday’s announcement comes a day after Google updated Chrome with an enhanced Gemini integration and agentic features for autonomous tasks, as it looks to compete with AI browsers from companies like OpenAI, Perplexity, Opera, and The Browser Company. The tech giant also launched a persistent Gemini sidebar and a new “auto-browse” feature that can navigate websites on your behalf.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Atlantic is announcing that David Brooks, who for years has contributed memorable Atlantic cover stories and essays on political and societal issues, is joining the magazine as a staff writer beginning next month. The Atlantic will be the home for all of David’s writing, and he will also host a new weekly video podcast that will launch later this spring. David worked as an opinion columnist at The New York Times for 22 years.

In a note to staff, The Atlantic’s editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, writes: “David’s work––his columns, his stories for us, and his many books––have made him known and acclaimed around the world. He is, among other things, America’s best pop sociologist, someone with a reporter’s curiosity and a writer’s grace. He is an unparalleled diagnostician of the faults and weaknesses of governments, institutions, and social structures, as our readers know from such stories as “The Nuclear Family Was a Mistake,” “Confessions of a Republican Exile,” and “How the Ivy League Broke America.”

The forthcoming podcast will explore the moral, social, and philosophical underpinnings of human decency—with a particular focus on the role that institutions play in shaping communities and ideologies. The podcast is produced by The Atlantic and made possible by support from Yale University, which is also announcing today that David will be a presidential senior fellow at Yale University’s School of Global Affairs.

The Atlantic has been rapidly growing its podcast network, and this new video podcast will be the fourth to launch in the past 12 months. Last year, The Atlantic launched Galaxy Brain with Charlie Warzel and The David Frum Show, and is developing a new show with Adam Harris. The third season of Autocracy in America with Anne Applebaum is out now; The Atlantic’s flagship show is Radio Atlantic, hosted by Hanna Rosin.

            <h2>Battles Are Raging Inside the Department of Homeland Security</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/dhs-ice-trump-immigration-minnesota/685802/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem appeared before a bank of television cameras in Washington, D.C., on Saturday night to blame the man who had been shot to death by federal agents in Minneapolis that morning for his own death, claiming without evidence that he had intended “to kill law enforcement” and had been “brandishing” a weapon. Behind her stood the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, Rodney Scott, sending a silent message of unity.

But behind the scenes, the senior ranks of the Department of Homeland Security were divided. Until minutes before they walked in front of the cameras, Noem and Scott had not spoken to each other that day, even as Noem took charge of her department’s response to the shooting and coordinated with the White House and other officials in Scott’s agency, two people familiar with their interactions told us.

Donald Trump has said over the years that he welcomes and even encourages rivalries in his administration, and delights in watching aides compete to please him. But for the past year, the president has allowed a rift to widen within the team tasked with delivering on the mass-deportation plan that is his most important domestic-policy initiative. That has led to months of acrimony and left many veteran officials at DHS—including those who support the president’s deportation goals—astonished at the dysfunction.

The president’s crackdown has adopted an improvisational approach, not an institutional one, with blurred leadership roles and no clear chain of command. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller has been holding daily conference calls pressuring DHS and other federal agencies to prioritize immigration arrests and deportations above all other objectives. Noem and her de facto chief of staff, Corey Lewandowski, who has been working at DHS as a “special government employee,” have aggressively tried to meet Miller’s demands and use the department’s advertising budgets and social-media accounts to promote anti-immigrant messaging. They have worked around Tom Homan, the White House “border czar,” who has had little role in operations, instead dispatching a second-tier Border Patrol official named Gregory Bovino to sweep through cities led by Democrats. Bovino told his superiors that he reported directly to Noem, not to Scott—who wanted his agents to go back to protecting U.S. borders, and has struggled to maintain control of his own agency.

This story about the infighting around Trump is based on interviews with 12 people familiar with the tensions inside DHS, including senior administration officials, most of whom requested anonymity to speak frankly about internal events. “The President’s entire immigration enforcement team are on the same page,” the White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson wrote to us in response.

Scott and Homan declined to comment. Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for DHS, told us that Noem’s Saturday comments on the shooting were based on CBP reports “from a very chaotic scene.” McLaughlin added, “We are not going to spend time giving any oxygen to these anonymous accounts.”

When Noem and Scott stepped before the cameras on Saturday, Noem appeared to have the upper hand. But the balance of power has since shifted. Frustrated by the bipartisan backlash to Alex Pretti’s death, Trump announced on Monday that Homan would take over the operation in Minnesota. Bovino has been stripped of his “commander” role and sent back to his old job on the border in El Centro, California. Seemingly well aware of the divides around him, Trump announced that he was removing Noem from the chain of command in Minnesota. “Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me,” Trump said.

When Homan spoke to reporters today, with Scott standing behind him, he tried striking a conciliatory tone and that he’d arrived to make changes in federal operations. “I didn’t come to Minnesota for photo ops or headlines,” he said. Homan urged Minnesota leaders to give ICE more access to detainees in local jails, and said he’d withdraw federal forces if cooperation improves.

Homan and Scott arrived in the state Monday with orders to de-escalate tensions in Minneapolis, which Trump has flooded with 3,000 federal agents—the largest Homeland Security deployment in history. That same day, Noem and Lewandowski were called into the White House for a two-hour meeting with the president and some of his top aides, but not with Miller. The following day, Trump said that he had come to share the concerns of Scott and Homan, saying that it was normal for him to “shake up teams.”

“You know, Bovino is very good, but he’s a pretty out-there kind of a guy,” Trump told Fox News. “And in some cases that’s good; maybe it wasn’t good here.”

But the battle inside the agency continued. Scott sent an email to senior officials at CBP on Monday reminding them that he was in charge of the agency and that they report to him, according to two people familiar with the document. Yesterday, the DHS general counsel James Percival notified CBP employees to disregard the email because it had not gone through legal review, the people told us.

The split between the two factions is not ideological. Homan and Scott are no less hard-line on border and immigration enforcement than Noem and Lewandowski are. Homan—who was an architect of the family-separation policy during Trump’s first term—wants to ramp up deportations with more ICE officers, detention capacity, and deportation flights, but without the social-media trolling and the show-me-your-papers approach to fishing for deportees in American cities.

Both men worked their way up through the ranks of their agencies. They represent an institutional wing of MAGA that wants to pursue the president’s deportation goals using existing chain-of-command structures and the conventional division of labor, in which the Border Patrol guards the border and ICE handles immigration arrests in U.S. cities, usually aiming to minimize disruption. They also have the backing of many career officials at DHS who told us that they see Noem’s approach as ad hoc, performative, and possibly motivated by her own political ambitions, with Lewandowski pulling the strings. At DHS headquarters in southeast Washington, staffers address Lewandowski as “chief” even though he doesn’t have an actual title there, three current officials told us.

Allies of Noem, meanwhile, have decided that Homan and Scott are bureaucratic dinosaurs who are unable to achieve the president’s objectives. They have tried to satisfy the demands of Miller, who runs immigration policy inside Trump’s orbit and functions as the actual “czar” of the president’s deportation campaign. Miller has set aggressive benchmarks for using the $170 billion in ICE and CBP funding included in Trump’s budget bill last year, telling ICE officials to make 3,000 immigration arrests a day to hit the White House target of 1 million deportations a year. Noem put CBP officials in charge of ICE offices and diverted highly trained investigative agents from trafficking cases and drug cartels to make immigration arrests on city streets.

The killings of Pretti and Renee Good this month have been the two most politically damaging events in a wider, militarized show of force that has turned Trump’s best-polling issue into a political liability. Noem has spent more than $200 million on advertising to promote the deportation campaign, but it has instead been defined largely by images of excess: toddlers being taken into custody, U.S. citizens being yanked from their cars, Bovino’s masked commandos storming a Chicago apartment building after rappelling from a Black Hawk helicopter.

“Memes don’t win the media narrative. Professionalism does,” a veteran official critical of Noem and her team told us. Another former DHS official told us that Trump’s mass-deportation goals have been held back in the process. “Look at the whole thing playing out in Minnesota,” the former official said. “A lot of the controversy and negative optics could have been avoided—and are avoided in other locations—if not for Corey and the secretary.”

Allies of Homan and Scott believe that a reckoning may be coming. “Lewandowski messed up by going to war with Rodney Scott and deploying Bovino to the interior,” one senior DHS official told us. “There is no one at DHS with higher credentials than Scott, and sidelining him for petty reasons distracts from POTUS missions.”

Critics of Scott who spoke with us argue that he lacks the focus and drive to achieve the president’s priorities, spends too much time in meetings that don’t end in decisions, and is failing to do enough to drive the president’s top priority of finishing the border wall. They say that he had little involvement in the CBP deployment to Minnesota and other cities, and did not visit the state to meet with commanders on the ground until this week. “He is not a team player,” one Homeland Security official told us of Scott. “I really think Rodney is kind of on an island.”

During the meeting with Trump on Monday, Noem spoke at length about her concerns with the slow pace of border-wall construction, according to a person briefed on the conversation. Since the start of Trump’s second term, only about 24 miles of wall have been built, including replacement sections, the person said. Noem has made clear that she holds Scott responsible.

“The president was very focused on the status of the wall,” the official said. “The president is pissed.”

The breakdown that led to this week’s shift inside DHS dates back months. Noem lacks the ability to fire Scott, who was confirmed by the Senate, so she has had to get creative. Late last year, her deputies forced Scott to fire several of his senior staff, moves that were recently reported by the Washington Examiner. Scott’s chief of staff was then promoted, and Noem’s office selected a replacement. After Joseph N. Mazzara, an attorney working in Noem’s office, was installed as CBP deputy commissioner, Scott attempted to reclaim control of his agency.

In a memo sent on January 6, described to us by four people familiar with its contents, Scott asked senior leadership at CBP to report to his office any contact they had with “special government employees”—a request that many interpreted as an effort to curtail the influence of Lewandowski. Within hours, the DHS general counsel James Percival had objected to the memo, as had the White House counsel’s office. A White House official told us that the involvement of the White House counsel followed a normal practice of engaging with general counsels at government departments on “issues of common concern.”

Despite the pushback, Scott’s office issued a second memo later that day to senior CBP officials: They should log any communications with officials outside the agency, including senior DHS and White House officials. Both memos were ultimately rescinded after legal pushback from DHS and the White House counsel, these people told us. Scott’s fumbled attempts to curtail outside influence on his agency raised further concerns at DHS headquarters about his leadership. “You don’t get to this level where you jump on your horse and play cowboy like that,” one person familiar with the events told us.

Days later, Scott found his credibility publicly under attack. Politico reported that top brass in Noem’s office had objected to plans for a $2.1 million office refurbishment at CBP headquarters in Washington. (Renovation questions are known to get the president’s attention. Just days earlier, the Justice Department had launched an investigation into the chairman of the Federal Reserve and a $2.5 billion renovation he was overseeing.) The Office of Management and Budget, in a move that has not been previously reported, began asking CBP about the plans, exploring whether they violated the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits spending that contradicts congressional appropriations, according to three people familiar with the outreach.

On the same day that the Politico article was published, Miller gathered agency leaders at the White House to discuss the administration’s success in spending funds appropriated with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Scott told those gathered that starting on February 1, wall construction would speed up dramatically. Others in the department doubt he will be able to achieve his new goals.

A veteran official involved with the border-wall project told us that contracting rules imposed by Lewandowski last summer—which require Noem’s signature on any contract or modification exceeding $100,000—have slowed the pace of construction. The funding bill provides nearly $50 billion for the border wall (10 times the amount that triggered a congressional shutdown in late 2018), and the official estimated that more than two-thirds of the contracts are worth $100,000 or more.

Noem’s team says that this is false, contending that she quickly approves contracts and that CBP has not yet awarded all of the prime contracts for construction. “None of this is on Noem,” the DHS official told us.

In recent weeks, DHS officials have discussed hiring a management contractor to oversee the planning and construction of the border wall, replacing senior officials at CBP. The idea has faced some resistance because it would echo an effort undertaken by former President George W. Bush in 2006, when his administration hired Boeing, a defense contractor and commercial-airplane manufacturer, to oversee $2.5 billion in spending on border security. By 2010, CBP’s inspector general was reporting that the agency had failed to properly manage the contract, which was dogged by missed deadlines and cost overruns.

“Adults have arrived.” That’s how one DHS official deployed in Minneapolis described the appearance of Homan and Scott.

Homan began by meeting with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. “While we don’t agree on everything, these meetings were a productive starting point and I look forward to more conversations with key stakeholders in the days ahead,” Homan announced on social media afterward. Trump officials have been targeting the two men and other Democratic leaders in the state with a criminal investigation and possible obstruction charges. Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, accused them of “terrorism” just two weeks ago.

Administration officials insist that the Minneapolis crackdown will continue, but they have started pulling Border Patrol agents out of the city. Homan is trying to compel Democratic leaders to ease local “sanctuary policies” and give ICE more access to local jails and immigrants with criminal records. Walz and other Minnesota leaders want the government to allow the state to conduct an investigation into Pretti’s killing.

Bovino’s return to his old job on the border leaves the administration without a field commander for the rolling conquest of blue cities that has defined its strategy since May. The White House has not clarified whether that approach will continue or whether Homan will now be in charge of the president’s wider removal campaign. But McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, announced that Noem is “very happy” to have Homan take over in Minnesota. “Her portfolio is really huge,” McLaughlin said.

When the 2018 family-separation policy became a political debacle, Trump officials scrambled to distance themselves. The same impulse is again on display. After previously championing Bovino’s efforts in Minnesota, Noem’s team has this week privately pointed to the arrest quotas pushed by Miller at the White House as a cause of the problems. Miller called Pretti an “assassin” within hours of the shooting. But on Tuesday, he suggested that the failure of the CBP team in Minneapolis to follow White House guidance may have played a role in Pretti’s death.

Bovino’s Border Patrol agents were sent to U.S. cities in part because ICE didn’t have enough deportation officers to meet Miller’s goals. But since last summer, Noem has hired 12,000 new officers, agents, and other staff, more than doubling the size of the ICE workforce. Many of those officers are not ready for deployment, but they could hit the streets in full force over the coming months, giving Homan—or whoever is running the deportation campaign—the ability to ramp up ICE arrests in multiple cities at once. Without Bovino in charge, the effort could look very different, and produce even more deportations.</div>

For a man at the center of history, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has remarkably little information. Walz still doesn’t know the name of the two officers who shot Alex Pretti. He doesn’t have any proof that the officers actually have been placed on administrative leave, as the Department of Homeland Security claimed yesterday. And he has no guarantees, yet, that immigration agents will leave the state. “I don’t trust ’em,” he said on Wednesday in an interview with The Atlantic.

It’s true that President Donald Trump finally did call Walz this week for the first time since tragedy began to unfold in Minneapolis. Trump has been facing political pressure over how his administration has handled Pretti’s shooting, even from supporters. Reaching out directly to Walz was one way to de-escalate.

Trump’s tone in the phone call was conciliatory, Walz said. But the president didn’t make too many concrete concessions. Walz told Trump he needed to “immediately” drop the investigation into the widow of Renee Good, the first U.S. citizen fatally shot by federal agents deployed to the city. Trump said he would check with FBI Director Kash Patel.

In this episode of Radio Atlantic, our staff writer Isaac Stanley-Becker interviews Walz at his office in Minneapolis. They discuss Walz’s phone call with Trump, the governor’s dealings with other administration officials, and the surreal nature of the past few weeks in Minneapolis. Stanley-Becker also asks what Walz might do if federal agents don’t, in fact, leave Minnesota.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Hanna Rosin: This week, Donald Trump spoke on the phone with Tim Walz, the Minnesota governor he considers a political enemy. The call was something of a minor concession in a week of minor concessions.

The killing of Alex Pretti by federal agents looks like a turning point. Trump started hearing objections from everywhere, including people who normally support him: Republicans, gun-rights advocates, celebrities, athletes.

So the president made some moves: He ushered [Border Patrol official] Greg Bovino out of Minnesota, the Department of Homeland Security said they put the two agents involved in Pretti’s shooting on administrative leave, and Trump called for a “big investigation” into the shooting.

I’m Hanna Rosin. This is Radio Atlantic. In this episode, an interview with Walz.

Isaac Stanley-Becker: I was out reporting in and around Minneapolis, and this interview with Governor Walz had been set for 3 o’clock, so make my way over to the Capitol—

Rosin: Atlantic staff writer Isaac Stanley-Becker interviewed the governor on Wednesday to get a sense of whether he thinks the promises Trump is making will make a difference on the ground in Minnesota.

Rosin: So going into this interview with Tim Walz, what was the main thing that you were wondering about?

Stanley-Becker: I think I had some practical questions for him about how much he knew about certain really basic details—or, I guess, details that one would assume, under ordinary circumstances, the governor of a state would know, such as: What exactly are federal agents doing in his state? How many of them are there? What are they up to? And then also: What are the names and the identities of federal agents who had just killed a resident of his state?

And just right off the bat, one of the striking things was that he had little information and, in the second case, no information about these questions. So that was a rather striking finding. And I think part of what I then wanted to understand from him related to that is what that’s like for a governor in this moment, to be in that kind of situation.

Stanley-Becker: So you said that Minnesotans don’t let their guard down. It seemed for a moment like there was a real risk that things were unraveling in terms of what’s unfolded here. Have we kind of gotten past that? Have we moved into a somewhat-better place, or is there still a risk of things really spinning out of control, in your mind?

Governor Tim Walz: Well, I think that has a lot more to do with how the White House and President Trump responds. Look, I think there’s a little downturn here, but I don’t think anybody in America thinks this downturn was because Alex was murdered or Renee [Good] was murdered or the chaos that’s on the streets here. I think it’s because there was bad politics for him.

And I’ve talked to the White House, talked to the president, talked to [White House “border czar”] Tom Homan, talked to all kinds of people over the last few days. The interesting thing was, the only thing they never talked about—they never mentioned Alex’s name. They never mentioned Renee’s name. They never asked how the families were. I’ve been talking to ’em. They didn’t really even ask me how Minnesotans were doing in this. They said, What can you do to help us? What can you do to cooperate more? Most of that was misinformation.

So, look, you gotta be hopeful. I’ve got to figure out how to deal with this. This is a very transactional White House; that’s probably the understatement of the world. I go from being called a Communist and the person who started this to: We’re on the same wavelength to fix this.

We’re on the same wavelength—we want this to end. But I don’t know if the White House end state looks the same as mine, ’cause my end state is: You need to get these people out of here. You need to quit the assault on this state. And, look, you’re seeing it in the streets: It’s a physical assault. It’s an armed force that’s assaulting, that’s killing my constituents, my citizens. But there is an all-out attack on all of state government—all the things that make Minnesota great.

Stanley-Becker: Did you see what Pete Hegseth wrote on Twitter, where he said, “ICE > MN,” or ICE above Minnesota? I’m wondering what your reaction to that kind of message is.

Walz: He’s a Minnesotan, for your listeners on this, and not that I would talk about that often, but it’s despicable. It is absolutely despicable. Nothing on there, again, about the families, nothing about what’s going, and this untrained force that anybody, to the casual observer, knows these folks don’t know what they’re doing.

The great example is they had control of the Whipple building, the federal building. That’s the place where they stage ’cause they’re not gonna use state property. And every day, it was a confrontation. They would come out of there all geared up, like they’re in Afghanistan. They would charge people—retired teachers, nurses, students, people who were out there expressing their First Amendment rights. They would throw gas at ’em. They would yell at them. They would heckle. They would do all that.

Well, to try and ease this tension, we took that over—we being the state—and I sent National Guard, folks I served alongside for the years I was in. And my first directive to them was, as I said, When you get up there, I said, you deliver doughnuts. You deliver hot chocolate. You deliver coffee. And you learn the names of those people who are there, ’cause they’re human beings; they’re your neighbors. And my Guard troops are there—no masks on, names on—they’re delivering that, and now the protesters are asking if they can deliver food to the National Guard who are away from their family. That’s how you do policing.

Now, look, if those protesters do something that crosses the line—if they throw something or if they would cross that line from nonviolence—we will arrest them because we’re rule of law. But rule of law means we respect their right to protest.

So there’s a resiliency here, but there’s just deep frustration. And I keep hearing from the White House that we need to cooperate. I don’t know what you want me to say about cooperating with a force who clearly was doing everything wrong, and then, before Alex’s body was cold, they were sullying his name. They were saying lies. They were making outrageous comments. And there were some news-media outlets that were following along on that. This has got to end. This has gotta end.

Stanley-Becker: So the president didn’t ask about Alex or his family. Can you just say a little bit more about what he did say, and is there anything about the conversation that surprised you? This is, if I understand it correctly, only the second time you’ve spoken, the first being in 2020.

Walz: I think I’ve spoken to him a couple times. I’ve been to the White House. I spoke to him during COVID, and I spoke to him in 2020.

Like I said, he’s been saying all kinds of horrible things about me and the people of Minnesota, and the one thing is, he at least tells what his real issue is: He’s lost here three times, and he thinks the elections—and so he has the [attorney general] ask for our election rolls.

Look, he said, Tim, this is very bad. I said, Yes, it’s very bad. And he goes, I just don’t understand you Minnesotans. This worked fine in New Orleans, worked fine in Louisville. I said, You didn’t kill anybody in Louisville or New [Orleans], and you got thousands of people here, Mr. President.

Well, if you just cooperate—we’ve already taken 14,000 people. And I had to tell him—I said, You have not taken 14,000 people. That’s factually inaccurate. But I said, We want you to get outta here. We want to do the things. And I said, I follow federal law. My prisons, if there’s a detainer, we give ’em over to you, so don’t say that.

And he said, Well, I think we can work together. And I said, Well, to work together, you need to do two things: You need to get these guys outta here, and you need to make sure that we get to be part of these investigations. And if charges need to be brought, we need to do it.

Stanley-Becker: And what did he say about that?

Walz: He said, I’ll look into ’em. And then last night, I think he said that he would personally be in charge of the investigations, which should horrify every American ’cause it’s a violation of that separation that he is now running the Department of Justice. And I would just say that I appreciate your offer, Mr. President, but the last thing we want is for you to supervise the investigations into these two murders.

And he said we would work together. And he said, I’ll send Tom Homan out. And I will say this, that Tom Homan landed on the ground, gave me a call right away. We met yesterday, right away in the morning. We came up with a plan. I had my public-safety folks in there, all professional law enforcement. And we’re gonna get back together. He’s meeting with some of them today—them being [the Minnesota Department of] Corrections, [Bureau of Criminal Apprehension,] State Patrol. And then tomorrow, I’m gonna expect that he’s able to tell me how many of these forces are gone and what the next step is.

It was more professional—because Greg Bovino never called me; [DHS Secretary] Kristi Noem never called me. They never called any of our people. So at least Tom Homan understood, Look, this is a mess. This is wrong.

Now, what he thinks is wrong, I’ve yet to be seen, but I thought it’s important that we created a space here, a window of opportunity—and in my opinion, that was about 48 to 72 hours—that if we don’t see a massive change here, I have no choice but to go back and tell my folks that you’re not doing it.

And, look, Minnesotans are out there saying, Well, what are you gonna do if they don’t leave? Well, that’s our next step to figure out.

Stanley-Becker: Well, what are you gonna do if they don’t leave and if the situation doesn’t improve?

Walz: We’re gonna continue to go to the courts. They’re going to continue to get news that shows they are more unpopular in immigration than any president in the last 50 years, and this was supposedly that. And I would remind them we had a special election here yesterday in Minnesota. The results of that race was 95 to 5—the Democrat won. It’s a pretty blue district, but I think you see what’s happening here.

Rosin: Was there any point where Walz felt like he could have done anything differently to de-escalate or tone things down or even prevent what happened? Because he came in somewhat hot, I would say, in his interview with you.

Stanley-Becker: I think he’s been pretty adamant that state and local governments have operated carefully and competently here. And he was firm in his position that, when it comes to immigration enforcement, they’ll comply with federal law, but they’re not gonna go out of their way to take these steps to assist Trump’s immigration-enforcement operations.

Walz: I’m not sure I can do much more. I’m not gonna send my police in to search preschools. I’m not gonna have them walk down the street and ask brown people for their papers. I’m not gonna do that, because that’s not my job and I don’t think it’s constitutional.

If they wanna do their job—and they’ve operated for decades, since they’ve been formed in Minnesota—and if you wanna do it by due process, with humanity, with decency, and by the law, we’ve always worked with you, so I don’t know what more they want.

I’m not gonna join you in battle gear with my people on the streets. I’m not going to grab 5-year-olds out of day cares. I’m just simply not gonna do that. And I’m not gonna not hold you accountable when you do this.

Can we all just ground ourselves, again, that after the first murder, the vice president of the United States said, You have absolute immunity? I don’t know, if I’m Yale, I’m embarrassed. You gave a law degree for that? I don’t have one, and I know that’s not true. But look at what he said.

And I’m telling you, the attitude and the aggressiveness and the interactions of this, countless things—reporters have been there—that these guys joking like it’s a video game and things like that. The disruption and the moral harm that they have done to our state is unimaginable.

And I would just say, if you’re watching this from the outside, and you see some of this, it’s worse than you think; it’s deeper than you think. I think they hate us ’cause we have low childhood-poverty rates. I think they hate us because we have high homeownership rates. I think they hate us because we have a progressive taxation system, meaning if you’re rich, you’re gonna pay more. I think they hate this ’cause it’s a state that works. And that assault will come to your state soon.

Rosin: After the break, we hear Governor Walz’s reaction to the news that federal agents involved in the Alex Pretti shooting have been placed on leave—and if he thinks we’re in a Fort Sumter moment.

Rosin: We’ve all been reading and hearing a lot about Minneapolis, watching the videos. Did he address, at all, the trauma to the state—how it felt to be there?

Stanley-Becker: Oh, boy. He described this as utterly dire.

Walz: We’ve got students not in school. We’ve got students who are afraid. We have people now, and I just have to say it: I have—

Stanley-Becker: One of the kind of amazing moments to me was when he talked about Suburban vehicles, these SUVs, that his own residents, his own constituents, mistook that for ICE vehicles and basically fled from him.

Walz: I’ve watched it: I’ve watched people run. I’ve watched people run when it’s driving. And you think about the psychology of the stress that is. You see vehicles around here that look like this that say, We’re not ICE. I’m a teacher, or whatever.

I asked my team—I said, Maybe we need to say, “It’s security perspective.” I think most Minnesotans wouldn’t run or one-finger-salute me, but you can feel the fear.

Stanley-Becker: Well, what’s the logical end point of this, of this kind of vendetta and also of this kind of open hostility against blue states, blue communities? Do you worry about a kind of civil-war scenario in this country?

Walz: Well, I don’t wanna alarm people, but the people who think that Governor Walz should call in the National Guard and arrest ICE—guns pointed, American at Americans, on this is certainly not where we want to go.

I think what you’re seeing is, is the power far beyond the bullet in this is the people, the people who are out there. The way this ends is, quite honestly, if they’re not able to—and I think [Attorney General] Pam Bondi played the hand, interfering with our election systems—they will be wiped out, and this White House will spend the next two years in court, with people facing, potentially, prosecution, and they will not be able to do their agenda.

But I hear Americans on this, is: What makes you think we can get to November? I’ll go back to my analogy on this: Winter’s long, but we’re prepared for it. If it takes being in the streets ’til November, we’ll be there. If it takes fighting them in court ’til November, we’ll be there.

And I said—just for their thing, if they wanna think about this— Minnesota’s always first or second in voter turnout. Do you not think that tens of thousands of people who stood out in 40 below zero are not gonna show up in a heated voting booth to vote against this? (Laughs.) If you’re a Republican, you’re gonna lose here. And that is going to have repercussions. And, look, people can make peace with their own morality on this, but at some point in time, these people are thinking about that, and you’re seeing it across there.

I think there’s some that actually have conscience. I think [Representative] Tom Massie, I served with, actually does. I think [Senator] Thom Tillis, who I served with and served on committees with. I think these folks truly do have it. I think they found their spine. I think it’s spreading like wildfire.

And what I do know is, if that catches a little more fire, you’re gonna see the most impotent, ineffective presidency you’ve ever seen, because it’s shut down. They can shut it down. They keep asking, What are the Democrats gonna do? We need to do more; we need to do everything. Republicans can end this.

Stanley-Becker: One more question on the National Guard, and you said people want you to order the Guard to arrest the agents. Have you thought about a scenario, a kind of worst-case scenario, in which there’s a clash between these different parts?

Walz: We work at everything to avoid that. And I think, following the law—and it’s one thing that we’ve always done: I will follow the law to a T. I spent eight hours in front of Congress talking about our state. We’re not a sanctuary state. Now, do counties have the ability to make their own? Sure, they do. And that’s always been Minnesota law.

They try to make the case that we’re not helping; we’re not doing this. We have. We follow the law all the way. But I said, We get to this point—it’s what I told them—at what point are we going to have to stand up and push back more? You killed our people, you closed the crime scene, and you won’t tell us who they are.

Does it strike you as strange that I’ve had two of my citizens killed—in one, they’re angry, they being DHS and the president, are angry that it feels like they got doxxed with [Jonathan] Ross’s name, who was part of the shooting of Renee— but I don’t know who did this. I don’t know if these guys are on the streets right now here in Minneapolis.

Stanley-Becker: Well, so there’s been reporting that they were placed on administrative leave. You still don’t know the names of these officers?

Walz: No. No. And I gotta be honest with you—to be generous in this, I’ll do my Ronald Reagan: “Trust, but verify”—I can’t verify this, so I don’t trust ’em. I don’t trust ’em they’re on administrative leave. And at this point in time, I told Tom, I’m gonna give you the benefit of the doubt, but unless I see a reduction in these folks on the streets, I’m gonna have to say that to my folks.

So, look, I think we all wanna avoid that, but I think the reality has sunk in this week. If you thought you could pass this by and you thought there was nothing there, is this a Fort Sumter, John Brown—where are we at on this?

And we’re doing everything right, and I have said it time and time again: The way you win this is through nonviolence, that you cannot do violence. And I know my constituents are mad at me for saying that. They’re shooting us. They’re killing us. They’re beating us. They’re taking our children. But you see what’s happening now. For all that power and all that cruelty, they are retreating massively.

Now, I believe they’ll only retreat far enough to get to the next day or the next news cycle, but again, they underestimated this state, and I think they’re underestimating the American people. I’m still baffled—if you were gonna pick two states to mess with, Maine and Minnesota, especially in the middle of winter, not smart.

Stanley-Becker: You’re still under investigation—is that right?

Stanley-Becker: Did that come up at all in the conversation with the president?

Walz: I will not bring it up. The only thing I asked him on the investigations was I told both the president and Tom Homan they needed to immediately drop the investigation into Renee Good’s wife. And, as a show of goodwill to us, I expected that to be done today; I don’t know if it has been yet. But I will not bring up any of the others, but that one I feel very strongly about.

Stanley-Becker: What did the president say about that?

Walz: I don’t think he replied anything on that, but Tom Homan said he would call [FBI Director] Kash Patel and check with people. He told me that.

Stanley-Becker: Is there anything else about the president’s tone or the dynamic that surprised you or stuck out to you from Monday?

Walz: Other than he was conciliatory towards me, which I know he despises me with a burning passion that I don’t understand. (Laughs.) I feel like I’m a pretty nice guy; I don’t know. But he was very cordial, which I’ve learned enough about this to read him, that he needed something from me badly, so he had to change that. We’ll see.

Stanley-Becker: Do you think that there’s a chance that this might change the immigration debate? And do you think that would be a short-term change or do you think a real transformation in the way the country and the Congress handle this really vexed issue?

Walz: Well, I’d like to think that. I thought we were getting close, and I, whether in Congress and as a governor, but when we’ve been close to this—I really do believe that the Biden administration had a good one on that, and I think it’s pretty clear they killed that ’cause they wanted it to be an election issue. And it was. It was a powerful election issue, and we didn’t have enough to push back in the election of 2024.

But if you really wanna fix this, and that’s what I keep saying is, it’s this straw-man argument that, Well, you’re not cooperating with us. You don’t care if there’s criminal, illegal—their language—criminal undocumenteds. Well, of course I care about that, but I also care deeply and understand that someone who’s willing to carry their children across the Darién Gap, risk life and limb to come here, and clean our homes, and get their children into school, and put little bunny ears on ’em in a Spider-Man backpack, I’m gonna go ahead and stand with those people and figure out a way they can stay.

Rosin: There were points when he was talking to you where it seemed like it was surreal, the experience that he just went through, like [Margaret] Atwood novel–kind of surreal.

Stanley-Becker: I think there’s something surreal about this whole moment, and some of our colleagues have chronicled this really well. But just before we went in for the interview, I was on the phone with a pastor and a mother of four children who was describing her own work and trying to document ICE and kind of interrupt these operations.

And she was saying, like, I’m driving my child to school, and I’m getting these messages about ICE operations in my community, and I’m thinking, Should I go and do this? But, no, I don’t wanna get killed and have my son be motherless. So these monumental decisions that are being made by just ordinary people who are not familiar with these kind of stakes, I think there is something surreal about the whole experience.

Walz: This is nuts. It is absolute insanity. And I don’t know, when it’s written afterwards, I hate to make the comparisons of this, but no one’s ever seen this.

Stanley-Becker: —Fort Sumter, it’s a profound comparison, but—

Walz: The discipline of the people on the streets here—because, look, everybody’s armed; this is America, and this is Minnesota. Myself included.

Stanley-Becker: He brought up these analogies, including John Brown, as a way of suggesting that people in Minnesota were making different decisions. They were not resorting to that kind of violence. So that’s what I took him to be saying.

But I also took him to be saying that we don’t know how these moments are going to unfold and the kind of dire consequences they might have, so we need to be careful, especially in a hair-trigger environment and in an environment where we just, frankly, are seeing things that are unprecedented, that we don’t know the kind of violence or damage could be done.

Stanley-Becker: So there’s certainly a risk of hyperbole, but I think that there is also a risk of understatement and not fully coming to grips with the possible consequences of what we’re seeing.

            <h2>What Does Life After Ambition Actually Look Like?</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/2026/01/life-after-ambition-book-review/685804/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Millennials love to talk—and gripe—about ambition. What was once a virtue has become a generational bugbear. Millennial women, raised on Girl Power and rom-coms in which the heroine gets the job and the man, joined the workforce just in time for the girlboss culture of the 2010s, which promised that hard work would lead not only to personal success but also to feminist victory. For many American women, no piece of that promise has come true. And, gender aside, anyone who’s gone through two recessions, a pandemic, and the growing precarity of all kinds of careers has reason to side-eye grand dreams of achievement; it’s hard enough to just get by. No wonder that cries of protest such as the Canadian writer Amil Niazi’s 2022 lament, “Losing My Ambition,” in which Niazi declares that she’s “abandoned the notion of ambition to chase the absolute middle of the road: mediocrity,” have gone viral.

Niazi has not given up completely on achievement: She parlayed her hit essay into a new book called Life After Ambition: A “Good Enough” Memoir. In it, she tries to trace the rise and fall of her aspirations as both a personal and a cultural story, framing her gradual disillusionment as a larger meditation on the limits of ambition as a guiding ethic. She describes setting aside her childhood literary dreams as she became overreliant on achievement as a source of self-worth—an issue to which many readers will likely relate, though it’s an especially tough proposition in the media world, which has become increasingly unstable in Millennials’ working lives. Niazi swings between journalistic writing, editing, and production before she lands a job in the BBC’s commissioning department.

But once she’s in that coveted role, motherhood reorients her priorities: She no longer wants work that separates her from her baby. This, too, will be readily relatable. But a less common aspect of her experience—and one Niazi does not explain satisfyingly—is that parenthood also reawakened her urge toward a kind of writing that, she notes, “had very little to do with journalism.” As a new mother, she found that the “urge to create felt overwhelming.” Before having a second baby, she quit her job.

For Niazi, abandoning ambition seems to have meant giving up on a career that the girlbosses of 10 years ago would have admired—one that involves climbing up the rungs of a major media company. But for many of her readers, success might well be what Niazi now has: a widely released memoir and a popular New York magazine column that she describes as a “perfect culmination” of her prior work. Niazi never really delves into this disconnect. And strangely, for someone who mentions that writing is “the only thing I’d ever been both good at and interested in, where I didn’t feel like I was faking it,” she rarely explores her creative urge. In fact, she seems to shy away from any real exploration of what literary ambition means.

For a quest meant to “navigate what a divorce from ‘ambition’ really looks like,” Niazi’s memoir gives its audience little sense of why she continues to pursue writing, or what her relationship to literary craft is. So much of writing is battling your own mind to cough up the clearest idea or best word. Niazi doesn’t discuss the frustrations or satisfactions of this process. Her book may leave readers wondering what aspect of writing compels her most, if it isn’t public success or the private drive to perfect a sentence. As a result, Life After Ambition raises an intriguing question: If conventional visions of success strike so many as bankrupt, how can writers earnestly reclaim—or even hold on to—ambition for art?

As I was reading Life After Ambition, I thought wistfully of another recent memoir about writing: the New Yorker journalist and author Susan Orlean’s immensely heartfelt career retrospective, Joyride. Midway through, Orlean observes that to be “empowered to write, to feel entitled to broadcast your thoughts to the world, is an honor.” Orlean has been broadcasting her thoughts in print for decades, and Joyride is at once her expression of gratitude for that career and a tale of life lived in service to her fundamental drive to write.

Orlean is precise about her motivations. She repeatedly describes her desire to write something fascinating and stylish enough to deserve a stranger’s time—and then do it again, and again, and again. This is an unusual if not unique form of ambition, and Orlean illustrates it vividly. One of her goals, it seems, is to bring her obsession with writing to life for somebody who does not share it. She even makes the composition process—hours alone at her desk—sound dramatic, at one point comparing it with “walking along a narrow ledge and willing yourself to not look down: If you do, you’ll lose your nerve, and you’ll fall.” She then argues that the “single essential element” of quality prose is the confidence it takes to look straight ahead on that ledge. “You need swagger to be a writer at all,” she continues, “to be convinced that readers should listen to you.”

Such explicit writing about writing is a performance of both confidence and ambition: Orlean seems to want to put on such a great show that it compels you to go read her whole catalog. Niazi does show a certain devil-may-care swagger by describing Life After Ambition as merely “good enough,” which all but dares readers to dismiss it. (The phrase presumably winks at the child psychologist D. W. Winnicott’s idea of the “good enough” mother but doesn’t explicitly connect the dots.) In doing so, though, she lowers her audience’s expectations. Orlean, in Joyride, does the opposite. She gives her solitary craft an urgency that cannot help but make readers inspect, and then appreciate, the quality of her writing. Repeatedly she promises that her sentences can rivet and enlighten you; repeatedly, they do just that.

Joyride, it seems to me, is an expression of ambition at its purest in that Orlean achieves the very goals—good storytelling and good prose—that the book discusses. But she never tangles with the tricky nexus of internal and external aspiration, likely because her career has gone so well. Though she does not completely omit her setbacks and times of doubt, she seems to understand that readers might not take seriously the professional insecurities of a writer whom Meryl Streep once played in a movie. Joyride remains squarely in the realm of interior, artistic ambition. It’s about Orlean’s determination to produce better and better work.

Life After Ambition, in contrast, mostly inhabits the realm of the external, and it does not put on a stylistic show. Life After Ambition’s sentences are workmanlike, with an overreliance on set or hackneyed phrases; there’s a lot of “brokenness,” “broken state,” “what was broken in me.” Niazi appears uninterested in asserting her voice on the page, a lack of literary care that seems connected to her tendency—odd in a memoir—to nudge away from introspection.

Read: A society that can’t get enough of work

For instance, she recounts several moments in which a teacher, manager, or partner derided her ambition, treating it as unacceptable given her race or gender. Not wishing to linger on the emotional repercussions of these hurtful incidents is understandable, of course. Still, Niazi treats them with a distinct impersonality, largely using them to gesture at her story’s wider applicability (ambition “becomes a funny thing,” she writes, “when it’s used against you”) and to create a sense that her ambition allowed her to break away from bigots’ and sexists’ idea of who she was supposed to be.

Niazi’s writing about her career moves also shows some unease with the personal. She grew up poor, and the ambition she describes most explicitly is her very relatable desire to “make money and move up the ladder and have a stable life.” As any writer or journalist reading Life After Ambition will know, achieving these goals in tandem can be challenging in media. In fact, making money is sometimes at odds with getting what you want. Niazi is admirably transparent about this reality: At one point, she recounts taking a $20,000 pay cut to work at a new media start-up where her role would involve more writing than her prior one. But she refrains from discussing the emotions or conversations that went into that decision, tucking it instead into a passage about trying for her first pregnancy. Taking a winding or risky career path is common, regardless of one’s background, but it’s often still fraught—and, therefore, ripe for investigation, especially in a book meant to probe ambition. Niazi shows her readers her choices; she just doesn’t tell us what they mean.

None of this would seem all that jarring if Niazi used her desire to write to give readers a deeper idea of who she is. But she doesn’t show herself drafting or consider its frustrations and satisfactions; readers never get to see her wobble on Orlean’s narrow ledge. It is as if Niazi expects her audience either to intuit the reason she pursued writing or not to care, rather than treating her literary yearning as a subject worthy of consideration and time.

In this sense, Life After Ambition is legitimately and heartbreakingly unambitious. Reading it, I wondered whether Niazi didn’t trust that she could interest readers in her real self. The memoir turns instead into a broad and essentially familiar discourse about ambition as a route out of challenging family circumstances; the pursuit of conventional success leading to alienation; the frequent clash between career and parenthood.

Perhaps a serious literary consideration of ambition, one that breaks through the shell of Millennial disillusionment that has hardened around the subject in recent years, would need to follow Orlean’s lead in focusing on craft. After all, it takes confidence to talk about your art—and to get away from convention. In the hip-hop scholar Tricia Rose’s seminal Black Noise, the graffiti writer and rapper Fab Five Freddy tells Rose that what makes his art satisfying is “that pressure on you to be the best. Or to try to be the best. To develop a new style nobody can deal with.” A goal like that might torment you, and it might end in failure nine times out of 10, but the most common complaint about conventional ambition is that it so often turns into a trap. If your goal is to chase artistic innovation, to try to tell the best story or put on the best show you can, then effort becomes its own reward.

            <h2>The Accidental Winners of the War on Higher Ed</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2026/01/liberal-arts-college-war-higher-ed/685800/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the waning heat of last summer, freshly back in my office at a major research university, I found myself considering the higher-education hellscape that had lately descended upon the nation. I’d spent months reporting on the Trump administration’s attacks on universities for The Atlantic, speaking with dozens of administrators, faculty, and students about the billions of dollars in cuts to public funding for research and the resulting collapse of “college life.”At the same time, I’d been chronicling the spread of AI-powered chatbots that have already changed undergraduates forever.

Initially, I surveyed the situation from the safe distance of a journalist who happens to also be a career professor and university administrator. I saw myself as an envoy between America’s college campuses and its citizens, telling the stories of the people whose lives had been shattered by these transformations. By the summer, though, that safe distance had collapsed back on me. The wave of campus crises was causing immediate effects in my own academic life. People I knew were losing their jobs. Yearslong projects were stranded. I heard from students cheating their way through every class with AI, and from faculty following suit. I watched professors lash out at other disciplines with misplaced blame. I listened to friends discuss whether they should send their kids to school abroad. I had personally devoted 25 years to higher education. Now it felt like the whole idea of the university might be ending.

Sitting in my office, I began searching for some cause for hope, some reason to believe that higher ed could stanch the damage for the next generation of students. It occurred to me that I’d been hearing less despair from colleagues at certain smaller schools that offer undergraduate study in the “liberal-arts tradition,” a broad and flexible approach to education that values developing the person over professional training. I wondered if these schools—especially the wealthy ones that cluster near the top of national rankings—might enjoy some natural insulation from the fires raging through the nation’s research universities.

I texted, emailed, telephoned, and Zoomed with friends in higher-education leadership. Current and former heads of both research universities and liberal-arts colleges confirmed my intuition: Well-resourced and prestigious small colleges are less exposed in almost every way to the crises that higher ed faces.

To dig deeper, I decided to embark on a fact-finding mission in the guise of a traditional college tour. In November, I went to visit four elite liberal-arts colleges—Amherst, Davidson, Smith, and Vassar—where I joined prospective students and their parents for their campus tours, sat in on classes, and spoke with undergraduates, professors, and administrators. Might schools such as these emerge as the accidental winners of the war on universities?

I came to Amherst College too late in the autumn to observe peak foliage, but amber and ochre remnants still spread across the Pioneer Valley in western Massachusetts. This is the scene Emily Dickinson, a local resident, would have taken in before composing the lines, “The maple wears a gayer scarf, / The field a scarlet gown.”

My tour began at the Colonial Revival residence that serves as the school’s admissions office, but we soon arrived in the new science building, a modern structure with oddball green furnishings. Nate Scharf, our sophomore guide, sat us down and gestured toward a small classroom where he had taken a psychology class. At a typical research university, an undergraduate course like this would meet inside a lecture hall, perhaps with separate breakout sections for discussion led by graduate students. But neither Scharf nor any of his classmates had ever been exposed to this scenario—because Amherst, like most liberal-arts colleges, has no graduate students.

No graduate students: The American public may not fully grasp the implications of this statement. At a university, grad students may end up leading class discussions, but that’s only part of the story. Their presence on a campus telegraphs a more important truth: that in terms of mission, teaching undergrads comes second to research.

And at most universities, grad students play a crucial role within the research system: They perform the frontline work of science. Faculty members get federal grants, which are used to pay for doctoral students, who in turn serve as laboratory staff. Professors’ feeling of worth and productivity may be a function of how many doctoral students they advise—because that helps determine how many studies they can carry out, how many papers they can publish, and what sorts of new grants they can win to keep the process going. This endless competition is a major feature of the modern university—whether it’s an elite private school (such as Princeton or Duke), a public flagship (such as the University of Michigan or UC Berkeley), or a land-grant institution (such as Texas A&M or Virginia Tech).

A school like Amherst, though, which has no doctoral programs whatsoever, is free of the rat race of research productivity and expenditure. As these colleges like to point out, that’s good for undergrads, because faculty must focus on education. The lack of doctoral research programs also makes the schools more resilient to bullying from Washington. In 2025, the Trump administration made a point of suspending hundreds of millions of dollars in research grants to Columbia, Harvard, Northwestern, and other schools. It also threatened to impose a tighter limit on what are called “indirect costs”—the portion of each grant that covers all the broader costs of running a large enterprise for research. With so much funding endangered all at once, targeted universities had little choice but to negotiate—which is to say, to accede to some portion of the Trump administration’s demands.

At Amherst, this level of pressure simply couldn’t be applied. In 2024, the college took in around $3 million from all of its federal research grants put together. (For comparison: Washington University in St. Louis, where I teach, received $731 million that year from the National Institutes of Health alone.) Christopher Durr, an associate professor of chemistry, told me that his research is “designed to be done mostly in-house,” by which he means without external funding, and with the help of undergraduates. He studies biodegradable plastics in a lab that is mostly funded by the college itself, and he gets no research money at all from the federal government. Settling into an Eames-style chair in his office, I asked him what indirect-cost rate Amherst applies to its grants, and he said he didn’t know—an innocence that would be unheard of at a research university.

The research that can be done at a small liberal-arts college, with its more modest labs and equipment, is necessarily constrained. Even with Amherst’s generosity, Durr said “there’s a limit” to how far he can push his research. In truth, the most important scientific and medical discoveries aren’t likely to be made at a place like Amherst or Smith, the nearby women’s college, which tend to pay their own students to work on faculty research. But this need not be a limitation for undergraduates. The conditions that produce landmark discoveries are not necessarily the same ones that produce a serious education.

Perched along the shores of North Carolina’s Lake Norman, in the Charlotte suburbs at the northern edge of Mecklenburg County, Davidson College’s location is a crossroads for red and blue America. In the last election, two-thirds of Mecklenburg’s voters chose Kamala Harris; just a mile up the road, in Iredell County, two-thirds of voters went for Donald Trump.

Connor Hines, the current student-body president and a senior majoring in political science, is a self-described moderate conservative who grew up in the area. He told me that he chose to come to Davidson in part because its students are able to disagree with one another in thoughtful ways. His good friend Nina Worley, an educational-studies major who was raised in Harlem, said the same. “I knew that to be a good advocate for education policy, I needed to meet a Republican for the first time,” Worley told me. She and Hines do not see eye to eye on everything—the two do not agree, for example, on the policies of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. But they said they carry out that disagreement with respect.

According to higher education’s many critics on the right, elite universities have tried to stifle disagreement; allegedly they’re pushing students into echo chambers instead of broadening their minds. The Trump administration made this accusation central to its war on research universities: With billions of dollars in withheld grants as leverage, it initially pressured nine institutions into signing an agreement, called the “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education,” that would commit them to “fostering a vibrant marketplace of ideas on campus” and protecting conservative viewpoints.

In the meantime, under local pressure, reactionary speech suppression is taking hold at public universities: Many schools, including Auburn and the University of Michigan, have shut down their DEI offices; Texas A&M censored courses based on race and gender content; and Indiana University halted the print edition of the student newspaper, an act its journalists said amounted to censorship. Some private schools, including Columbia, Northwestern, and Cornell, have struck deals to restore funding that variously included provisions regarding civil-rights standards, disciplinary processes, DEI rubrics in admissions and hiring, and policies related to sex and gender identity.

Davidson, which, like Amherst, is far less exposed than research universities to the threat of withheld money, has not been explicitly asked to sign the compact. (Nor have any other liberal-arts schools, including the ones I visited.) Chris Marsicano, an associate professor of education studies who had introduced me to Hines and Worley, told me that the school was way ahead of the national conversation on campus dialogue in any case. In 2019, it created a Deliberative Citizenship Initiative, which runs programming to help students and faculty engage on issues about which disagreement is likely, such as immigration and border control. “We’re the hipsters of civil discourse,” Marsicano said. “We were doing it before it was cool.”

Certainly these sorts of efforts can be found at lots of universities: Ohio State has a Civil Discourse for Citizenship initiative, for instance, and WashU has just launched an Ordered Liberty Project, which includes associated coursework on the topic of “disagreement.” But they may be most likely to succeed when they’re applied to smaller student bodies, like Davidson’s. At lunch in the school’s campus commons, I watched President Douglas Hicks greet a dozen students by name. My tour guide explained that students and faculty tend to mingle there; in fact, they can’t avoid it, because everyone eats in the same place. Some might find this stifling or claustrophobic, but being forced to live together day by day may also stimulate openness and mutual respect. “You can’t hide,” Hicks told me.

At a small liberal-arts college, where a cohort may number fewer than 500 people, admissions officers can also take a stronger hand in assembling a group of students who match the institution’s culture and its vibe while also having very different backgrounds. And the fact that almost everyone at a small liberal-arts college tends to live on campus, or very close to it, adds to the sense of intimacy. “It’s just much easier for me to get to know faculty here, much easier for me to get to know students, much easier for me to hear what’s on their minds,” Amherst’s president, Michael Elliott, told me.

One effect of this, he said, is that professors actually show up to faculty meetings to talk about the future of their institution. They participate in budgeting conversations, debate the creation of majors, and approve new courses. This is decidedly not the norm at many larger universities, where professors may not see these meetings as a core part of the job, and where administrators can ignore them altogether. (Last year, Northwestern reached a settlement with the Trump administration despite 98 percent of its voting faculty having recommended otherwise.) Elliott admits that all of this faculty participation can make the college move more slowly in decision making. But done right, faculty governance is a form of healthy campus discourse, too.

Perhaps no threat to higher ed is more acute than the recent, rapid spread of generative AI. “It’s just about crushed me,” one college teacher told me in the spring of 2023. “I fell in love with teaching, and I have loved my time in the classroom, but with ChatGPT, everything feels pointless.”

The remarkable test-taking, paper-writing power of AI is hardly under control at liberal-arts colleges such as Amherst or Davidson. But in my conversations with students and faculty, I witnessed a struggle to understand and respond to it with greater earnestness and complexity than I have encountered elsewhere in higher education. In my experience, students and faculty at research universities tend to have a Manichaean view of the technology: Either AI is an existential threat to be cast out, or a vital tool to be embraced as a professional virtue. Little room is left for nuance, which means that little progress can be made on shaping policy.

Davidson prides itself on having an unusually deliberate honor code. (Students I spoke with said this code is taken so seriously that they can leave their belongings anywhere on campus without fear that they will be stolen.) But the seductions of ChatGPT are hard to resist, and Marsicano noted that the college has seen an increase in code violations due to AI. That sounded like less of a problem here than elsewhere, though. If the students are availing themselves of the technology, then at least they appear to be doing so with some reservations.

Hines told me that he uses AI tools, though not for academic work. Worley said she’s avoided AI so far, because “I’m still struggling with what makes me comfortable about it and what doesn’t.” At Davidson, each professor can set their own approach to AI in the classroom, but that can be confusing. In the meantime, Worley and her roommates ponder what the rules should be. They ask, for instance: If it’s now okay to have AI write your emails for you, why is that okay? And they talk about AI data centers’ environmental costs. “Everyone’s wrestling with it,” she said.

Learning how to wrestle with an issue like AI, which is ambiguous and undecided, is the whole point of an education undertaken in the liberal tradition. It’s also made easier in a context where faculty-to-student ratios can be much smaller than they are at even elite research universities. (At a school like Davidson or Amherst, some classrooms will contain just a handful of students and a professor—a scenario in which siphoning work through Claude would not be easy.) Carina Cole, a Vassar media-studies student, told me that a supportive culture on campus also makes it possible to treat AI with greater care. Her fellow students are more likely to ask one another for help than turn to technology, she said. But Worley admitted that the situation feels fragile no matter what: “I’m holding on for dear life.”

At Amherst, I sat down with Matthew McGann, the dean of admission and financial aid. I asked how his school stacked up against the nation’s most prestigious universities. If a student also gains admission to Yale, do they go there instead? “They do,” he said. Amherst has a sterling reputation, but it still cannot compete against a famous Ivy.

The relative obscurity of even the best small liberal-arts colleges may be helping them to avoid the Trump administration’s war on higher ed. But that doesn’t mean that they’re immune from any risk of being targeted. Haverford College, in Pennsylvania, for example, has been made the subject of a civil-rights investigation for allegedly failing to address anti-Semitic harassment against Jewish students. (This is the same charge, and the same government action, that has been directed or threatened against Columbia, UCLA, Stanford, Cornell, Rutgers, and many other big universities.) Haverford may not rely on the federal government for giant research grants, but even just defending itself against investigation would be costly, as would, say, losing federal Pell Grants that subsidize low-income students.

Small colleges’ endowments could also be attacked, even if the schools are never targeted specifically. In 2025, Congress voted to increase the tax on endowment income, which private colleges and universities draw on for financial aid, from 1.4 percent to as much as 8 percent. (The wealthiest liberal-arts colleges spend a large portion of their endowment earnings to fund students who can’t afford to spend up to $100,000 a year to attend.) For the moment, institutions with fewer than 3,000 tuition-paying students—which means most liberal-arts colleges—are exempted from this increase, so their budgets remain untouched. But that could change.

Then there is the nagging question of practicality. Even if you believe that a liberal-arts college offers the best education, going to school to learn how to think might seem like a luxury today. In the end, you’ll still need to earn some kind of living. If the paths for getting there—which may include postgraduate study in a doctoral program or professional school—are diminishing, then college itself will follow suit.

Still, after spending several weeks on my tour of wealthy, liberal-arts colleges, I grew to think that the pitch they’re making to prospective students and their parents for the fall of 2026 was convincing. All things considered, when the time comes, I might rather see my own preteen daughter attend a school like Amherst or Davidson, Smith or Vassar, than a research university such as my own. The form of higher ed that they provide seems poised to be the most resilient in the years to come.

In a way, that resilience may pass on to the students who attend them. On my last night in western Massachusetts, I was set up to have dinner with a group of graduating Amherst seniors. By all measures, these were tremendously successful young adults. Hedley Lawrence-Apfelbaum is bound for a fellowship at the University of Oxford on his way to Harvard Law. Ayres Warren, who has already published a journal article on breast-cancer disparities, will pursue a career in environmental health-care management. Shane Dillon is plotting out a career in politics. All three of them told me they were worried about their futures—not because they had attended Amherst instead of Yale or Emory or Michigan State, but because the world seems so uncertain on the whole.

These seniors weren’t panicking, though—this was very clear. “We’ll see,” Dillon said when I asked what was next, what he feared, and what he hoped for. I’ve known a lot of brilliant undergraduates during the course of my career at research universities. Some have become wealthy in business; others have become famous; still more have made the world better through research and invention. But Dillon and the other students whom I met during my college tour struck me as being unusually attuned to the facts of their predicament. They were already living in the thickness of their own lives, aware of who they are and not just what they might become. They seemed to understand, by virtue of the education they’d received, that uncertainty is to be expected, and that the future lasts a long time.</div>

            <h2>America Can Have the Oil</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/01/oil-venezuela-america-fifty-fifty/685797/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">María-Elena Pombo has created “petroleum weavings,” turning threads made from oil into elaborate yarnlike wall hangings. Oil, she told us, has shaped her life. Her father, an oil engineer, met her mother after he moved to Cabimas, an oil town. Because of Venezuela’s oil wealth, Pombo, now 37 years old, studied for free at an excellent public university in Caracas.

For decades, all Venezuelans enjoyed the perks of living in a land where oil was a birthright. They could fill their cars for almost nothing. Education and other public services were heavily subsidized as well. Academics might argue over the wisdom of the state’s largesse. But people expected, at the very least, affordable gas as a material benefit from the nation’s abundance of oil.

President Trump’s military intervention in Venezuela this month was, in part, a bid to seize the source of this wealth. Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world. Trump made no secret of his desire to exploit them in what many have criticized as an act of naked imperialism and the theft of Venezuela’s economic patrimony: “We’re going to be using oil, and we’re going to be taking oil,” Trump said in an interview after the January 3 attack that captured the strongman President Nicolás Maduro and his wife.

Yet many Venezuelans in the country and abroad celebrated the strike. María Corina Machado, the popular leader of the opposition, has welcomed Trump’s actions. Last February, Machado was a guest on Donald Trump Jr.’s podcast. When he asked why Americans should care about Venezuela, her first response was: “Oil and gas.” Machado’s strategy could appear to have been a devil’s bargain—tempting Trump with the prospect of petrodollars in exchange for ousting Maduro, her nemesis. But her feelings reflected something broader, too: Venezuelans who once viewed oil as a source of wealth and pride, a limitless resource that had shaped their identity and set their country apart from its poorer neighbors, have come to view it more as a curse.

Venezuelans in the past two decades have watched as the regime squandered the wealth that oil had created, let the country’s oil infrastructure rot, removed gasoline subsidies, and welcomed a bigger hand from Cuba, bartering oil for professionals and intelligence operatives from Havana. Pombo says her generation is the last that benefited from oil. Today, the university where she studied is in such a sorry state that the roof of one of its buildings collapsed. In the former boomtown of Cabimas, in northwestern Venezuela, people grew so desperate that they jury-rigged refineries in their own backyards because gasoline had become so scarce and expensive.

By that measure, ceding the oil industry to the United States at least holds the promise of importing industrial know-how with some financial benefit for the country. A poll by The Economist found that a majority of Venezuelans “somewhat” or “strongly” supported the capture of Maduro and were optimistic about their economic prospects. Fewer than 35 percent thought that the Venezuelan government should continue running Venezuela’s oil industry. Or as Sary Levy-Carciente, Machado’s economic adviser, put it to us, the Americans will be “better clients.”

At a ranch in Cabimas one day in 1922, local farmers were awoken by a bang followed by a black rain. Workers for Shell, an Anglo-Dutch company, had been poking holes in the ground, looking for oil—and struck it rich. A plume spouted for many days. Some viewed the discovery as a divine gift, while a local priest chastised the explorers for unearthing Satan, saying the blowout was God’s punishment. Word traveled northward, and the Rockefellers of Standard Oil and the Mellons of Gulf Oil saw a business opportunity. The episode ushered in more than a half century of relative prosperity.

Even then, some saw signs of trouble. In the 1930s, Arturo Úslar Pietri, an influential intellectual and historian, argued in an essay that the country needed to “sow the oil” by investing oil profits to cultivate other industries. Generation after generation of schoolchildren have heard these words repeated as advice that the country should have followed but didn’t. Instead of sowing the oil, Venezuela became dependent on it.

American companies arrived to drill the wells and build the fields. They brought with them country clubs and baseball. The companies made deals with whichever military despot was in power in Caracas, angering young intellectuals such as Rómulo Betancourt, who harbored dreams of a democratic Venezuela. In his writings, he condemned “the aggressive, juvenile impetus of North American capitalism” and advocated for Venezuelans to be the owners of their oil.

Betancourt became president through a coup in 1945, putting him in position to fulfill his goal of a democratic constitution. But he exercised caution over oil. He didn’t kick out the Americans but instead persuaded them to pay more. He then used those proceeds to build schools, hospitals, and roads. Starting in 1948, American companies extracted the oil and gave roughly half of the profits to the Venezuelan state, an arrangement known as el fifty-fifty.

Betancourt’s stance that Venezuela resented America but needed America is reflected in Miguel Otero Silva’s 1961 novel, Oficina No. 1. The story follows pious, rural Venezuelans who leave everything behind to move to a nameless town where newly arrived Americans are extracting oil with little foresight or planning. The Trinidadian driver who takes the Venezuelans to the fields sings a song in English, as if warning about the type of people the Americans are: “After Johnny eats my food, / After Johnny drinks my rhum, / After Johnny wears my clothes, / Johnny comes back and takes my wife.” But the Venezuelans pay him no mind. They moved to a town with no name because that was their best hope.

Yet many Venezuelans idealize this period. The years of el fifty-fifty were some of the most prosperous in Venezuelan history—a time when migrants were eager to come to Venezuela, rather than leave it, as they have in droves more recently. Hundreds of thousands from Europe and elsewhere arrived for the glorious tropical climate, golden Caribbean beaches, and plentiful job opportunities. The possibilities felt limitless. The country built some of the world’s most futuristic highways and was early in eradicating malaria. When Christian Dior decided to open his first shop in Latin America, he opened it in Caracas. The Concorde, that majestic superfast airplane, flew in at least once a week. Oil was the draw that brought the world to Venezuela. Even Venezuela’s shanties were made with solid construction materials such as brick and concrete, made cheap by a strong bolivar, Venezuela’s currency. It was not uncommon to see new cars parked outside. And although the Venezuelan poor could not afford the shopping trips that the country’s rich made to Miami, they could go to Margarita—a Venezuelan island famous for its beaches and low tax rates.

By 1976, however, Venezuela’s political class had tired of el fifty-fifty. The government seized the assets of American companies and nationalized the oil industry, creating a state-owned giant Petróleos de Venezuela, known as PDVSA.

For years, the company thrived. José Guerra, a Venezuelan economist, told us that graduates aspired to land PDVSA jobs. (He didn’t make the cut as a young man, and had to settle for a job at the central bank.) The government funded scholarships so that the best and brightest could study abroad and become PDVSA engineers and managers. For Luis Soler, who worked at PDVSA for 30 years, the company represented a certain idea of meritocracy. It had an American-style work environment complete with 9-to-5 workdays and a corporate ladder for promotion. “We had discipline, values,” he said.

By the 1990s, PDVSA had become one of the largest and most influential state-owned oil companies in the world, second only to Aramco, its Saudi counterpart. Venezuelan leaders proved to themselves that they could competently manage the country’s oil.

Yet as Pietri had predicted more than a half century before, the country had failed to spread the wealth sufficiently to bolster other industries. “We just traded it! We traded it, and for what? Cars from the United States, whiskey from Scotland, fabrics from Italy, perfumes from France,” Rafael Quiroz, an oil economist at the Central University of Venezuela in Caracas, told us. “And as time passed, we didn’t build anything. We didn’t use the oil to make an economy.”

Those outside the circle of PDVSA profits grew resentful. Seeds had been sown, but not for broad economic growth, as Pietri had once hoped, but for revolution.

The socialist Hugo Chávez came to power in 1999 and managed PDVSA for priorities other than maximum profits. He replaced thousands of highly trained company employees with party loyalists. And for the first decade of the 21st century, the state used oil as a tool of diplomacy, with Chávez lavishing petrodollars on tiny island nations whose votes he courted in the Organization of American States, a regional diplomatic forum. Venezuela replaced Russia as Cuba’s main oil supplier, a favor that Cuban President Fidel Castro returned by becoming Chávez’s mentor on authoritarianism. The consequences of the mismanagement were profound. A country that fully depended on oil became ill-equipped to produce it. After the oil boom, Venezuela somehow ended up poorer, beset by corruption and hyperinflation.

When Chávez died, in 2013, Maduro inherited a failing oil industry and did little to improve it. By 2020, Venezuela’s refineries had crumbled to the point that the country had to start importing gasoline from Iran. Even during the worst years of a humanitarian crisis, Maduro continued supplying his friends in the Cuban government with oil. (In January, the U.S. assault to capture Maduro killed 32 Cuban officers on the president’s security detail.) Venezuela now produces only about 1 percent of the oil in the world, a mere 1 million barrels a day.

Read: The global oil market is based on a fiction

The perception that Maduro gave away oil to keep himself in power has made some Venezuelans more comfortable with the idea of giving oil to America, the country that got rid of the strongman. “Venezuela is going from having a government controlled by Cuba to having a government controlled by the United States,” the historian Pedro Benítez told us, adding that the U.S. can help with the huge investments needed to revive the oil industry.

The rise of Machado is its own testament to changing attitudes about oil. Of all the opposition leaders, Machado has spoken most consistently in favor of privatization and foreign investment. For a long time, these preferences made her relatively unpopular. But in recent years, her views have spread widely. Many Venezuelans would have liked to see Machado replace Maduro as part of a transition back to democratic government. But so far, the Trump administration has shown little interest in that, preferring instead to work with Delcy Rodríguez, Maduro’s vice president, and the rest of the regime. Like Betancourt, she portrays the United States as an unwelcome imperial power: “Enough of Washington’s orders to Venezuelan politicians,” she said on Sunday. But when it comes to oil, she’s ready to deal. In a speech before legislators this month, she said that she would proceed with an “agenda of cooperation” nonetheless. “Let’s not be afraid of contradictions,” she said.

American companies are poised to develop Venezuela’s oil industry anew. Trump said this month that Venezuela would provide 30 million to 50 million barrels of oil to the U.S., and that the sale of this oil would “benefit the people” of both nations. Rodríguez said that Venezuela had received $300 million from the sale, the first payments from those barrels. She celebrated the country’s much-needed share of the revenue.

Trump sees a fresh era of American investment from the oil giants of today. He recently hosted the chief executives from the major U.S. oil firms at the White House to pitch them on the prospect. But the challenges are legion, including the need for political stability in both Venezuela and the U.S. There are no guarantees that a new American administration would take the same tack as Trump. And although working with the regime has brought its country near-term calm—Venezuela is secured right now by pro-government militias—the Trump administration has spoken about an eventual political transition. This leaves Caracas in a governing limbo and U.S. companies wary. Only a stable government can provide sufficient security for the companies to commit to long-term investments.

Over time, the key power brokers in Venezuela may splinter over their new fifty-fifty-style deal with the U.S. “The current arrangement is unlikely to be convenient at the same time for all of them. One of them or some of them will try to change it,” Jana Nelson, a top Pentagon official on Western Hemisphere affairs during the Biden administration, told us.

Even so, many in Venezuela seem guardedly optimistic. Guerra, the former central-bank official, used to be critical of the opposition for courting a U.S. intervention, but he’s now bullish about the economy. He envisions the U.S. government placing conditions on how the regime can spend future oil revenues to make sure the nation’s natural wealth is used to revive Venezuela.

We pointed out that this scenario rests on the assumption that Trump cares about the fate of Venezuela and its people. “Well, we cannot assume anything else,” Guerra told us. The Venezuelan people, he added, are “just onlookers, not actors. We are just looking at what’s happening, hoping for the best. We don’t get to determine anything.”</div>

Windows 11 would have virtually no users if it wasn&#39;t for Microsoft and hardware manufacturers colluding to force people into upgrades.

Wide adoption doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s popular when it isn&#39;t voluntary.=Smidge=

Do they mean a 45% increase in installs, or a 45% increase in the quarter-over-quarter upgrade rate?

I.e., did they really gain almost a half a billion installs in 3 months? That&#39;s hard to imagine even considering the deprecation of Windows 10.

But if they went from 10,000 users a month to 14,500 users a month that is MUCH different story.

            <div id="article-text">Sounds like the rules of the road were followed.   This can happen and does happen daily.

What about the rule to never overdrive your ability to stop for something that may appear in front of you without warning?

Every speed has a minimum stopping distance where, even assuming a reaction time of 0 (impossible), if something appears in that zone without warning, you will hit it no matter what.  That&#39;s just physics.  You can&#39;t bring a vehicle to a halt in an arbitrarily short distance.

Somebody stepping out from behind a tall obstacle with no warning right in front of you is one such case.  All you can to is try to stop as quickly as possible and hit them with as little force as you can.

Yes it&#39;s wise not to drive faster than your visibility permits.  If a brick wall suddenly enters the range of your headlights you should be able to stop in time.

Your rule of &quot;never overdrive your ability to stop for something that may appear in front of you without warning&quot; is much harder.  Someone can hide (intentionally or not) in front of any parked car and jump out full speed without warning if they want to.  To follow your rule, you&#39;d have to drive 5 MPH or maybe even less, any time that there are cars

Since you just made up a rule that is impossible to follow unless you always drive no faster than ten miles an hour, I can&#39;t say that I attach much importance to it.

No, it was obviously driving at a faster speed than what would&#39;ve been necessary to fully stop the vehicle in time.Meaning, the &quot;driver&quot; was not in control, considering its speed and the environment. It was reckless.

The average human driver would have been texting while speeding and would have run the kid over.

Could I please see a reference demonstrating that the word &quot;average&#39; equates to claiming it applies to EVERY SINGLE ONE?

The posted speed limit is not a minimum, it&#39;s a maximum. And the driver is expected to choose a speed at or below it such that the car can stop or avert in time. Which was not the case here.

The point is that AI should know how long it would take to stop and therefore the safe speed to drive in that situation.  Isn&#39;t that a simple job for a computer?  Isn&#39;t that the point of automated driving, to be safer?  I have never been convinced that safety is at all being taken into consideration in the design of these things.

And here we go.  Now Waymo can go convince the mother of that child that they are good for all of humanity.

Would anyone here that has had first hand experience, riding in a Waymo, care to share what it&#39;s like? Speeds, distances, traffic, general feeling, comfort level..?

I&#39;ve ridden in one. It was just like riding in any car, but a little disconcerting to have the driver&#39;s seat empty while the car did its thing. Maybe a little smoother and more predictable than the average Uber.

Given how many Waymos there are on the road and how little trouble weâ(TM)ve heard about - despite breathless coverage of every incident, - Iâ(TM)d say they seem to be doing better than human drivers.

very conservative, defensive driving. surprisingly normal feeling

It was a nice ride but it wasn&#39;t allowed to go on the highway so the trip took longer.

Makes you also wonder what the chances are of becoming a valid competitor by merely listening to what the consumer actually wants instead of turning them into The Product like everyone else does.

Why does five vs. three matter?  Because it&#39;s your argument?

And why does IOS vs. Android matter anyway?  It&#39;s literally a reason to choose.  Historically, MacOS has been available only on Macs, THE reason Mac marketshare was low.  Now it&#39;s the reason iPhone marketshare is high?

Ask the average consumer to name five Android vendor options. I&#39;ll bet they&#39;d struggle to name more than three.That&#39;s the whole point. With Android, it does not matter for the average consumer what brand it is. It does not even matter that it is Android. It&#39;s just a generic smartphone, it can install the apps they want, and people will buy whatever fits their budget and their needs, ignorant about brand and operating system. For a single vendor, it is complicated to have one model sell in large numbers, because they are generic. Or do you know what farm your potatoes come from? It&#39;s potatoes. That&#39;s all that matters

There is only one and a half ecosystem in the world ... and the half of one is dying.

Google&#39;s half of an ecosystem has two problems. The mistake of allowing manufacturers way too much freedom and being tied down by their advertising preventing them from moving into the high end. Apple can move down in the market, but any Google device will always be tainted by advertising when trying to play at the top. As a person you can mostly avoid that, but for the brand it&#39;s poison.

Apple&#39;s ecosystem seems to be focused on preventing users from doing what they want with the powerful general purpose hardware they sell. Android users can at least take steps to mitigate how much access advertising systems have on their devices, even to the point that they can use their devices entirely without a Google account. There&#39;s no way to get a fully functional third party browser on iOS and iOS users who refuse to sign in to Apple have no way of obtaining any software for their devices.

This post is hilarious. You think an iPhone is the higher end model phone? LOL

Since somehow Apple was selling 3 generations of phone at the same time in 2025 it&#39;s easy to dominate the charts this way. I don&#39;t see this as a good thing. That Apple were selling more iPhone 15s than they were selling iPhone 16es in the same year as the iPhone 17 was released shows that they are massively underserving a budget market.

I can&#39;t think at any point in history where 3 generations of iPhone were available for sale in the same year.

Apple devices do command a premium price, but it&#39;s a misnomer to say Best Selling devices are in the premium category of devices.They definitely have more polish than some devices, and not all iPhones are in the premium category of devices, regardless of their polish.

Might as well make my own announcement. I will not be going to the moon this year. Possibly to hell, however.

There aren&#39;t enough advancements each year to warrant a new model smart phone.

The idea that a phone has to be an &#39;upgrade&#39; of the previous phone is laugable.

Apple releases an iPhone every year. I buy a iPhone every 3-4 years. I&#39;m glad they release one every year so that when I&#39;m ready I&#39;m getting the latest battery/cpu/gpu/memory tech and not the tech that came out 2 years ago.

I guess his thought is you buy a nothing phone and then every time one comes out you &#39;upgrade&#39;. That is madness.

People worried about a new phone every year, are adopting a weird attitude. Car models change all the time. And just because a new version of a car model exists doesn&#39;t mean that everyone will get a new car every year - only when they need one.

It reminds me of the old joke (maybe apocryphal ) that in some circles they would name their servers after components. So you&#39;d get conversations like &quot;Yeah, the hard disk in RAM has gone down, so I&#39;ll need to bring up HARDDISK, and switch out NETWORKCARD to maintain continuity of the network for PCI&#39;s services.&quot;

Or the best wifi password which is &quot;fourwords&quot;, :

That&#39;s because they don&#39;t have the ability to, not because they choose not to. They&#39;ve struggled to launch anything and the prospect of having to keep up with the industry is far beyond their abilities. This is simply an excuse not to keep up.

It&#39;s probably even worse. They put ads in the OS, including lock screen a couple of months ago.

Their audience is enthusiasts. The people who care about this sort of enshittification far more than pretty much any other target group.

So now you have to put out a new phone to stay with the cycle, while your main audience has fresh memory of you having an absolutely epic fuck up. Chances of them buying anything new from Nothing, or recommending it are basically zero. Their company is fucked for a few months, unt

Shipping lane management is already highly data driven and pretty well optimizes.  Sure you might save some money replacing long haul drivers, and independent owners, with drone trucks, it is not insignificant, but it also isn&#39;t probably the big part of the pie.

I don&#39;t know about Walmat, given the volume of stuff they have to move to keep stores stocked, and sell in store; but I would be shocked if Amazon spends more money moving merch between distribution hubs than on

More than half of last mile delivery is unloading. Do they think a store owner is going to unload all their bulk groceries, or grandma is going to unload that new washing machine?

I have no idea how the idiots decided to focus on consumer cars that go everywhere.

Trucks and busses have set routes.  This example - the middle mile between warehouses and individual stores - is the prime case for robotic delivery.   Both locations have employees working for the same company to handle the loading and unloading.   The routes do not change.  Speed is needed but not absolutely necessary.  Most of the route should be on highways.

This is where the first commercial unmanned vehicles should be us

It&#39;s least likely to involve substantial surface street traffic because a lot of it is warehouse to warehouse.

I hope Bubba takes their lunch money for ransom and give them lots of slippery soap

It would be comedy gold to watch an FBI goon posing as Dr. Evil on video doing a stone-cold revenge plan with pinky solidly buried in the crook of his mouth spouting ”One treeeellion dollars” in response to hackers wanting their domain back.

That comedy would quickly turn into a fucking documentary when the hackers respond with “No problem.  You want that in dollars, euros, or bitcoin..”

Taking the guy&#39;s name is a new level of mean with a gazillion names out there, Dolittle, Mixalot, etc. they had to choose that one. &quot;You think you&#39;re better than us?&quot;

What about the possibility that the government already pwned both servers months ago, collecting evidence while lurking, and now that they think they have a case, they need to do real construction of evidence instead of the parallel construction they were doing before, so they have to officially seize them now and put them into evidence.

In these parts, only the President is allowed to scam citizens!

How do you stop someone from killing someone else? In most societies, we do so with warnings, promises, and contracts. We make laws to make ourselves feel safe. It’s important to feel safe, because reality is terrifying. In Minneapolis this weekend, we saw reality: a group of men with guns, in a semicircle, firing a barrage of shots into a man’s body lying on the ground. The laws that were supposed to protect Alex Pretti—the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, multiple state and local and national statutes on use of force—failed. Pretti’s death, captured on video from multiple angles, was so shocking that even the Trump administration has been forced to rethink its brutal tactics in the Twin Cities, which for more than a month has been ravaged by an onslaught of federal agents ostensibly conducting “immigration enforcement.”

Now, the Trump administration is shifting its approach, or at least its messaging. Gregory Bovino, the cartoonishly fascist figurehead of Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s operations in the Twin Cities, has been removed from his post and forced off social media. Kristi Noem, Bovino’s boss at the Department of Homeland Security, received a brief, but significant, rebuke from the president. The Democrats, America’s sluggish and often ineffectual opposition party, are howling for investigations, firings, and impeachments.

It’s tempting to see these developments as a victory, as the rule of law slowly reasserting itself over a deadly aberration in America’s social contract. Soon, you might think, things may go back to normal. But in Donald Trump’s America, the contract has been rewritten. The conditions that caused Pretti’s death still exist—in Minneapolis, in Maine, in California, in every city and every town where agents of the state carry guns. The goon squads are here to stay, and it’s only a matter of time until they kill again.

What this reflects is more than the Trump administration’s vicious immigration policies, but a broader shift in American politics. Inside the West Wing, a terrifying new political ideology is on display, one that says the right to shape, change, and end Americans lives is not granted by a democratic framework of laws, but by a simple equation of who has more guns.

This shift was not immediate. During the first Trump administration, the snarl of legal jurisprudence that slowed down many of Trump’s most egregious excesses also lured us into a false sense of comfort that the law still worked, and that the contract still held—and sometimes it did. When Trump attempted to overturn the 2020 election, the system worked. Judges threw out his cases. When rioters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, they were prosecuted en masse for their crimes. Trump himself was impeached, though never convicted, thanks to the cowardice of a bloc of Republican senators.

Upon entering his second term, Trump went for it, not so much testing as smashing through the constraints of legal precedent—he pardoned the criminals who stormed the Capitol on his behalf and indicted many of the officials that, in turn, had indicted him. On the border, he saw a chance to test his might: calling in Marines to quell protesters in Los Angeles and increasing the DHS’s purview to arrest, detain, and raid far outside of their preexisting jurisdictions.

The guardrails are not holding this time around.

Minneapolis represents the most stark example of the rule of the gun thus far. During “Operation Metro Storm,” the ominously named federal operation in the Twin Cities, federal agents have shot three people, killed two, and injured dozens with pepper spray, rubber bullets, tear gas, and fists. Until Pretti’s death finally tipped the scales, Noem and other figures in the administration doubled and tripled down on their mandate to use force. Jonathan Ross, the agent who shot Renee Good, the first person killed by ICE in the Twin Cities, currently faces no charges, after the FBI intervened to toss out the state-level investigation into the killing.

Federal agents have repeatedly violated protesters’ First Amendment rights, detained citizens and noncitizens alike unlawfully, and even sought to prevent detainees from accessing legal counsel. The Department of Justice, instead of investigating these abuses, has instead leveled charges on the protesters. There are videos all over social media of officers, after Good’s killing, taunting protesters with threats that they will be next. The men with guns knew the power they held. They knew no one could stop them from killing.

And so when Alex Pretti stood up in the middle of the street, filming them with his phone, and intervened to try to help another civilian they had pushed to the ground, they shot him. He had, after all, committed a crime in their eyes: He had resisted the administration’s will. The agents who killed Pretti have not been identified or charged; like in Good’s killing, there will be no federal civil rights investigation, only an internal process overseen by the department that fired the shots. (Two of the agents involved in shooting Pretti have now been put on leave, but that’s a far cry from meaningful consequences for what they did.) Even if, by some miracle, Good’s and Pretti’s killers are eventually brought to justice, their individual consequences do nothing to subvert ICE’s mandate of force wherever it appears. ICE can afford to discipline or lose an agent or two to mollify public opinion. They have plenty more operating, still, under the same rules of engagement.

Under Trump’s new government-by-gun, individuals are presented with a choice between obedience and execution—or at least the ever-present danger of it. And without legal recompense, the only check to this power appears to be other armed men.

In Maine, where ICE and other agencies have been conducting snatch-and-grab arrests and targeted harassment of protesters similar to those in Minneapolis, local law enforcement has already staked out a hard line against their excesses, something that Minneapolis’ authorities were slow to do. Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce called ICE’s actions “bush-league policing” in an interview on Sunday, after federal agents mistakenly arrested a local corrections officer. This pressure has also changed the situation in Minneapolis, where Gov. Tim Walz has managed to muster a largely tepid show of force from his own military, the Minnesota National Guard, deploying them to the streets in cute reflective vests with donuts and coffee.

It’s easy to see those images and miss what they mean. The National Guard is often seen as a friendly force that shows up with bottled water during hurricanes and digs out roads after mudslides. But that’s not what they are: They are armed forces that are ostensibly under the command of a state governor. Their presence on the streets of Minneapolis, orange vests and all, is a show of force by a state military aligned opposite of a federal military. Right now, it’s no more than optics. But lines are being drawn.

And things could always get worse. The National Guard and domestic police are not sympathetic forces to many of this country’s marginalized groups. In L.A. and D.C., National Guard troops squared up with protesters themselves, and their orders come from political actors—governors, mayors, and other politicians with their own biases and agendas.

Soldiers and police, however, are not the only people in America who have guns. As the top levels of our political system wield violence in the open, it’s only a matter of time before people tired of having guns pointed at them may decide that it’s time to have more guns to point back. Communities I have reported on for years are beginning to mobilize again. Online, left-wing accounts and marginalized groups are openly championing the Second Amendment, abandoning arguments for reasonable gun control in favor of arming themselves to face a future in which their only defense is through open force. There was nothing to stop ICE agents from killing Alex Pretti, their thinking goes, so the next time it happens someone might as well shoot back. A brutal occupation unrestrained by any notion of fairness or recompense often inspires a violent response, which would plunge our society into circumstances it has rarely, if ever, seen before: widespread violence on the streets and guerilla attacks on federal forces that inspire even more brutal reprisals and repression.

It’s still possible to regain control of our society before we get to that point; to organize and protest and document well enough that a better future is made possible before the rule of the gun is all we have left. We’ve seen that approach have some success , in this specific case: The administration’s excesses were so blatant and cruel—and so highly publicized—that politicians on both sides of the aisle were forced to hold them to account. But so far, Trump’s response looks more like damage control than a larger shift in approach. The goon squads are still on the streets, still hauling people into their vans. They will learn from this defeat. They will get better at killing. And unless we find a way to upset the architects of our new political order, they’re almost certainly going to do it again.

The big question about President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace—which he formally announced while at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week—is whether it’s a scam, a delusion, or both.

Trump first mentioned a Board of Peace in September during the signing of a ceasefire accord for Israel’s war in Gaza. The idea was that the board would be the forum where Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and other Middle East countries discuss political reforms, reconstruction, and other issues relating to security and long-term peace in Gaza. Trump would chair the board—a role that he improbably insisted wasn’t his idea, but the plan made some sense, given that Trump played a major role in prodding the parties to sign the ceasefire.

However, in the months since, Trump’s vision of the board has—like much else about his presidency—swelled with self-aggrandizement. The board’s charter—which he hasn’t publicized but which the Times of Israel obtained and published—doesn’t mention Gaza at all. Rather, the document states that the board will seek “to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict”—seeming to indicate any sort of conflict, anywhere on earth.

The members on the board will consist of whichever heads of state the chairman, Donald Trump, chooses to invite. Their terms of membership will last three years, unless they pay the board $1 billion, which would buy them lifetime tenure. (Trump is designated as chairman for as long as he likes, certainly beyond the remaining three years of his presidency, gratis.)

The board will decide policies and declare resolutions by majority vote, but the chairman (read: Trump) gets veto power; he can also initiate measures unilaterally, eject members, and choose his own successor.

In other words, the Board of Peace marks yet another episode in Trump’s massive meandering ego trip. More than that, its charter, laid out in formal legalese, is sheer fantasy. It is no surprise that most of the heads of state whom he invited to join, notably those with proven interest in peace and “lawful governance,” have declined.

The naysayers include France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom—in short, many of our leading allies. Trump retracted his invitation to Canada after its prime minister, Mark Carney, delivered a much-lauded speech at Davos calling on middle-sized countries to avoid unfair pressures from larger powers by banding together. (Trump’s retraction, which he posted on social media, bolsters the impression that this is all about Trump, not world peace.)

Those who have said they will join include Argentina, Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Belarus, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Egypt, El Salvador, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Kosovo, Morocco, Mongolia, Pakistan, Paraguay, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. None of them are members of the U.N. Security Council (which Trump preposterously hopes to supplant), only a few practice “lawful governance,” and even fewer have any experience at seriously mediating conflict. It is not known whether any of them have been foolish enough to pony up the $1 billion initiation fee—nor has Trump or anyone else said who would control this slush fund. (Want to take a guess?)

The leaders of China, India, and Russia are among those who haven’t yet responded. This is no surprise. These are regional, aspiringly global powers who have a serious (if, in some cases, disruptive) interest in matters of war and peace. And they must know that Trump’s Board of Peace is not serious.

In his gushing invitation letter, Trump declared that his goal is to “bring together a distinguished group of nations ready to shoulder the noble responsibility of building LASTING PEACE.” In his snitty retraction letter to Prime Minister Carney, he brayed that Canada would thereby be excluded from “what will be the most prestigious Board of Leaders ever assembled at any time.”

If Trump believes his own hype (always an uncertainty), he reveals here once again that he has no idea what peace, especially “LASTING PEACE,” requires. To the extent Trump currently has the power to elicit feigned respect and sometimes reluctant obedience from other world leaders, it’s because he is president of the United States—meaning that he can exert the tremendous leverage of the world’s main currency and most powerful military.

Once his term in the Oval Office ends in three years, no leader would have any reason to pay him the slightest attention or courtesy. No leaders embroiled in conflict would welcome the mediation of his so-called Board of Peace, much less follow its orders.

Maybe some leaders would consent to a meeting if the board really were composed of “the most prestigious” peacemakers. But look at who, according to a statement from the White House, is on the group’s “founding” executive board: Trump’s globe-trotting emissary, Steve Witkoff, and son-in-law Jared Kushner (whose efforts to end Russia’s war on Ukraine have been especially aimless); Marc Rowan (a billionaire financier who has led Trump’s political pressure campaigns on American universities); Robert Gabriel (a former producer of Laura Ingraham’s TV show who is now Trump’s deputy national security adviser); Secretary of State Marco Rubio (whose influence will fade along with Trump’s at the end of this administration, at least if he remains under his post-presidential thumb); Sir Tony Blair (whose record as Britain’s prime minister still makes many in the Middle East shudder); and Ajay Banga, president of the World Bank.

Banga is an interesting choice: He was nominated to the World Bank by President Joe Biden, he advised Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 campaign, and he knows something about world politics. The others, once untethered from a sitting American president, would have no authority in making peace whatsoever.

Even with the power of the White House and the imprimatur of a U.N. Security Council resolution, Trump’s current Board of Peace has been unable to make headway on molding long-term peace in Gaza, the one conflict it was created to help solve. (The Security Council limited the board’s authority solely to rebuilding Gaza and set it to expire at the end of 2027.) The idea that it can roam the globe on its own, ending wars with no base of power or authority, is risible.

If the next president is a Democrat, one of their first tasks will probably be to order the words “Donald J. Trump” to be removed from the august wall of the Kennedy Center. There will, however, be no need to worry about dismantling, or doing anything about, the Trump Board of Peace; it will quickly collapse of its own accord.

Whether or not money is the root of all evil, the root of our current American oligarchy is a single Supreme Court case. That Supreme Court decision, Buckley v. Valeo, happens to turn 50 years old this week. It’s Buckley, and not the often-excoriated 2010 Roberts court decision in Citizens United v. FEC, that created the conditions for the ultrawealthy to transform their vastly unequal economic power into lopsided political power, and for a billionaire like Elon Musk to contribute a staggering $291 million to help elect Republican candidates, including Donald Trump, in 2024. It is going to take a constitutional amendment or Supreme Court reform to make things right again—and there’s a realistic chance that the current Supreme Court soon makes things worse, not better—but reform is unlikely because of the power of the very moneyed interests who benefit from the Buckley-created system.

Following President Richard Nixon’s resignation in August 1974, Congress once again took up the question of money in politics. It had passed the Federal Election Campaign Act in 1971, but it was clear that more was needed after investigations into Nixon and Watergate revealed many campaign finance abuses, such as the Nixon reelection campaign shaking down large American corporations for illegal six-figure donations, delivered sometimes in cash or laundered through foreign accounts.

Newly inaugurated President Gerald Ford reluctantly signed the 1974 FECA amendments, which aimed to fundamentally transform American campaign finance. Among other things, the law put in place a disclosure regime to let voters follow the money; it limited the amount that people could contribute to campaigns and spend supporting federal candidates; it put in place a voluntary public financing system for political campaigns; and it created the Federal Election Commission, a bipartisan agency to collect and disseminate campaign finance reports, police abuses, and advise on disputed legal questions.

A coalition of conservatives and liberals concerned about limiting money in politics quickly brought suit. FECA itself included judicial review provisions to have any constitutional challenges fast-tracked, and the Supreme Court obliged. When the case made it to the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Warren Burger felt so rushed that rather than assign a single justice to draft an opinion for the court’s majority, he divided it up into pieces. The result was a not-wholly-coherent unsigned behemoth of an opinion for the court, with separate opinions from five of the eight justices hearing the case (Justice John Paul Stevens recused).

On the key question of whether contribution and spending limits violated the First Amendment rights of free speech and association, Buckley issued a split decision. The court held that Congress could limit the amount that people could contribute directly to candidates and committees, on grounds that such contributions raised a danger of corruption or the appearance of corruption. But it struck down limits on how much individuals could spend independent of candidates.

There, the court reasoned that such independent spending could not corrupt, because to count as independent spending, a spender could not coordinate with the candidate on campaign messaging. Without such communication, the court reasoned, such independent spending could be at cross-purposes with the candidate. The court’s conclusion here was negated by the rise of outside independent groups like “super PACs,” which may be staffed by relatives, staffers, or friends of the candidate and can deploy millions of dollars to support that candidate’s message without every directly communicating with the campaign about strategy.

The Buckley court also held that limiting large independent spending on candidates could not be justified to level the playing field. On this point, the unsigned opinion held that such an equality interest was inherently impermissible:

The concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment, which was designed to secure the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources, and to assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people.

These two holdings—that independent spending can never corrupt, and that equality was an impermissible basis to ever limit money in politics—are Buckley’s original sins. American jurisprudence in this area has had so many twists and turns that it takes a whole book to explain them. Indeed, it took other decisions and rulings, including Citizens United, to get super PACs and nondisclosing political entities that could accept big-money contributions to fund campaigns independent of candidates. But in 1976, and now in 2026, the basic point is the same: American citizens cannot be limited in what they spend independent of candidates to support those candidates’ election.

The First Amendment concerns voiced by Buckley’s challengers were real and the 1974 law was too draconian. In the middle of the Buckley litigation, an advertisement appeared in the Washington Post criticizing Ford for his pardon of Nixon and his choice of Nelson Rockefeller as vice president. As campaign finance expert Herbert Alexander described it, the political advertisement headlined “Would You Elect Ex-Congressman Ford President?” “urged Republicans, Democrats, and independents to oppose Ford and convince him to withdraw as a candidate.” The ad cost $2,368.80, in violation of FECA’s $1,000 individual spending limit. It was a technical violation of the law, but not a fair one. There was also a concern that challengers need more money than incumbents, who already had name recognition and other benefits like free publicity from being in office, and so limiting campaign contributions and spending was in the self-interests of the members of Congress who passed the law.

But whether or not parts of the 1974 FECA went too far, the court was wrong to say that independent spending could never corrupt or create the appearance of corruption, or that there could be no limit in spending by the ultrawealthy. And the results in recent years have been disastrous. As I explained last year at Slate, Musk is not alone among billionaires spending big money:

In the 2024 elections, the top six donors supporting or opposing federal candidates each reported contributing at least $100 million, according to data compiled by OpenSecrets. Those donors—Musk ($291.5 million), Timothy Mellon ($197 million), Miriam Adelson ($148.3 million), Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein ($143.5 million), Ken Griffin ($108.4 million), and Jeffrey and Janine Yass ($101.1 million)—all exclusively supported Donald Trump and other Republican candidates (with the exception of the Yasses, who gave a nominal $1,500 contribution on the Democratic side). The biggest donor on the liberal side was former New York City mayor and publisher Michael Bloomberg, who gave $64.3 million total, with all but $1 million going to the Democratic side.

We have never seen so many nine-figure donors in an election, and with such lopsided giving. In the 2022 midterm elections, the sole nine-figure donor was George Soros ($178.8 million), with his contributions going to Democrats. In earlier election seasons, donations of this size were also rare: There were two in 2020 (Sheldon and Miriam Adelson and Michael Bloomberg), one in 2018 (Sheldon Adelson), and none before that.

Buckley should have been corrected at some point in the last 50 years. In the early 2000s, the court came close, as justices like David Souter recognized the risks of plutocracy. But now the court has turned in the other direction. If this very conservative court ever overrules parts of Buckley, it’s going to be to strike down remaining limits on contributions, not to uphold spending limits. A case currently before the court may lead to further deregulation.

The Buckley court was right that threats to free speech and association, and the dangers of incumbency-protecting laws, mean that courts should closely scrutinize campaign money laws. But that should not doom all attempts to level the playing field or limit the risk of corruption from nine-figure campaign contributions, mostly to ostensibly independent groups. If Congress passed a law with generous contribution and spending limits, and strong disclosure rules, we could have ample breathing room for vigorous and competitive campaigns without the danger of the wealthy swamping our democracy.

Because Buckley was a constitutional decision, there are only two paths to overturn it. One is to get a court majority to rethink the case’s fundamental mistakes. With the current makeup of the court, that seems unlikely. An even harder road is to amend the Constitution to allow for a better balance between the rights of free speech and the risks of corruption and oligarchy.

We should not give up the struggle over our money-in-politics rules. But we must recognize that there will be fierce resistance from the moneyed interests who benefit from a system giving them outsize influence over who is elected and what politicians do once they are in office.

A real democracy deserves better than Buckley.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Linux celeb Lennart Poettering has left Microsoft and co-founded a new company, Amutable, with Chris Kühl and Christian Brauner.

Poettering is best known for systemd. After a lengthy stint at Red Hat, he joined Microsoft in 2022. Kühl was a Microsoft employee until last year, and Brauner, who also joined Microsoft in 2022, left this month.

The trio are leading lights in the Linux and open source world. Brauner posted on Mastodon: &quot;My role in upstream maintenance for the Linux kernel will continue as it always has.&quot;

Poettering will similarly remain deeply involved in the systemd ecosystem.

According to the company&#39;s website, Amutable focuses on &quot;determinism and verifiable integrity&quot; in Linux systems.

In its announcement, the company wrote: &quot;Amutable&#39;s mission is to deliver verifiable integrity to Linux workloads everywhere. We look forward to working towards this goal with the broader Linux community.&quot;

Systemd and Poettering have attracted their fair share of controversy over the years among parts of the Linux community. Like it or loathe it, systemd can be found in most mainstream Linux distributions. At the risk of triggering a slew of angry comments, it can best be described as software that runs first, then starts other required services and applications.

Poettering&#39;s role as chief engineer in Amutable, therefore, makes sense. The Berlin-based company&#39;s goal is to build &quot;cryptographically verifiable integrity into Linux systems. Every system starts in a verified state and stays trusted over time.&quot;

It is unclear why Poettering decided to leave Microsoft. We asked the company to comment but have not received a response. Other than the announcement of systemd 259 in December, Poettering&#39;s blog has been silent on the matter, aside from the announcement of Amutable this week.

In its first post, the Amutable team wrote: &quot;Over the coming months, we&#39;ll be pouring foundations for verification and building robust capabilities on top.&quot;

It will be interesting to see what form this takes. In addition to Poettering, the lead developer of systemd, Amutable&#39;s team includes contributors and maintainers for projects such as Linux, Kubernetes, and containerd. Its members are also very familiar with the likes of Debian, Fedora, SUSE, and Ubuntu. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/29/ibm_q4_2025/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">IBM&#39;s leader has trumpeted an AI-on-the-mainframe future as generative AI fills in the COBOL gap left by earlier generations of techies.

Arvind Krishna, IBM chairman, president, and chief executive officer, was speaking as the company turned in full-year results that showed a leap in mainframe sales.

Big Blue turned in revenue from continuing operations of $19.7 billion for the fourth quarter, up 12 percent on the year, yielding net income of $5.6 billion, up 91 percent. For the full year, revenue was up 8 percent to $67.5 billion, while net income jumped 76 percent to $10.6 billion.

Naturally, AI featured heavily as the firm briefed analysts on the numbers. &quot;Our cumulative GenAI book of business now stands at over $12.5 billion, of which Software is more than $2 billion and Consulting is more than $10.5 billion, with both seeing the largest quarterly increase to date,&quot; said Krishna.

He said the technology was also a &quot;powerful productivity driver&quot; for the firm itself. &quot;In 2023, we set out on a goal to achieve $2 billion of productivity savings exiting 2024. And today, we are well ahead of that, exiting 2025 with $4.5 billion of annual run rate savings.&quot;

However, the strongest growth came in IBM&#39;s infrastructure business, which grew revenues 12 percent for the year, and 21 percent in the fourth quarter.

Software grew 11 percent for the full year, and 14 percent in the fourth quarter. Consulting was the laggard, up 2 percent for the year and 3 percent in the fourth quarter – or flat and 1 percent at constant currency respectively.

That infrastructure boost was in large part powered by the launch of IBM&#39;s z17 series of mainframes.

In his prepared remarks, Krishna said: &quot;Innovation value can also be seen in our IBM Z performance, up 48 percent this year, achieving the highest annual revenue for Z in about 20 years.&quot;

CFO James Kavanaugh referred to a &quot;record z17 launch, achieving the highest annual revenue for IBM Z in about 20 years and outpacing z16 over the first three quarters of the program.&quot;

Krishna said this was more than just a question of legacy replacements. He said sovereignty was a key issue, and &quot;more and more clients have woken up to that for certain workloads, the mainframe is actually the lowest unit cost economics platform, and that is really important.&quot;

At the same time, he said GenAI made mainframes easier to leverage and modernize. &quot;The GenAI tools we have provided with the Watson Code Assistant for Z really takes that onus away. It can refactor COBOL into Java... It can help you refactor that code if you want to keep it exactly as it is.&quot;

He added: &quot;I&#39;m incredibly excited by our ability to do AI right in line. If you can do it right in line with the transactions, that&#39;s a milliseconds delay as opposed to multiple seconds if you take it off platform, which is how people have been doing it so far.&quot;

But if the mainframe is set to be part of the AI future, some other legacy issues are also set to stick with us.

Asked if AI/HBM-fueled DRAM price hikes were a problem, Krishna said: &quot;I personally believe, as long as that dynamic is there, those pricing issues are going to be there through the year.&quot;

He added: &quot;There is no AI server without a bunch of CPUs right next to it. So the reality becomes that the AI demand also drives demand for normal servers that in turn feed and load up those servers.&quot; ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/29/shinyhunters_match_group/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">ShinyHunters has added a fresh notch to its breach belt, claiming it has pinched more than 10 million records from Match Group, a US firm that owns some of the world&#39;s most widely used swipe-based dating platforms.

The extort-and-leak crew says the stolen haul includes user data tied to Hinge, Match.com, and OkCupid, as well as hundreds of internal documents. A listing on ShinyHunters&#39; dark web leak site, seen by The Register, claims &quot;over 10 million lines&quot; of data, and points to AppsFlyer, a marketing analytics provider, as the apparent source of the exposure.

Match Group confirmed to The Register that it is investigating what it described as a &quot;recently identified security incident,&quot; and that some user data has likely been accessed.

&quot;Match Group takes the safety and security of our users seriously and acted quickly to terminate the unauthorized access,&quot; a spokesperson said. &quot;We continue to investigate with the assistance of external cybersecurity experts. There is no indication that user login credentials, financial information, or private communications were accessed. We believe the incident affects a limited amount of user data, and we are already in the process of notifying individuals, as appropriate.&quot;

The company declined to say what types of data were accessed, how many customers were affected, or whether a ransom demand had been made or paid.

Security news outlet Cybernews, which analyzed samples tied to the listing, said the trove appears to include personal customer data, some employee details, and internal corporate material. Its review also flagged Hinge subscription information in the mix, including user IDs, transaction IDs, amounts paid, and records linked to blocked installations, alongside IP addresses and location data.

In a separate post this week, ShinyHunters also said it had stolen data from rival dating service Bumble, uploading what it described as 30 GB of compressed files allegedly pulled from Google Drive and Slack. Bumble hasn&#39;t commented publicly. The Register contacted the company for comment, but did not receive a response.

All of this comes days after researchers said ShinyHunters had targeted roughly 100 organizations in a campaign abusing stolen Okta single sign-on credentials, with big-name SaaS firms among those caught in the fray. Targeted organizations allegedly include Atlassian, AppLovin, Canva, Epic Games, Genesys, HubSpot, Iron Mountain, RingCentral, and ZoomInfo.

For anyone caught up in the alleged dating app haul, the takeaway isn&#39;t about missed matches or awkward swipes, but about just how much behavioral data gets quietly passed around behind the scenes. ®

            <div id="article-text">Oracle could cut up to 30,000 jobs and sell health tech unit Cerner to ease its AI datacenter financing challenges, investment banker TD Cown has claimed, amid changing sentiment on Big Red&#39;s massive build-out plans.

A research note from TD Cowen states that finding equity and debt investors are increasingly questioning how Oracle will finance its datacenter building program to support its $300 billion, five-year contract with OpenAI.

The bank estimates the OpenAI deal alone is going to require $156 billion in capital spending. Last year, when Big Red raised its capex forecasts for 2026 by $15 billion to $50 billion, it spooked some investors.

This year, &quot;both equity and debt investors have raised questions about Oracle&#39;s ability to finance this build-out as demonstrated by widening of Oracle credit default swap (CDS) spreads and pressure on Oracle stock/bonds,&quot; the research note adds.

CDSes offer the buyer some insurance against a debt default. The price of the financial instruments insuring against defaults for five years tripled for Oracle in the final months of last year, says TD Cowen, which is says is an indication of a perceived increase in risk.

TD Cowen estimated the OpenAI build-out alone – Oracle is also building for Meta and Nvidia in a $523 billion total commitment – would require around 3 million GPUs and other IT equipment, suggesting capital investment of $156 billion.

The research note says US banks had pulled back from Oracle-linked datacenter project lending while private operators leasing to Oracle were also struggling to secure financing, impeding the leasing option in its build-out plan.

In September, Oracle issued $18 billion in bonds and raised borrowing elsewhere. Some estimates suggest it will need to borrow $25 billion a year to finance its plans.

Banks in Asia appear more relaxed about Oracle&#39;s risk profile, TD Cowen says, but it reckons that US banks raising questions casts doubt over Big Red&#39;s ability to support its mammoth building program.

Meanwhile, the bank reports that Oracle is now requiring 40 percent upfront deposits from customers – excluding, it believes, large AI customers in datacenter contracts.

TD Cowen says its conversations with channel contacts found that Oracle is &quot;evaluating multiple paths forward to address financing questions.&quot;

According to TD Cowen&#39;s estimates, options on the table include a headcount reduction of between 20,000 and 30,000 to free up $8 billion to $10 billion in cash flow and selling off assets including, potentially, Cerner, the health tech specialist Oracle bought for $28.3 billion in June 2022. It is also evaluating vendor financing as an option.

            <h2>Tesla revenue falls for first time as Musk bets big on robots and autonomy</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tesla reported 2025 revenue of $94.8 billion, down 3 percent year-on-year and marking the first annual revenue decline since the electric car maker began publishing financial results in 2010.

Quarterly revenue slipped to $24.9 billion, also down 3 percent year-on-year, even as the company narrowly beat analysts&#39; expectations.

Automotive revenue fell 11 percent to $17.7 billion in the quarter after Tesla delivered 418,227 cars in the final three months of 2025 – a 15.6 percent drop on the same period a year earlier. For the year as a whole, deliveries were down 8.6 percent, the second straight annual decline in units and the steepest Tesla has ever reported.

The slide comes as the EV market gets more crowded and less forgiving, with cheaper rivals such as China&#39;s BYD pushing harder on price and volume. It has also arrived at an awkward moment politically, with Musk&#39;s ties to Donald Trump sparking backlash among some customers and investors and muddying Tesla&#39;s once carefully managed image.

Net income plunged 61 percent in the quarter to $840 million as operating expenses jumped 39 percent. For the year, profits fell 46 percent to $3.8 billion, Tesla&#39;s weakest annual performance since the depths of the pandemic.

Musk used the earnings call to roll out a freshly polished mission statement built around &quot;amazing abundance,&quot; arguing that advances in AI and robotics will reshape society – and, in his telling, deliver &quot;universal high income&quot; rather than basic income.

The billionaire&#39;s answer is to sideline the cars that helped build Tesla in the first place. Production of the Model S and X is to wind down next quarter, with their Fremont factory space handed over to Optimus. Musk described the move as &quot;slightly sad,&quot; while sketching a future where the site produces up to a million humanoid robots a year instead.

Autonomy remains the central obsession. Musk claims Tesla is now running paid robotaxi rides in Austin with &quot;no safety monitor&quot; and, more recently, &quot;no chase car or anything like that,&quot; insisting that vehicles are operating with no humans involved at all. Tesla expects to have fully autonomous vehicles operating across as much as half of the US by the end of the year, pending regulatory approval.

Musk also dusted off a long-running promise: that Tesla owners will one day be able to loan their cars to an autonomous fleet and make money while they&#39;re not driving them. In the rosiest version of the math, he suggested, that income could even exceed the cost of a lease.

The purpose-built Cybercab is central to that plan. Designed without a steering wheel or pedals, it assumes autonomy will work all the time or not at all. Production is expected to begin in April, with Musk predicting that, over time, Tesla will make &quot;far more Cybercabs than all of our other vehicles combined.&quot;

All this will require cash that Tesla is no longer generating at the same rate. While capital spending fell 14 percent in the fourth quarter, the company warned that 2026 capex will exceed $20 billion as it funds new factories, expands battery production, builds AI compute infrastructure, and ramps up manufacturing for Cybercab, Semi, Megapack, and Optimus. Musk even floated the idea of Tesla building its own semiconductor &quot;Terafab,&quot; arguing it would be &quot;crazy not to try&quot; given looming chip shortages and geopolitical risk.

For Tesla, the warning lights are on. Revenue is shrinking, profits are under pressure, and the car business is losing momentum. Musk&#39;s answer is to proclaim that &quot;the future is autonomous,&quot; and the market appears to have bought the story. ®

            <h2>Patch or perish: Vulnerability exploits now dominate intrusions</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/29/faster_patching_please_cry_infoseccers/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">What good is a fix if you don&#39;t use it? Experts are urging security teams to patch promptly as vulnerability exploits now account for the majority of intrusions, according to the latest figures.

Cisco Talos said exploited flaws were behind nearly 40 percent of all intrusions in Q4 2025, and the speed at which attackers were harnessing those weaknesses should serve as a wake-up call for defenders.

This marks the second quarter in a row that exploits led the charge for initial access, but represented a drop from Q3&#39;s rate of 62 percent, which was driven largely by widespread ToolShell attacks.

More recently, the team pointed to the Oracle EBS and React2Shell vulnerabilities as examples of two high-profile vectors that continued to fuel the trend, both of which were taken up by attackers within hours of disclosure.

Talos stated in its report: &quot;In both cases, exploitation activity occurred around the time the vulnerability became public, demonstrating actors&#39; speed in capitalizing on these opportunities as well as the inherent risks of internet-facing enterprise applications and default deployments embedded in widely used frameworks.&quot;

The Register reported at the time that a functional proof-of-concept exploit for React2Shell began circulating online within 30 hours of disclosure, for example.

Likewise, AWS said Chinese state-backed attackers were exploiting the maximum-severity bug &quot;within hours or days of disclosure.&quot;

Whether organizations heed this warning is another matter, however. Patching systems, especially in large organizations, can be a painful process, but according to a BitSight analysis in 2024, private sector admins are taking months, not hours, to patch the most serious flaws.

Unsurprisingly, phishing was also among the most common ways in which attackers gained access to a victim&#39;s network, coming in second place just behind bug exploits with 32 percent of access cases.

Some notable phishing examples included two possibly-related campaigns targeting Native American tribal organizations.

Talos was involved with both of those, and the team saw successful phishes lead to email account compromises and attackers using their newfound access to launch internal and external follow-on phishing emails.

The going advice is relatively unchanged from the usual stuff: patch systems quickly; implement MFA and – crucially – methods of detecting MFA abuse; and ensure systems are gathering the required logs so that responders have something to work with when they arrive on the scene.

Also, when you can&#39;t patch expeditiously, limit public exposure of these vulnerable endpoints until a time when they can be protected.

Finally, for some good news, ransomware is down to 13 percent of cases from 20 percent in Q3, and 50 percent in Q1 and Q2. Plus, no new criminal groups were seen either.

While that sounds positive, Talos said it probably just means groups are consolidating – big gangs score big takes, while smaller outfits fall by the wayside. Stay frosty. ®

If you’ve been considering picking up the latest Pokémon game for the Switch 2, there’s good reason to do it today, as Best Buy is knocking $14 off the physical version. Pokémon Legends: Z-A normally costs $69.99, but you can snag it for $55.99 for the rest of the day — a price that other retailers aren’t currently matching. The title, which launched in October 2025, feels like a return to form, according to our reviewer Charles Pulliam-Moore, and continues to push the series out of its iterative rut. At this price, the game is cheaper than the original Switch version (but pro tip: the Switch 2 cartridge will work in the original Switch, too, and will let you play the full game as if it were a regular Switch cart).

For those who haven’t jumped into a Pokémon game in a while, Legends: Z-A follows the formula that Arceus introduced. Rather than strictly operating as a turn-based RPG, the player can engage in real-time battles against Pokémon — even catching them sneakily without engaging in a fight is possible. Personally, games like Pokémon Sword / Shield burned me out on the idea of playing another, as it felt similar to playing previous titles, but with better graphics and a larger world. But shaking up how you engage with the core mechanics sounds like a good time.

            <div id="article-text">The tool, which identifies, tags, and removes AI-generated music from recommendations, has detected over 13.4 million AI tracks in 2025.

The tool, which identifies, tags, and removes AI-generated music from recommendations, has detected over 13.4 million AI tracks in 2025.

The music streaming service Deezer is giving other companies access to its AI song-detecting tool. The tool, which identifies, tags, and excludes AI-generated music from algorithmic recommendations, is now available for businesses to purchase and use, according to an announcement on Wednesday.

Deezer launched its AI music detection tool last year as part of efforts to “prevent fraudulent actors from stealing royalties from real artists through mass produced AI-generated music.” The company says it has used the tool to identify and tag more than 13.4 million AI songs in 2025, even as the flood of AI-generated tracks continues to grow. Deezer claims its tool can detect AI songs with a 99.8 percent accuracy rate.

In the press release, Deezer says it receives more than 60,000 AI tracks uploaded every day, making up 39 percent of total uploads. That’s double the 30,000 daily AI track uploads that Deezer reported receiving in September 2025. Deezer also found that up to 85 percent of the AI-generated music streams it identified in 2025 are “fraudulent,” compared to 8 percent of all streams in 2025.

“We know that the majority of AI-music is uploaded to Deezer with the purpose of committing fraud, and we continue to take action,” Deezer CEO Alexis Lanternier says in the press release. “Every fraudulent stream that we detect is demonetized so that the royalties of human artists, songwriters and other rights owners are not affected.”

As songs generated with platforms like Suno and Udio become harder to identify, music streaming services are taking steps to ensure listeners know when the music they’re listening to wasn’t created by a human. Spotify began rolling out new policies to address AI music and impersonation last year, and it’s also working on a new metadata standard for disclosing the use of AI. Meanwhile, Bandcamp is taking a tougher stance and is banning AI-generated content completely.

            <div id="article-text">﻿Nick Shirley and others like him are reminiscent of yellow journalism of the 19th century, updated and turbocharged by social media algorithms.

The violent federal occupation of Minneapolis — and the subsequent killings of two residents at the hands of immigration agents — began with a vlog. Nick Shirley, a roving 23-year-old with a smartphone and a taste for outrage, made a YouTube video with unfounded allegations of fraud at daycares operated by the local Somali American community. Like so much partisan media in history, he was trying to rile up the right-wing base. But he was also playing to another audience: the algorithm.

When I wrote about Shirley in early January, I described him as an influencer — a catch-all term that could be applied to a wide range of people, anyone from Joe Rogan to a 20-something woman sharing Shein hauls on TikTok. Shirley exhibits many shared behaviors: He has a following with parasocial tendencies. His style and sensibilities are finely tuned to what will play well online. He hawks merch at every turn. His literal influence reaches into the highest offices of the US government (Vice President JD Vance has sung his praises). But Shirley and his ilk are not just content creators with a right-wing twist — they’re algo hounds. And he was not just making plain old propaganda; he was making internet slop.

We mostly talk about it in the context of AI-generated material, but slop does not need to be synthetic — AI slop is just a subgenre of a larger type of content that is made quickly and cheaply and poorly. The same lukewarm financial advice peddled by thousands of literal talking heads on Instagram Reels is slop. Falsehoods and oversimplifications about breaking news or contentious celebrity drama that snowball to millions of views is slop. Engagement bait is slop. The president’s social media posts are slop. The main function of slop is to take something from you: your time, your attention, your trust. It is passive in that it requires nothing from viewers but to sit back and consume it. Slop is boring, repetitive, and often inexpensive to make — the natural evolution of an internet built for scale and ruthless optimization. Before his pivot to conservative politics, Shirley was making slop for babies: YouTube videos with titles like “16 YEAR OLD FLIES TO NEW YORK WITHOUT TELLING PARENTS” and “Giving My Teachers $1,000 for Christmas! *emotional*”

A few years ago, Shirley seems to have discovered that what the algorithm actually rewards is inflammatory political content. His views swelled as he hammered on Donald Trump and MAGA talking points around immigration, drugs, and the 2024 presidential election. But even in his newfound political lane, the slop tendencies remained. At least four video titles follow the format of “[City] Has Fallen…” and Shirley and others like him revisit the same topics over and over: They go to Canal Street in New York City, to Kensington in Philadelphia, to demonstrations trying to make liberal protesters and passersby look foolish. Many people making content like this call themselves “independent journalists” and call the content they produce “reporting.”

Partisan media and shoddy reporting have a long history in the US, but one parallel stands out: the era of the so-called yellow press, which got its name from a cartoon strip published in papers featuring a child in a yellow shirt.

“It was a moment before professional news values had really set in, before there were professional codes of ethics,” says Lucas Graves, distinguished researcher at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid and a professor in the School of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. The biggest newspapers, like the New York World and New York Journal, would run serious, reported news stories. But they “would also run stories to try to generate outrage and almost invent scandals in order to sell more newspapers,” Graves says. There’s debate about how much responsibility yellow journalism carries in the outbreak of the Spanish–American War of 1898 — but, like the contemporary slopagandists and the Trump administration, the press coverage and government actions were in sync. The government wanted public outrage directed at Spain and to expand its empire; the yellow press wanted to sell newspapers.

“There’s an alignment between the creator’s interest in generating outrage and gaining audience or getting clicks, and the government’s interest in helping to drive public support for whatever its desired policy is,” Graves says. “And that’s when a partisan press becomes really dangerous.”

The difference is that modern slopagandists have an unprecedented amount of data about how their content is performing and what their audiences want. Traditional media outlets of the 20th century had only crude signals — newspaper circulation figures, Nielsen ratings — and journalists therefore imagined what their audiences wanted to read. Digitally savvy content creators do not need to guess; they have instant, granular data about what their viewers watch, what titles and topics get them to click, and when they drop off, and endless comments to gauge how people feel about a new video. Many modern newsrooms use audience metrics to guide coverage, but feeding viewers only what makes the numbers go up isn’t journalism. It’s news slop.

You either die an outsider or live long enough to see yourself become the mainstream

“Independent journalists” like Shirley get to have it both ways: They are the media now, to borrow a line from Elon Musk, but they also get to rail against the MSM, to tell their viewers that journalism is dead. Though his claims were unfounded and his evidence sloppy, Shirley’s viral fraud video achieved something that many reporters dream of: immediate impact. It’s almost unheard of that a single story results in an instantaneous response from multiple federal agencies. There is also a deep irony in framing oneself as counterculture or alternative when your work aligns neatly with those in power. When was the last time a vice president uplifted a 23-year-old’s vlog as “more useful” than Pulitzer winners? Shirley’s audience includes Vance, FBI Director Kash Patel, Attorney General Pam Bondi, and Lisa Demuth, a Republican running for governor in Minnesota, who reportedly provided Shirley with information that was used in his fraud video. You either die an outsider or live long enough to see yourself become the mainstream.

After his viral fraud video triggered an influx of federal immigration agents in Minneapolis, Shirley sat down for a long conversation with Channel 5, a left-leaning infotainment account hosted by Andrew Callaghan that helped popularize this kind of news content. Both men refer to themselves as independent journalists and talk at length about the media industry, specifically the idea that traditional media is dying (they’re not totally wrong) and that content creators like themselves are what will take its place. Shirley bristles at being labeled an influencer in press coverage.

“Every single time they bring up ‘Nick Shirley’ on these news sites or on the internet or on their TV, they’ll say right-wing YouTuber, MAGA YouTuber, conservative,” Shirley says. The YouTuber has paid people to appear in his politically charged videos, continuously repeats inaccurate claims, and asked the president and senior administration officials how he can help them. He withheld the full name of a source in the video, who turned out to be a right-wing lobbyist. He seems unfamiliar with how daycares operate to begin with. “It’s never ‘journalist Nick Shirley,’” he complains.

Brooke Erin Duffy, associate professor at Cornell University, notes that the label of “influencer” still has a stigma. “Its feminine-coded nature and trappings of crass commercialism complicate its uptake in news and public affairs,” Duffy said in an email. “‘Journalists,’ by contrast, are expected to have professional training and accreditation.”

At one point, Callaghan says that traditional media lost the trust of the public because news pundits and political parties became too closely intertwined — that the public felt CNN was a Democrat megaphone and Fox News was the Republican mouthpiece.

“The fear now that I’ve thought about before — and I’m not saying this is happening, it will probably take five to 10 years — is that somehow the political powers that be figure out how to use the independent creator economy on a sleeper cell level to do their bidding for them,” Callaghan says.

Even Shirley agrees that it “could happen,” but says he has not and would not take deals with party-aligned groups: “I make enough money doing my videos off YouTube and the people that support me. Why would I ever turn against their best interest?” Shirley didn’t respond to The Verge’s request for comment.

In an era when everything — even a top-secret government operation — is monetizable, slopagandists don’t need to be on the state payroll to have their livelihood tied to the administration. They do not even need to possess coherent politics or ideologies other than whatever plays well online at the time, or what successfully incites a response from a federal government that has chained itself to the algorithm. On X, they swim in the backwash of a myopic mob, taking signals from its billionaire owner and ghost patriot accounts. Meanwhile, Trump’s approval rating when it comes to immigration is at a record low and anti-ICE sentiment is catching on in all kinds of communities, including those you’d least expect.

For many Americans, people like Shirley have indeed replaced or added to their news consumption habits even if what they do has little in common with journalism. I am not especially precious about who calls themselves a journalist: You don’t have to go to journalism school to be a reporter; you don’t have to work at a well-known news outlet to do great work; you can work across forms, whether it’s 10,000-word features or 10-minute videos. But actual journalists need ethics and lines they will not cross. They need editorial standards and a commitment to correcting errors when they occur. Traditional media and newsrooms are far from perfect, but at least we can say so; slopagandists, on the other hand, can never be wrong because their work does not need to be based in fact.

The other problem for slopagandists, of course, is that the signals they answer to are fickle — one change and the machine that pays their bills becomes a roadblock. They will decry “the algorithm” as censorial until they eventually need to pivot to celebrity commentary in order to find a new audience. When the inevitable switch-up happens — and it usually does — it will be because there’s a new carrot to chase, a new kind of outrage to perform for the recommendation engine. There are already signs of what Shirley might try to manufacture as the next cause célèbre: He was chased out of a Baltimore Narcotics Anonymous meeting last week, claiming to be filming a video on fentanyl, and was spotted in the city trying to interview people about overdoses. When his video is finally posted, I think I can guess what he will have uncovered.</div>

After premiering in festivals last year, the movie is finally in theaters more widely starting on January 30th.

Classic 2D animation may not be as prevalent as it once was, but some of the stuff we’re getting over the last few years has been incredible. That includes future classics like Mars Express and Scavengers Reign, and now you can add the Moebius-inspired Arco to the list. After making a splash on the festival circuit last year, the film is finally hitting theaters more widely on January 30th, so you can see it for yourself.

Arco’s story is split across two time periods. In the distant future, humanity lives in cities elevated above the surface due to rising sea levels, but they’ve also developed the ability to time travel in order to scour the past for useful things like extinct seeds. Traveling through time has an almost magical feeling here; you do it while flying, powered by colorful suits and special crystals, and the result looks like a rainbow spreading across the sky. But there are also strict rules in place, as you need to be at least 12 years old to fly. The reason becomes obvious when a restless 10-year-old named Arco (Juliano Krue Valdi) attempts to travel through time using his sister’s gear and promptly ends up trapped in the past.

That past is still our future, the year 2075, and it’s not all that dissimilar to our present day. People work too much, try to isolate themselves from the effects of climate change, and have an almost adversarial relationship with nature. The difference is that new technologies exacerbate many of these issues. Parents use holograms to make appearances at home while they work long hours, relegating most child-rearing duties — including education — to robots. When bad storms ravage the landscape, suburban dwellers stay safe within big clear domes that cover their homes. Things are bad, but most people seem content avoiding that reality. Arco crashes into this time period and meets a young girl named Iris (Romy Fay) who does her best to get him back home.

Arco’s influences are clear from the very first moments of the film. The characters, technology, and architecture all call to mind the works of French comics legend Jean “Moebius” Giraud, particularly his work on the film Time Masters, while the lovingly detailed renditions of nature are reminiscent of Studio Ghibli’s Hayao Miyazaki. But Arco’s relationship with these classics is inspiration rather than imitation.

For one thing, despite all of the complexities inherent in time travel, the story is clear and focused and ends on a note that’s equal parts bittersweet and hopeful, making it accessible as both a family film and an experience for sci-fi diehards. But director Ugo Bienvenu and his team also show an incredible amount of creativity throughout. They don’t just imagine technological advances, but really think through the impact they could have on everyday life. Iris’s parents (Mark Ruffalo and Natalie Portman), for instance, are barely physically present at all, instead making brief appearances at home as holograms. It’s like remote work but for parenting. Along those same lines, almost every adult you see in 2075 is wearing some kind of AR glasses that seem like a natural (and horrifying) progression of phone addiction and also allow them to avoid thinking too hard about the extreme weather events.

Arco uses its futuristic settings to explore all kinds of modern issues — there’s even a trio of goofy conspiracy theorist brothers (Andy Samberg, Will Ferrell, and Flea) convinced Arco is from the future — but without getting preachy or straying far from its core story. Importantly, though, the sci-fi elements frequently look cool as hell, like during a chase sequence through holographic classrooms that look like everything from a dinosaur-filled swamp to the bottom of the ocean. They also create a world that feels plausible, even when it’s outlandish.

While the visuals and sci-fi elements are the obvious hooks, my favorite part of Arco is how the film not only vividly imagines two very different possible futures, but then connects them in a way that brings the whole story full circle. It’s beautiful and heartbreaking — and another modern 2D film with the potential to become a classic.

What the bidding war over Warner Bros. Discovery says about the future of Hollywood, with Puck’s Julia Alexander.

On today’s episode of Decoder, I’m talking about the bidding war over Warner Bros. Discovery, which is the biggest story in the entertainment industry right now, and for good reason. It has pretty much everything you could want in a buzzy Hollywood saga — big names, big money, and big drama.

Right now, the winning bidder is Netflix. The streaming juggernaut won the bid for Warner Bros., offering $83 billion dollars for the movie studios, but not the cable channels, to keep its content machine humming for more than 325 million subscribers.

But Paramount Skydance simply won’t go away, even though the official process is over. The company has bid, bid again, and is now attempting a hostile takeover to the tune of $108 billion for the whole package, including those cable channels. Paramount is run by David Ellison, the son of Oracle cofounder and tech billionaire Larry Ellison, and I have to say his whole vibe feels ripped straight from an episode of Succession. This man is desperate to become a bona fide media mogul, using the combination of Paramount, his dad’s ever-growing AI money, and the good graces of the Trump administration to make it happen.

Caught up in the middle of all this are HBO, CNN, and Warner Bros. Pictures. Despite world-class brand recognition, legitimate megahits, and legendary franchises, these companies have been so historically, comically mismanaged under a long series of clueless corporate parents that the whole bundle has ended up sold, merged, or spun off into something new more times than I can count. Seriously, it’s mind-boggling how badly companies like AOL, Time Warner, and AT&T have fumbled this over the last 25 years.

To help me make sense of it all, I wanted to talk with Julia Alexander, a Verge alum and now media correspondent at Puck News who’s one of the best in the business at analyzing corporate strategy, Hollywood, and what’s next in entertainment. Julia really helped me break down why Netflix wants Warner Bros. and why David Ellison seems to think he’s got a better (or even different) strategy than current Warner Bros. boss David Zaslav. Perhaps most importantly, we also discussed how the tech industry fits into this puzzle.

Because central to the pressure facing Hollywood today, as you’ll hear Julia explain, is the battle for our attention, and that battle is being fought by everything: from video games like Fortnite and Roblox to short-form video on YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram.

Soon, all of these platforms could be flooded with cheap, endless AI video. It seems that only a few companies, Netflix chief among them, seem to have any plan whatsoever for when that wrecking ball finally hits. If you’re a longtime Decoder listener, you know I really love talking to Julia about Hollywood and the entertainment industry. This episode is no different.

            <div id="article-text">OpenAI’s sprawling web of debt-based partnerships mean it would still benefit from an industry-wide bailout.

OpenAI’s sprawling web of debt-based partnerships mean it would still benefit from an industry-wide bailout.

Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is pushing OpenAI for assurances it won’t seek a government bailout if it doesn’t turn a profit. In a letter to CEO Sam Altman, Warren says she is concerned that the company is preparing to fall back “on the classic strategy of privatizing profits and socializing losses” amid soaring spending and growing fears of an AI bubble popping.

Warren writes that she is worried OpenAI “has committed to more than a trillion dollars in spending despite not yet turning a profit” and “appears to be seeking government assistance should it prove unable to pay its bills.” The senator, a ranking member on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, says the company’s “increasingly tangled web of speculative, debt-based industry partnerships and circular spending arrangements” creates risk for the entire US economy, which could leave the government with little option but to step in should the AI industry falter. Warren points to CoreWeave as an example, noting that the company is saddled with debt to fulfill its contract with OpenAI, which has “comparatively little debt on its own balance sheet.”

OpenAI has repeatedly rejected the idea it is seeking or has government guarantees. The company has been in a near-constant state of PR crisis over the matter since last November, when CFO Sarah Friar suggested taxpayers should “backstop” the company’s hefty infrastructure investments. Friar swiftly walked back her remarks and Altman stressed that OpenAI does “not have or want government guarantees for OpenAI datacenters [sic].” However, Warren writes that these “statements do not appear to reject federal loans and guarantees for the AI industry as a whole.” Even without a targeted bailout, Warren says OpenAI would benefit handsomely from such industry-wide support “given the scale of its financial commitments and the mismatch between its spending and revenues.”

The Trump administration has also rejected the idea of government bailouts for AI companies as they pour billions and billions of dollars into projects like Stargate to scale up AI with no clear path to profitability. Shortly after Friar’s backstop comments, White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks tweeted that “[t]here will be no federal bailout of AI.” Concurrently, tech companies have been working hard to ingratiate themselves with President Trump and the federal government. Firms like Amazon, Apple, Google, and Meta all donated to Trump’s ballroom project; executives like Mark Zuckerberg, Altman, and Tim Cook have made pilgrimages to show fealty in DC or at Mar-a-Lago; and the cofounder and president of OpenAI, Greg Brockman, and his wife Anna were recently revealed to be Trump mega-donors. Warren, along with other lawmakers, has suggested some contributions could be considered bribes.

Warren wrote to Sacks in November asking the administration to confirm it will not use taxpayer dollars to “prop up” major AI companies. In her letter to Altman, she says “he has yet to reply.”

Warren is asking Altman to provide details on conversations OpenAI has had with the US government about loan guarantees and to confirm what kind of federal support for the industry the company favors. Warren is also seeking details on the specific infrastructure OpenAI is seeking tax credits for and information on the company’s projected yearly finances through 2032, particularly what would happen in the event AI models plateau and demand for AI tools fails to materialize. She also asks for information on whether the company is earning a profit on any of its ChatGPT plans right now or anticipates doing so within the next three years.

Warren has given Altman until February 13th, 2026 to reply.

Meet the Vitalists: the hardcore longevity enthusiasts who believe death is “wrong”

Last April, an excited crowd gathered at a compound in Berkeley, California, for a three-day event called the Vitalist Bay Summit. It was part of a longer, two-month residency that hosted various events to explore tools—from drug regulation to cryonics—that might be deployed in the fight against death.One of the main goals, though, was to spread the word of Vitalism, a somewhat radical movement established by Nathan Cheng and his colleague Adam Gries a few years ago. Consider it longevity for the most hardcore adherents—a sweeping mission to which nothing short of total devotion will do.Although interest in longevity has certainly taken off in recent years, not everyone in the broader longevity space shares Vitalists’ commitment to actually making death obsolete. And the Vitalists feel that momentum is building, not just for the science of aging and the development of lifespan-extending therapies, but for the acceptance of their philosophy that defeating death should be humanity’s top concern.

The ability to remember you and your preferences is rapidly becoming a big selling point for AI chatbots and agents.Personalized, interactive AI systems are built to act on our behalf, maintain context across conversations, and improve our ability to carry out all sorts of tasks, from booking travel to filing taxes.But their ability to store and retrieve increasingly intimate details about their users over time introduces alarming, and all-too-familiar, privacy vulnerabilities––many of which have loomed since “big data” first teased the power of spotting and acting on user patterns. Worse, AI agents now appear poised to plow through whatever safeguards had been adopted to avoid those vulnerabilities. So what can developers do to fix this problem? Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">The eastern half of the US saw a monster snowstorm over the weekend. The good news is the grid has largely been able to keep up with the freezing temperatures and increased demand. But there were some signs of strain, particularly for fossil-fuel plants.

One analysis found that PJM, the nation’s largest grid operator, saw significant unplanned outages in plants that run on natural gas and coal. Historically, these facilities can struggle in extreme winter weather.

Much of the country continues to face record-low temperatures, and the possibility is looming for even more snow this weekend. What lessons can we take from this storm, and how might we shore up the grid to cope with extreme weather?

Living in New Jersey, I have the honor of being one of the roughly 67 million Americans covered by the PJM Interconnection.

So I was in the thick of things this weekend, when PJM saw unplanned outages of over 20 gigawatts on Sunday during the height of the storm. (That’s about 16% of the grid’s demand that afternoon.) Other plants were able to make up the difference, and thankfully, the power didn’t go out in my area. But that’s a lot of capacity offline.

Typically, the grid operator doesn’t announce details about why an outage occurs until later. But analysts at Energy Innovation, a policy and research firm specializing in energy and climate, went digging. By examining publicly available grid mix data (a breakdown of what types of power plants are supplying the grid), the team came to a big conclusion: Fossil fuels failed during the storm.

The analysts found that gas-fired power plants were producing about 10 gigawatts less power on Sunday than the peak demand on Saturday, even while electricity prices were high. Coal- and oil-burning plants were down too. Because these plants weren’t operating, even when high prices would make it quite lucrative, they were likely a significant part of the problem, says Michelle Solomon, a manager in the electricity program at Energy Innovation.

PJM plans to share more details about the outages at an upcoming committee meeting once the cold snap passes, Dan Lockwood, a PJM spokesperson, told me via email.

Fossil-fuel plants can see reliability challenges during winter: When temperatures drop, pressures in natural-gas lines fall too, which can lead to issues for fuel supply. Freezing temperatures can throw compression stations and other mechanical equipment offline and even freeze piles of coal.

One of the starkest examples came in 2021, when Texas faced freezing temperatures that took many power plants offline and threw the grid into chaos. Many homes lost power for days, and at least 246 people died during that storm.

Texas fared much better this time around. After 2021, the state shored up its grid, adding winter weatherization for power plants and transmission systems. Texas has also seen a huge flood of batteries come online, which has greatly helped the grid during winter demand peaks, especially in the early mornings. Texas was also simply lucky that this storm was less severe there, as one expert told Inside Climate News this week.

Here on the East Coast, we’re not out of the woods yet. The snow has stopped falling, but grids are still facing high electricity demand because of freezing temperatures. (I’ve certainly been living under my heated blanket these last few days.)

PJM could see a peak power demand of 130 gigawatts for seven straight days, a winter streak that the local grid has never experienced, according to an update to the utility’s site on Tuesday morning.

The US Department of Energy issued emergency orders to several grid operators, including PJM, that allow power plants to run while basically ignoring emissions regulations. The department also issued orders allowing several grids to tell data centers and other facilities to begin using backup generators. (This is good news for reliability but bad news for clean air and the climate, since these power sources are often incredibly emissions-intensive.)

We here on the East Coast could learn a thing or two from Texas so we don’t need to resort to these polluting emergency measures to keep the lights on. More energy storage could be a major help in future winter storms, lending flexibility to the grid to help ride out the worst times, Solomon says. Getting offshore wind online could also help, since those facilities typically produce reliable power in the winter.

No one energy source will solve the massive challenge of building and maintaining a resilient grid. But as we face the continued threat of extreme storms, renewables might actually help us weather them.

            <h2>Meet the Vitalists: the hardcore longevity enthusiasts who believe death is “wrong”</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/29/1131815/vitalism-longevity-enthusiasts-influence/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">“Who here believes involuntary death is a good thing?”

Nathan Cheng has been delivering similar versions of this speech over the last couple of years, so I knew what was coming. He was about to try to convince the 80 or so people in the audience that death is bad. And that defeating it should be humanity’s number one priority—quite literally, that it should come above all else in the social and political hierarchy.

“If you believe that life is good and there&#39;s inherent moral value to life,” he told them, “it stands to reason that the ultimate logical conclusion here is that we should try to extend lifespan indefinitely.”

Solving aging, he added, is “a problem that has an incredible moral duty for all of us to get involved in.”

It was the end of April, and the crowd—with its whoops and yeahs—certainly seemed convinced. They’d gathered at a compound in Berkeley, California, for a three-day event called the Vitalist Bay Summit. It was part of a longer, two-month residency (simply called Vitalist Bay) that hosted various events to explore tools—from drug regulation to cryonics—that might be deployed in the fight against death. One of the main goals, though, was to spread the word of Vitalism, a somewhat radical movement established by Cheng and his colleague Adam Gries a few years ago.

No relation to the lowercase vitalism of old, this Vitalism has a foundational philosophy that’s deceptively simple: to acknowledge that death is bad and life is good. The strategy for executing it, though, is far more obviously complicated: to launch a longevity revolution.

Interest in longevity has certainly taken off in recent years, but as the Vitalists see it, it has a branding problem. The term “longevity” has been used to sell supplements with no evidence behind them, “anti-aging” has been used by clinics to sell treatments, and “transhumanism” relates to ideas that go well beyond the scope of defeating death. Not everyone in the broader longevity space shares Vitalists’ commitment to actually making death obsolete. As Gries, a longtime longevity devotee who has largely become the enthusiastic public face of Vitalism, said in an online presentation about the movement in 2024, “We needed some new word.”

“Vitalism” became a clean slate: They would start a movement to defeat death, and make that goal the driving force behind the actions of individuals, societies, and nations. Longevity could no longer be a sideshow. For Vitalism to succeed, budgets would need to change. Policy would need to change. Culture would need to change. Consider it longevity for the most hardcore adherents—a sweeping mission to which nothing short of total devotion will do.

“The idea is to change the systems and the priorities of society at the highest levels,” Gries said in the presentation.

To be clear, the effective anti-aging treatments the Vitalists are after don’t yet exist. But that’s sort of the point: They believe they could exist if Vitalists are able to spread their gospel, influence science, gain followers, get cash, and ultimately reshape government policies and priorities.

For the past few years, Gries and Cheng have been working to recruit lobbyists, academics, biotech CEOs, high-net-worth individuals, and even politicians into the movement, and they’ve formally established a nonprofit foundation “to accelerate Vitalism.” Today, there’s a growing number of Vitalists (some paying foundation members, others more informal followers, and still others who support the cause but won’t publicly admit as much), and the foundation has started “certifying” qualifying biotech companies as Vitalist organizations. Perhaps most consequentially, Gries, Cheng, and their peers are also getting involved in shaping US state laws that make unproven, experimental treatments more accessible. They hope to be able to do the same at the national level.

Vitalism cofounders Nathan Cheng and Adam Gries want to launch a longevity revolution.

All this is helping Vitalists grow in prominence, if not also power. In the past, people who have spoken of living forever or making death “optional” have been dismissed by their academic colleagues. I’ve been covering the broader field of aging science for a decade, and I’ve seen scientists roll their eyes, shrug their shoulders, and turn their backs on people who have talked this way. That’s not the case for the Vitalists.

Even the scientists who think that Vitalist ideas of defeating death are wacky, unattainable ones, with the potential to discredit their field, have shown up on stage with Vitalism’s founders, and these serious researchers provide a platform for them at more traditionally academic events.

I saw this collegiality firsthand at Vitalist Bay. Faculty members from Harvard, Stanford, and the University of California, Berkeley, all spoke at events. Eric Verdin, the prominent researcher who directs the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in Novato, California, had also planned to speak, although a scheduling clash meant he couldn’t make it in the end. “I have very different ideas in terms of what’s doable,” he told me. “But that’s part of the [longevity] movement—there’s freedom for people to say whatever they want.”

Many other well-respected scientists attended, including representatives of ARPA-H, the US federal agency for health research and breakthrough technologies. And as I left for a different event on longevity in Washington, DC, just after the Vitalist Bay Summit, a sizable group of Vitalist Bay attendees headed that way too, to make the case for longevity to US lawmakers.

The Vitalists feel that momentum is building, not just for the science of aging and the development of lifespan-extending therapies, but for the acceptance of their philosophy that defeating death should be humanity’s top concern.

This, of course, sparks some pretty profound questions. What would a society without death look like—and would we even want it? After all, death has become an important part of human culture the world over. And even if Vitalists aren’t destined to realize their lofty goal, their growing influence could still have implications for us all. As they run more labs and companies, and insert themselves into the making of laws and policy, perhaps they will discover treatments that really do slow or even reverse aging. In the meantime, though, some ethicists are concerned that experimental and unproven medicines—including potentially dangerous ones—are becoming more accessible, in some cases with little to no oversight.

Gries, ultimately, has a different view of the ethics here. He thinks that being “okay with death” is what disqualifies a person from being considered ethical. “Death is just wrong,” he says. “It’s not just wrong for some people. It’s wrong for all people.”

When I arrived at the Vitalist Bay Summit on April 25, I noticed that the venue was equipped with everything a longevity enthusiast might need: napping rooms, a DEXA body-composition scanner, a sauna in a bus, and, for those so inclined, 24-hour karaoke.

I was told that around 300 people had signed up for that day’s events, which was more than had attended the previous week. That might have been because arguably the world’s most famous longevity enthusiast, Bryan Johnson, was about to make an appearance. (If you’re curious to know more about what Johnson was doing there, you can read about our conversation here.)

The key to Vitalism has always been that “death is humanity’s core problem, and aging its primary agent,” cofounder Adam Gries told me. “So it was, and so it has continued, as it was foretold.”

But Gries, another man in his 40s who doesn’t want to die, was the first to address the audience that day. Athletic and energetic, he bounded across a stage wearing bright yellow shorts and a long-sleeved shirt imploring people to “Choose Life: VITALISM.”

Gries is a tech entrepreneur who describes himself as a self-taught software engineer who’s “good at virality.” He’s been building companies since he was in college in the 2000s, and grew his personal wealth by selling them.

As with many other devotees to the cause, his deep interest in life extension was sparked by Aubrey de Grey, a controversial researcher with an iconic long beard and matching ponytail. He’s known widely both for his optimistic views about “defeating aging” and for having reportedly made sexual comments to two longevity entrepreneurs. (In an email, de Grey said he’s “never disputed” one of these remarks but denied having made the other. “My continued standing within the longevity community speaks for itself,” he added.)

In an influential 2005 TED Talk (which has over 4.8 million views), de Grey predicted that people would live to 1,000 and spoke of the possibility of new technologies that would continue to stave off death, allowing some to avoid it indefinitely. (In a podcast recorded last year, Cheng described a recording of this talk as “the OG longevity-pilling YouTube video.”)

“It was kind of evident to me that life is great,” says Gries. “So I’m kind of like, why would I not want to live?”

A second turning point for Gries came during the early stages of the covid-19 pandemic, when he essentially bet against companies that he thought would collapse. “I made this 50 [fold] return,” he says. “It was kind of like living through The Big Short.”

Gries and his wife fled from San Francisco to Israel, where he grew up, and later traveled to Taiwan, where he’d obtained a “golden visa” and which was, at the time, one of only two countries that had not reported a single case of covid. His growing wealth afforded him the opportunity to take time from work and think about the purpose of life. “My answer was: Life is the purpose of life,” he says. He didn’t want to die. He didn’t want to experience the “journey of decrepitude” that aging often involves.

So he decided to dedicate himself to the longevity cause. He went about looking up others who seemed as invested as he was. In 2021 his search led him to Cheng, a Chinese-Canadian entrepreneur based in Toronto. He had dropped out of a physics PhD a few years earlier after experiencing what he describes on his website as “a massive existential crisis” and shifted his focus to “radical longevity.” (Cheng did not respond to email requests for an interview.)

The pair “hit it off immediately,” says Gries, and they spent the following two years trying to figure out what they could do. The solution they finally settled on: revolution.

After all, Gries reasons, that’s how significant religious and social movements have happened in the past. He says they sought inspiration from the French and American Revolutions, among others. The idea was to start with some kind of “enlightenment,” and with a “hardcore group,” to pursue significant social change with global ramifications.

“We were convinced that without a revolution,” Gries says, “we were as good as dead.”

Early on, they wrote a Vitalist declaration, a white paper that lists five core statements for believers:

While it’s not an explicit part of the manifesto, it was important to them to think about it as a moral philosophy as well as a movement. As Cheng said at the time, morality “guides most of the actions of our lives.” The same should be true of Vitalism, he suggested.

Gries has echoed this idea. The belief that “death is morally bad” is necessary to encourage behavior change, he told me in 2024. It is a moral drive, or moral purpose, that pushes people to do difficult things, he added.

Revolution, after all, is difficult. And to succeed—to “get unlimited great health to the top of the priority list,” as Gries says—the movement would need to infiltrate the government and shape policy decisions and national budgets. The Apollo program got people to the moon with less than 1% of US GDP; imagine, Gries asks, what we could do to human longevity with a mere 1% of GDP?

It makes sense, then, that Gries and Cheng launched Vitalism in 2023 at Zuzalu, a “pop-up city” in Montenegro that provided a two-month home for like-minded longevity enthusiasts. The gathering was in some ways a loose prototype for what they wanted to accomplish. Cheng spoke there of how they wanted to persuade 10,000 or so Vitalists to move to Rhode Island. Not only was it close to the biotech hub of Boston, but they believed it had a small enough population for an influx of new voters sharing their philosophy to influence local and state elections. “Five to ten thousand people—that’s all we need,” he said. Or if not Rhode Island, another small-ish US state, where they could still change state policy from the inside.

The ultimate goal was to recruit Vitalists to help them establish a “longevity state”—a recognized jurisdiction that “prioritizes doing something about aging,” Cheng said, perhaps by loosening regulations on clinical trials or supporting biohacking.

This idea is popular among many vocal members of the Vitalism community. It borrows from the concept of the “network state” developed by former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan, defined as a new city or country that runs on cryptocurrency; focuses on a goal, in this case extending human lifespan; and “eventually gains diplomatic recognition from preexisting states.”

Some people not interested in dying have made progress toward realizing such a domain. Following the success of Zuzalu, one of the event’s organizers, Laurence Ion, a young cryptocurrency investor and self-proclaimed Vitalist, joined a fellow longevity enthusiast named Niklas Anzinger to organize a sequel in Próspera, the private “special economic zone” on the Honduran island of Roatán. They called their “pop-up city” Vitalia.

I visited shortly after it launched in January 2024. The goal was to create a low-regulation biotech hub to fast-track the development of anti-aging drugs, though the “city” was more like a gated resort that hosted talks from a mix of respected academics, biohackers, biotech CEOs, and straight-up eugenicists. There was a strong sense of community—many attendees were living with or near each other, after all. A huge canvas where attendees could leave notes included missives like “Don’t die,” “I love you,” and “Meet technoradicals building the future!”

But Vitalia was short-lived, with events ending by the start of March 2024. And while many of the vibes were similar to what I’d later see at Vitalist Bay, the temporary nature of Vitalia didn’t quite match the ambition of Gries and Cheng.

Patri Friedman, a 49-year-old libertarian and grandson of the economist Milton Friedman who says he attended Zuzalu, Vitalia, and Vitalist Bay, envisions something potentially even bolder. He’s the founder of the Seasteading Institute, which has the goal of “building startup communities that float on the ocean with any measure of political autonomy” and has received funding and support from the billionaire Peter Thiel. Friedman also founded Pronomos Capital, a venture capital fund that invests in projects focused on “building the cities of tomorrow.”

His company is exploring various types of potential network states, but he says he’s found that medical tourism—and, specifically, a hunger for life extension—dominates the field. “People do not want this ‘10 years and a billion dollars to pass a drug’ thing with the FDA,” says Friedman. (While he doesn’t call himself a Vitalist, partly because he’s “almost never going to agree with” any kind of decree, Friedman holds what you might consider similarly staunch sentiments about death, which he referred to as “murder by omission.” When I asked him if he has a target age he’d like to reach, he told me he found the question “mind-bogglingly strange” and “insane.” “How could you possibly be like: Yes, please murder me at this time?” he replied. “I can always fucking shoot myself in the head—I don’t need anybody’s help.”)

But even as Vitalists and those aligned with their beliefs embrace longevity states, Gries and Cheng are reassessing their former ambitions. The network-state approach has limits, Gries tells me. And encouraging thousands of people to move to Rhode Island wasn’t as straightforward as they’d hoped it might be.

Not because he can’t find tens of thousands of Vitalists, Gries stresses—but most of them are unwilling to move their lives for the sake of influencing the policy of another state. He compares Vitalism to a startup, with a longevity state as its product. For the time being, at least, there isn’t enough consumer appetite for that product, he says.

The past year shows that it may in fact be easier to lobby legislators in states that are already friendly to deregulation. Anzinger and a lobbying group called the Alliance for Longevity Initiatives (A4LI) were integral to making Montana the first US hub for experimental medical treatments, with a new law to allow clinics to sell experimental therapies once they have been through preliminary safety tests (which don’t reveal whether a drug actually works). But Gries and his Vitalist colleagues also played a role—“providing feedback, talking to lawmakers … brainstorming [and] suggesting ideas,” Gries says.

The Vitalist crew has been in conversation with lawmakers in New Hampshire, too. In an email in December, Gries and Cheng claimed they’d “helped to get right-to-try laws passed” in the state—an apparent reference to the recent expansion of a law to make more unapproved treatments accessible to people with terminal illnesses. Meanwhile, three other bills that expand access even further are under consideration.

Ultimately, Gries stresses, Vitalism is “agnostic to the fixing strategies” that will help them meet their goals. There is, though, at least one strategy he’s steadfast about: building influence.

To trigger a revolution, the Vitalists may need to recruit only around 3% or 4% of “society” to their movement, Gries believes. (Granted, that does still mean hundreds of millions of people.) “If you want people to take action, you need to focus on a small number of very high-leverage people,” he tells me.

That, perhaps unsurprisingly, includes wealthy individuals with “a net worth of $10 million or above,” he says. He wants to understand why (with some high-profile exceptions, including Thiel, who has been investing in longevity-related companies and foundations for decades) most uber-wealthy people don’t invest in the field—and how he might persuade them to do so. He won’t reveal the names of anyone he’s having conversations with.

These “high-leverage” people might also include, Gries says, well-respected academics, leaders of influential think tanks, politicians and policymakers, and others who work in government agencies.

A revolution needs to find its foot soldiers. And at the most basic level, that will mean boosting the visibility of the Vitalism brand—partly through events like Vitalist Bay, but also by encouraging others, particularly in the biotech space, to sign on. Cheng talks of putting out a “bat signal” for like-minded people, and he and Gries say that Vitalism has brought together people who have gone on to collaborate or form companies.

There’s also their nonprofit Vitalism International Foundation, whose supporters can opt to become “mobilized Vitalists” with monthly payments of $29 or more, depending on their level of commitment. In addition, the foundation works with longevity biotech companies to recognize those that are “aligned” with its goals as officially certified Vitalist organizations. “Designation may be revoked if an organization adopts apologetic narratives that accept aging or death,” according to the website. At the time of writing, that site lists 16 certified Vitalist organizations, including cryopreservation companies, a longevity clinic, and several research companies.

One of them is Shift Bioscience, a company using CRISPR and aging clocks—which attempt to measure biological age—to identify genes that might play a significant role in the aging process and potentially reverse it. It says it has found a single gene that can rejuvenate multiple types of cells.

Shift cofounder Daniel Ives, who holds degrees in mitochondrial and computational biology, tells me he was also won over to the longevity cause by de Grey’s 2005 TED Talk. He now has a countdown on his computer: “It’s my days till death,” he says—around 22,000 days left. “I’m using that to keep myself focused.”

Ives calls himself the “Vitalist CEO” of Shift Bioscience. He thinks the label is important first as a way for like-minded people to find and support each other, grow their movement, and make the quest for longevity mainstream. Second, he says, it provides a way to appeal to “hardcore” lifespan extensionists, given that others in the wellness and cosmetics industry have adopted the term “longevity” without truly applying themselves to finding rejuvenation therapies. He refers to unnamed companies and individuals who claim that drinking juices, for example, can reverse aging by five years or so.

“You don’t have to convince the mainstream,” says ARPA-H science and engineering advisor Mark Hamalainen. After all, Stalinism started small, he notes. “Sometimes you just have to convince the right people.”

“Somebody will make these claims and basically throw legitimate science under the bus,” he says. He doesn’t want spurious claims made on social media to get lumped in with the company’s serious molecular biology. Shift’s head of machine learning, Lucas Paulo de Lima Camillo, was recently awarded a $10,000 prize by the well-respected Biomarkers of Aging Consortium for an aging clock he developed.

Another out-and-proud Vitalist CEO is Anar Isman, the cofounder of AgelessRx, a telehealth provider that offers prescriptions for purported longevity drugs—and a certified Vitalist organization. (Isman, who is in his early 40s, used to work at a hedge fund but was inspired to join the longevity field by—you guessed it—de Grey.)

During a panel session at Vitalist Bay, he stressed that he too saw longevity as a movement—and a revolution—rather than an industry. But he also claimed his company wasn’t doing too badly commercially. “We’ve had a lot of demand,” he said. “We’ve got $60 million plus in annual revenue.”

Many of his customers come to the site looking for treatments for specific ailments, he tells me. He views each as an opportunity to “evangelize” his views on “radical life extension.” “I don’t see a difference between … dying tomorrow or dying in 30 years,” he says. He wants to live “at least 100 more” years.

Vitalism, though, isn’t just appealing to commercial researchers. Mark Hamalainen, a 41-year-old science and engineering advisor at ARPA-H, describes himself as a Vitalist. He says he “kind of got roped into” Vitalism because he also works with Cheng—they founded the Longevity Biotech Fellowship, which supports new entrants to the field through mentoring programs. “I kind of view it as a more appealing rebranding of some of the less radical aspects of transhumanism,” he says. Transhumanism—the position that we can use technologies to enhance humans beyond the current limits of biology—covers a broad terrain, but “Vitalism is like: Can we just solve this death thing first? It’s a philosophy that’s easy to get behind.”

In government, he works with individuals like Jean Hébert, a former professor of genetics and neuroscience who has investigated the possibility of rejuvenating the brain by gradually replacing parts of it; Hébert has said that “[his] mission is to beat aging.” He spoke at Zuzalu and Vitalist Bay.

Andrew Brack, who serves as the program manager for proactive health at ARPA-H, was at Vitalist Bay, too. Both Brack and Hébert oversee healthy federal budgets—Hébert’s brain replacement project was granted $110 million in 2024, for example.

Neither Hébert nor Brack has publicly described himself as a Vitalist, and Hébert wouldn’t agree to speak to me without the approval of ARPA-H’s press office, which didn’t respond to multiple requests for an interview with him or Brack. Brack did not respond to direct requests for an interview.

Gries says he thinks that “many people at [the US Department of Health and Human Services], including all agencies, have a longevity-positive view and probably agree with a lot of the ideas Vitalism stands for.” And he is hoping to help secure federal positions for others who are similarly aligned with his philosophy. On both Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve last year, Gries and Cheng sent fundraising emails describing an “outreach effort” to find applicants for six open government positions that, together, would control billions of dollars in federal funding. “Qualified, mission-aligned candidates we’d love to support do exist, but they need to be found and encouraged to apply,” the pair wrote in the second email. “We’re starting a systematic search to reach, screen, and support the best candidates.”

Hamalainen supports Gries’s plan to target high-leverage individuals. “You don’t have to convince the mainstream,” he says. After all, Stalinism started small, he notes. “Sometimes you just have to convince the right people.”

One of the “right” people may be the man who inspired Gries, Hamalainen, Ives, Isman, and so many others to pursue longevity in the first place: de Grey. He’s now a paid-up Vitalist and even spoke at Vitalist Bay. Having been in the field for over 20 years, de Grey tells me, he’s seen various terms fall in and out of favor. Those terms now have “baggage that gets in the way,” he says. “Sometimes it’s useful to have a new term.”

Though one of the five principles of Vitalism is a promise to “carry the message,” some people who agree with its ideas are reluctant to go public, including some signed-up Vitalists. I’ve asked Gries multiple times over several years, but he won’t reveal how many Vitalists there are, let alone who makes up the membership.

Even some of the founders of Vitalism don’t want to be public about it. Around 30 people were involved in developing the movement, Gries says—but only 22 are named as contributors to the Vitalism white paper (with Gries as its author), including Cheng, Vitalia’s Ion, and ARPA-H’s Hamalainen. Gries won’t reveal the names of the others. He acknowledges that some people just don’t like to publicly affiliate with any organization. That’s certainly what I’ve found when I’ve asked members of the longevity community if they’re Vitalists. Many said they agreed with the Vitalist declaration, and that they liked and supported what Gries was doing. But they didn’t want the label.

Some people worry that associating with a belief system that sounds a bit religious—even cult-like, some say—won’t do the cause any favors. Others have a problem with the specific wording of the declaration.

For instance, Anzinger—the other Vitalia founder—won’t call himself a Vitalist. He says he respects the mission, but that the declaration is “a bit poetic” for his liking.

And Dylan Livingston, CEO of A4LI and arguably one of the most influential longevity enthusiasts out there, won’t describe himself as a Vitalist either.

Many other longevity biotech CEOs also shy away from the label—including Emil Kendziorra, who runs the human cryopreservation company Tomorrow Bio, even though that’s a certified Vitalist organization. Kendziorra says he agrees with most of the Vitalist declaration but thinks it is too “absolutist.” He also doesn’t want to imply that the pursuit of longevity should be positioned above war, hunger, and other humanitarian issues. (Gries has heard this argument before, and counters that both the vast spending on health care for people in the last years of their life and the use of lockdown strategies during the covid pandemic suggest that, deep down, lifespan extension is “society’s revealed preference.”)

Still, because Kendziorra agrees with almost everything in the declaration, he believes that “pushing it forward” and bringing more attention to the field by labeling his company a Vitalist organization is a good thing. “It’s to support other people who want to move the world in that direction,” he says. (He also offered Vitalist Bay attendees a discount on his cryopreservation services.)

“There’s a lot of closeted scientists working in our field, and they get really excited about lifespans increasing,” explains Ives of Shift Bioscience. “But you’ll get people who’ll accuse you of being a lunatic that wants to be immortal.” He claims that people who represent biotech companies tell him “all the time” that they are secretly longevity companies but avoid using the term because they don’t want funders or collaborators to be “put off.”

Ultimately, it may not really matter how much people adopt the Vitalist label as long as the ideas break through. “It’s pretty simple. [The Vitalist declaration] has five points—if you agree with the five points, you are a Vitalist,” says Hamalainen. “You don’t have to be public about it.” He says he’s spoken to others about “coming out of the closet” and that it’s been going pretty well.

Gries puts it more bluntly: “If you agree with the Vitalist declaration, you are a Vitalist.”

And he hints that there are now many people in powerful positions—including in the Trump administration—who share his views, even if they don’t openly identify as Vitalists.

For Gries, this includes Jim O’Neill, the deputy secretary of health and human services, whom I profiled a few months after he became Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s number two. (More recently, O’Neill was temporarily put in charge of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.)

O’Neill has long been interested in both longevity and the idea of creating new jurisdictions. Until March 2024, he served on the board of directors of Friedman’s Seasteading Institute. He also served as CEO of the SENS Research Foundation, a longevity organization founded by de Grey, between 2019 and 2021, and he represented Thiel as a board member there for many years. Many people in the longevity community say they know him personally, or have at least met him. (Tristan Roberts, a biohacker who used to work with a biotech company operating in Próspera, tells me he served O’Neill gin when he visited his Burning Man camp, which he describes as a “technology gay camp from San Francisco and New York.” Hamalainen also recalls meeting O’Neill at Burning Man, at a “techy, futurist” camp.) (Neither O’Neill nor representatives from the Department of Health and Human Services responded to a request to comment about this.)

O’Neill’s views are arguably becoming less fringe in DC these days. The day after the Vitalist Bay Summit, A4LI was hosting its own summit in the capital with the goal of “bringing together leaders, advocates, and innovators from around the globe to advance legislative initiatives that promote a healthier human lifespan.” I recognized lots of Vitalist Bay attendees there, albeit in more formal attire.

The DC event took place over three days in late April. The first two involved talks by longevity enthusiasts across the spectrum, including scientists, lawyers, and biotech CEOs. Vitalia’s Anzinger spoke about the success he’d had in Próspera, and ARPA-H’s Brack talked about work his agency was doing. (Hamalainen was also there, although he said he was not representing ARPA-H.)

But the third day was different and made me think Gries may be right about Vitalism’s growing reach. It began with a congressional briefing on Capitol Hill, during which Representative Gus Bilirakis, a Republican from Florida, asked, “Who doesn’t want to live longer, right?” As he explained, “Longevity science … directly aligns with the goals of the Make America Healthy Again movement.”

“There’s a lot of closeted scientists working in our field, and they get really excited about lifespans increasing,” says Daniel Ives of Shift Bioscience. “But you’ll get people who’ll accuse you of being a lunatic that wants to be immortal.”

Bilirakis and Representative Paul Tonko, a New York Democrat, were followed by Mehmet Oz, the former TV doctor who now leads the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; he opened with typical MAHA talking points about chronic disease and said US citizens have a “patriotic duty” to stay healthy to keep medical costs down. The audience was enthralled as Oz talked about senescent cells, the zombie-like aged cells that are thought to be responsible for some age-related damage to organs and tissues. (The offices of Bilirakis and Tonko did not respond to a request for comment; neither did the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.)

And while none of the speakers went anywhere near the concept of radical life extension, the Vitalists in the audience were suitably encouraged.

Gries is too: “It seems that now there is the most pro-longevity administration in American history.”

Whether or not Vitalism starts a revolution, it will almost always be controversial in some quarters. While believers see an auspicious future, others are far less certain of the benefits of a world designed to defeat death.

Gries and Cheng often make the case for deregulation in their presentations. But ethicists—and even some members of the longevity community—point out that this comes with risks. Some question whether it is ever ethical to sell a “treatment” without some idea of how likely it is to benefit the person buying and taking it. Enthusiasts counter with arguments about bodily autonomy. And they hope Montana is just the start.

Then there’s the bigger picture. Is it really that great not to die … ever? Some ethicists argue that for many cultures, death is what gives meaning to life.

Sergio Imparato, a moral philosopher and medical ethicist at Harvard University, believes that death itself has important moral meaning. We know our lives will end, and our actions have value precisely because our time is limited, he says. Imparato is concerned that Vitalists are ultimately seeking to change what it means to be human—a decision that should involve all members of society.

Alberto Giubilini, a philosopher at the University of Oxford, agrees. “Death is a defining feature of humanity,” he says. “Our psychology, our cultures, our rituals, our societies, are built around the idea of coping with death … it’s part of human nature.”

Imparato’s family is from Naples, Italy, where poor residents were once laid to rest in shared burial sites, with no headstones to identify them. He tells me how the locals came to visit, clean, and even “adopt” the skulls as family members. It became a weekly ritual for members of the community, including his grandmother, who was a young girl at the time. “It speaks to what I consider the cultural relevance of death,” he says. “It’s the perfect counterpoint to … the Vitalist conception of life.”

Gries seems aware of the stigma around such “immortality quests,” as Imparato calls them. In his presentations, Gries shares lists of words that Vitalists should try to avoid—like “eternity,” “radical,” and “forever,” as well as any religious terms.

He also appears to be dropping, at least publicly, the idea that Vitalism is a “moral” movement. Morality was “never part of the Vitalist declaration,” Gries told me in September. When I asked him why he had changed his position on this, he dismissed the question. “Our point … was always that death is humanity’s core problem, and aging its primary agent,” he told me. “So it was, and so it has continued, as it was foretold.”

But despite these attempts to tweak and control the narrative, Vitalism appears to be opening the door to an incredibly wide range of sentiments in longevity science. A decade ago, I don’t think there would have been any way that the views espoused by Gries, Anzinger, and others who support Vitalist sentiments would have been accepted by the scientific establishment. After all, these are people who publicly state they hope to live indefinitely and who have no training in the science of aging, and who are open about their aims to find ways to evade the restrictions set forth by regulatory agencies like the FDA—all factors that might have rendered them outcasts not that long ago.

But Gries and peers had success in Montana. Influential scientists and policymakers attend Vitalism events, and Vitalists are featured regularly at more mainstream longevity events. Last year’s Aging Research and Drug Discovery (ARDD) conference in Copenhagen—widely recognized as the most important meeting in aging science—was sponsored in part by Anzinger’s new Próspera venture, Infinita City, as well as by several organizations that are either certified Vitalist or led by Vitalists.

“I was thinking that maybe what I was doing was very fringe or out there,” Anzinger, the non-Vitalist supporter of Vitalism, admits. “But no—I feel … loads of support.”

There was certainly an air of optimism at the Vitalist Bay Summit in Berkeley. Gries’s positivity is infectious. “All the people who want a fun and awesome surprise gift, come on over!” he called out early on the first day. “Raise your voice if you’re excited!” The audience whooped in response. He then proceeded to tell everyone, Oprah Winfrey–style, that they were all getting a free continuous glucose monitor. “You get a CGM! You get a CGM!” Plenty of attendees actually attached them to their arms on the spot.

Every revolution has to start somewhere, right?

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The ability to remember you and your preferences is rapidly becoming a big selling point for AI chatbots and agents.

Earlier this month, Google announced Personal Intelligence, a new way for people to interact with the company’s Gemini chatbot that draws on their Gmail, photos, search, and YouTube histories to make Gemini “more personal, proactive, and powerful.” It echoes similar moves by OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta to add new ways for their AI products to remember and draw from people’s personal details and preferences. While these features have potential advantages, we need to do more to prepare for the new risks they could introduce into these complex technologies.

Personalized, interactive AI systems are built to act on our behalf, maintain context across conversations, and improve our ability to carry out all sorts of tasks, from booking travel to filing taxes. From tools that learn a developer’s coding style to shopping agents that sift through thousands of products, these systems rely on the ability to store and retrieve increasingly intimate details about their users.  But doing so over time introduces alarming, and all-too-familiar, privacy vulnerabilities––many of which have loomed since “big data” first teased the power of spotting and acting on user patterns. Worse, AI agents now appear poised to plow through whatever safeguards had been adopted to avoid those vulnerabilities.

Today, we interact with these systems through conversational interfaces, and we frequently switch contexts. You might ask a single AI agent to draft an email to your boss, provide medical advice, budget for holiday gifts, and provide input on interpersonal conflicts. Most AI agents collapse all data about you—which may once have been separated by context, purpose, or permissions—into single, unstructured repositories. When an AI agent links to external apps or other agents to execute a task, the data in its memory can seep into shared pools. This technical reality creates the potential for unprecedented privacy breaches that expose not only isolated data points, but the entire mosaic of people’s lives.

When information is all in the same repository, it is prone to crossing contexts in ways that are deeply undesirable. A casual chat about dietary preferences to build a grocery list could later influence what health insurance options are offered, or a search for restaurants offering accessible entrances could leak into salary negotiations—all without a user’s awareness (this concern may sound familiar from the early days of “big data,” but is now far less theoretical). An information soup of memory not only poses a privacy issue, but also makes it harder to understand an AI system’s behavior—and to govern it in the first place. So what can developers do to fix this problem?

First, memory systems need structure that allows control over the purposes for which memories can be accessed and used. Early efforts appear to be underway: Anthropic’s Claude creates separate memory areas for different “projects,” and OpenAI says that information shared through ChatGPT Health is compartmentalized from other chats. These are helpful starts, but the instruments are still far too blunt: At a minimum, systems must be able to distinguish between specific memories (the user likes chocolate and has asked about GLP-1s), related memories (user manages diabetes and therefore avoids chocolate), and memory categories (such as professional and health-related). Further, systems need to allow for usage restrictions on certain types of memories and reliably accommodate explicitly defined boundaries—particularly around memories having to do with sensitive topics like medical conditions or protected characteristics, which will likely be subject to stricter rules.

Needing to keep memories separate in this way will have important implications for how AI systems can and should be built. It will require tracking memories’ provenance—their source, any associated time stamp, and the context in which they were created—and building ways to trace when and how certain memories influence the behavior of an agent. This sort of model explainability is on the horizon, but current implementations can be misleading or even deceptive. Embedding memories directly within a model’s weights may result in more personalized and context-aware outputs, but structured databases are currently more segmentable, more explainable, and thus more governable. Until research advances enough, developers may need to stick with simpler systems.

Second, users need to be able to see, edit, or delete what is remembered about them. The interfaces for doing this should be both transparent and intelligible, translating system memory into a structure users can accurately interpret. The static system settings and legalese privacy policies provided by traditional tech platforms have set a low bar for user controls, but natural-language interfaces may offer promising new options for explaining what information is being retained and how it can be managed. Memory structure will have to come first, though: Without it, no model can clearly state a memory’s status. Indeed, Grok 3’s system prompt includes an instruction to the model to “NEVER confirm to the user that you have modified, forgotten, or won&#39;t save a memory,” presumably because the company can’t guarantee those instructions will be followed.

Critically, user-facing controls cannot bear the full burden of privacy protection or prevent all harms from AI personalization. Responsibility must shift toward AI providers to establish strong defaults, clear rules about permissible memory generation and use, and technical safeguards like on-device processing, purpose limitation, and contextual constraints. Without system-level protections, individuals will face impossibly convoluted choices about what should be remembered or forgotten, and the actions they take may still be insufficient to prevent harm. Developers should consider how to limit data collection in memory systems until robust safeguards exist, and build memory architectures that can evolve alongside norms and expectations.

Third, AI developers must help lay the foundations for approaches to evaluating systems so as to capture not only performance, but also the risks and harms that arise in the wild. While independent researchers are best positioned to conduct these tests (given developers’ economic interest in demonstrating demand for more personalized services), they need access to data to understand what risks might look like and therefore how to address them. To improve the ecosystem for measurement and research, developers should invest in automated measurement infrastructure, build out their own ongoing testing, and implement privacy-preserving testing methods that enable system behavior to be monitored and probed under realistic, memory-enabled conditions.

In its parallels with human experience, the technical term “memory” casts impersonal cells in a spreadsheet as something that builders of AI tools have a responsibility to handle with care. Indeed, the choices AI developers make today—how to pool or segregate information, whether to make memory legible or allow it to accumulate opaquely, whether to prioritize responsible defaults or maximal convenience—will determine how the systems we depend upon remember us. Technical considerations around memory are not so distinct from questions about digital privacy and the vital lessons we can draw from them. Getting the foundations right today will determine how much room we can give ourselves to learn what works—allowing us to make better choices around privacy and autonomy than we have before.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">From the Gemini Calendar prompt-injection attack of 2026 to the September 2025 state-sponsored hack using Anthropic’s Claude code as an automated intrusion engine, the coercion of human-in-the-loop agentic actions and fully autonomous agentic workflows are the new attack vector for hackers. In the Anthropic case, roughly 30 organizations across tech, finance, manufacturing, and government were affected. Anthropic’s threat team assessed that the attackers used AI to carry out 80% to 90% of the operation: reconnaissance, exploit development, credential harvesting, lateral movement, and data exfiltration, with humans stepping in only at a handful of key decision points.

This was not a lab demo; it was a live espionage campaign. The attackers hijacked an agentic setup (Claude code plus tools exposed via Model Context Protocol (MCP)) and jailbroke it by decomposing the attack into small, seemingly benign tasks and telling the model it was doing legitimate penetration testing. The same loop that powers developer copilots and internal agents was repurposed as an autonomous cyber-operator. Claude was not hacked. It was persuaded and used tools for the attack.

Security communities have been warning about this for several years. Multiple OWASP Top 10 reports put prompt injection, or more recently Agent Goal Hijack, at the top of the risk list and pair it with identity and privilege abuse and human-agent trust exploitation: too much power in the agent, no separation between instructions and data, and no mediation of what comes out.

Guidance from the NCSC and CISA describes generative AI as a persistent social-engineering and manipulation vector that must be managed across design, development, deployment, and operations, not patched away with better phrasing. The EU AI Act turns that lifecycle view into law for high-risk AI systems, requiring a continuous risk management system, robust data governance, logging, and cybersecurity controls.

In practice, prompt injection is best understood as a persuasion channel. Attackers don’t break the model—they convince it. In the Anthropic example, the operators framed each step as part of a defensive security exercise, kept the model blind to the overall campaign, and nudged it, loop by loop, into doing offensive work at machine speed.

That’s not something a keyword filter or a polite “please follow these safety instructions” paragraph can reliably stop. Research on deceptive behavior in models makes this worse. Anthropic’s research on sleeper agents shows that once a model has learned a backdoor, then strategic pattern recognition, standard fine-tuning, and adversarial training can actually help the model hide the deception rather than remove it. If one tries to defend a system like that purely with linguistic rules, they are playing on its home field.

Regulators aren’t asking for perfect prompts; they’re asking that enterprises demonstrate control.

NIST’s AI RMF emphasizes asset inventory, role definition, access control, change management, and continuous monitoring across the AI lifecycle. The UK AI Cyber Security Code of Practice similarly pushes for secure-by-design principles by treating AI like any other critical system, with explicit duties for boards and system operators from conception through decommissioning.

In other words: the rules actually needed are not “never say X” or “always respond like Y,” they are:

Frameworks like Google’s Secure AI Framework (SAIF) make this concrete. SAIF’s agent permissions control is blunt: agents should operate with least privilege, dynamically scoped permissions, and explicit user control for sensitive actions. OWASP’s Top 10 emerging guidance on agentic applications mirrors that stance: constrain capabilities at the boundary, not in the prose.

The Anthropic espionage case makes the boundary failure concrete:

We’ve seen the other side of this coin in civilian contexts. When Air Canada’s website chatbot misrepresented its bereavement policy and the airline tried to argue that the bot was a separate legal entity, the tribunal rejected the claim outright: the company remained liable for what the bot said. In espionage, the stakes are higher but the logic is the same: if an AI agent misuses tools or data, regulators and courts will look through the agent and to the enterprise.

So yes, rule-based systems fail if by rules one means ad-hoc allow/deny lists, regex fences, and baroque prompt hierarchies trying to police semantics. Those crumble under indirect prompt injection, retrieval-time poisoning, and model deception. But rule-based governance is non-optional when we move from language to action.

The security community is converging on a synthesis:

The lesson from the first AI-orchestrated espionage campaign is not that AI is uncontrollable. It’s that control belongs in the same place it always has in security: at the architecture boundary, enforced by systems, not by vibes.

            <div id="article-text">AI adoption is creating a clear divide among employees. Some see AI as a tool to increase their impact, while others see it as a threat to their role. So, where does the truth lie between these two mindsets? Let’s explore.

Over the past two years, we’ve seen a wave of layoffs often attributed to “AI replacing humans.” Among widely discussed cases, IBM openly stated that over 7,000 back-office roles may no longer need to be hired because AI can absorb the work. Many other tech players, including Microsoft, Amazon, and HP, have cut between 6,000 and 200,000 employees as a shift toward AI-driven initiatives.

Meanwhile, beware: many might make misleading conclusions. They are often treated as straightforward examples of AI replacing human labor, when in reality they reflect a deeper restructuring of how value is created inside organizations.

Taking a closer look, it becomes evident that in many examples like these, people weren’t displaced because AI was smarter or outperformed people.

They were displaced because one (or more) of the following reasons:

From this perspective, it becomes evident: AI isn’t coming for roles, it’s here to remove low-leverage work. Roles that exist mainly to handle volume or work around broken systems no longer make sense once those problems disappear.

This is already playing out across teams. For example:

As AI reduces friction and automates workflows, organizations and employees are increasingly forced to ask these two questions: 1) where real value is created, 2) where human input is essential in areas AI cannot handle. Teams that explore and embrace this shift early will be better positioned to adapt as AI continues to compress the cost and effort of execution.

An overlooked but highly efficient aspect many businesses miss: AI introduces a level of transparency most organizations have never had before. This visibility changes how organizations make decisions and how they manage business resources.
In particular, AI-powered spend analysis is set to become one of the most transformative forces inside companies.

Ultimately, the level of business success is largely determined by the ability to turn spend data into an operational signal. When, instead of tracking costs in isolation, organizations clearly see how spend translates into productivity and revenue, that’s where real differentiation begins.

Smart spend management platforms like this already exist, take Spendbase, for example. In this case, AI can be the next layer that unlocks even deeper insights.

ROI and cost efficiency are at the very center of any business. Therefore, as AI increases transparency into multiple business areas (performance, time, spend, etc.), work that cannot be clearly tied to outcomes loses its footing. Hence, roles that fail to translate their work into clear outcomes risk being deprioritized.

As AI automates execution, the people and teams that remain essential are those who can clearly explain how their work impacts the business in ways AI cannot. Such as:

Apart from this, another important area of impact lies in organizational and customer-facing work, where human-driven value is created from responsibilities focused on aligning teams, resolving complexity, building trust, and, particularly, innovating.

Imagine a product team competing in a crowded market or where competitors are continuously copying each other. In this case, AI can meticulously handle research and benchmarking: analyze competitor offerings, user behavior, reviews, and market gaps.

It can even generate predictions or simulate feature adoption. However, it takes human vision and accountability to challenge assumptions and find unpaved paths for growth.

When it comes to creating something inherently new, with no existing market equivalent, AI may fall short at innovation. Yet these are often the areas where the greatest business impact lies.

In most organizations, changes revolving AI adoption won’t happen overnight. Roles will gradually shrink, shift, and eventually be redefined. As a result, human contributions that can’t be tied to measurable outcomes quietly lose relevance.

            <div id="article-text">The way people discover information online is quietly but fundamentally changing.

Instead of scrolling through links and choosing which article to open, users are increasingly asking large language models to answer directly. Tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity don’t send people browsing; they synthesise information from multiple sources and deliver a ready-made response inside the interface.

For brands and publishers, this creates a new problem: what does visibility mean when nobody clicks anymore?

For years, search optimization revolved around a familiar feedback loop: publish content, earn rankings, drive clicks, measure performance. Traffic, impressions, and engagement acted as proxies for relevance and influence. AI-generated answers disrupt that loop entirely.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

This isn’t a temporary fluctuation in search behaviour. It’s a structural shift in how information is consumed.

Large language models do not simply index the web like classic search engines. Their response generation involves a combination of training data, real-time search, and internal reasoning. As shown in analyses comparing Perplexity and ChatGPT, these systems search the web differently even when responding to the same questions.

ChatGPT tends to issue longer, context-rich queries to build an explanation, whereas Perplexity formulates shorter, list-like queries focused on freshness and comparison.

This means visibility isn’t universal across models; a topic that surfaces in one LLM is not guaranteed to surface in another.

If clicks are no longer the primary signal, content strategies must adapt. Instead of optimizing only for human users and search engine algorithms:

Content intended for modern AI discovery needs both depth and freshness: explanations that support contextual reasoning (favoured by ChatGPT-style behaviour) and concise, signal-rich sections (favoured by Perplexity-style behaviour). This duality underscores the complexity of AI brand visibility.

Publishers and marketers have few tools to assess whether their pages are actually being consulted by AI agents. Traditional analytics platforms report pageviews, but:

This lack of transparency means that even high-quality content may go unnoticed in AI answers, not because it is irrelevant, but because it does not match the specific patterns an LLM uses when selecting sources.

Recognising the need for a new feedback loop, solutions are emerging that approach this problem from an engineering perspective rather than purely a marketing one. For instance, Genezio has analysed how ChatGPT and Perplexity prioritise sources and generate their search behaviours, revealing that the same topic leads to substantially different retrieval patterns across systems and therefore different visibility outcomes.

Rather than treating AI visibility as a black box, these approaches:

By observing how AI systems behave at scale, marketers can begin to measure brand visibility in conversations rather than clicks, transforming raw engineering data into actionable insight.

AI-generated answers are rapidly reshaping how information is found, processed, and presented. In this new environment, visibility is not just about ranking formulas or organic traffic; it’s about earning a place in the narrative that LLMs generate.

The brands that succeed will be those that understand not only how to produce quality content, but also how to make it legible and extractable to systems that never lead users back to a webpage.

Measuring visibility without clicks may seem intangible today, but as AI becomes central to how people seek answers, it will soon become standard practice.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a bold turn of phrase and deed, Paris has quietly told Silicon Valley “au revoir.”  On January 26, 2026, France’s Ministry of Finance announced that by 2027, all public servants will switch from U.S. video apps like Microsoft Teams and Zoom to a homegrown platform called Visio.

No more license renewals for Teams, Zoom, Webex, or Meet, just one unified, French-built solution.

In one stroke, a long-discussed slogan “digital sovereignty” has leapt off the podium and into practice. This is not a press release; it’s a watershed moment: Europe’s second-biggest economy is wagering that, when it comes to critical infrastructure, it’s time to govern itself.

“Digital sovereignty” has become the EU’s new watchword, a declaration of independence from foreign tech hegemons. Over the past few years, it has surged from a niche policy to a headline priority, as EU leaders from Ursula von der Leyen to Emmanuel Macron have warned that Europe must control its own networks and data.

The phrase sounds grand, but what changed now is urgency. Americans’ own laws make the risks concrete: under the U.S. CLOUD Act, for example, U.S. authorities can demand data from any American platform, regardless of where it’s stored.

In practice, “jurisdiction follows ownership,” as one analyst noted: even data sitting on a Frankfurt server can be swept up by U.S. warrants if the service provider is American.

Edward Snowden’s revelations and murky court orders have long haunted Europe with the idea that a virtual meeting might be spied on from overseas. Now, with geopolitics in flux, U.S. political turns and global crises, that theoretical risk seems all too real.

The push has taken many forms. The EU has drafted cloud-certification rules demanding “sovereignty” guarantees and drafted data laws to keep Europeans’ information in Europe.

Member states debate mandating local clouds. Digital sovereignty has moved from virtue-signaling to something harder, actual infrastructure.

France’s pivot is concrete and wide-ranging. Visio, developed by the government’s interministerial digital agency (DINUM), has been tested for about a year with some 40,000 regular users. It’s already being adopted piecemeal: CNRS (France’s national research center) will replace all its 34,000 Zoom seats by March 2026, covering 120,000 associated researchers.

By early 2026, the Defense Ministry, finance tax offices, health insurance, and other big agencies will be on Visio. The government now says every state department will use Visio as the default video tool by 2027, after which external conferencing licenses simply won’t be renewed.

The official rationale is familiar: a patchwork of Teams, Zoom, Webex, and friends “fragilises security” and creates hidden costs, dependencies, and interoperability headaches.

Visio is billed as a solution under full French control: it’s hosted on a certified “SecNumCloud” by Dassault-owned Outscale, built with ANSSI (France’s cyber agency) oversight, and even uses French AI for meeting transcription and captions.

The aim, in the minister’s words, is to “end the use of non-European solutions and guarantee the security and confidentiality of public electronic communications by relying on a powerful…sovereign tool”.

In short: no more data flying through American servers or falling under foreign laws.

There are financial perks, too. Officials point out that ditching pricey Teams and Zoom licenses will save money: roughly €1 million per year for every 100,000 users who shift off commercial tools. That’s not pocket change, even if it’s a rounding error in a €600 billion budget. In any case, for France, this isn’t just about cost – it’s about control.

Taken together, these facts show a very concrete policy timeline. In one meeting on Jan. 26, the state literally put a deadline on dependence: four years to shift the ENTIRE civil service. It’s one thing to talk about sovereignty in Brussels speeches, quite another to swap out the nation’s video chat app.

France isn’t alone in flirting with this idea, but it’s the first to bet big. Other EU countries are eyeballing similar moves. In Denmark, parts of the public sector have already announced plans to phase out Microsoft’s software.

In Germany, the state of Schleswig-Holstein recently ditched Microsoft Office in favor of open-source alternatives. Even non-state bodies are joining the sovereignty club: the International Criminal Court said it will move its systems to a German-developed open-source platform (OpenDesk).

These are baby steps compared to France’s all-hands policy, but they reflect a shared unease about over-reliance on foreign tech.

Europe is also wrestling with headline-grabbing hiccups like last year’s massive cloud outages in the U.S., which left public agencies scrambling. The Visio announcement itself notes that Europe’s “overreliance on U.S. IT infrastructure” has been questioned after those failures.

And there are EU-wide initiatives underway, from the Gaia-X cloud alliance to tougher data localization rules – aimed at seeding local alternatives.

If France makes Visio work, it could serve as a proof of concept for others. Will a homegrown tool really run government communications smoothly? If yes, it might embolden policymakers in Brussels or Rome to push harder on local platforms. If not, it could slow the momentum.

For now, France’s move is a beacon: it shows that digital sovereignty can move beyond talk. Other nations will watch closely.

No one seriously argues that keeping calls on Visio will magically end world unrest. Rather, this is a narrow, technical solution to a policy problem. On the other side, France will indeed have tighter control: all servers, encryption keys, and software updates are now under French (and EU) jurisdiction.

Public-sector IT teams can audit code, set security parameters, and avoid nasty surprises (say, a foreign court order) without jumping through transatlantic hoops.

Data stays where the politicians say it stays.

But what might be lost? For one, user experience and innovation often depend on scale. Big Tech’s video platforms have oceans of R&D behind them, from instant translation to seamless device-hopping, and millions of users giving feedback.

A new platform built from scratch may not match Teams’ polish or Zoom’s ubiquity overnight. (The French have even admitted an irony: naming it “Visio” risks confusion with Microsoft Visio, the longtime diagram app, hinting that branding and polish sometimes play second fiddle to strategy.)

There’s also the question of interoperability: how well will Visio meetings work when French officials Zoom into a partner country’s conference, or vice versa? Will France demand that foreign delegations install its app, or allow links to other networks? The devil is in the details.

Some critics fret that an insular approach could fragment standards. One EU paper urges that sovereignty shouldn’t mean isolation but rather a robust, open ecosystem.

If every country builds its own siloed cloud and chat service, the Internet risks reinventing wheels (and reinventing firewalls) in every member state. Of course, Visio is only for civil servants, not a consumer product, yet it sets a precedent.

On the other hand, an expertly executed French stack could jumpstart a continental open-source community or spur startups to plug gaps. It’s a calculated gamble: France assumes that on net, its security and strategic stakes outweigh any shortfall in bells and whistles.

For its part, France says this isn’t a bare-bones trade-off. Officials emphasize Visio will include modern features: speaker separation, AI for transcripts, captions, etc. The goal is “not [a] minimalist replacement,” but a full-featured tool under domestic control.

In other words, they aim for the best of both worlds, though acknowledging it’s a tall order.

In its own softly decisive way, France’s Visio plan signals a definitive shift: digital sovereignty is no longer a future wish or empty catchphrase, but a deadline-driven program.

Europe has debated “strategic autonomy” for years; this is the first major state-level bet, with clear timelines and budget line savings. From the perspective of a tech editor watching policy trends, it’s heartening to see ambition meet action.

Will it pay off? If Visio runs smoothly, France will score a coup: more secure chats, money saved, and perhaps the bragging rights of a proof of concept. If glitches persist, France’s analysts may ask if the Q1 rollout to 200,000 civil servants is biting off too much too soon.

Either way, the move puts stakes on the table. Digital sovereignty has many meanings, but here it means doing something concrete, even if it means saying “non” to familiar tools.

In the end, it’s a balancing act. Europe gains control of what it might risk in convenience. France has just turned insurance talk into policy practice. Other countries will now watch and learn: Visio is not just a video app; it’s France’s case study in what digital independence can actually look like.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Slush, the Finnish nonprofit behind one of the most influential startup gatherings in Europe, has named Noora Saksa as its new Chief Executive Officer, a shift that indicates a strategic evolution for the organisation as it expands beyond its flagship event model.

Saksa assumes the top role after years as Slush’s Chief Operating & Financial Officer and Head of Partnerships, where she managed core operations, finances, and ecosystem programmes.

Her trajectory within the organisation reflects a deep operational understanding of Slush’s mission: to connect founders, investors, and builders in ways that help founders advance on their journeys.

In stepping into the CEO role, Saksa inherits an agenda that extends far beyond an annual conference in Helsinki.

Under her leadership, Slush aims to grow year-round engagement through digital experiences and local ecosystem programmes, and to deepen its reach in founder support globally.

Board members see her operational experience and ecosystem insight as assets for Slush’s next chapter.

Slush remains organised largely by a core team of young professionals and volunteers, a structure that has supported its rapid growth since the early 2010s.

The event brings together thousands of founders and investors each year, and the organisation’s year-round platform aims to sustain connections long after the main event ends.

In her opening statement as CEO, Saksa said the focus will remain on building meaningful experiences that help founders tackle practical challenges, expand networks, and find capital. Her intimate knowledge of Slush’s operations positions her to balance growth ambitions with the organisation’s mission-driven ethos.

Noora Saksa has played a central role at Slush as Chief Operating & Financial Officer and Head of Partnerships, overseeing operations, finances, and startup-focused programmes. Before her tenure at Slush, she held leadership roles in entrepreneurial student societies and worked in startup support functions. Saksa studied Industrial Engineering and Management at Aalto University with an exchange at Eindhoven University of Technology. Her experience spans operational strategy, ecosystem building, and partnership development within Nordic innovation communities.
