            <h2>To reuse or not reuse—the eternal debate of New Glenn's second stage reignites</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/to-reuse-or-not-reuse-the-eternal-debate-of-new-glenns-second-stage-reignites/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Engineers at Blue Origin have been grappling with a seemingly eternal debate that involves the New Glenn rocket and the economics of flying it.

The debate goes back at least 15 years, to the early discussions around the design of the heavy lift rocket. The first stage, of course, would be fully reusable. But what about the upper stage of New Glenn, powered by two large BE-3U engines?

Around the same time, in the early 2010s, SpaceX was also trading the economics of reusing the second stage of its Falcon 9 rocket. Eventually SpaceX founder Elon Musk abandoned his goal of a fully reusable Falcon 9, choosing instead to recover payload fairings and push down manufacturing costs of the upper stage as much as possible. This strategy worked, as SpaceX has lowered its internal launch costs of a Falcon 9, even with a new second stage, to about $15 million. The company is now focused on making the larger Starship rocket fully reusable.

New Glenn is quite a bit larger than the Falcon 9 vehicle, 98 meters in height compared to 70 meters, and with a 7-meter diameter compared to the Falcon 9’s 3.7 meters; but it is also smaller than Starship. Accordingly Blue Origin has struggled with whether to reuse the New Glenn upper stage or to seek to ruthlessly cut its manufacturing costs.

Over the years, this internal debate has waxed and waned.

A little more than five years ago, Blue Origin kicked off a project to develop a reusable stainless-steel upper stage known as “Project Jarvis.” This initiative was later abandoned. In the run-up to the first launch of New Glenn in early 2025, both the company’s founder, Jeff Bezos, and CEO, Dave Limp, told Ars in an interview that they were continuing to trade the options on New Glenn’s upper stage, known as GS2.

However, a new job posting suggests the debate may be swinging back toward reusing GS2. The job, for a director of “Reusable Upper Stage Development,” was posted Thursday by the company.

“As the Director of Program Management for the New Glenn Upper Stage and Payload Accommodations (GS2PA), you will work with the Vice President of New Glenn GS2PA and directly support the execution of a lean engineering initiative to incrementally develop a reusable upper stage,” the job description states. The salary range goes up to $284,430.30.

New Glenn is an exceptional rocket, flying expertly on its debut in January 2025, and then shocking the aerospace world (in a good way) by making a stunning first stage landing at sea on just its second flight in November 2025.

The first generation of the rocket is overengineered and very expensive. Although Ars does not have access to Blue Origin’s internal costs, sources have reliably indicated that it costs in excess of $100 million to manufacture a first stage and more than $50 million to build an upper stage.

The first stage cost can be amortized over multiple launches, and that’s precisely what Blue Origin plans to do with the vehicle’s third launch, which will reuse the first stage that landed in November. However, flying super-expensive upper stages is no way to build a sustainable launch business.

Right now, Blue Origin has the capacity to build a dozen second stages a year, and it is bringing a new facility online to manufacture more. Presumably, it will be able to shave some costs with rate manufacturing and a simpler second stage design. But this will have limits. The problem gets even worse with the planned upgrade to New Glenn, the 9×4 version of the rocket that will use four BE-3U engines. Such an upper stage probably will cost on the order of $100 million to manufacture.

Hence the pressure on Blue Origin to find a pathway to reuse. The challenge is that reusing the upper stages of rockets is still something of an unknown. SpaceX is still experimenting with thermal protection for its Starship vehicle’s return from orbital velocities, and there will be a performance hit for propellant and landing gear mass. So the new director of upper stage development has their work cut out for them.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/02/driven-the-2026-lamborghini-temerario-raises-the-bar-for-supercars/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">While mainstream vehicles usually get comprehensive updates every few years, low-volume exotics tend evolve more gradually. Supercar platforms often remain unchanged for a decade or more, with manufacturers instead focusing on what can be tuned, massaged, added, or subtracted to keep their lineups fresh. Every once in a while, though, a performance car debuts that truly earns the label “all-new,” and the Lamborghini Temerario is one of them.

As the replacement for the Huracán, Lamborghini’s bestselling sports car to date, the Temerario has big shoes to fill. At first glance, it might seem like a more subdued affair than its predecessor, but the Huracán debuted in a similar fashion before wilder iterations like the STO and Sterrato were introduced to the lineup.

During a technical briefing late last year, Lamborghini sales chief Frederick Foschini noted that the Temerario’s streamlined look is intentional. The team sought to increase downforce by more than 100 percent compared with the Huracán Evo through the car’s core design, rather than relying on big wings, splitters, and other racy aerodynamic bits. Designers were also tasked with creating an all-new car that was distinctive yet instantly recognizable as a Lamborghini. Judging by the number of heads this car turned during my time with it, I’d say the company was successful.

It’s not obvious from a cursory look at the exterior, but the Temerario is longer, wider, and taller than the car it replaces. Underpinned by a new all-aluminum spaceframe that’s more than 20 percent stiffer than the Huracán’s, the Temerari’s dimensional changes become immediately evident when you settle in behind the wheel, as head and legroom are noticeably improved over the outgoing car. I’m 6 feet, 3 inches (1.9 m), and at a rained-out track session at Sonoma Raceway back in November, I was able to position my seat however I wanted with headroom to spare, even with a helmet on.

The Temerario is also a big step forward ergonomically, as Lamborghini seems to be taking a more pragmatic approach to the control layout, which, like the Revuelto, sees the majority of often-used features accessed on the steering wheel. The tightly packed array of buttons and knobs looks overwhelming at first, but once you’re used to it, having everything directly in front of you—and controlled by physical buttons rather than capacitive surfaces—means your attention can stay on the road.

These are definitely welcome improvements, but the star of the show, and arguably the most controversial element of the Temerario, is its all-new powertrain. While the Huracán was motivated by a lovely naturally aspirated V10, the Temerario gets its propulsion from a 4.0 L twin-turbocharged DOHC dry-sump V8 that revs to a searing 10,000 rpm. An axial-flux electric motor is sandwiched between the flywheel and the eight-speed dual clutch gearbox. Combined with two additional electric motors that power the front wheels, the total system output is a healthy 907 hp (676 kW) and 538 lb-ft (730 Nm) of torque.

A 3.8 kWh lithium-ion battery mounted in the central tunnel of the spaceframe powers the electric motors and provides about six miles (10 km) of all-electric range. Though it can be recharged in about 30 minutes on a Level 2 charger, the hybrid system is designed to capture energy from the internal combustion engine and regenerative braking, so owners won’t need to plug in very often, if ever.

The sophisticated setup adds some heft: Lamborghini cites a dry weight of 3,726 lbs (1,690 kg), which means the Temerario weighs about 600 lbs (272 kg) more than the Huracán Evo. Additional mass is never a welcome development for a sports car, but to the automaker’s credit, Lamborghini has done a truly commendable job of hiding it.

Although I had originally planned to drive the Temerario exclusively on track at Sonoma, heavy rain forced us to scrap that idea after a slippery autocross session and a few harrowing laps around the course. To make up for the false start, Lamborghini graciously provided me with a Blu Marinus example for a few days at my home in Los Angeles. While the dry weather seat time reinforced the notion that you really do need to get this thing on a racetrack to see what it’s capable of, I was pleased to find it’s not a one-trick pony.

As with the Revuelto, the Temerario defaults to Citta (Italian for “city”), its all-electric drive mode, each time it’s started. This makes pressing the jet-fighter-style start/stop button less exciting than it was in the Huracán, but it gives the Temerario an element of stealth that its predecessor never had.

There are 13 drive modes, but only four main ones (Citta, Strada, Sport, and Corsa), which can be augmented with additional settings selected via the EV knob on the upper right-hand side of the steering wheel. The latter offers Recharge and Hybrid settings in all four main modes, while a third Performance setting is available only in Sport and Corsa. Each of these EV-related settings alters how the hybrid system behaves and how the battery’s state of charge is managed. The Performance setting is the only way to get the full 907 hp out of the powertrain.

The Temerario can reach highway speeds solely with electricity, but it’s not a particularly exciting way to get around. Acceleration is best described as leisurely, and the front motors’ torque output can struggle to contend with even a moderately steep hill, which often triggers the internal combustion engine to spring to life. But the engine has its own required warm-up process, so situations like this sometimes result in less-than-graceful powertrain handoffs.

Once all the systems are working together, though, the Temerario proves to be a surprisingly competent tourer, thanks to improved ergonomics and a firm but forgiving adaptive suspension that, in its softer setting, absorbs bumps on the highway instead of bouncing over them. But as impressive as the Temerario is at handling everyday driving tasks, everything starts to feel like a mere lead-up to the main event once you’ve unleashed it on a fast stretch of canyon road. Given room to stretch its legs, the V8 emits a superbike-like snarl as the revs climb, and the sheer thrust of the powertrain makes chasing its 10,000 rpm redline feel like a test of bravery, even in lower gears.

The way this car piles on speed is stunning on its own, but it’s the accessibility—and how confidently it can maintain a pace—that truly sets it apart from the Huracán. It feels every bit as nimble as the Huracan, delivering relentless grip even on standard Bridgestone Potenza Sport summer tires, while the brakes—which now use ten-piston calipers instead of the Huracán’s eight-piston setup—offer strong, repeatable stopping power at top speeds.

I did find myself occasionally wishing for more aero stability during these moments, though. Fortunately, for any would-be Temerario owners who plan to track their cars regularly, Lamborghini also offers the Alleggerita package. This add-on increases downforce by 67 percent versus the standard Temerario while swapping the Bridgestone Potenza Sport tires out for track-ready Bridgestone Potenza Race rubber. The package also includes a raft of carbon fiber components for modest weight savings over the standard car.

All this doesn’t come cheap, though. Temerario’s base price of $389,554 ($486,721 as-tested) represents a six-figure jump over the last Huracán, and you can tack on another 45 grand if you opt for the Alleggerita package in its most basic form.

That’s a tall ask, especially when cars like the Corvette ZR1 offer similarly incredible performance for substantially less coin. But something tells me that Lamborghini won’t have any problems moving its latest “entry level” model. Then again, have you seen the price of bitcoin lately?</div>

            <h2>New critique debunks claim that trees can sense a solar eclipse</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/new-critique-debunks-claim-that-trees-can-sense-a-solar-eclipse/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last year, a team of scientists presented evidence that spruce trees in Italy’s Dolomite mountains synchronized their bioelectrical activity in anticipation of a partial solar eclipse—a potentially exciting new insight into the complexities of plant communication. The findings naturally generated media interest and even inspired a documentary. But the claims drew sharp criticism from other researchers in the field, with some questioning whether the paper should even have been published. Those initial misgivings are outlined in more detail in a new critique published in the journal Trends in Plant Science.

For the original paper, Alessandro Chiolerio, a physicist at the Italian Institute of Technology, collaborated with plant ecologist Monica Gagliano of Southern Cross University and several others conducting field work in the Costa Bocche forest in the Dolomites. They essentially created an EKG for trees, attaching electrodes to three spruce trees (ranging in age from 20 to 70 years) and five tree stumps in the forest.

Those sensors recorded a marked increase in bioelectrical activity during a partial solar eclipse on October 22, 2022. The activity peaked mid-eclipse and faded away in its aftermath. Chiolerio et al. interpreted this spike in activity as a coordinated response among the trees to the darkened conditions brought on by the eclipse. And older trees’ electrical activity spiked earlier and more strongly than the younger trees, which Chiolerio et al. felt was suggestive of trees developing response mechanisms—a kind of memory captured in associated gravitational effects. Older trees might even transmit this knowledge to younger trees, the authors suggested, based on the detection of bioelectrical waves traveling between the trees.

Soon, other plant scientists weighed in, expressing strong skepticism and citing the study’s small sample size and large number of variables, among other concerns. Justine Karst, a forest ecologist at the University of Alberta in Canada, unfavorably compared Chiolerio et al.’s findings to a 2019 study claiming evidence for the controversial “wood-wide web” concept, in which trees communicate and share resources via underground networks of mycorrhizal fungi. Karst co-authored a 2023 study demonstrating insufficient evidence for the wood-wide-web.

Ariel Novoplansky, an evolutionary ecologist at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel, was among those who objected to the study’s publication—so much so that he co-authored the new critique with his Ben-Gurion colleague Hezi Yizhaq. He thinks it’s far more likely that the spikes in bioelectrical activity were due to temperature shifts or lightning strikes.

“My serious doubts had arisen from the very basic premise regarding the adaptive rationale the entire study hinged upon—namely, that those trees would be functionally affected by such a minor ‘passing cloud’ effects of such a (very) partial eclipse [with] a mere 10.5 percent reduction in sunlight for two hours,” Novoplansky told Ars. “I then thought about the possibility that thunderstorms might be involved in the heightened ‘anticipatory’ electrical activity of the trees, and it rolled from there.”

The forest trees frequently experience far greater fluctuations in cloud cover, and hence light quality and quantity, than occurred during the partial eclipse, according to Novoplansky. He also objected to the suggestion of older trees sharing prior eclipse “knowledge” with younger trees, pointing out that each solar eclipse follows a unique path. So even if older trees “remembered” an earlier eclipse, it would not translate into being able to anticipate future ones. And any gravitational changes associated with a partial eclipse would be minor, on par with a new moon. Thus, for Novoplansky, the 2025 paper “represents the encroachment of pseudoscience into the heart of biological research.”

“This field of plant behavior/communication is rampant with poorly designed ‘studies’ that are then twisted into a narrative that promotes personal worldviews and/or enhances personal celebrity,” said James Cahill, a plant ecologist at the University of Alberta in Calgary, Canada, who voiced objections when the original paper was published and is cited in Novoplansky’s acknowledgements. “The textbook example of this is the [Suzanne] Simard ‘mother tree’ debacle. Ariel is trying to get the science back on track, as are many of us.”

(Cahill recently co-authored a paper in Trends in Ecology and Evolution on the issue of cognition in plants, including commentary on “how we might stop fighting and do actual science.”)

“He puts forward logical alternative hypotheses,” said Cahill of Novoplansky’s critique. “The original work should have tested among a number of different hypotheses rather than focusing on a single interpretation. This is in part what makes it pseudoscience and promoting a worldview.”

Granted, “[p]lants have extensive and well established mechanisms of communication, with that of volatiles being the most well studied and understood,” he added. “There is also growing recognition that root exudates play a role in plant-plant interactions, though this is only now being deeply investigated. Nothing else, communication through mychorriza, has withstood independent investigation.”

Chiolerio and Gagliano stand by their research, saying they have always acknowledged the preliminary nature of their results. “We measured [weather-related elements like] temperature, relative humidity, rainfall and daily solar radiation,” Chiolerio told Ars. “None of them shows strong correlation with the transients of the electrome during the eclipse. We did not measure environmental electric fields, though; therefore, I cannot exclude effects induced by nearby lightnings. We did not have gravitational probes, did not check neutrinos, cosmic rays, magnetic fields, etc.”

“I’m not going to debate an unpublished critique in the media, but I can clarify our position,” Gagliano told Ars. “Our [2025] paper reports an empirical electrophysiological/synchrony pattern in the eclipse window, including changes beginning prior to maximum occultation, and we discussed candidate cues explicitly as hypotheses rather than demonstrated causes. Describing weather/lightning as ‘more parsimonious’ is not evidence of cause. Regional lightning strike counts and other proxies can motivate a competing hypothesis, but they do not establish causal attribution at the recording site without site-resolved, time-aligned field measurements. Without those measurements, the lightning/weather account remains a hypothesis among other possibilities rather than a supported or default explanation for the signals we recorded.”

“We acknowledged the limited sample size and described the work as an initial field report; follow-up work is ongoing and will be communicated through peer-reviewed channels,” Gagliano added. As for the suggestion of pseudoscience, “I won’t engage with labels; scientific disagreements should be resolved with transparent methods, data, and discriminating tests.”

“It seems that the public appeal is something particularly painful for the colleagues who published their opinion on Trends in Plant Science,” Chiolerio said. “We did not care about public appeal, we wanted to share as much as possible the results of years of hard work that led to interesting data.”

            <h2>Stellantis swallows $26 billion costs as it rethinks its EV strategy</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/02/stellantis-swallows-26-billion-costs-as-it-rethinks-its-ev-strategy/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The automotive industry’s big bet on a rapid adoption of electric vehicles—at least here in the United States—continues to unwind. Today, Stellantis, which owns brands like Jeep and Dodge, as well as Fiat, Peugeot, and others, announced that it has “reset” its business to adapt to reality, which comes with a rather painful $26.2 billion (22.2 billion euro) write-down.

It wasn’t that long ago that everyone was more bullish on electrification. Even the US had relatively ambitious plans to boost EV adoption into the next decade, including a big commitment to charging infrastructure. Ten new battery factories were announced, and the future looked bright.

Not everyone agreed. Some automakers, having been left behind by the push toward battery EVs and away from simple hybrids that offered little in the way of true decarbonization, lobbied hard to relax fuel efficiency standards. Car dealers, uncomfortable with the prospect of investing in and learning about new technology, did so, too. When the Republican Party won the 2024 election, the revanchists got their wish.

Gone were the incentives to consumers and businesses to buy EVs, which helped offset the higher purchase price. Out went funding for that national network of high-speed chargers. Tough future emissions standards were torn up, and inefficient and polluting gasoline engines will instead be the order of the day. And automakers were told to forget about being fined under the existing regulations—&quot;sell as many gas-guzzlers as you like” was the message. (But also, bizarrely, import those tiny Japanese Kei cars, too.)

Stellantis is hardly alone in feeling this pain; in December, Ford announced a $19.5 billion write-down as it reprioritized combustion-engine platforms going forward. GM followed in early January with news that canceling some of its EV plans would cost the company $6 billion. Neither bill is quite as large as the one facing Stellantis (and its shareholders).

The automaker has lagged behind Ford and General Motors in terms of its electrification strategy. In the time that Ford’s F-150 Lightning electric truck has come and gone, and as GM will sell you a couple of different EV pickups, Ram never got that far—and likely never will now that its giant-batteried truck has been canceled. And Jeep’s first US EV was more than a bit underwhelming.

Those canceled products will cost Stellantis about $3.4 billion (2.9 billion euros), with another $7.1 billion (6 billion euros) from platforms that will no longer be amortized over nearly as many units. Another $6.8 billion (5.8 billion euros) will be paid as cash over the next four years due to existing contracts.

Resizing the company’s supply chain will cost another $2.5 billion (2.1 billion euros) as it needs fewer batteries. Laying off workers in Europe will cost another $1.5 billion (1.3 billion euros), with an additional $4.8 billion (4.1 billion euros) due to ongoing warranty issues.

“The charges announced today largely reflect the cost of over-estimating the pace of the energy transition that distanced us from many car buyers’ real-world needs, means and desires. They also reflect the impact of previous poor operational execution, the effects of which are being progressively addressed by our new team,” said Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa.

Going forward, Stellantis says it will invest $13 billion in the US, where it plans to add 5,000 jobs as it builds more trucks and SUVs. Among these will be a new V8 version of the Ram 1500 pickup, a gas-powered version of the Dodge Charger, and some Jeeps.</div>

            <h2>Lawmakers ask what it would take to "store" the International Space Station</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/congress-advances-bill-requiring-nasa-to-reconsider-deorbiting-space-station/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Members of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee voted to approve a NASA authorization bill this week, advancing legislation chock full of policy guidelines meant to give lawmakers a voice in the space agency’s strategic direction.

The committee met to “mark up” the NASA Reauthorization Act of 2026, adding more than 40 amendments to the bill before a unanimous vote to refer the legislation to the full House of Representatives. Wednesday’s committee vote was just one of several steps needed for the bill to become law. It must pass a vote on the House floor, win approval from the Senate, and then go to the White House for President Donald Trump’s signature.

Ars has reported on one of the amendments, which would authorize NASA to take steps toward a “commercial” deep space program using privately owned rockets and spacecraft rather than vehicles owned by the government.

Another add-on to the authorization bill would require NASA to reassess whether to guide the International Space Station (ISS) toward a destructive atmospheric reentry after it is decommissioned in 2030. The space agency’s current plan is to deorbit the space station in 2031 over the Pacific Ocean, where debris that survives the scorching reentry will fall into a remote, unpopulated part of the sea.

The most recent NASA authorization act, passed in 2022, extended the US government’s support for the ISS program until 2030. The amendment tacked onto this year’s bill would not change the timeline for ending operations on the ISS, but it asks NASA to reconsider its decision about what to do with the complex after retirement.

The amendment would direct NASA to “carry out an engineering analysis to evaluate the technical, operational, and logistical viability of transferring the ISS to a safe orbital harbor and storing the ISS in such harbor after the end of the operational low-Earth orbit lifetime of the ISS to preserve the ISS for potential reuse and satisfy the objectives of NASA.”

Rep. George Whitesides (D-Calif.) submitted the amendment with cosponsorship from Rep. Nick Begich (R-Alaska). The proposal passed the committee through a voice vote with bipartisan support. Whitesides was a NASA chief of staff and longtime executive in the space industry before his election to the House last year.

“The International Space Station is one of the most complex engineering achievements in human history,” Whitesides said. “It represents more than three decades of international collaboration and investment by US taxpayers estimated at well over $100 billion. Current plans call for the station to be deorbited at the end of its service life in 2030. This amendment does not seek to change that policy. Instead, it asks a straightforward question: Before we permanently dispose of an asset of this magnitude, should we fully understand whether it’s viable to preserve it in orbit for potential use by future generations?”

In 2024, NASA awarded SpaceX a nearly $1 billion contract to develop a souped-up version of its Dragon spacecraft, which would be equipped with additional thrusters and propellant tanks to provide the impulse required to steer the space station toward a targeted reentry. The deorbit maneuvers will slow the station’s velocity enough for Earth’s gravity to pull it back into the atmosphere.

The deorbit vehicle needs to slow the station’s speed by about 127 mph (57 meters per second), a tiny fraction of the spacecraft’s orbital velocity of more than 17,000 mph (7.7 kilometers per second). But the station mass is around 450 tons (400 metric tons), equivalent to two freight train locomotives, and measures about the length of a football field. Changing its speed by just 127 mph will consume about 10 tons (9 metric tons) of propellant, according to a NASA analysis released in 2024.

The analysis document shows that NASA considered alternatives to discarding the space station through reentry. One option NASA studied involved moving the station into a higher orbit. At its current altitude, roughly 260 miles (420 kilometers) above the Earth, the ISS would take one to two years to reenter the atmosphere due to aerodynamic drag if reboosts weren’t performed. NASA does not want the space station to make an uncontrolled reentry because of the risk of fatalities, injuries, and property damage from debris reaching the ground.

Boosting the space station’s orbit to somewhere between 400 and 420 miles (640 to 680 kilometers) would require a little more than twice the propellant (18.9 to 22.3 metric tons) needed for deorbit maneuvers, according to NASA’s analysis. At that altitude, without any additional boosts, NASA says the space station would likely remain in orbit for 100 years before succumbing to atmospheric drag and burning up. Going higher still, the space station could be placed in a 1,200-mile-high (2,000-kilometer) orbit, stable for more than 10,000 years, with about 146 tons (133 metric tons) of propellant.

There are two problems with sending the ISS to higher altitudes. One is that it would require the development of new propulsive and tanker vehicles that do not currently exist, according to NASA.

“While still currently in development, vehicles such as the SpaceX Starship are being designed to deliver significant amounts of cargo to these orbits,” NASA officials wrote in their analysis. “However, there are prohibitive engineering challenges with docking such a large vehicle to the space station and being able to use its thrusters while remaining within space station structural margins. Other vehicles would require both new certifications to fly at higher altitudes and multiple flights to deliver propellant.”

Going higher would also expose the space station to an increased risk of collision with space junk. The hazards from space debris are most severe at about 500 miles (800 kilometers), according to the engineers who conducted the analysis. “This means that the likelihood of an impact leaving station unable to maneuver or react to future threats, or even a significant impact resulting in complete fragmentation, is unacceptably high.”

Whitesides’ office did not respond to Ars’ questions, but he said in Wednesday’s hearing that his amendment would direct NASA to further examine the costs and risks of putting the ISS in a higher orbit. The legislation “simply ensures that Congress receives a rigorous fact-based analysis so that future decisions involving the ISS are informed by scientific reality,” he said.

“At a time when we’re thinking seriously about sustainability in space, this amendment protects taxpayer investments and ensures that we fully understand our options before an irreplaceable asset is permanently retired.”

Rep. Brian Babin (R-Texas) said he “wholeheartedly” supports Whitesides’ amendment. Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) also endorsed it in brief remarks during Wednesday’s markup hearing.

“I just hate the thought that we would take something not just that we spent all the money on, but such an important part of human history, and dump it in the Pacific Ocean, never to be seen again, rather than preserving it,” Beyer said. “We don’t know whether we can do it in orbit, but if we can, we should really explore that hard.”

Although NASA’s official policy is still to decommission the ISS in 2030, the door hasn’t closed on extending the lab’s operations into the next decade. There are some concerns about aging hardware, but NASA said in 2024 that engineers have “high confidence” that the primary structure of the station could support operations beyond 2030.

The oldest segments of the station have been in orbit since 1998, undergoing day-night thermal cycles every 45 minutes as they orbit the planet. The structural stability of the Russian section of the outpost is also in question. Russian engineers traced a small but persistent air leak to microscopic structural cracks in one Russian module, but cosmonauts were able to seal the cracks, and air pressure in the area is “holding steady,” a NASA spokesperson said last month.

One of the lab’s most critical elements, its power-generation system, is in good shape after NASA recently installed upgraded solar arrays outside the station. Another set of upgraded solar panels is scheduled to arrive at the station later this year, just a few years before the complex is to be retired.

NASA’s strategy is to decommission the ISS and turn to the commercial sector for new, cheaper, smaller space stations to continue conducting research in low-Earth orbit. This would allow NASA to buy time on a commercial space station for its astronauts and experiments, while the agency’s human spaceflight program focuses on missions to the Moon.

That’s a fine plan, but NASA’s program to support commercial space stations, known as Commercial LEO Destinations (CLDs), is going nowhere fast. Supporters of the CLD program say it has been underfunded from the start, and the strategy became more muddled last year when Sean Duffy, then NASA’s acting administrator, changed the agency’s rules for private space stations. NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman is reviewing the changes, and the requirements for stations may shift again.

NASA spends more than $3 billion per year for ISS operations, including crew and cargo transportation services to staff and support the outpost. NASA’s budget for deep space exploration in fiscal year 2026 is nearly $7.8 billion. NASA is receiving $273 million for the Commercial LEO Destinations program this year, with the money to be divided among multiple companies.

Any private space station will need to sustain itself, at least partially, on commercial business to be profitable. Developers have raised concerns that they will be unable to attract sufficient commercial business—in areas like pharmaceutical research, tech demos, or space tourism—as long as the government-funded ISS is still operating.

One of the companies vying for NASA funding is Vast, which plans to launch its first single-module private outpost to orbit in early 2027. This first station, named Haven-1, will accommodate crews for short-duration temporary stays. Vast plans to follow Haven-1 with a much larger multi-module station capable of supporting a permanent crew.

Max Haot, Vast’s CEO, does not seem bothered by lawmakers’ efforts to revisit the question of deorbiting the International Space Station.

“The amendment directs NASA to study the feasibility of something other than deorbit and disposal after ISS end of life, which is separate from the issue of retiring the space station and transitioning to commercial partners,” Haot said in a statement to Ars. “We support President Trump’s directive in national space policy to replace the ISS by 2030, with commercial partners who can ensure there is no gap in America’s continuous human presence in space.”

The other top contenders in the commercial space station arena are Starlab, a joint venture between Voyager Space and Airbus, the Blue Origin-led Orbital Reef project, and Axiom Space. Voyager and Blue Origin did not respond to requests for comment from Ars, and an Axiom spokesperson was unable to provide a statement by publication time.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Move over Snoopy, because NASA has a new character helping to promote its deep space exploration plans. His name is Uncle Traveling Matt.

Fraggle Rock: A Space-y Adventure has taken over the same theater the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Florida previously used for All Systems Are Go, featuring the comic strip beagle. The new stage show stars the Jim Henson Company’s subterranean Muppets as they discover outer (outer) space for the first time.

“I went back through the canon of the original [1983 HBO] series and then our reboot [Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock for Apple TV], and I was like, ‘Wait, Uncle Matt never really questioned what’s beyond, because he thinks he’s done it all.’ He’s like, ‘Oh, I’ve explored outer space’—that’s what the Fraggles call our world, right? So he’s like, ‘I’ve done it,’” said John Tartaglia, the show’s director, writer, and choreographer as well as creative supervisor for Fraggle Rock at the Henson Company, in an interview with collectSPACE.com.

“So for him to have his mind blown that there’s something even beyond that, I thought that was such a fun way to push that character’s journey forward,” said Tartaglia.

To differentiate between the Fraggles’ use of “outer space&quot;—the land where the “silly creatures,” aka, us humans live—and our “outer space,” the show refers to the latter as “outer outer space.” (It is unclear if that concept will live on beyond the NASA show. “I think it could be,” Tartaglia said. “We haven’t explored that yet.” No pun intended.)

As Fraggle Rock: A Space-y Adventure opens, Gobo, Red, and their friends are still at home, and we “silly creatures” are at Kennedy Space Center. The trick, said Tartaglia, was finding ways to bridge that gap while staying true to both realities.

“We always want to stay true to the world,” said Tartaglia. “You have to justify why the Fraggles are there.”

The Doozers offered one way. The show’s small, green, industrious creatures are, in their more modern incarnations, technologically adept and have developed DoozerCam, a FaceTime-like video call system that is able to connect Fraggle Rock with outer space.

As the show opens, the DoozerCam shows the Fraggles in the midst of a familiar scene—the title sequence from the show, complete with their theme song—until they notice the audience of humans watching them.

“NASA, wisely, really wanted people to immediately get into that vibe of Fraggle Rock,” Tartaglia told collectSPACE. “We could have just written a show where it all takes place at Kennedy Space Center, but I think people really want to peek in and see Fraggle Rock, so it just felt like the appropriate, rule-based way to do it that felt right to the world, but also kept Fraggle Rock a cool, distant mystery place that you want to go visit.”

But to really bring the Fraggles to Kennedy required a postcard… and a change of scale.

In the series, Traveling Matt wrote about what he had encountered in outer space through postcards that he sent to his nephew, Gobo, back at Fraggle Rock. Gobo would then share his uncle’s adventures with his friends, including Red, who particularly loathed them.

In Fraggle Rock: A Space-y Adventure, a postcard with a photo of a “cookie” leads Traveling Matt, Gobo, and Red through a “Fraggle hole” to Kennedy Space Center. It is there that they meet a representative of NASA’s Exploration Ground Systems (EGS) division and learn of outer outer space and that the cookie is really the Moon.

(Asked why Traveling Matt would not have recognized the Moon from his time in outer space, Tartaglia said that perhaps he did see it, but only as a thin crescent, and did not equate the two. Or maybe it was that he was “so forward-driven” that he never bothered to look up.)

As Gobo, Red, and Traveling Matt step through the Fraggle hole onto the stage at Kennedy, they are no longer hand-operated puppets but full-body “walk-around” characters. And to remain to scale, that meant up-scaling another character, too.

“When we scaled up the Fraggles to be costume-size, so they could dance and move without being encumbered by being just puppets, we realized that one of the Doozers would have to become puppet-size. That was really fun to do because the real Doozers are six inches tall, and they are animatronic. They’re teeny, and now they get to have their glory as hand puppets,” said Tartaglia, who also voices Gobo for the show and performs as him when in puppet size.

When NASA first contacted the Jim Henson Company about bringing the Fraggles to the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, Tartaglia and his team knew it would be cool. And once they decided to have Uncle Traveling Matt be the show’s central character, the plot came together fairly quickly.

“He’s a great character to learn from because he is so oblivious, and he thinks he knows everything, and he really doesn’t. So he’s a great character to use as a bridge for the audience to be able to learn all these awesome facts and figures about NASA,” said Tartaglia.

He and his team also came to appreciate how much Fraggle Rock shares with the space agency, its activities, and goals.

“We all started talking and realized really quickly that Fraggles and Doozers and the whole message of Fraggle Rock—especially about Uncle Matt—is about exploring new worlds, making discoveries, and the whole fragile ecosystem. All of these different worlds need each other and want to work to learn more about each other. It sounded all very aligned with what NASA does and the whole purpose of space exploration,” said Tartaglia.

“So our two worlds that on paper wouldn’t seem connected, made a lot of sense to connect,” he said.</div>

            <h2>Professor Says Her Garbled AI Textbook Was a Huge Success</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/professor-defends-ai-textbook">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The professor behind an AI-generated textbook says that her error-ridden experiment was actually a resounding success.

Designed for a comparative literature course on medieval and Renaissance-era writing and announced by UCLA at the end of 2024, the digital textbook was immediately met with widespread mockery and derision from educators. Its AI-generated cover was riddled with incomprehensible text — “Of Nerniacular Latin To An Evoolitun On Nance Langusages,” for example — and featured generic visuals that had little to do with the period it was supposedly covering.

At the time, Elizabeth Landers, a grad student who helped put together the volume, said that the errors “aren’t a failure of AI.” Instead, she argued, “they’re an intentional artistic choice that prompts students to question their assumptions about language, meaning and historical truth.”

Now in a new interview with Inside Higher Ed in which the word “hallucination” isn’t mentioned once, the course’s professor Zrinka Stahulja called her decision to use an “AI-assisted” textbook a “no-brainer” because of all the time it saved her, helping her be an “approachable and accessible teacher.”

And incredibly, Stahuljak says she was surprised that her UCLA colleagues were so skeptical about her AI textbook. “I was really shocked that they couldn’t see that this textbook was my creation; it was carefully edited, just as if it had been printed,” she told IHE.

“I don’t see how a traditional textbook that costs $250 and is out of date within two years or three years, would be in some way better than a custom $25 AI-facilitated textbook that is based on my material,” she added.

The AI textbook was made with Kudu, a platform for creating digital textbooks started by another UCLA professor. Stahuljak says she created the textbook by supplying her own notes to the AI tool, which was instructed not to pull from outside sources. Students could interact with a built-in chatbot to help learn the materials, though she stresses it was designed not to write papers or complete assignments. Stahuljak also says the AI features made the book more accessible, with some students saying they listened to it while walking or at the gym.

After deploying the AI textbook, Stahuljak claimed that “engagement went up” compared to classes that didn’t use it. And perhaps soberingly, she viewed it as a preferable to having her students turn to ChatGPT for help.

“It’s better than some commercial version that has nothing to do with what you’re teaching or is pulling the information from the internet,” she said in the interview. “We’re losing that control when we are indiscriminately given ChatGPT or other commercial generative AI-powered tools.”

There’s a fair point or two being made, but Stahuljak isn’t addressing the numerous elephants in the room. AI chatbots are notorious for generating made-up facts and otherwise incorrectly reporting information, regardless of whatever data they’re being asked to pull from. A considerable and still growing body of evidence shows how AI tools may diminish critical thinking skills and attention spans. Then there’s the broader concerns over how the tech is threatening the very existence of learning institutions, as tech companies spend millions of dollars to capture schools and universities and use them to offload their products.

“This is truly bad and makes me wonder if we aren’t participating in creating our own replacements at the expense of, well, everyone who cares about teaching and learning,” one English professor wrote on social media after the AI textbook was announced, as quoted by IHE.

“If you do this you should have your doctorate revoked and be thrown into the stocks at the center of the main university quad,” fumed another professor. “This is abandonment of professional responsibility to a degree that would be comical if it weren’t so self-serious.”

            <h2>An Analysis Just Found Something Extremely Unflattering About What Happens to Users of Prediction Markets</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/future-society/prediction-markets-analysis">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After an analyst found that users are losing money faster on sites like Polymarket than on traditional sports gambling platforms, the US’s largest prediction market Kalshi hit back with a decidedly unusual response.

As Bloomberg reports, the betting platform told it that the analysis was part of an “extortion plot” by the startup that had collected the data, Juice Reel — before, even more puzzlingly, backing off from the stunning claim.

The report was conducted by Jordan Bender, an equity research analyst at the bank Citizens. Using Juice Reel’s data, it found that in the first three months, users on prediction markets like Kalshi were losing more money than on traditional gambling sites like FanDuel and DraftKings, in proportion to the amount of money they wagered.

If true, the findings put a considerable dent in prediction markets’ self-styled image as a more cerebral form of betting, allowing customers to place wagers on a variety of real-world events, ranging from presidential elections to natural disasters to military interventions. And because bettors are competing against each other, instead of the house, these sites claim that means users have a more reliable way of making money.

Though they’re essentially dressed-up casinos, they also seek to be seen as an authority on the future itself. Last month, for example, Kalshi partnered with CNN to provide real time prediction data on its broadcasts. Polymarket announced a similar partnership with Dow Jones, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, barely a week later. These add heft and credibility to their projections, even though Kalshi’s and Polymarket’s projections are entirely determined by users’ bets.

Of course, if Kalshi and similar services are just as much as a money sink as plain old gambling, then that elevated veneer vanishes. And they appear to: Bender found that the bottom quarter of users lost about 28 centers of every dollar they put on the lane, compared to just 11 cents per dollar on traditional gambling hubs.

Kalshi’s tried-and-true defense against these claims? Calling the data “flat-out wrong,” it said in a statement to Bloomberg. Its head of communications Elisabeth Diana accused Juice Reel of having a conflict of interest because it sought “investment support” from Kalshi in the past. She also claimed that Juice Reel’s founder offered to “defuse the situation” if he was given a meeting with Kalshi’s CEO.

“Please consider the source and its motives,” she told Bloomberg in an emailed statement. “This is extortion.”

Juice Reel’s CEO Ricky Gold tells it differently. “They called and messaged us, pressuring us to tell Bloomberg that our data is inaccurate,” Gold told the publication. “We stand for transparency, we stand for helping bettors, traders understand their activity across the platform, and we stand behind our data.”

Kalshi continued to dispute the findings and denied pressuring Gold, per the reporting. But it’s now changed its tune on the whole alleged blackmail angle. “We are in ongoing discussions about Juice Reel’s legal ability to obtain our data, but after further review, we don’t believe the intention was extortion,” the company said in an updated statement last week.

The touchy response from Kalshi also comes amid increasing calls to regulate prediction markets after several scandals captured national attention. The most significant came in January, when a slew of traders on Polymarket placed sizable bets on the prediction that US forces would enter Venezuela just hours before Trump launched the operation to capture the country’s leader Nicolas Maduro. One “lucky” bettor made more than $400,000.

            <h2>Novo Nordisk Furious at $49 Knockoff Ozempic Pill</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/health-medicine/novo-nordisk-ozempic-knockoff-pill">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Novo Nordisk conquered the world with its borderline miraculous drug semaglutide, sold as Ozempic and Wegovy. But with a sinking stock price and compelling alternatives eating its lunch, it’s now finding itself in a position in which it has to take desperate measures to fight off its competitors.

On Thursday, the Danish pharmaceutical giant vowed to take legal action against Hims & Hers after the telehealth company announced a much more affordable knockoff of its weight loss pill, Wegovy— which it’s offering starting at $49 for a month’s supply, though the price subsequently jumps to $99.

“The action by Hims & Hers is illegal mass compounding that poses a significant risk to patient safety,” Novo said in a statement, per CNBC. “Novo Nordisk will take legal and regulatory action to protect patients, our intellectual property and the integrity of the US gold-standard drug approval framework.

“This is another example of Hims & Hers’ historic behavior of duping the American public with knock-off GLP-1 products, and the FDA has previously warned them about their deceptive advertising of GLP-1 knock-offs.”

It remains to be seen if the lawsuit materializes. But Novo probably felt it had to say something to save face. Immediately after Hims announced its Wegovy knockoff on Thursday, the pharma giant’s shares plunged by nearly 8 percent.

Luckily for Novo, they’re now back up by over 5 percent, after its big brother came to the rescue: later that same day, the US Food and Drug Administration made its own vow that it would crack down on “illegal copycat drugs.” With the script now flipped, Hims’ stock nosedived by ten percent in after-hours trading, per Reuters, and as of today, is down by over 2 percent.

What Hims is offering is what’s known as a compounded form of a drug, which are made by pharmacies using their own ingredients, rather than being made by the pharmaceutical company. They’re different from generic versions of a drug, which are approved by the FDA. Compounded drugs are largely unregulated and receive no FDA approval, but are far cheaper than buying the brand name.

The practice of compounding drugs allows a pharmacist to tailor a drug to a patient’s specific needs, but big pharma companies view it as a loophole that lets copycats sell cheap knockoffs. At one point, Novo claimed that some one million Americans were taking semaglutide knockoffs, and appealed to the US government to ban imports of some of the key ingredients copycats used to formulate their versions of the drug.

The increased competition comes after a disastrous years-long spell for Novo, which was once the most valuable company in Europe. US rival drugmaker Eli Lilly overtook prescription for Wegovy with its Zepbound weight loss shot — which, to rub salt in the wound, also performed better in a head-to-head trial. It didn’t help that Novo’s offerings were prohibitively expensive before it eventually slashed them last summer, at one point costing more than $1,000 per month for customers without insurance. The perception of its weakening grip on the throne saw Novo’s stock collapse by over 50 percent year over year in 2025, wiping out hundreds of billions of dollars in value.

And its worst days may still be ahead. On Wednesday, Novo said it expected sales to fall this year, the New York Times reported, which would be its first annual decline in sales in nearly a decade. Meanwhile, Eli Lilly said it expected its sales to keep growing, nudging its market cap back above the $1 trillion mark.

Novo’s saving grace is that it beat Lilly to the punch with a pill version of Wegovy, released in January. Pill versions are seen as the next big steep for weight loss drugs, as they’re cheaper and less intimidating than shots. Its CEO Mike Doustdar claimed that the Wegovy pill is selling 15 times faster in its first month that than the injectable version on its debut, per the NYT. But this advantage may soon vanish too, as Lilly expects to release its own pill later this year.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For quite some time now, investors have fought the suggestion that the artificial intelligence industry may be forming a massive bubble, risking an eventual collapse of epic proportions that could take down the US economy with it.

But shaking off those fears has proven increasingly difficult as the tech stock market reels from a major selloff this week.

Amazon shares tumbled nine percent Friday morning after claiming that its spending would hit an astronomical $200 billion this year as part of its efforts to keep up in the ongoing AI race. Shares are down over eight percent over the last five days, indicating it’s not just a blip.

Microsoft has been hit hard lately as well, with shares also plunging almost eight percent over the last five days, following its biggest single-day loss since the pandemic last week.

Other tech companies, including AI chipmaker Nvidia, Oracle, Alphabet, and Meta, all saw their shares drop significantly this week as they indicated they remained committed to spending vast sums to scale up their AI infrastructure investments.

As CNBC reports, around $1.35 trillion in valuations has been wiped out as Big Tech companies committed to spending a total of $660 billion this year alone, a “breathtaking” figure, as AllianceBernstein head Jim Tierney told the Financial Times.

But it doesn’t take much reading between the lines to figure out that investors are becoming incredibly antsy about those enormous spending plans. A short-term return on investment for AI-focused infrastructure buildouts is certainly out of the question as tech leaders continue to reassure them that it will all be worth it in the end.

The selloff could mark the beginning of a much larger downturn, analysts fear.

“Questions over the extent of [capital expenditures] as a result of LLM build-outs, the eventual return on that, and the fear of eventual over-expansion of capacity will be persistent,” GAM Investments investment director Paul Markham told CNBC.

With its $200 billion spending target, a significant 56 percent increase over last year, Amazon has positioned itself as the biggest spender. Yet the stock tumble indicates it’s not what investors wanted to hear.

“We have suddenly gone from the fear that you cannot be last, to investors questioning every single angle in this AI race,” Quilter Cheviot consumer discretionary analyst Mamta Valechha.

Further adding credence to the theory that investors are getting spooked by the enormous amount of money companies are continuing to pour into AI is Apple, whose far more muted approach appears to have paid off — with its shares instead up a whopping seven percent since Monday.

“The market is rethinking its approach to AI,” M&G chief investment officer for equities Fabiana Fedeli told the FT, arguing that investors are “a lot more selective in which companies [they] will decide to bet on.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">US employers announced over 108,000 layoffs across January, in the highest to start the year since the depths of the Great Recession in 2009. Many executives were quick to blame AI for the layoffs, though the real reason might be simpler: companies just aren’t optimistic about the direction the economy is heading.

According to new reporting by CNBC, layoffs are up 118 percent from January, 2025, and a whopping 205 percent compared to December 2025. Throughout the month, US corporations tracked by analyst firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas only reported 5,306 new hires — another low which hadn’t been seen since January of 2009.

“Generally, we see a high number of job cuts in the first quarter, but this is a high total for January,” Andy Challenger, chief revenue officer at the analytics firm, told CNBC. “It means most of these plans were set at the end of 2025, signaling employers are less-than-optimistic about the outlook for 2026.”

The horrid numbers come as tech companies announce plans to dump more money into AI than ever before. Earlier this week, Google’s parent company Alphabet announced it would double its AI capital expenditures from the $90 billion it spent in 2025 to as much as $185 billion, per the New York Times.

With so much hope for AI’s future, it’s no wonder many commentators and businesses titans have blamed the tech for the bone-dry job market. Yet as the market research firm Forrester explained in its January labor report, the “job apocalypse” is way overblown.

“Many companies announcing AI-related layoffs do not have mature, vetted AI applications ready to fill those roles, highlighting a trend of ‘AI washing’ — attributing financially motivated cuts to future AI implementation,” the report read.

In fact, some companies’ financial woes might actually be the result of AI-washing in previous years. As Forrester puts it, “over-automating roles due to the hype surrounding AI can lead to costly pullbacks, damaged reputations, and weakened employee experiences.”

So while the job market might be struggling, resist the knee-jerk temptation to blame AI. We’re not living in the cyberpunk dystopia yet — just the age-old grind of an all-too-familiar capitalist economy.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Mainstream cryptocurrency Bitcoin is being eviscerated this week. The token tanked to a historic low, coming eerily close to as little as $60,000 on Thursday evening. That’s well under 50 percent down from its all-time high a mere four months ago.

While the crypto has since bounced back to around the $68,000 mark, it comes at a grim cost: it’s now wiped out all of its gains since president Donald Trump won the presidential election in late 2025.

Analysts aren’t presumably hopeful about an imminent recovery, with some expecting the absolute worst.

“Our BTC price target is 0.0,” Pivotus Partners chief market strategist and partner Richard Farr tweeted. “That’s not just for shock factor. It’s where the math takes us.”

Farr said he concurred with Michael Burry, who famously shorted the US housing market before its collapse in 2008, and recently warned in a Substack post that further losses for Bitcoin could result in a “death spiral.”

Farr pointed to Bitcoin following similar trends to a larger US stock downturn, suggesting it’s no longer the safe haven it was once claimed to be, arguing that it operates as a “speculative instrument correlated to the Nasdaq” instead.

The crypto bear argued that “no serious central bank will ever own something where Michael Saylor controls the float,” referring to the CEO of Strategy, the largest corporate Bitcoin treasury.

Farr also criticized the token for being damaging to the environment, as mining it requires copious amounts of energy and water.

“Nothing ‘green’ about this ‘coin,&#39;” Farr wrote mockingly. “We think it’s a zero.”

In a follow-up post on LinkedIn, Farr argued that worsening US jobs numbers could cause even more money to “come out of speculative assets, than in,” which led him to feel “increasingly emboldened” about his zero-dollar call.

He also pointed to crypto miners, who were already squeezed by winter storms driving up electricity prices, being forced to close up shop amid the crash.

“We think we are only in the early innings of the crypto correction,” Farr wrote.

In his Substack post, Burry noted that a recent crash in gold prices — following a historic surge — appeared to be linked to Bitcoin’s ongoing demise.

As people continue to gamble on gold futures, Burry argued that “physical metals may break from the trend on safe haven demand,” triggering a “death spiral”-like collapse.

Considering Bitcoin’s enormous swings over the last couple of months, it’s likely not the end of the ride for the infamously volatile digital token.

Farr clearly isn’t alone in predicting further losses.

“This steady selling in our view signals that traditional investors are losing interest, and overall pessimism about crypto is growing,” Deutsche Bank analyst Marion Laboure wrote in a note to clients, as quoted by CNBC.

“Bitcoin isn’t trading on hype anymore, the story has lost a bit of that plot, it is trading on pure liquidity and capital flows,” FG Nexus CEO of digital assets Maja Vujinovic added.

            <div id="article-text">Carbon-removal startup Terradot is acquiring competitor Eion, the two companies announced today. The sale was driven largely by big investors like sovereign wealth funds, which want to work with companies that can handle large contracts. Eion was simply too small, Eion CEO Anastasia Pavlovic Hans told The Wall Street Journal.

Both companies spread pulverized rocks on farm fields to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Known as enhanced rock weathering (EWR), it speeds up a natural process and has the potential to be a low-cost way to remove carbon, but it requires large and distributed operations. The spread between what EWR companies would like to charge and what buyers would like to pay remains wide, according to a survey by CDR.fyi.

California-based Terradot’s operations are centered on Brazil, where the company works with basalt as its mineral of choice, while Eion works in the U.S. and uses olivine. Terradot’s investor list includes Gigascale Capital, Google, Kleiner Perkins, and Microsoft, while Eion’s investors include AgFunder, Mercator Partners, and Overture.

            <div id="article-text">Last month, I wrote about Mercor’s new benchmark measuring AI agents’ capabilities on professional tasks like law and corporate analysis. At the time, the scores were pretty dismal, with every major lab scoring under 25%, so we concluded lawyers were safe from AI displacement, at least for now.

But AI capabilities can change a lot in a couple of weeks.

This week’s release of Anthropic’s Opus 4.6 shook up the leaderboards, with Anthropic’s new model scoring just shy of 30% in one-shot trials, and an average of 45% when given a few more cracks at the problem. Notably, the release included a bunch of new agentic features, including “agent swarms,” which may have helped with this kind of multistep problem-solving.

Regardless, the score is a huge jump from the previous state-of-the-art, and a sign that progress on foundation models isn’t slowing down. Mercor CEO Brendan Foody, who was particularly impressed, said, “jumping from 18.4% to 29.8% in a few months is insane.”

Thirty percent is still a long way from 100%, so it’s not like lawyers need to be worried about getting replaced by machines next week. But they should be a lot less confident than they were last month!

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/06/reddit-says-its-looking-for-more-acquisitions-in-adtech-and-elsewhere/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Reddit is gearing up for more M&A, the company told analysts on its fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday. Reddit CFO Andrew Vollero said the online forum site is looking for businesses that can either leverage Reddit’s scale — meaning their products become more impactful when deployed across Reddit’s massive user base — or help grow the company’s user base.

“[We’re] looking to buy capabilities, technologies, and companies,” he said during the introductory remarks.

Investors, obviously, wanted to know more — particularly about what the company had in mind when it came to scaled opportunities.

In the Q&A portion of the call, Vollero clarified, “I probably wouldn’t overthink the scaled opportunities. I would just look at it as sort of a spectrum of opportunities.” He reiterated that the company was looking for capabilities and technologies that could add to its business, noting that it’s been successful doing this in the past.

“It’s really been one of the secrets of our success,” he pointed out.

Vollero explained that Reddit’s adtech team in particular had been adept at “tucking in” acquired technologies rather than building these things themselves.

“Saves us six months to market, saves us twelve months to market, and you have a proven product,” the CFO remarked, crediting these deals with helping Reddit improve its monetization capabilities as an ad-supported business.

Still, Vollero cautioned that while adtech acquisitions have been what worked in the past, the company is “not ruling anything off the table.” That’s why he had mentioned that Reddit might buy companies that could deliver when added to a company of its size.

The company in the quarter reported strong earnings, with $726 million in revenue, $690 million of which came from ads. Its global daily active unique users were up 19% year-over-year to 121.4 million, and its earnings per share of $1.24 beat estimates.

Reddit also said it sees a growing opportunity of generating revenue from its AI search product in the future, which raises the question as to whether the company is looking to this area for M&A, too.

Reddit, which has been ramping up its AI investments in recent months, including an AI search engine, has acquired startups before. In recent years, it snapped up adtech players and AI optimization tools, including Memorable AI in August 2024.

Designed to enhance Reddit’s advertising tools, the acquisition joined a handful of others from 2022, including AI platform Spell, designed to boost Reddit’s machine learning capabilities; Spiketrap, which focused on improved ad targeting; Oterlu, which developed machine-learning moderation tools; and MeaningCloud, another startup bought to improve Reddit’s machine-learning and text analytics capabilities.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A month after introducing mandatory facial verification for access to chats on its platform, Roblox says 45% of its daily active users have undergone age checks as of January 31.

Roblox’s launch of age checks followed a wave of lawsuits over child safety, including ones from the attorneys general of Texas, Kentucky, and Louisiana. The lawsuits were filed in response to reports that Roblox was exposing young users to dangerous risks, such as grooming and explicit content.

To complete the age-check process, users have to open the Roblox app, allow access to their camera, and follow a series of on-screen instructions for facial verification. Once the age check is processed, Roblox says it deletes any images or videos of users. The verification is processed by a third-party vendor, Persona, which also deletes images and videos after completing the process, Roblox says.

Once users complete an age check, they can access age-based chats, which means they can only communicate with others in a similar age group. There are six age groups: under 9, 9 to 12, 13 to 15, 16 to 17, 18 to 20, and 21 plus. Users in each age group can chat with people in the groups directly above and below theirs. For example, users in the 9-12 category can chat with people in their own group, as well as those in the under 9 and 13-15 groups.

If the age-check process incorrectly estimates a user’s age, they can appeal the decision and verify their age through alternative methods, including ID verification or through parental controls that allow parents to update their child’s age.

The company said during its Q4 2025 earnings release this week that age-checked data reveals a younger user base than self-reported data. This isn’t surprising, and even Roblox itself said it expected this outcome. Of the 45% of users who have undergone age checks, 35% are under 13, 38% are between the ages of 13 and 17, and 27% are over 18.

As the company rolled out the new process, some concerns were raised around particular loopholes. For instance, Wired reported that eBay had listings for age-verified Roblox accounts for minors as young as nine years old. Even though eBay has removed the listings, concerns remain that predators could access accounts posing as minors by tricking the system.

Roblox’s senior director of product policy, Eliza Jacobs, told TechCrunch on Friday that the company has continuous age-check systems running in the background to address these concerns and prevent this type of abuse.

Jacobs said the platform looks to see if “there are any signals on your account that indicate that the age that we now have on that account is not consistent with the activity on that account. Whether that’s the kinds of games you’re playing, or who you’re talking to. We also have key stroke analysis. The way adults type is different from the way kids type. So [we have] lots of systems running in the background to ensure that the age is accurate to the person actually using the account. And if we have any reason to believe that it’s not accurate, we will introduce additional checks to make sure that we have it right.”

She noted that another way Roblox looks for age accuracy is by looking at how a person uses emojis. Older generations tend to use emojis at the end of sentences as punctuation, while younger people often place them in the middle of sentences, Jacobs explained.

In addition to using age checks to make its platform safer, Roblox CEO and co-founder David Baszucki said during the company’s earnings call that the data collected as a result of these checks will be used to grow revenue.

“We have been able to find a bigger growth opportunity in the 18-plus demographic than previously assumed,” Baszucki said. “We estimate our 18 and over cohort is growing at over 50%, and this cohort monetizes 40% higher than younger cohorts.”

He went on to say that Roblox is optimizing its platform to facilitate the growth of high-revenue genres popular with older users, such as shooters, RPGs, sports, and racing.

Roblox says it will continue to enhance its safety measures to respond to evolving risks and user needs.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/06/senator-who-has-repeatedly-warned-about-secret-u-s-government-surveillance-sounds-new-alarm-over-cia-activities/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A senior Democratic lawmaker with knowledge of some of the U.S. government’s most secretive operations has said he has “deep concerns” about certain activities by the Central Intelligence Agency.

The two-line letter written by Sen. Ron Wyden, the longest serving member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, does not disclose the nature of the CIA’s activities or the senator’s specific concerns. But the letter follows a pattern in recent years in which Wyden has publicly hinted at wrongdoing or illegality within the federal government, sometimes referred to as the “Wyden siren.”

In a statement (via the Wall Street Journal’s Dustin Volz), the CIA said it was “ironic but unsurprising that Senator Wyden is unhappy,” calling it a “badge of honor.”

When reached by TechCrunch, a spokesperson for Wyden’s staff was unable to comment, as the matter was classified.

Tasked with oversight of the intelligence community, Wyden is one of a few lawmakers who is allowed to read highly classified information about ongoing government surveillance, including cyber and other intelligence operations. But as the programs are highly secretive, Wyden is barred from sharing details of what he knows with anyone else, including most other lawmakers, except for a handful of Senate staff with security clearance.

As such, Wyden, a known privacy hawk, has become one of the few key members of Congress whose rare but outspoken words on intelligence and surveillance matters are closely watched by civil liberties groups.

Over the past few years, Wyden has subtly sounded the alarm on several occasions in which he has construed a secret ruling or intelligence gathering method as unlawful or unconstitutional.

In 2011, Wyden said that the U.S. government was relying on a secret interpretation of the Patriot Act, which he said — without disclosing the nature of his concerns — created a “gap between what the public thinks the law says and what the American government secretly thinks the law says.”

Two years later, then-NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed that the National Security Agency was relying on its secret interpretation of the Patriot Act to force U.S. phone companies, including Verizon, to turn over the call records of hundreds of millions of Americans on an ongoing basis.

Since then, Wyden has sounded the alarm on how the U.S. government collects the contents of people’s communications; revealed that the Justice Department barred Apple and Google from disclosing that federal authorities had been secretly demanding the contents of their customers’ push notifications; and said that an unclassified report that CISA has refused to release contains “shocking details” about national security threats facing U.S. phone companies.

As noted by Techdirt’s Mike Masnick, we may not know yet why Wyden sounded the siren about the CIA’s activities, but every time Wyden has warned, he has also been vindicated.

On this week’s Galaxy Brain, Charlie Warzel takes listeners deep into the internet’s fever swamps to examine how figures who once would’ve stayed on the fringes now dominate mainstream feeds. The episode charts the rise of Clavicular, a young livestreamer who’s gone from an absurdist curiosity to a fixture in the manosphere and its adjacent right-wing influencer culture. Using Claviculara as a lens—his extreme body modification, relentless self-documentation, and a willingness to do anything for attention, Charlie discusses the rise of nihilistic Zoomer influencers. Then Charlie is joined by the internet-culture researcher Aidan Walker, who helps situate Clavicular alongside figures such as Nick Fuentes and Andrew Tate, revealing how the “looks-maxxing” movement collides with nihilism, grievance politics, and an anti-political, “algorithm-first” ideology. Together they explore what happens when the gatekeepers are gone, and when nihilism becomes a default way for budding attention hijackers to build an audience.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Aidan Walker: Their very existence is proof of something not working.

And so, in a way, their project is to exist, to be seen, to be popular. That’s why he’s going to say the N-word on stream. That’s why he’s going to read the humiliating text from his father on stream. It’s a total commitment to that project. Because I think his existence just sort of proves that the gatekeepers are gone.

Charlie Warzel: I’m Charlie Warzel, staff writer at The Atlantic, and this is Galaxy Brain, a show where today we are going to expose ourselves to a lot of really awful internet content so that you don’t have to. We are really going to plumb the depths of the online fever swamps here. Or maybe it’s more appropriate to say that the characters from the depths of the online fever swamps moved up in a rather concerning way from the fringes all the way into popular culture.

Over the past few months, a very young livestreamer named Clavicular has risen out of obscurity and become part of a stable of manosphere influencers and right-wing online figures. Now, if you’re a normal person who is not chronically online, you probably don’t have the faintest idea who Clavicular is. And I’m sorry to ruin that for you, but bear with me.

Pretty much everything about Clavicular is preposterous. One of his first brushes of internet fame was when this photo of him went viral on Reddit. He was flexing in the mirror, and it was taken by this old, disinterested lady. In December, he made headlines for livestreaming on Christmas Eve while apparently running a man over with his Cybertruck. In interviews, he’s claimed he’s hit his face repeatedly with a hammer to crack his jaw and sculpt it.

He said he’s done methamphetamines to get hollow cheeks. He seemingly takes all kinds of steroids and meticulously documents all of it.

Clavicular is a “looks-maxxer,” and that’s part of this online subculture that is obsessed with going to extreme lengths to achieve a chiseled-faced notion of perfection. It’s an online community that’s gained a fair amount of notoriety in recent years, in part because there’s this overlap there with these other online groups that all cater to disaffected and vulnerable men. It’s always a little bit difficult to categorize these groups, but I think it’s safe to say that in Clavicular’s case, he’s somebody who represents this slice of the manosphere—this big group of popular influencers who traffic in blatant misogyny, online nihilism, and all kinds of destructive trolling behaviors.

Now, historically, somebody like Clavicular would be strange enough and arguably off-putting enough that he might toil on the fringes for quite a while and slowly build up this audience and influence in some of these backwater like-minded communities. But instead the opposite has happened. Clavicular has blown up extremely quickly.

He’s been palling around and collaborating with these manosphere influencers like Andrew Tate, Nick Fuentes, who is arguably one of the most significant media figures on the far right. As we’ll discuss, Clavicular went viral in part because he seems to be willing to do or say absolutely anything and associate with absolutely anyone in order to be famous.

This is how he ended up in a club in Miami a few weeks ago with Andrew Tate and Nick Fuentes singing along to Ye’s song “Heil Hitler.”

Clavacular’s rise is pretty interesting in part because he represents this edgelord, manosphere influencer who also has a pretty incoherent politics. He hangs out with Nick Fuentes, yes, but he’s also called J. D. Vance fat and ugly and subhuman.

Now, I know what you’re thinking: There’s arguably a little bit of risk in taking all of this deadly seriously. In part because Clavicular and all these guys are really young, and also there may not be a lot going on up there. Clavicular himself said on a stream recently: “All I think about is content. I’m sorry, bro. Like, dude, I literally only think about content. You’ve got to understand.” End quote. Good stuff.

And yet, I think Clavicular’s rise—and the rise of these influencers that he’s associating with—may actually reveal a good bit about the direction of online culture in a world where Nick Fuentes and these nihilistic Zoomers seem to be gaining influence online. It’s really easy to dismiss these guys when you watch them online. It all just seems so bankrupt and vain, and often racist and sexist and just kind of devoid.

It’s a worse version of the 2016 pro-Trump shock-jock ecosystem that was led by now mostly forgotten influencers like Milo Yiannopoulos. But this is not the media ecosystem of 2016. And it’s not just Fuentes, who has reach, ending up on Tucker Carlson’s show and vexing Republicans who’d rather not have to side with him or disavow him.

Take Nick Shirley, the 23-year-old YouTuber whose video on alleged fraud at Somali American day cares in Minneapolis went viral late December. A lot of Shirley’s claims had been debunked, and Shirley is by no means a serious journalist. But people in the Trump administration listen to that. The media circus online around his video was used by the administration to justify the surge of ICE agents in Minneapolis.

In other words: Shirley’s provocation, which is content that is made just for the algorithm, broke off the internet into the real world, leaving violence and chaos in its wake. Things right now that can seem trivial or beyond the pale or just so stupid in the second Trump administration often aren’t.

So who actually are these influencers? Where do they come from? And crucially, how seriously should we be taking them? Joining me today is Aidan Walker; he’s a writer and internet-culture researcher.

He’s currently the new-media manager at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. And he spent years documenting the evolution of memes and online culture at the site Know Your Meme. When it comes to content creators, he knows of what he speaks, because he runs a popular TikTok account himself. And Aidan is just the perfect person to situate Clavicular, Fuentes, and his cast of characters into a broader context of online and political culture. He joins me now.

Warzel: So we’re gonna walk through this. This is gonna be some hand-holding, I think, in general, because you are a student of the fever swamps, of the meme craziness, that I think a lot of people do not ingest to the same degree. And I’ve been in those swamps myself. I dip in and out of them.

But I wanted to do something here where we really kind of walk people through all of this. So I want to start—let’s just hope that people haven’t had the pleasure—but who is Clavicular? I don’t even know if I’m saying his name right. Who is he?

Walker: Well, okay, to start from the very beginning: Clavicular is a dude named Braden. He started posting on the internet as a teenager. So when he was around 15, 14, he was on these looks-maxxing forums, which—some of it overlaps with 4chan. Not all of it is 4chan. But he’s out here talking about body modification, essentially.

Warzel: That’s what looks-maxxing is for people.

Walker: So maximizing your looks through various methods. And for a while he’s posting, you know, like many teenagers on social media, gathering a bit of a following. And in the past two months—essentially, I mean, I first heard of him in December, and as you said, I spent a lot of time in the fever swamps—he kind of vaulted to this level of viral prominence. Mostly for stuff on Twitch that he was doing, and Kik actually. So livestreaming his actions, his adventures, his misadventures.

Warzel: So tell me a little bit about what you know; he started doing this when he was much younger. What was he doing in that community? Like, tell me what the looks-maxxing community, what do they—do they believe anything? What do they believe? Tell me about his involvement and that community.

Walker: So the thing to know about looks-maxxers—and I want to be careful with my words, because the lore here is deeply complicated and controversial—but there’s an adjacency to incels. The core of it is kind of this philosophy that the only thing in life that actually matters is how attractive you are. Everything else is sort of a scam. Everything else is a lie.

Women only care about how good you look, men only care about how good you look, and grades don’t matter. Nothing matters. And so the rational person, faced with this situation, will do anything they can to look better.

And so the looks-maxxers will do everything from steroids to, kind of famously, hitting themselves in the face with a hammer or another hard object. The science is that it’ll make microfractures. “Science” in scare quotes, of course. And that’ll reform your facial bones so that you look more like a Chad. You have a sharper jawline. And they’ll also do things like “mewing,” named after a Dr. Mew, which is the sense that you can kind of like—

Warzel: It’s like structuring your jaw, right? Like biting down on something, or doing basically jaw exercises to work it out—as you would if you were curling your biceps or something like that.

Walker: Yeah, yeah—to make it sharper. To make it more muscular. And in a way, it kind of ties into this pseudoscientific health stuff we see with the RFK [Robert F. Kennedy] Jr. BS that goes around. But it’s very much like these young, alienated men on the internet doing anything to make themselves look better. And then kind of posting constantly about the insane lengths you’ll go to, like hitting yourself in the face with a hammer to look good.

Warzel: So what did Clavicular do in this? Did he have a pretty normal trajectory on this? Did he break off from this? He just sort of reached people’s radars late last year. But was he someone of prominence here in this world, as far as you know? Or was he someone who just kind of ascended late in that?

Walker: Yeah, it’s funny that you use the word ascended, because that’s the word they use to describe going from having a soft jawline, looking like a virgin, and then you ascend to look like a Chad. So Clavicular—prior to kind of popping off in November, December—had sort of transferred over to posting on TikTok, and doing kind of the classic posting that attractive people do on TikTok. You know, like dancing, kind of like Blue Steel–ing the camera, like Zoolander. But then including all these “ascension” content—where he’d have a picture of himself when he was young and pimply and then one now, where he’s kind of sculpted and hot.

And so he was prominent in the niche, but he was far from the No. 1 kind of person there. And as to what he did to become prominent: He hit a dude with his Cybertruck during a livestream, and he told a conservative podcaster that he supported Gavin Newsom over J. D. Vance because Gavin Newsom is a 6’3” Chad, and Vance is fat and ugly.

Warzel: So it’s a lot to take in. But what’s interesting about that is simply the degrees to which one can become famous now. Also, the degrees to which somebody like that can kind of pop out of nowhere for the most ridiculous things. To your mind, how has this idea of looks-maxxing—again, it’s not something a lot of people were talking about even, you know, two or three years ago. How has that ascended? What is its rise been as a culture?

Walker: So looks-maxxing is very old, like probably 10, 15 years old. And some of kind of the earliest very active meme subcultures on the internet are like bodybuilders and then incels. And not that every bodybuilder online becomes an incel. It’s a funnel; it’s a pipeline. Not everybody goes down it, which is important to remember. The looks-maxxers aren’t all, like, fallen lost boys who can’t be saved.

Warzel: Who are other looks-maxxers who’ve kind of broken through in this? Or is Clavicular the first that you feel like has achieved this kind of Twitter main-character level of fame?

Walker: So I think Clavicular is the first that has achieved this level of main-character fame. And I think one reason for that is: There’s definitely been people who maybe I’m not aware of that have gotten big on Instagram for doing this. There’s been looks-maxxing influencers for years. But the roots of it, really, are like in this sort of anonymous image-board kind of culture where people aren’t necessarily hustling for the fame. And I think Clavicular’s innovation is that he kind of married that looks-maxxing niche—which is very strong, very vital, has been for years—with sort of this general niche of, like, “I’m a young, hot person” on TikTok. I go to the club; I go out and make videos of myself dancing; I talk about hitting on girls. And so he’s kind of married the two together. And to my mind, I think, he’s one of probably the first really big, famous looks-maxxers to kind of break through into a category of more general fame. Which probably says something about the derangement of our society.

Warzel: Yeah, I think probably. But you have Clavicular, and we’re kind of working toward something here where Clavicular is this character to come out of this corner of the manosphere that is very extreme. About doing extreme, sometimes, damage to your physical body in order to look good—but also is part of this incel, kind of disaffected male culture that has a political valence. Would you say that it has a real political valence, or would you say that it doesn’t really?

Walker: So it has a political valence—but it doesn’t map very neatly onto right-left. So I think part of the reason why it was shocking that Clavicular endorsed Gavin Newsom over J. D. Vance is that anyone on the internet would expect a dude like that to be kind of right wing, in part because it’s kind of incel adjacent. But more than anything, there’s this kind of nihilism to it. Like, the reason he’s endorsing Gavin Newsom isn’t because he is against the [Trump] administration or wants a certain policy outcome. It’s because that cold logic of looks-maxxing says the only thing that matters is the sharpness of a guy’s jawline.

Nothing else in the world actually applies. There’s no morality. There’s no rationality. It’s just, you know, What degree is his canthal tilt?—which is the way your eyes are in relation to the bridge of your forehead. And so it’s a total evacuation of all the other things that people care about. And just a total replacement of it by, you know, (A) How do you look? Is it good? Does it fit the metrics? And (B) How does it perform on the platform? And so if it has a political valence, I don’t think it’s like Clavicular wants a strong social safety net. I think it’s like: Clavicular believes the way that everybody else talks is stupid, and that he’s going to performatively just insist upon this on-the-surface bizarre, and yet strangely cohesive, system of just describing the entire world—describing all human relations—by reference to how people’s faces look. So it’s a total lack of belief in anything social. Anything beyond just, like, “Oh, that guy’s hot or not hot” as a metric for evaluating something. So it’s anti-political, maybe, in a way.

Warzel: So, okay, so we’re gonna put a pin in that. Then there’s another character in this universe. They’re all going to join together, in the worst possible Avengers way. Tell me who—and I think plenty of people will be familiar with his name—but tell me who Nick Fuentes is.

Walker: Yeah; so it’s interesting. Nick Fuentes and Clavicular, after Clavicular’s glow up, have started to collab and still are. Fuentes is about my age, born in 1998. He is a Gen Z, white-nationalist political commentator who first got big around 2019. He has a group—they’re called the Groypers, after a version of the Pepe meme that’s sort of an unappealing toad. And his main platform now is: He does these livestreams where he takes questions; he kind of impersonates a news anchor, and he’s always drilling down on these, like, Steve Bannon–esque points. But even a bit more like explicit and further out. And he kind of got to the scene in 2019, by starting this Groyper war against Charlie Kirk and Turning Point USA—where Kirk would go around campuses and do these events, have people asking questions, do these debate bro–type things. And Fuentes and his Groypers would come into the audience and then ask these questions that would push Kirk to take two steps further to the right than he already was: to endorse something blatantly anti-Semitic or blatantly racist, when Kirk might’ve just been doing the dog whistle before. And so that’s kind of how he soared into prominence as like the furthest stretch of the alt-right. And now, post–Charlie Kirk’s death, Fuentes sort of got mentioned a bunch more. And his stream has kind of been continuing all these years, and now he’s kind of the big bad boy of the online right.

Warzel: Yeah, he went on with Tucker Carlson. He’s sort of, he’s taken his shots with other people. And it’s just been sort of, on the right, like—there was a big blowup with the Heritage Foundation and whether or not to, you know, basically attack Tucker Carlson for having Nick Fuentes on. And this idea that the Heritage Foundation wasn’t going to weigh in. And it was this feeling that Fuentes is always pushing just what he was doing, in the quote unquote “Groyper war” with Kirk, right? He’s always trying to push, even with his presence. People have to disavow or not disavow him. And he does have this meaningful constituency of Groypers. What do Groypers believe? Do they believe anything?

Walker: Good question. I think within the Groypers, there’s probably a lot of diversity of belief. But I think they can kind of be understood as a subset of the alt-right, kind of the more radical edge of it. I think that most of the—not to generalize—but most of the animosity that they feel is probably channeled toward minorities, toward Jewish people, but also toward the center-right: like the Charlie Kirks of the world, kind of the establishment. Most of their viral clout has been gotten by Fuentes being the dude that these people say, “That’s too much; this guy’s too crazy.” And then all of the most crazy, disaffected young people will say, “Oh, really? The guy who’s too edgy for Charlie Kirk? That’s right for me.” And so I think they’re just kind of into pushing that edge.

And Fuentes himself has a bit of like a white-nationalist type. You know, solidarity politics in a way. It’s hard to even call it solidarity of, you know, saying to young white men or to others of like, This is your group; go with this; oppose everybody else. And so, to the extent that they do believe something, it’s kind of just like being racist. And I think one thing you really start to notice when you spend time in the fever swamp, and you study things like green-text stories on 4chan, or just these various memes, is: I think a lot of these men who are into Fuentes are marginalized, for lack of a better word. They’re disabled; they’re neurodivergent; they come from a poor background; they come from a familial-abuse background. And a lot of the content is about that. It’s about that kind of—

Warzel: So that’s what they’re confessing in those threads, you mean? Like, you’re not surmising this? This is actually what they’re saying in their threads.

Walker: Yeah. I mean, in as many words, yeah. I mean, they’re posting threads about, you know, Can’t get a job. I’m a drain on my family. My mom hates me, you know. Can’t get with girls, you know. I’m ugly. I’m fat. I can’t figure anything out. Like, it’s guys who are stuck in that situation. And not everybody who’s in that situation or a situation like it makes that choice, so they should be held responsible. But I think one thing to understand about it is: They choose the Groyper Toad as their emblem. You know, that’s not a jackbooted, strong character. That’s a chubby, off-putting, gross toad. And so, I think a lot of what that movement does—the service it provides—is it allows them to feel, you know, accepted in this freak brotherhood. Where all you have to say to have this sort of all-encompassing, you know, ever-loving group is: You just say the slur. And then you’re on the other side of that Rubicon. It’s like a gang. It’s that kind of initiation ritual. And it seems to solve these people’s problems sometimes. But I think it always leads down very destructive paths.

Warzel: This is interesting too, then, in the convergence, right? Because you have someone like Fuentes. You have a group of these people; obviously not all of them are like, you know, feel like they are horribly marginalized. Some of them are just, you know, edgelords or people who are just, you know, out-and-out, proud racists and love to engage with other racists. But there is this level of disaffected feeling.

And then you have the looks-maxxing community, right? Which is also—there is potentially just as much of a home for disaffected people there, or people who feel, you know, I’m ugly or I’m a drain or I’m whatever and want to optimize themselves in this way, or find that to be really appealing. So this brings us to this video that came out a couple of weeks ago that went pretty viral on a lot of my different feeds—mostly with a lot of people feeling this was like the end times. But it was a meeting of Clavicular [with] the manosphere influencer who I believe has been indicted in different countries for sex trafficking, Andrew Tate, and Nick Fuentes, among others. There’s a few other characters there who we don’t need to get into. They’re at a club in Miami. They are goofing around, seemingly having a good time, and I guess goad somebody in the club to put on the Kanye—or Ye, as he’s known now—song “Heil Hitler.” Which is its own provocation. And the idea is that they’re all dancing to it, but that the whole club is dancing to it. And it’s this sort of moment of total trolling—but also this like out-and-out-proud racism that everyone around, in that clip, seems to be totally okay with in that moment. And I think watching that, so many people felt like, What the hell is happening? And so, I would ask: What the hell happened there?

Walker: Yeah; it’s horrifying. And they’re blasting that song in the rented limo going to the club beforehand.

Walker: So that was, I think, always the plan. And Kanye, Ye, I think is like the representative artist for some of these guys. Because, you know, the verses of that song before the horrible chorus are about how he can’t see his kids anymore, and he’s a drug addict and a washout and a sleazebag and all this stuff. And I think that they definitely staged this moment in the club for maximum shock value—so that it goes across people’s feeds. And I think there’s sort of two sides to it. The first is that, you know, if you transgress in that way, and you get people outraged and shocked, that’s the only play these guys have ever done.

You know, from Gamergate to today, from 2016 to today, they’ve just always pushed the boundary. And then been rewarded with clicks and attention, even if there is pushback. Then I think the other side of it is just this sort of violent show, of like, “Oh, we can get away with it.” Right? Like, this is the one thing that liberals would say you can’t get away with. And just by doing that—having the video go everywhere on X—they’ve said, “Hey, we got away with it.” And they’ve done this summit of all these guys. And Clavicular’s status there is interesting, because he’s the newest one, and he’s the youngest one. And he’s the ringleader of it in a way.

Warzel: Before, and correct me if I’m wrong, but before they went to the club, I believe Nick Fuentes, this guy Sneako, and Clavicular sit down for this livestream, right? You said that this was, like, a very rich text, right, for someone who wanted to understand the differences between these people. You have Clavicular—who is younger, very young—and then you have Fuentes and Sneako, who are in their late 20s. That wouldn’t seem like a huge difference, but in these online-influencer worlds, it actually is. There’s so many cycles in between them of how to think about content, how to think about their politics.

You wrote that it seemed like, in the stream—which I just have to say to people who might not seek this out on their own, it’s so lame. Like, it is just so deeply lame. These guys are like pulling up computer chairs, wearing suits, nice clothes. It’s like, people walking around in the background; they’re in a living room, and they’re just very not charismatic. Sometimes Fuentes comes off on his own show as very charismatic. Here, he’s just kind of hunched in a chair, very uncharismatic, having these conversations that seem sort of brain dead, honestly. Like, they’re racist and whatever, but also just kind of not animated, or very even interested at all. But you write that Fuentes is interested in this stream, or it seems, about describing his political project around this white identity—that there’s this coherence, almost, to what he wants to do. How he wants to sort of take conservatism from the mantle of the Boomers and move into something else. And you write that Clavicular seemed totally uninterested in that. And tell me a little bit about that, and the differences that you saw between someone, you know, sort of older Gen Z and younger Gen Z in that sense.

Walker: Yeah, that was—I mean, it’s a horrible stream to watch. I kind of just inflicted it on myself, I guess, because I have a professional—anthropological, sort of—interest in these spaces. And I think also, just on a personal level, being the age that I am—same age as Fuentes and Sneako—I think you just kind of grow up, and you see a lot of kids in your high school or whatever kind of get pulled down that path. In the same way you see kids get into drugs or something. And it ends up badly for them. And it’s always been this force, just like in the internet. So I think that’s part of the fascination. And where Fuentes is describing his political project, most concretely for me, it’s when he’s talking about getting this gold sponsorship that used to be, I think, Mark Levin’s, who’s kind of a Boomer conservative commentator. And Fuentes is very hung up on getting this sponsorship, because I think, for him, it would mean that he’s beaten the Boomers, and now he’s the mainstream of the conservative movement.

Warzel: This is like a “buy gold” thing, right? Sorry to interrupt.

Walker: Yeah, like a “buy gold” thing, like the classic, you know, alongside like survival-prep stuff that supports right-wing radio. There’s no reason for it to matter to Clavicular, but it still matters to Fuentes and to some extent to Sneako. And so, I think there’s a difference between kind of elder and younger Gen Z, in that for Clavicular—I mean, I’m sure he’s not a nice guy. I think he’s probably a racist. I think that someone who isn’t hateful wouldn’t do the things that he’s done. But he’s not like—

Warzel: He does seem to use the N-word quite a bit.

Walker: Yeah; exactly. But he’s not interested in remaking the state in the same way that Fuentes seems to be. He just seems to be interested in making himself as handsome as possible. In this totally, I guess you could say, like, Randian, self-interested whatever. Whereas Fuentes has some desire to be seen by the institutions, or to be seen beating the institutions. For Clavicular, it’s irrelevant from the jump.

Warzel: Yeah, you described it as “the exchange corresponding to the overall idea of an algorithmic ideology, replacing an institutional ideology.” That is really interesting to me. The idea that someone like Fuentes, whom we would think of as extremely online and using an online movement to some effect—obviously, attention hijacking, growing an audience, etc., still having institutional desires. Right? Still wanting some kind of political power. Whereas Clavicular seems to only want … like, he rejects institutions almost fully. Right? In his sort of incoherent, you know, left-right politics or whatever. But also in the idea that he really only cares about the algorithm.

Walker: Yeah; he only cares about that cold logic of, like, algorithm. How many views can you get for saying this or doing this? You know, how many aura points can you get for mutilating your face in this way? There’s just this total lack of belief in anything that is social, anything that is, you know, institutional. Which, to me, it translates as kind of an anti-politics. But what I sort of meant by ideology—and this is maybe something I do with my content, a little tongue in cheek, and then maybe it starts to become sincere—is, you look at these guys, and you look at this boring, horrible stream as a rich text. And I think what you can sometimes extract from it is: These are people who have this set of distorted values about the world but that have somehow found visibility and attention. And why, exactly, is that? Their very existence is proof of something not working.

And so, in a way, their project is to exist, to be seen, to be popular. That’s why he’s going to say the N-word on stream. That’s why he’s going to read the humiliating text from his father on stream. It’s a total commitment to that project. Because I think his existence just sort of proves that the gatekeepers are gone.

It kind of proves that these weird, sleazebag, disaffected, angry young men—that there’s nothing holding them back. The fact that Clavicular is there is proof that you’ve won. And I think Fuentes, being a little bit older, had this formative experience of the gatekeeper still being there. He got famous by being the guy that was too radical for Charlie Kirk. And so, he needs there to be a Charlie Kirk there. Or some figure like that. And I think Clavicular doesn’t have that need. Which I think testifies to kind of the moment we’re in, and that they’re able to self-sustain just by being this beast of the algorithm.

Warzel: You write—and I thought this observation was really clarifying—that this is nihilism by default. That Clavicular is nihilism by default. And the elder Zoomer, maybe, the Fuentes ideology, is a little bit of a nihilism by disillusionment. And I think that that is really interesting, because one way that I look at the internet, throughout generations of it, is like: The culture’s always layering stuff on top and absorbing the thing that came before it, right? Everything’s a little more of an abstraction, right? Like, the Groyper is an abstraction of the Pepe meme, which was its own abstraction of a thing from, you know, a cartoonist that got popular on 4chan. These things layer on top of each other.

And it’s interesting to think of the nihilism being layered on top, to the point where you get these people who are just like—they don’t know why they have this “lol, nothing matters” disaffected feeling. It’s just sort of like what they saw on the internet from this community and they’re just adopting it. That’s kind of—that’s terrifying, man.

Walker: Yeah. And, I mean, it’s the difference between resenting the idea of adult supervision, I guess, because you think you’re oppositional, or better than the adult. And then the feeling of there just having never been an adult in the room. You know, like I think someone like Clavicular, since the time he was conscious, you know, Donald Trump has been the central figure in American politics.

I think that was even something Clinton said in 2016—that it’s going to be a generation of people raised watching someone who breaks every rule, gets away with everything, and gets wildly rewarded for it. And there’s tons of other figures in American and global life who are not Trump who exhibit that kind of behavior as well. But I think it’s just years and years of that there’s not even any juice to be had in opposing the establishment, because the establishment is so absent from your life, honestly.

Warzel: Yeah; I heard—this is a slight tangent, but somebody who is part of Gen Z was saying to me: The reason why the “democracy dies in darkness” stuff doesn’t resonate with us is because Trump’s been around since the very beginning of this. He’s the only thing I know about American politics, from my own experience. What are you talking about? What is a functional feeling there, right?

And I think that that is a really interesting piece of, you know—if we’re describing the water that a lot of people are swimming in, especially like a much, much younger generation. That dysfunction, that nihilism, doesn’t not feel the same way. But also that the appeal to institutions, or the appeal to, you know, norms or civic virtues or values or whatever—liberalism even—that it’s not on the radar, almost. And that is concerning, I guess.

Walker: Yeah. It’s not even opposed, necessarily. It’s just not legible. And I think it’s important to point out, too, that the majority of Gen Z people are not nihilistic looks-maxxers who want to burn down civilization. It’s just: Some people kind of make that choice, or get drawn to it. But I think there is just overall a sense of the old coordinates—of whatever the old order does—have just been gone for so long.

Warzel: Well, and this is where I’ll—I’m glad you brought that up. This is where I want to try to push back a little on all of this, right? And get a sense of, I would say first off: Can you describe the size of all of this? Because, like you say, it’s not everyone. It is its own., Like, there’s a strange thing that’s happened, where the fringe has become not the fringe anymore. And yet, it still obviously is part of a fringe of some kind of thing. It’s a little hard to understand. But, like: How popular are these guys? How do you think about it? How do you quantify it?

Walker: So, I mean, you could look at subscriber counts and stuff. And my impression is—forgive me if I don’t, viewers can look this up at home—I think Fuentes has around 100K on his Telegram channel, which is a bit more of a closed, intimate social media. Actually more used overseas than in the U.S., I think. But there’s sort of two ways to measure it. I think it’s like you can go for raw overall count. In which case, of course, Mr. Beast is bigger; mainstream influencers are bigger. They have more people. But then there’s the sense of like, as an influencer, you probably would rather have 100 paying subscribers vs. like 100,000 people who will just like your video.

And so, I think some of what allows these fringe figures to throw a disproportionate weight around on the online ecosystem is that once they have a fan, they have a zealous follower. They have a devotee. You know, it’s so radical, it’s so extreme, to get to this position where you’re gonna post and say “I’m a fan of Nick Fuentes.” Like, that guy’s taking up a lot of your time and a lot of your life—in a way that’s someone who’s a fan of a more mainstream creator, they probably aren’t. And we saw the same phenomenon with 4chan: pretty small platform in terms of user base, but has this disproportionate influence on internet culture because of how committed and fiendish they all are. And so, I think these guys are definitely someone that most young people will have heard of. They’re definitely on their radar. Which is where they want to be. But I don’t think they’re at all the dominant influence on people. They’re an option on the menu, which is troubling, but they’re not the main course, maybe.

Warzel: My overarching question here though, I think, is: How much should we be paying attention to these guys? And I know that’s sort of impossible to ask. But there is a sense—I’ve gone so back and forth on this in my own coverage, in my own thoughts with all these different people—where you’re like: You know what? This guy is an out-and-out horrible racist-type person. There’s just no reason to give this any oxygen. And then you see the audience continue to grow, the specter continue to grow.

Then in the right-wing-media ecosystem, they’re platformed by just a big-enough person, say, Tucker Carlson and Fuentes. And then it’s like, The New York Times is writing about him every day, and it’s a person who has to be dealt with now. And then it doesn’t matter whether you think there’s enough oxygen, or you should give them oxygen or not.

How do you think about paying attention to these guys as a culture and a society? Because it’s lame. Like it feels like in a just society, it’d be like, These guys are absolute freaks. We don’t need … like, this is not worth anyone’s time. And yet, that’s not happening.

Walker: Yeah. I think that’s always been kind of, as you point out, the concern with kind of internet-culture journalism and covering these people. Because the thing they love most in the world is, you know, The Atlantic talking about them. Like, that’s the goal in a way, or one of the goals. But I think they’re worth paying attention to, because I think we still often make this distinction between right-wing-media ecosystem and the administration. But it’s the same thing. The DHS account; the kinds of memes they’re posting. The fact that after Kirk died, J. D. Vance went and took that podcasting chair. These guys—in terms of clout, in terms of the way they speak to the base, in terms of the way they inform policy—Ted Cruz sits down with Tucker Carlson.

Tucker Carlson is the more powerful figure there in terms of the right wing. So I think it’s crucial to pay attention to them if we kind of want to understand the way that this administration is consolidating power and thinking about its place in the world. And I think from another angle, one thing you see a lot when you look at online niches is that you sort of have these big whales, and then there’s other creators. There’s like a big delta, I guess, between the No. 1 and then like the No. 6. And I think with the right-wing ecosystem, the big whale is Trump. And then there’s sort of different flavors of that, and all of them collaborate and sort of help each other and then repost and work off of the big guy.

And so I think understanding that, and paying attention to it, sort of tells us more about this moment and that administration than a lot of kind of the analyses that are like, you know, Look what they’re doing to the courts, or Look at this latest order. Let’s think about what’s the reason for the tariffs on XYZ country. You know, the reason for the tariffs is the same reason Clavicular hits his face with a hammer. It’s to get attention. It’s to mobilize the base, it’s to prove a point that there’s no rules anymore. And so, I think that the structure of these radical communities tell us something about what the government itself is doing.

Because the last point that I always sort of try to make—thinking about it generationally—is like John Ganz, the writer, makes this point of Groyperfication within the government. A lot of these young conservative staffers—guys who are like 35 now—10, 15 years ago, they were the kids on 4chan. And that’s the person who’s been empowered. That’s the milieu that’s coming out of. And I think that’s part of why I really pay attention to this. It’s that I find that, you know, it helps to sort of know what’s going on and what’s driving it at a deeper level.

Warzel: Where do you think this goes? Because, again, when we think about the layer cake of nihilism, so to speak—you’ve written about some of these guys that they burn so bright with their trolling and one-upsmanship and content-first mentality that it’s not sustaining, right? They will eventually probably immolate in some way, on a creator level. But at the same time, the culture nudges forward, right? It becomes a little more extreme. Even if those stars in their galaxy kind of burn out.

Walker: I think it goes to death. Both for them personally, and then probably for social media, the internet, the country. There’s no image of the future. It’s just this race to the bottom. Break every taboo, break every rule, destroy your body.

Walker: Like literally, yeah. If you sort of agree with the analysts who kind of see this moment as fascist in one way or another, I think that’s where fascism leads you. It’s a form of death worship. And I think it’s also, to the extent that what the looks-maxxers do—like, part of why that interested me is that it feels so poetically kind of apt to describe the whole thing as that You destroy your body; you destroy your life chances for the sake of an online public that really doesn’t care about you. Because the incentives are always for them to double down, always for them to do more. The only place it ends is with their self-destruction.

And the question is whether the rest of us go along with that. And I think that in many ways—insofar as the first thing they destroyed was the institutions, and now they’re trying to destroy the rest of us and themselves—it’s like, Where do we stop it? Where do we detach from that project? And I think it’s something that … I don’t know what I’m saying. I’m an internet-culture analyst. I don’t know about national politics, in the end. But it’s like: We just need to find another option. And I think it’s important to tell young people that this project ends in death. This is a guy who’s destroying his life for a livestream. And they’re destroying the country for clicks.

Warzel: I think that’s a great place to leave it. A depressing place to leave it. But also, I would just say—as someone who has covered this stuff for getting close to two decades, and always being like, “This internet-culture stuff, it’s not politics,” and then every year being like, “It’s kind of politics.” So I wouldn’t sell yourself supremely short. We’re not geopolitical analysts, but this stuff has bled into the highest levels of, at least, American politics right now. So I think the perspective is worthy. Aidan Walker, thank you for coming on Galaxy Brain.

            <h2>The Evangelicals Who See Trump’s Viciousness As a Virtue</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/evangelicals-trump-national-prayer-breakfast/685908/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The National Prayer Breakfast was founded in 1953, when President Dwight Eisenhower accepted an invitation to join members of Congress to break bread together. Every president since has participated, regardless of party or religious persuasion. It offers an opportunity, according to its organizers, for political leaders to gather and pray collectively for our nation “in the spirit of love and reconciliation as Jesus of Nazareth taught 2,000 years ago.”  Donald Trump never got that memo—or, if he did, he’s found ways to ignore it.  In a rambling, 75-minute speech at the Prayer Breakfast yesterday, we saw the quintessential Trump. His comments were grievance-filled, narcissistic, conspiratorial, factually false, divisive, and insulting. He referred to his critics as “lunatics.” He engaged in projection, comparing them to “dictators” and “the gestapo.” He labeled Republican Representative Thomas Massie a “moron” because he won’t cast legislative votes the way Trump wants. Joe Biden is “Crooked Joe,” while Jacob Frey is “the horrible fake mayor” of Minneapolis. Trump praised El Salvador’s authoritarian President Nayib Bukele—Bukele has referred to himself as “the world’s coolest dictator”—for his “very strong prisons.” (The prison that Trump celebrates, Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, known as CECOT, is notorious for its cruel and inhumane conditions.) Trump emphasized that Bukele—who also spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast—is “one of my favorite people.”

Trump took credit for churches “coming back stronger than ever” and for religion being “hotter than ever.” He claimed he has “done more for religion than any other president”—apparently, before the age of Trump, Christians couldn’t say “Merry Christmas” in public—and argued that his predecessors in the White House “bailed out” on religion. “I don’t know how a person of faith can vote for a Democrat. I really don’t,” he said, adding, “They cheat.”

The spirit of love and reconciliation that Jesus of Nazareth taught 2,000 years ago was not particularly evident in the words of the president. Of course, it never has been. No matter. The audience of some 3,500—the great majority of whom undoubtedly claim to be followers of Jesus—responded to Trump’s remarks with a standing ovation.

It is testimony to the marketing genius of Donald Trump that he never sold himself to Christians as one of them—pious, devoted, merciful, forgiving, irenic, biblically literate, a faithful husband and father, a man of high moral standards. Instead, he sold himself as their protector. He didn’t hide his cruelty or his belief that the ends justify the means; doing so would have been impossible for him because they are central features of his personality. So he did the opposite: He presented himself to Christians as a fierce, even ruthless, warrior on their behalf. It worked. He built a huge, loyal, fanatical following.  At the National Prayer Breakfast, Trump recounted comments made about him by Robert Jeffress, the senior pastor of the First Baptist Church in Dallas and a stalwart Trump ally for a decade.

Peter Wehner: MAGA Jesus is not the real Jesus

According to Trump, the case Jeffress made on his behalf in 2016 went like this: “He may not have ever read the Bible, but he will be a much stronger messenger for us.” It was Jeffress who said at the time, “I want the meanest, toughest SOB I can find to protect this nation.”  Jerry Falwell Jr., then the president of Liberty University, put it this way in a 2018 tweet: “Conservatives & Christians need to stop electing ‘nice guys’. They might make great Christian leaders but the US needs street fighters like @realDonaldTrump at every level of government b/c the liberal fascists Dems are playing for keeps & many Repub leaders are a bunch of wimps!”  Tony Perkins, an ordained Southern Baptist minister and the president of the Family Research Council, a prominent evangelical activist group, admitted in 2018 that he and other evangelicals gave Trump a “mulligan” on his multiple affairs and hush-money payments to a porn star for a simple reason: Evangelicals “were tired of being kicked around by Barack Obama and his leftists. And I think they are finally glad that there’s somebody on the playground that is willing to punch the bully.” When asked what happened to turning the other cheek, Perkins replied, “You know, you only have two cheeks. Look, Christianity is not all about being a welcome mat which people can just stomp their feet on.”  They thrill to watch Trump savage his critics, and their devotion grows with every dehumanizing word, with every merciless act.

If Henry VIII earned the title “Defender of the Faith,” why not Donald Trump?  It is odd to see the very same evangelicals who claim the Bible is inerrant and who criticize fellow Christians about matters such as ordaining women—on the grounds that they are being unfaithful to what Paul wrote in one of his Epistles, an interpretation that many biblical scholars dispute—dismiss Jesus’s most famous sermon. For these Christians, the teachings of the son of God take a back seat to the pronouncements of the king of Mar-a-Lago.  Much of today’s evangelical world sees Trump’s viciousness not as a vice but as a virtue, so long as it is employed against those they perceive as their enemies, against those whom they resent and for whom they have a seething hatred. Unless you’ve spent time in the evangelical world, fully appreciating the level of antipathy that exists toward Democrats and progressives is difficult. The only thing that exceeds it is the loathing reserved for the Christians and conservatives who broke with Trump because their commitment to their faith, and to cherished moral truths, required them to speak out against him.

What i am describing isn’t true of all Christians, thankfully. Some have found the cumulative effect of Trump’s assault on Christian ethics too much. The Catholic Church and its American pope, Leo XIV, are speaking out prudentially but forcefully against the actions of the Trump administration. Mainline denominations, including the United Methodists, are stepping up. My friend Mark Labberton, a former president of Fuller Theological Seminary and a Presbyterian (PCUSA) pastor, traveled to Minneapolis to express solidarity with the people of that city after an ICE agent killed Renee Good. He joined many others in peaceful protests in subzero temperatures. Other pastors and theologians I respect, several of whom were formative in my journey of faith, signed a statement titled “Christ Alone: A Call to Faithful Resistance.” It nowhere mentions the president or his party, but it does take a prophetic stance “in a time of fear and capitulation in both the Church and in our civic life.”

From the January/February 2024 Issue: My father, my faith, and Donald Trump

“In this moment we specifically call on the Church and peoples across the political spectrum to recognize the clear and present danger of rising authoritarian rule to all of us, especially the most vulnerable,” the statement says. “We commit ourselves to resisting cruel or oppressive means of control and to standing in solidarity with the oppressed, the marginalized, and the silenced.”

Even among evangelicals, support for Trump is hardly universal, and many pastors I know are quite disturbed by the damage he and his administration are doing. Yet they know full well that many within their congregations voted for Trump and still align themselves with the Republican Party. These ministers are therefore hesitant to speak out not only from the pulpit but in any capacity. They want to keep their head down.  That’s understandable. The best pastors I know are instinctively wary about speaking out politically; that’s not why they got into ministry in the first place. They don’t feel that it’s their job to offer political commentary, nor do many of them feel especially equipped to do so. They also realize that many people go to church seeking a safe haven from politics. They believe, too, and with some justification, that to take a stand, even with great care, might well split a congregation.

Evangelical denominations and pastors, though, even those who are not deeply immersed in politics, are generally willing to speak out on culture-war issues that have political and sometimes legislative implications. I’ve seen this happen many times over the years.

So the reluctance to take a prophetic stance in the realm of politics and culture is less a principled unwillingness than a selective one. Ministers, like most of the rest of us, are likely to wade into controversial waters only when it’s safe—in their case, when there is overwhelming agreement within a congregation on a set of issues. They speak out when the response from those in the pews is a resounding “Amen!” rather than even a handful of voices saying, “Oh no you don’t!”

I don’t pretend these are easy matters for pastors to face. A minister of a conservative congregation might tell himself that the downside to speaking out against the sins of the authoritarian right, even judiciously and without partisan rancor, is too costly. They may fear that their ministry will be damaged, that offended parishioners will tune them out, and that they will gain nothing concrete.

But aren’t prophets esteemed precisely for their willingness to tell difficult truths to the people of God? For being steadfast in the face of fierce criticism; for denouncing social injustice and idolatry, including political idolatry, when it’s unfashionable to do so; for issuing warnings when others fall silent; and for calling people to repentance during times of moral blindness?

Non-maga evangelical pastors are going to face a set of difficult questions during the next three years: Under what conditions, if any, are you willing to speak out when a president and his administration repeatedly violate Christian ethics? Will you stay silent even when acts of cruelty, lawlessness, and injustice aren’t the exception but the norm? How much more indecency do you need to see before you act?

My colleague Jonathan Rauch, an eminently fair-minded, reasonable, and wise writer, recently explained why, after heretofore avoiding the term, he has come around to the belief that Donald Trump’s governing style qualifies as fascist.

Even if you disagree with Rauch’s conclusion, it’s still worth wrestling with his catalog of the president’s misdeeds, broken into 18 categories. And the case Rauch makes—that although America is not a fascist country, it has a fascist president—will almost certainly become stronger over time.

At some point, then, it may become nearly impossible for pastors who are not fully on board with MAGA to look away, to stall for more time, to let others do the heavy lifting, or to tell themselves that things aren’t so bad, that silence is golden. A healthy church culture, like a healthy family culture, brings things into the open. It doesn’t avoid or close off conversations.

Labberton, the Presbyterian pastor, once told me that the more highly contentious an issue is, the more likely he is to want to discuss it with his congregation in a way that is honest, open, and biblically informed. Of course, there will be a diversity of opinions. That’s not something to run from; it’s something to learn from.

“Our reality is sufficiently complex that we need to invite one another along for the journey,” Labberton said. We need to invite one another into respectful conversations. “Together we need to instigate a long journey into God’s mercy and justice.” Pastors, and the congregations they lead, have to hope that we can summon the courage to go where God’s mercy and justice lead us.

“Seldom, if ever, do I pause to answer criticism of my work and ideas,” Martin Luther King Jr. wrote. But when a group of white Alabama clergymen declared him an outside agitator whose efforts were “unwise and untimely,” he decided to respond. The result was “Letter From Birmingham Jail,” one of the most important documents in U.S. history.

This letter, like all of King’s greatest works, cannot be understood apart from his Christian faith. Faith shaped his views on ethics and human dignity. It also gave him the courage to create tension in the cause of justice. “I am grateful to God that, through the influence of the Negro church, the way of nonviolence became an integral part of our struggle,” he wrote.

The white pastors in Birmingham had a case to make. They didn’t want what they called “days of new hope” in Birmingham to be undone by “extreme measures” that would cause divisions. King, one of America’s great prophets, saw things differently. He wept over the laxity of the Church and reminded it of its high calling—not to be the master or the servant of the state, but rather its conscience.

From the King issue: Martin Luther King Jr.’s ‘Letter From Birmingham Jail’

I imagine that all of the white pastors I know think that if they had been a minister at that time—especially if they were a minister of churches that were made up of white segregationists—they would have found a way to speak up rather than be silent, would have stood with King instead of those who urged caution in the name of unity.

The question now comes again in our time: What does it mean for the Church to be the conscience of the state?</div>

At least one fundamental human trait persists in the smartphone era: People seem to love a challenge. The internet teems with viral competitions, gamified health apps, and “life-maxxing” exercises of many kinds. Even those who resist the lure of screens—by, for instance, reading books—are frequently doing so with a kind of competitive zeal. A University of Pennsylvania professor has built a strict, rules-based classroom cult around reading. And this week in The Atlantic, Walt Hunter, who teaches English at Case Western Reserve University, wrote about his own attempt to buck alarming literacy trends by asking his students to read entire books.

First, here are four stories from The Atlantic’s Books section:

Hunter discovered that if you recalibrate a course to prioritize “developing a relationship” with authors and books (he eased up on writing assignments, for example), students will meet the challenge. After he swapped out short excerpts for full texts, his students “were reading everything, or most of it.” They proved it by identifying obscure passages without notes (and, because he quizzed them in the classroom, there wasn’t a chatbot within reach). Even more important, “they were experiencing life in a way that was not easy outside the class.” They were putting effort and time into a mental activity that scrolling on their phone couldn’t match.

This is a feel-mostly-good story, but how useful is Hunter’s experiment for those of us who don’t have anything except our own willpower standing between us and the algorithms? Such readers might find value in another Atlantic article this week, in which Bekah Waalkes recommends books that can be read between errands. Waalkes suggests an attitude shift that doesn’t force you to choose between setting strict reading goals and giving up altogether. “All you need,” she writes, “is a willingness to dedicate a few minutes a day, and maybe a few new habits.”

Hunter also describes reading as a feat of adult self-motivation. “You are not word-maxxing or optimizing information for efficiency,” he writes. “You are engaged in a singular practice, one with its own primary justification.” I like the word “practice,” because reading requires it, just like many other things grown-ups find fulfilling. We schedule activities—travel, socializing, cooking, exercise—so we can achieve everything we should do and everything we want to do (two categories that ideally overlap). With time, we get better at these things—and at finding a place for them in our life. So here’s my advice, if you need it: Schedule some reading time, wherever and whenever you can. Pick up one of Waalkes’s recommended books, or whatever you like. Set a timer, dive in, and find out what you&#39;re made of.

What I learned when I finally started assigning the hard reading again.

Like Austen’s other novels, Northanger Abbey contains a marriage plot. But it’s set apart from the rest of her work by a long, satirical section sending up gothic fiction and its fans. The book’s heroine, Catherine Morland, is an avid reader of the popular novels of the day, and has a specific fondness for Ann Radcliffe’s real-life 1794 best seller, The Mysteries of Udolpho, a tale of ghostly figures and hidden manuscripts. Catherine views herself as the hero of a similar story, and when she goes to the country house of a family she has befriended (the titular Northanger Abbey), she reinvents herself as the protagonist of a mystery. Austen is the master of depicting small faux pas, and Catherine commits many—she forces open cabinets in search of creepy documents; she begins to suspect that the family patriarch has murdered his wife. The chronic daydreamer can easily identify with Catherine’s near-delusional longing for something to happen beyond the courtships and evenings around the pianoforte that seem to make up the better part of her future.

📚 Frog: and Other Essays, by Anne Fadiman

📚 The Mixed Marriage Project, by Dorothy Roberts

With this week’s announcement of massive cuts at The Washington Post, the paper’s Book World supplement earned a dismal distinction: It may be the only newspaper book-review section to have been killed twice. The first time was in 2009, when papers across the country were slashing books coverage in an attempt to stave off budgetary apocalypse. So when the Post relaunched Book World in 2022, readers and writers reacted with the same mixture of amazement and trepidation inspired by the dinosaurs at Jurassic Park. The rebirth of a dead species was wonderful to see, but how would it end?

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/2026/02/this-is-where-the-serpent-lives-daniyal-mueenuddin-review/685884/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Books about masters and servants tend to come with an inborn flaw: They are written largely by those from the moneyed class, individuals who have seen the poor from above and must now, in their writing, illuminate their lives from within. This gap can sometimes be breached through immersive journalism of the kind championed by George Orwell in Down and Out in Paris and London or Barbara Ehrenreich in Nickel and Dimed. But such instances are rare, and even harder to achieve in countries like India or Pakistan—places with large domestic-worker populations where socioeconomic differences are so harshly inscribed that one can, more often than not, immediately infer a person’s status from their mannerisms and language.

This is what makes the work of the Pakistani American writer Daniyal Mueenuddin so special and surprising. Mueenuddin is a U.S.-educated descendant of a Pakistani feudal family; he spent years running an estate in rural Punjab. In his prize-winning fiction, though, he is somehow able to enter the lives of the servant class with the same gentleness and attention that he lavishes on the ultrarich. The concerns of drivers, retainers, maids, and cooks exist alongside the romantic problems of Paris-hopping Pakistanis with cocaine addictions in his justly acclaimed debut collection, In Other Rooms, Other Wonders, from 2009. Small details shine. Reading about, say, the family life of Nawabdin, an electrician “who flourished on a signature ability, a technique for cheating the electric company by slowing down the revolutions of electric meters,” one wonders: How does he know so much? How does he re-create the lives of those immured within a feudal system without reinforcing his own position through condescending, morose social realism?

Mueenuddin has cited the author Ivan Turgenev—himself an estate owner who captured the lives of both serfs and aristocrats in 19th-century Russia—as one of his inspirations. Turgenev, hampered by czarist censorship, did not write polemics about suffering serfs but instead created hyperrealist, idiosyncratic slices of life that would later inspire Ernest Hemingway. Turgenev’s stories, especially his 1852 collection, A Sportsman’s Notebook, indirectly led to the end of serfdom by humanizing the peasantry for Czar Alexander II. In short, Turgenev was the rare estate owner who listened.

Mueenuddin does the same in his latest work, This Is Where the Serpent Lives. His first book in 17 years and his debut novel, it is a feast of sustained noticing, despite an overarching flaw. One of the main strands in Serpent is based, according to an interview with The New Yorker, on the life of a swashbuckling driver employed for years by Mueenuddin’s father. His fictional driver, Yazid, is the moral center of the novel, described as “an ambling bear” with huge sideburns “moving to his own North.” As a young orphan, Yazid was a cook’s apprentice who emulated the rich schoolboys he served, intending to slowly insinuate himself into their class—only to be thwarted by a jealous, older maidservant.

Mueenuddin’s novel essentially comprises four novella-like storylines about grand landowning families and their employees in Pakistan from the 1950s to the present. Besides Yazid’s story, two short narratives follow reluctant feudal potentates. A final story, which takes up the majority of the novel, focuses on Yazid’s much younger protégé, Saqib, a servant boy of “fine sensibility and intelligence” who also seeks to join the upper class.

Mueenuddin’s novel suggests that there are moral costs to both the rich and the poor for living in a system that allows such little mobility. Wealthy characters verge on making reforms, then pull back at the slightest complication. In the process, they remain stuck within their “ordered purposeless” lives, as Mueenuddin wrote in his collection. The servants, meanwhile, who are “more fed than paid,” recognize that only the most brazen cheating and corruption can break them out of their squalid circumstances—the sort of corruption, of course, that has enabled the elite to thrive in a country where meaningful land reform never occurred and ancient inequalities persist. A novelist depicting both these classes must find an elegant way to integrate stories of inherited ennui and desperate striving. If Mueeneddin doesn’t entirely succeed, this is in part because the unyielding feudal order of Pakistan means that the lives of servants and masters rarely intersect in meaningful ways.

Saqib’s story captures the dilemma of the aspirant even more fiercely than Yazid’s does. “Respectful but not servile,” Saqib enters the good graces of his mistress, Shahnaz Atar, an intelligent woman who, “like most Lahori women of her class,” Mueenuddin writes, “battled constantly to find and train and keep household servants.” Saqib is entrusted with more and more responsibility as he grows up, eventually setting up an ambitious cucumber-farming scheme on the Atars’ estate in rural Punjab. He figures that it will take one careful, major act of corruption to finally ascend to the elite: “Each untrue mark that he inscribed” in the account books would be, Mueenuddin writes, “another step in his emancipation.” Alas, it is this choice that gets him into trouble and causes the fine web of relationships around him to crumble, throwing him violently back to his origins as the mere son of a gardener.

As in his story collection, Mueenuddin succeeds here in painting Yazid and Saqib and a host of secondary characters on the social ladder as distinct individuals, down to their faces and habits and family lives. He also shows how, at this late stage of history—in which Chinese smartphones, Western porn, and Facebook “confettied all over” the populace—the players are more aware than ever of their particular roles. Shahnaz, who grew up largely abroad, sees her position as mistress of an estate “through the lens of her Western politics and experience,” even studying the Russians, including Turgenev, to comprehend the complex social dynamics unfolding on her farm. Her husband’s cousin Rustom, who returns from America to take over his family’s land after his parents and grandfather die, finds himself tacitly okaying the beating of a worker from a rival estate. “What happened to college days and marching for justice in South Africa and in solidarity with ship workers in Poland?” he wonders. Meanwhile, Saqib carefully observes the behavior of his masters, the Atars, in order to model it—noting, for example, that they treat “eating as ceremony.”

What gives Mueenuddin a harder time is finding a structure that generates meaning from the interplay between the upper and the lower classes. His four stories follow no clear arc, flitting from one time period or character to another. In a short-story collection such as Other Rooms, the question of a narrative through line does not arise. You get discrete stories (or rooms!) about people from different classes, and the links between characters are subtle. In Serpent, however, Mueenuddin’s attempts to give the lives of Yazid and Saqib the same weight as those of the estate owners is strangely lopsided; his characters’ connections feel more circumstantial than inherent to the narrative. A 150-page novel about Saqib alone, for example, might have succeeded more than this brilliant but blowsy book, which had me writing, at page 100, “I still don’t know what this is about.”

Alas, this pitfall has as much to do with the structure of Pakistani society as it does with the structure of the book. Although masters and servants occupy the same spaces, their lives don’t apply equal pressure on each other. A servant could have a tumultuous inner life, but unless he commits a major crime (as in, for instance, Aravind Adiga’s Booker-winning The White Tiger), his emotions are unlikely to infect the master. The master, in turn, usually lives in another sphere—one of extramarital affairs and boozy parties and corrupt business deals. Shahnaz, for example, simply turns away bitterly and sadly after Saqib’s crime. One wishes Mueenuddin had devised a narrative in which she experienced a deeper, more complicated fallout—an exception to the rule.

And so lives that are disparate continue to feel wrenched apart. What we have here is not a novel at all but another linked short-story collection—if only Mueenuddin had named it as such! The lives of these characters are of superb interest. It is the form in which they live that is flawed.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On January 2, Raha Bahloulipour watched Sentimental Value, the latest film by the Norwegian auteur Joachim Trier, in her dorm room at the University of Tehran. It was the first film she viewed in 2026, and she liked it very much.

I know this because Raha was, like myself, an avid user of the film-cataloging app Letterboxd. With its tag system and diary, she jotted down when, where, and in what context she watched movies and what she thought of them. She started her diary in August 2023 and logged a total of 795 films during her 888 days on the app. She gave Trier’s film a heart, indicating that it was a favorite. She also tagged it with “protests,” to note that she’d watched it as anti-regime demonstrations rocked her country.

On January 8 and 9, the Iranian regime mowed down thousands of protesters all across the country. Raha was one of them, killed by a bullet that pierced her lungs.

A 24-year-old student of Italian literature at the University of Tehran, Raha took part in the movement from its beginning, on December 29. On that day, she shared her impressions in a Telegram post that mingled English, Italian, and her native Persian.

“What a Day! What a night!” she wrote. “These streets, these feelings,” she went on: “I want my life to be like this.” She ended her post with a call for a solidarity demonstration on campus.

Raha’s Telegram channel, like much of her life, was dedicated to arts and culture. In thousands of posts, starting in December 2019, she wrote about the music, novels, and films she loved. She also shared her love for the city of Tehran, and the pictures she took during her strolls around the metropolis. Had she belonged to another time or place, Raha might have preferred not to engage in politics. In August 2023, she quoted Joan Didion: “I’m not telling you to make the world better, because I don’t think that progress is necessarily part of the package. I’m just telling you to live in it.”

Gal Beckerman: The silence of the left on Iran

But for a woman in contemporary Iran, staying aloof from politics was impossible. Not only did the Islamic Republic restrict what she could wear, listen to, and watch, but its misrule had destroyed her standard of living. In February 2025, she wrote on X: “I am in the most penniless era of my life. I can barely afford one meal a day.” Like many of her compatriots, she could hardly imagine a future. Around the same time, she wrote: “I hate, hate, hate the Islamic Republic, and I am so tired of it.”

Iran’s previous major protest movement erupted in 2022, and Raha, then 20 years old, signaled her support on Telegram. She deeply identified with the movement’s slogan, “Women, life, freedom.” She might have thought of one of her favorite films, Bernardo Bertolucci’s The Dreamers (logged and hearted on Letterboxd in December 2024), about young bohemians drawn into student protests in Paris in 1968: Politics beckoned Raha as it beckons the film’s protagonists.

She took an even more active role in the protests that expanded this January. She posted regularly about them. On January 5, she explained the shift in her channel’s content, telling her followers that she’d understand if they weren’t comfortable with the political output and wanted to leave.

All the while, she never stopped watching movies. She tagged a total of 22 films with “protests,” viewing them throughout the stormy days of January. On January 4, she saw the British thriller V for Vendetta, centered on mass demonstrations against a dystopian fascist government. On the same day, she found time to watch Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson duke it out in Die My Love and to rewatch the feel-good musical La La Land. Her interest piqued by Trier, she saw his celebrated film The Worst Person in the World on January 6.

Little did she know that this would be the last new watch she would log on Letterboxd (she also logged a rewatch of Houman Seyyedi’s Sound and Fury later that day).

The regime had imposed a sweeping internet blackout. Raha was able to get online briefly on January 9. “I connected for only a moment,” she wrote on Telegram, “and I just want to write: Women, Life, Freedom. Forever.” This would be her last post and political testament.

Mahsa Alimardani: How doubt became a weapon in Iran

Iranians are mourning thousands of dead. The exact number eludes us: Nobody believes the regime’s count of 3,000; some in the opposition say that the real number might be 10 times as high. Even at the low end, this is the worst killing of protesters in Iranian history. And no matter what the ultimate tally, every individual is an aching, terrible loss.

Many of the fallen leave behind social-media profiles that open windows, however narrow, onto their lives, their aspirations, and why and for what they risked their lives.

Raha’s story has spread quickly in recent weeks in part because her Telegram posts express a joyful nature that is now gut-wrenching to behold. “I really am a big fan of life,” she wrote in November 2025. In a viral video from the university, she is heard practicing her Italian: “Forse perché mi piace vivere moltissimo quindi.” (“Maybe because my love for life knows no end.”) In one Telegram post, she quoted Matt Haig’s memoir Reasons to Stay Alive: “I want life. I want to read it and write it and feel it and live it.”

Raha’s exuberance was inextricably linked to cinema and literature. In January 2020, at 17 years old, Raha wrote: “Until the cinema can give you courage to go on, you must continue life even if it’s full of pain and suffering.” Four years later, she wrote: “I love cinema because I love humans. I love that humans live and exist.” A year later, she wrote: “I owe so much to cinema. Most of the courage I feel in myself is because of cinema. I just read a letter from Fellini and now I am so calm.”

Judging by her writings, Raha belonged to a milieu in Tehran where the arts are a secular religion. This tugs at me because I once belonged to one very similar. “In days, I am taken by literature and at nights by the movies,” Raha wrote, and she could have been describing my youth in Tehran, even though I am 14 years her senior.

Raha adored the Belgian director Chantal Akerman. Her Toute une nuit (1982), which follows two dozen people through one night in Brussels, was among Raha’s top four on Letterboxd. “Need to soak up every moment of this film,” she wrote after a rewatch. In the world of literature, she reserved a special place for Albert Camus who, together with Milan Kundera, Jostein Gaarder, Simone de Beauvoir, and a few others, has remained as central to her generation as he was to mine. She posted a quote from a love letter that the Spanish-born French actor Maria Casares wrote to Camus: “My Love, I wish I knew a language never used before to speak to you.” Translated into Persian, the line reads like poetry.

As Raha delved into her university studies, her posts reflected her readings in Italian. Oriana Fallaci’s Penelope alla guerra was a new favorite; last September, she wrote excitedly about her class on Dante’s Divine Comedy.

Arash Azizi: The Islamic Republic will not last

Many of the works that she—and I—explored as a young person in Iran were of European origin, but what drew her to them was their universality. Raha received nothing passively: She interacted with Western works of art alongside Iranian ones, and in relation to them. Her Telegram channel’s name exemplified this transport of ideas: “Le vent nous portera” (“The Wind Will Carry Us”) is a song by a French rock band, named after a film by the Iranian auteur Abbas Kiarostami, who took it from a poem by the Iranian poet Forough Farrokhzad.

Raha did not consume only Western works. She also read the Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish and the South Korean novelist Han Kang. The Mexican American author Valeria Luiselli was another favorite, as her modern urban sensibility helped Raha appreciate flaneuring in her own Tehran. “Now that I am not there, I suddenly catch myself dreaming of walking in Tehran’s streets,” she wrote last year. “This city is truly my lover. Full of danger, chaos, life, and passion.” Elsewhere, she wrote: “I currently love Tehran, the Italian language, cinema, translation, and beautiful humans.”

Raha’s ebullience contrasted starkly with the martyrdom culture promoted by the theocratic regime she lived under. Iran’s rulers, like many religious fundamentalists, celebrate indifference to earthly life and pin their sights on posthumous rewards.

Now, as Iranians bury their new martyrs, an entirely different culture has sprung up around them. Funerals feature not the traditional resigned mourning, but defiance and a celebration of life. Instead of the Islamic term shahid, or “martyr,” Iranians have adopted the Persian term javidnaam, or “eternal name,” to denote this new mentality.

The designation fits Raha very well. She will not be able to watch any of the 279 films on her Letterboxd “Watchlist.” She will not finish her Italian degree. But her writings will indeed be eternal, and her name will live on among Iranians still struggling to take their country back: Raha Bahloulipour, whose life was taken from her perhaps, above all, because she loved it so much. As she wrote on Telegram: “Nothing in this life was as we wanted it. But we wanted it and loved it madly and fought for it.”</div>

Some dictators go down fighting. Some are lynched and strung up for their victims to spit on. Some die in bed.

Bashar al-Assad, who oversaw the torture and murder of hundreds of thousands of his fellow Syrians during a quarter century in power, may have achieved something new in the annals of tyranny. As the rebels closed in on Damascus on December 7, 2024, Assad reassured his aides and subordinates that victory was near, and then fled in the night on a Russian jet, telling almost no one. I remember seeing a statement issued that same evening declaring that Assad was at the palace performing his “constitutional duties.” Some of his closest aides were fooled and had to escape the country however they could as rebel militias lit up the sky with celebratory gunfire.

Assad’s betrayal was so breathtakingly craven that some people had trouble believing it at first. When the facts became impossible to deny, the loyalty of thousands of people curdled almost instantly into fury. Many swore that they had always secretly hated him. There is an expression in Arabic for this kind of revisionist memory: When the cow falls, the butchers multiply.

But the emotion was real for many, as was the belief that Assad was solely responsible for everything that had gone wrong. “You can still find people who believe in Muammar Qaddafi, who believe in Saddam Hussein,” Ibrahim Hamidi, a Syrian journalist and editor, told me. “No one now believes in Bashar al-Assad, not even his brother.”

The sudden collapse of the Assad regime put an end to a cruel police state, but now there is virtually no Syrian state at all outside the capital. The country’s new leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, has done a superb job of charming Donald Trump and other world leaders. He is also an Islamist whose authority is tenuous, and whose country remains so dangerously volatile that it could easily descend into another war.

No one—not the CIA, not the Mossad—appears to have had any idea that Assad would fall so fast. But in the days and weeks afterward, an explanation for his regime’s collapse began to gain currency. Assad’s backers, Russia and Iran, had been drawn into other conflicts, with Ukraine and Israel respectively, and no longer had the ability to protect him. Their sudden withdrawal exposed what had been hidden in plain sight for years: the terrible weakness of an exhausted, corrupt, and underpaid army. A little like the American-backed regime in Afghanistan that fell in 2021, the Assad dynasty was the casualty of broader geopolitical realignments. After the fact, its fall came to seem inevitable.

But over the past year, I have spoken with dozens of the courtiers and officers who inhabited the palace in Damascus, and they tell a different story. Many describe a detached ruler, obsessed with sex and video games, who probably could have saved his regime at any time in the past few years if he hadn’t been so stubborn and vain. In this version, it was not geopolitics that doomed the regime. None of the countries in the region wanted Assad to fall, and several of them offered him lifelines. If he had taken hold of them, he would almost certainly be sitting in the palace now. Even in the final days, foreign ministers were calling, offering deals. He didn’t answer. He appears to have been sulking, angered by the suggestion that he might have to give up the throne.

In the end, Assad’s embittered loyalists may have been right. It was all about Bashar.

Perhaps all autocrats come to think of themselves as invincible, but Assad had a particular reason for his misplaced confidence: He had already survived one near-death experience.

The Arab Spring uprisings reached Syria in 2011 and blazed up into civil war. A large portion of the country’s people took up arms against its ruler, and scarcely anyone expected Assad to survive. “I have no doubt that the Assad regime will soon discover that the forces of change cannot be reversed,” Barack Obama declared in 2012. Obama was so confident that his State Department helped fund a “Day After Project” to be ready for the new Syria. My editors at The New York Times asked me to write an obituary of the Assad dynasty, and I remember thinking that I should get it done quickly. I still have it in my files.

Read: The dispute behind the violence in Syria

That obituary probably would have been published in 2015 if not for a deus ex machina named Vladimir Putin. A Russian intervention that began in September of that year changed everything for Assad. Waves of deadly air strikes by Russia’s Sukhoi and Tupolev jets, working in concert with Iranian and Shiite militias, shifted the momentum on the battlefield, inflicting fierce blows on the rebel forces. By now, the Syrian opposition, once led by nonviolent protesters, was dominated by Islamists, who were divided and feckless and could be easily lumped together with the telegenic savageries of the Islamic State, known as ISIS.

By late 2017, Assad had more or less won the war. His regime controlled the major cities, and the opposition was confined to the northwestern province of Idlib, where a former al-Qaeda leader named Ahmed al-Sharaa (then known as Abu Muhammad al-Jolani) was emerging as a leading figure.

That deceptive moment of victory, many Syrians have told me, was when everything started to go wrong. Assad didn’t seem to understand that his triumph was a hollow one. Large portions of his country had been reduced to rubble. The economy had shrunk almost to nothing, and sanctions levied by the United States and Europe were weighing it down even further. Syria’s sovereignty had been partly mortgaged to Russia and Iran, which were squeezing Damascus for money to repay their investment in the conflict. Assad’s supporters, having suffered through years of war and struggle, would not remain patient forever. With the fighting over, they began to expect some kind of reprieve.

Assad could have given his people what they wanted. The Gulf Arab states had the money and clout to bring him in from the cold, and in 2017, the United Arab Emirates began reaching out to Damascus. But it had a condition, the same one it had been seeking since before the civil war: Assad had to distance himself from Iran. The Gulf Arabs had long seen the revolutionary theocrats in Tehran as their biggest threat, and Syria’s long-standing alliance with them—forged by Bashar’s father, Hafez al-Assad—was a sore point with all of the other Arab leaders.

For Syria, exchanging Iran’s dubious company for the wealth of the Gulf made a lot of sense. But there was a catch: It wasn’t necessarily the best thing for the Assad family. Unlike the Gulf states and the West, the Iranians had always made clear that they would do anything to keep Assad in power. All he had to do in return was continue to facilitate Tehran’s provision of weapons and money through Syrian territory to Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese militia that was the star player in Tehran’s “Axis of Resistance.”

Assad did reach a modest rapprochement with the Emiratis, who reopened their embassy in Damascus in 2018. But he refused to cut his ties to Iran. Khaled al-Ahmad, a shrewd political operator in Assad’s inner circle who had negotiated the deal with the Emiratis and had briefly believed that a real political transition was possible, finally concluded that Assad was incapable of changing course. “I decided he was a dead elephant in the room,” he told me of Assad. (Ahmad is now an adviser to the new Syrian government.)

Around this time, a young Israeli national-security official reached the same conclusion and began urging his superiors to organize an internal coup against Assad. The Israelis had long viewed Assad as a manageable enemy—someone who mouthed all of the usual slogans about the Zionist enemy but kept the border between the two countries quiet. But the Israeli official, who is no longer in government service and spoke with me on the condition of anonymity, told me that around 2019, he began to fear that Assad was too feckless to be reliable. “The regime was an empty shell,” he said.

The Israeli command demurred on the coup proposal. The idea had been discussed periodically over the years in Tel Aviv and Washington but had never gotten very far, perhaps because Assad’s father had deliberately created a regime that kept potential rivals in check or under surveillance.

“Everybody in the region was comfortable with him being there,” the former Israeli official said. “Being weak, posing a threat to no one.”

Assad apparently mistook this tacit consensus for power. “Bashar was living in a fictional world,” a former Hezbollah political operative who was often in Syria during those years told me (he asked for anonymity for fear of repercussions): “The Iranians need me. The Russians have no choice. I’m the king.”

Assad’s backers began to grumble, but the Syrian leader wouldn’t listen. In 2019, the former Hezbollah operative said, the Russians and the Iranians began pushing him to make mostly symbolic reforms that would placate Western countries and ease the burden of Syria’s economic isolation. Assad lied and temporized, the official said. Iran’s foreign minister at the time, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said in a recent interview with Al Jazeera that he’d urged Assad to “engage with the opposition” but that the Syrian leader, “drunk with victory,” had stalled.

Perhaps the most arresting example of Assad’s obtuseness came during the first Trump administration. In 2020, Washington sent two officials, Roger Carstens and Kash Patel, to Lebanon to locate Austin Tice, an American journalist who had disappeared in Syria in 2012 and was thought to be in the hands of the Assad regime. Abbas Ibrahim, then the head of Lebanon’s General Security branch, brought the two men to Damascus, where they met with one of Assad’s top security officials, a widely feared figure named Ali Mamlouk. The Americans raised the subject of Tice, Carstens told me, and Mamlouk responded that the United States would need to lift sanctions and remove its troops from Syria before any American request could be discussed. Ibrahim, who had taken part in the meeting and recalled some details differently, told me that he had seen Mamlouk’s remark as an opening gambit and had never expected the Americans to make such sweeping concessions.

To the surprise of both Ibrahim and Mamlouk, the U.S. government signaled its agreement to a deal in exchange for proof that Tice was alive. Ibrahim then flew to Washington, where he was told that Trump had confirmed the American position. But Ibrahim was even more amazed when he got the response from Assad: No deal, and no more talks. Ibrahim asked why, and Mamlouk told him that it was “because Trump described Assad as an animal” years earlier.

Ibrahim told his Syrian counterpart that this was madness. Even if Tice was dead, the Americans would hold up their end of the deal as long as they could find out what had happened to him and “close the file.” (There have been conflicting reports about what happened to Tice, including some suggesting, without proof, that an Assad-regime officer may have killed him.) The Americans were eager for anything they could get, Ibrahim recalled to me: “I got a call from Pompeo once; he said, I’m ready to fly by private jet to Syria, ready to shake hands with anyone.” (Pompeo and Patel did not respond to my requests for comment.)

This was a “golden opportunity” for Assad, who presumably could have met with Mike Pompeo, then the U.S. secretary of state, and told him apologetically that the regime did not know what had happened to Tice, Ibrahim said. The meeting alone would have bestowed a new legitimacy on Assad, and made other countries more inclined to reach out to him.

The Biden administration renewed the offer in 2023, sending a high-level delegation to Oman to meet with Syrian officials about Tice. This time, Assad behaved almost insultingly, Ibrahim said, refusing even to send a senior official to meet them. Instead, he sent a former ambassador who was given strict instructions to not so much as speak about Tice.

That Assad, with his hubris and lack of foresight, was soon to fall may be less puzzling, in retrospect, than the fact that he lasted so long. The reason he did goes back to his father, who built a regime so sturdy and ruthless that it survived 25 years of the son’s mismanagement. One lesson to be drawn from Assad’s fall is a very old one: The greatest vulnerability of all political dynasties is the problem of succession.

Hafez al-Assad was a dictator in the classic mold, a shrewd and strong-willed man who rose from rural poverty through the military and seized power in a 1970 coup. He had a genius for undermining and outwitting his rivals, and he made dictatorship seem natural. It was what many Syrians wanted after the chaotic years that followed their country gaining independence from France, in 1946. “For some reason it seems to me that within the Arab circle there is a role wandering aimlessly in search of a hero,” wrote Gamal Abdel Nasser, the lantern-jawed Egyptian leader who embodied that heroic role perfectly in the 1950s and ’60s and helped create the modern idea of what an Arab dictator should be.

Bashar was different. Even first-time visitors to Syria could see that he didn’t look the part: He had a weak chin and panicky eyes, and his head and neck were oddly elongated, as if he’d been squeezed too tight in the birth canal. When you saw his image on one of the ubiquitous billboards around Syria, it was easy to get the feeling that someone had played a practical joke and substituted the head of an anxious schoolboy for that of the leader.

When he started talking, the impression was even worse. His voice was thin and nasal, and he always looked uncomfortable during speeches, as if he was desperate to get it over with. In a culture that puts great value on eloquence and authority, he had none.

Many people who know Bashar told me that his lack of confidence stems from his early years. His older brother, Bassel, bullied his younger siblings so mercilessly that he permanently distorted their personalities, one former palace insider told me. The family dynamics are on display in a famous photograph taken around 1993. Bassel stands at the center of the frame, looking cocky and slightly bored, with his parents seated in front of him and his siblings on either side. Bashar is on the left, his body slightly angled away, his face uneasy. Unlike the others, he seems to be looking beyond the photographer, as if scouting an escape route.

Bashar came to power through an accident. Bassel, a military officer and a show-jumping equestrian who was known as Syria’s “Golden Knight,” was the heir apparent. But he died in a car crash in 1994. Hafez yanked Bashar back from London, where he’d been training to be an ophthalmologist, and began grooming him as the next leader.

Many in Syria’s dissident circles at first found Bashar’s awkwardness and shyness appealing. The fact that he didn’t resemble a dictator kindled their hopes that he would be kinder and more tolerant. For a brief moment, that appeared to be true. During the “Damascus Spring” that followed Bashar’s accession after his father’s death, in 2000, the margin of free speech seemed to widen.

But a crackdown soon followed, and in the following years, Assad’s psychology appeared to be working in the opposite direction. He was so afraid of being perceived as weak, he seemed to believe that he had to prove, again and again, that he could live up to the brutality that was expected of him.

I have spoken with at least a dozen people who knew Assad, and they all commented on his stubbornness. He doesn’t listen to advice, many of them said, and often seems to resent hearing it. Similar things were said about his father, a famously uncompromising negotiator. Both men had to “bargain with and manipulate sinecures of power within this opaque system in order to reach consensus,” David Lesch, a scholar at Trinity University who interviewed Bashar extensively in the 2000s, told me. But Assad lacked his father’s native toughness. According to some who knew and studied him, his rigidity masked a lack of confidence in his own judgment.

That insecurity, some told me, also makes him impressionable. He was particularly taken with Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, an immensely popular and charismatic figure. Assad seems to have believed the propaganda Nasrallah fed him, perhaps because it was what he wanted to hear: that the Axis of Resistance would strike a fierce blow against Israel and that, afterward, Assad would be able to set any conditions he liked for peace. In other words, Assad would not have to make any difficult choices or sacrifices. Everything would be handed to him on a platter.

On October 7, 2023, Assad must have imagined for a few hours that Nasrallah’s prophecies had come true. Hamas fighters swept across the border fence from Gaza and massacred more than 1,000 people. Israel—the Samson of the region—looked weak and unprepared.

But before long, Israel was launching thousands of air strikes not just into Gaza but also into Lebanon and Syria. Assad said nothing about this campaign against his allies, which eventually killed Nasrallah himself. Perhaps he hoped to keep his name off Israel’s target list. But according to Wiam Wahhab, a Lebanese political figure who was close to the Syrian regime, Assad’s silence fueled Iranian suspicions that he was feeding information to the Israelis. The Axis of Resistance was falling apart.

That should have worried Assad, especially in light of the fact that Russia, his other protector, was bogged down in Ukraine. But the atmosphere at the palace was not conducive to clear thinking. Assad was spending much of his time playing Candy Crush and other video games on his phone, according to the former Hezbollah operative I spoke with. He had sidelined the éminences grises of his father’s day and relied instead on a small circle of younger figures with dubious credentials. One of them, a former Al Jazeera journalist named Luna al-Shibl, doubled as Assad’s lover and also procured other women for him to have sex with, including the wives of high-ranking Syrian officers, according to former palace insiders and the former Israeli official.

Shibl, who was married to a regime insider, seems to have encouraged Assad’s palace-born habit of looking down on ordinary citizens. In a recording that surfaced this past December, Assad and Shibl can be heard laughing dismissively about the pretensions of Hezbollah and mocking the soldiers who salute them as they drive through a Damascus suburb. Assad, who is at the wheel, says at one point of the Syrians they pass in the street: “They spend money on mosques, but they don’t have enough to eat.”

To understand the obscenity of Assad’s comment, you need to know that he was amassing an enormous personal fortune, mostly from drug smuggling, even as many Syrians were at the point of starvation. Ordinary soldiers were paid as little as $10 a month, far less than they needed to survive. The Syrian pound, which had once traded at 47 to the dollar, had reached a rate of 15,000 a dollar by 2023. The poverty deepened after 2020, when the U.S. Congress imposed another steep round of sanctions under the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act.

Even longtime supporters from the Alawite religious minority—the sect to which the Assads belong—began to complain about their destitution. One member of the Assad clan who lives in Europe told me that he’d visited Syria in 2021 and been amazed to discover that the officers—from the elite Republican Guard unit—charged with protecting his immediate family were so poor that they spent their off-duty hours hawking fruit and cigarettes in the street.

Assad and his family maintained their own living standards by turning Syria into a narco-state, with Bashar’s brother Maher overseeing the manufacture and smuggling of immense quantities of Captagon, an illegal amphetamine. The drug trade earned Assad billions of dollars, but it also fueled an addiction crisis in the Gulf states and Jordan, angering their leaders.

Assad’s megalomania seems to have taken a strange new turn in these past few years. According to Ahmad, Assad had concluded that he needed “monarchy tools” like those of Putin and the Gulf rulers, including cash reserves large enough to subsidize militias and reorient the economy. Assad’s comments to a Russian interviewer during his final months in power betray a hint of this idea of royal powers. Asked about the downsides of democracy, Assad said, with a contemptuous grin: “In the West, the presidents, especially in the United States, are the executive directors, but they’re not the owners.”

In July 2024, with the war in Gaza dominating the headlines, Luna al-Shibl was found dead in her BMW on a highway outside Damascus. The regime media called it a road accident, but the circumstances were odd: According to some reports, the car was only lightly damaged, yet her skull had been bashed in. Rumors spread quickly that she had been killed on the orders of Tehran for providing targeting information to the Israelis.

But Assad was the one who’d ordered the murder of his former lover, the former Israeli official and two people with ties to the regime told me. Shibl had become a de facto Russian agent, providing Moscow with information about Iran’s activities in Syria, the former Israeli official said. Perhaps she’d sensed that the end was coming for Assad and that she needed another protector. This account was impossible to confirm; Russian officials do not comment on intelligence matters.

When a tyrant falls, we may be tempted to imagine a final moment of tragic self-awareness—a personal reckoning, like Oedipus blinding himself, or Macbeth raging on the heath. But I don’t think real dictators go down like that. They are too good at lying to themselves.

For Assad, the final chapter began in November 2024. The rebel militias under Ahmed al-Sharaa’s command had been lobbying for Turkey’s permission to launch a military operation, and finally, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan gave it to them. (Turkey denied official involvement in the operation.)

Erdoğan did so reluctantly. All year, he had been asking Assad to meet with him. His demands were pretty modest: a political reconciliation and a deal to allow the millions of Syrian refugees in Turkey to return home. But Assad acted as if he held all the cards, refusing to meet unless Erdoğan agreed in advance to withdraw all Turkish forces from Syria. The rebel operation that Erdoğan approved seems to have been intended as a way to prod Assad to negotiate; it was framed not as an invasion but as a defensive move.

When the rebels marched northeast toward the city of Aleppo on November 27, 2024, Assad was in Russia, where his son would be defending his Ph.D. dissertation on number theory and polynomial representations at Moscow State University. As Aleppo’s defenses crumbled, Assad remained in Moscow, to the shock and dismay of his commanders back home. He seems to have been hoping to persuade Putin to rescue him.

But the Russian president kept him waiting for days, and when they finally met, it was very brief. According to the former Israeli official I spoke with, Putin told Assad that he could not fight his war for him, and that the Syrian leader’s only hope was to go to Erdoğan and cut a deal. The Russians had always valued their strategic relationship with Turkey far more than their relationship with Syria. Whether Assad grasped this is impossible to know. But Putin was not going to launch a new war against Turkey’s rebel allies just to save a petty dictator whose own soldiers were deserting.

Aleppo had fallen to the rebels by the time Assad landed back in Damascus. After only a few hours, he flew to Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, Ahmad told me. It is not clear whom he met with or what was said. The Emiratis feared Sharaa’s Islamist militias as much as they feared Tehran. But they had no boots on the ground.

Back in Damascus, Assad tried a last gambit, calling on the “monarchy tools” he had been assembling for years. He put out word that he would pay exorbitant salaries to volunteers who could quickly reassemble the militias that had helped win the civil war years earlier, Ahmad told me. But when the ordinary soldiers who’d spent years on starvation wages heard of these offers, many were so furious that they abandoned their post.

The rebels had now captured the city of Hama and were on their way to Homs, 100 miles north of the capital. At the same time, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard commanders who had helped prop up the regime began to pack up and leave. Syrian soldiers got wind of their allies’ retreat, and panic spread among the ranks. The rebels rode southward almost unopposed.

On December 7, 2024, the foreign ministers of Russia and seven Middle Eastern countries held an emergency meeting on the sidelines of an annual security conference in Doha, the Qatari capital. None of them wanted the Assad regime to collapse. They issued a statement calling for an end to military operations and for a phased political transition, based on a United Nations Security Council resolution that had been issued a decade earlier. They would need Assad to agree to this and facilitate it, but there was a problem: No one could reach him. He appeared to have turned off his phone.

A member of Assad’s entourage who was with him in the final hours gave me the following account, asking not to be named because he is still living in the region.

Assad returned from the palace to his private residence in the capital’s al-Malki neighborhood at roughly 6 p.m. He seemed calm, and mentioned that he had just reassured his cousin Ihab Makhlouf that there was nothing to worry about; the Emiratis and Saudis would find a way to stop the rebel advance. Makhlouf was shot to death later that night while fleeing by car to Lebanon.

At 8 p.m., word came that Homs had fallen to the rebels. That struck fear in the entourage. But Assad assured his aides that regime forces were coming from the south to encircle and defend the capital. This was not true, and my sources could not say whether Assad believed it. In the hours that followed, he seemed to have oscillated between despair and deluded assurances that victory was at hand—a state of mind that will be familiar to anyone who has watched the movie Downfall, about Hitler’s final days in the Führerbunker in Berlin.

Just after 11 p.m., Mansour Azzam, one of Assad’s top aides, arrived at the house with a small group of Russian officials. They went off to a room together with Assad to talk. My source told me he believes that the Russians were showing Assad videos proving that the regime forces were no longer fighting.

By 1 a.m., word had reached the entourage that many regime supporters had given up the fight and were fleeing the capital for the Syrian coast, the Alawite heartland.

At 2 a.m., Assad emerged from his private quarters and told his longtime driver that he would need vans. He gave orders for the staff to start packing his belongings as quickly as possible. A group of Russians was outside the house.

Until that moment, many in the entourage had believed that Assad would go to the presidential palace to deliver a speech of resistance to his followers. Now they finally understood that the battle was over. He was abandoning them for good. Assad moved toward the front door, this time with two of his aides and his son Hafez. The others were told that there was no room for them.

Assad’s middle-aged driver stood by the door, looking at the president with an unmistakable expression of disappointment on his face.

Assad looked back at him. Even in this last moment, he wouldn’t take responsibility for what had happened to his country. He wasn’t betraying his followers—it was they who were betraying him, by refusing to lay down their lives to extend his rule.

“What about you people?” Assad asked the driver. “Aren’t you going to fight?”

He turned and went out into the night. The Russians were waiting.</div>

Chinese sock puppet says, &quot;Forget all, this, look at this lovely distracting Epstein stuff!&quot;

So the Communist Party tracks every time you sneeze, but they had no idea this is going on? Either that, they are in on it.

China isn&#39;t like North Korea, and even in North Korea they can&#39;t watch everyone all the time. Crime still happens.

I expect there will be some high profile arrests, and very harsh punishments. They will want to avoid it becoming like South Korea, where hidden cameras are a huge problem.

Typically, adjusted for the perceived severity of the offense, punishment is proportional to the difficulty of identifying and apprehending the offender.

It&#39;s nearly impossible to sweep a hotel daily for these cameras.  If you do find them, it&#39;s nearly impossible to identify who planted them.

So... I like &#39;stocks in the public square for a month&#39;.

This seems to have been a for profit operation, so they will be able to trace the money. I doubt whoever did it was careful enough to wipe the cameras clean of fingerprints anyway, let along manage good digital opsec.

People who think that have never been to China. If they had been, they would have noticed that it&#39;s not like North Korea.

Seriously, what kind of loser pays to watch this? It&#39;s pathetic.

I have a wonderful business opportunity to offer you: NotARugPull dot something.  Please let me know your budget and I will let you know what &quot;something&quot; will be.

Quick: the domain IA.com is still available [afternic.com]! Do I hear $07 million?

My friend sold wallstreet.com for $1.03 Million, and all I got was a lousy T-shirt.

My T-shirt said: My friend sold wallstreet.com for $1.03 Million, and all I got was a lousy T-shirt.

This is right on schedule matching up with the end of the dotcom era. Though back then everybody IPOd as soon as possible. Now it&#39;s just a bunch of Enron-esque circular deals with Theranos-levels of impossibility, so I guess one or two people will get rich, and a few companies will be left holding the bag.

Even an AI hallucination couldn&#39;t explain the reasoning leading to this choice.

&quot;offering a personal &quot;AI agent&quot; that lets consumers send messages, use apps and trade stocks.&quot;

I bet $500 that behind the scenes this actually turns out to be a bunch of poorly-paid remote workers in the Philippines.

Just like the last time we heard about an amazing &#39;agent&#39; thing and it was actually...wait for it...a bunch of poorly-paid remote workers in the Philippines.

            <div id="article-text">I guess this is the source for the push for the new data centers. I can sort of understand the reason the accounts like it. From a developer standpoint, outside of production where you want regional redundancy, I don&#39;t understand wanting to push so much work to &quot;someone else&#39;s computer&quot; that you don&#39;t have full control over it and where you can make the accountants and VPs pull there hair out because you ran a development process a few extra times and now they have a computer bill they weren&#39;t expecting, bu

Our county in Indiana just rejected two data centers, and while the exact concerns were different (power costs, water usage) the sentiment was the same: the big cloud companies will not stripe-mine our resources.

So the companies that owe that trillion dollars are a trillion dollars in debt? What happens when this trillion dollar backlog just doesn&#39;t happen because the companies that booked it disappear because they can&#39;t service their trillion dollar debt? Sounds like it&#39;s time to head for the door...

Nothing happens, except huge stock market drops.

As far as the companies themselves.  Its all funny money.  Company A promises to use 200 Billion in compute from hyperscaler B over Y years if hyperscaler B invests $X, where $X is slightly less than 200 Billion over Y years, paid in installments contingent on something that almost certainly requires hyperscaler B to do the build out for A to do the contingency work.

So basically its all flim flam use to to impress^H^H^H^H^H^H bilk investors, where by these guy

I can&#39;t speak to all of the areas that contribute to AI backlog (like capital allocation, systems integration, networking availability, etc).  But from a data centre standpoint it is a real struggle.  The general timeline to get from requirements to signature on a data centre lease is about three months if all goes well (assuming you are not self-performing).  Once that is signed a DC project takes about two years from conception to RFS (ready-for-service) where you can start rolling in racks.  A LOT goes i

And let&#39;s not forget that when they&#39;re asking for gigwatts of power they now have to wait for the power plants to be built, which are a little longer lead time than backup generators...

Things are bad enough the brokers are contacting every single hole-in-the-wall with a closet calling itself a colocation facility if they have space for a dozen or two racks with 100kW power requirements. That is, 100kW *per rack*.

If I&#39;m reading this right, pretty much the companies are overbooked, with not enough data centers to handle the incoming workloads?  Or is this meaning that their clients are in arrears?

I have been worried about a &quot;cloud cliff&quot;.  In previous recessions, businesses could weather bad times by dropping service plans, not updating (when updates were paid), or even going on the high seas and surviving that route.  Now, with cloud subscriptions, if a company can&#39;t afford to make their cloud bill, there is no redu

I wonder if they&#39;ll deliver before the bubble pops

They will deliver some the data centers and hardware and then those big 3 and a few others will be stuck making payments on the bonds for hardware and data centers that they may not have any significant customers and they hopefully are profitable enough that they won&#39;t go out of business getting stuck holding the bag.

The people making the purchases seem be purchasing the capacity because they think the magical AI is going to make them lots of money, if it does not (and that seems pretty likely that it is go

Just waiting for it to turn out that AI cooked their books or missed some massive fraud, and they try to claim it&#39;s not their fault.

They sound like douchebags - was the intention to encourage the rejection?

Auditing is about establishing the truth about the situation within the company. Which is why AI should never be allowed to be used in the context of auditing. Or at the very least the auditors should never rely on the AI-generated results provided by the company. What&#39;s stopping companies from telling AI to generate a set of data that would make them pass an audit, hiding the real facts? Auditors should rely on facts, not confabulations, and should dig as deep as necessary to uncover all the dirt that&#39;s hiding under the surface.

Afterthought:Which is why auditors should actually be asking for more money because now they&#39;ve got to cut through even more corporate BS.

The auditor is the one using AI. One of the things AI is good at is looking at lots of boring data and finding weird patterns.

Auditors used to have to go through and check every transaction to see if someone screwed up or was fudging the numbers. Modern accounting practices plus software can pretty much do that automatically now, leaving the auditors to look for more subtle stuff. AI can help with that more subtle stuff.

            <div id="article-text">Come on, this is &quot;Bild Zeitung&quot; here, about as reliable as the NY Post (although not as bad as the National Inquirer).

I honestly didn&#39;t know that the NY Post is that bad.

I don&#39;t think causing your penis to hallucinate is a performance-enhancer...

do they piss green? and what does the drug test show?

Hyaluronic acid is added to creams and certain supplements because it helps with moisturizing of skin and lubrication of joints as well as reduction in wrinkles, which means it can &quot;make things bigger&quot;

It&#39;s produced by the body. The only way I can figure for testing purposes is if there&#39;s some baseline determined for normal body amounts and if someone tests for above that amount. I&#39;m sure arguments could be made against the usefulness of such tests.

When the entire thing turns out to be &#39;shrinkage&#39;

i bet they are at a nice comfortable room temperature when scanned, and things get a little smaller when they are outdoors in winter flying thru the air..

The answer to all these uniform issues is just have the Olympics return to form.

I think the source is a tabloid newspaper, not known for being accurate, and sorry to ruin the fun but it doesn&#39;t quite add up. If a looser fitting outfit was an advantage, people would just buy a looser fitting outfit. Also, stuff being loose and flapping about doesn&#39;t tend to improve aerodynamics or flight capability, quite the opposite in fact.

I wonder if there&#39;s a translation issue, because more-inside ought to translate to a tighter suit, not a looser suit. Perhaps they mean doing this enlarges the suit?

I wonder if there&#39;s a translation issue,No. The article is correct. Imagine if competitors could wear anything -- they would wear something like a wingsuit.

No. The article is correct. Imagine if competitors could wear anything -- they would wear something like a wingsuit.

And again, more inside = tighter. Nothing about this adds up.

Then as AmiMojo says, why don&#39;t they?Because the rules don&#39;t allow it. They specify that the suits must be tight against the skin, or something like that. Temporarily enlarging a body part is a workaround of the roles.

Because the rules don&#39;t allow it. They specify that the suits must be tight against the skin, or something like that. Temporarily enlarging a body part is a workaround of the roles.

(from a LLM result) Olympic ski jump suit rules for 2026 mandate strict, tight-fitting, and air-permeable microfiber uniforms, often measured within a 2-4 cm tolerance of the body via 3D scanning to prevent excess lift. Suits must be 4mm-6mm thick, with specialized controls for 2026 to prevent illegal,, &quot;Crotchgate&quot; style modifications, such as lowering the crotch to increase aerodynamic surface area.

TBH, there are so many over-specified details that I&#39;d question t

Maybe, but could that really make any measurable difference to flight performance? If anything you would think that the protrusion would compromise the aero, not enhance it. Planes are smooth for a reason - they have been trying to reduce the bumps from bolts and riveting for over a century now, to the point where modern aircraft are made of layers of carbon fibre and adhesive.

The claim is that the increase in lift provides more benefit than the increase in drag takes away. If they are keeping their legs close together in the part where drag is a detriment (while accelerating) and then spreading out while in the air then this makes sense, and in fact that&#39;s what they do normally.

ought to translate to a tighter suit,I suspect that measurements are made in an &quot;inflated&quot; state, which is only temporary. Then, after the application of what seem to be rather stringent rules[1], the suits are looser when actually worn. Worn in cold weather, I might add, with its concomitant shrinkage effects. A certain amount of material is allocated, based on body size. But that can be redistributed to a certain extent.

If it&#39;s as simple as the amount of material affects performance, then it seems logical that they should specify standard sizes and either everyone uses the same (with padding) or they have divisions and a few fixed sizes.

A lot of sports have similar problems now. The margins are so small at the top levels, it becomes extremely difficult to make them fair. Like the amount of effort they put into making sure the sound from the starting gun in a sprint reaches the ears of every competitor at the same time.

It&#39;s not about it being a looser fit, but just being a bit larger and thus generating more lift.  I think the Guardian picked up more details, although still somewhat brief: https://www.theguardian.com/sp...  [theguardian.com]

As for looseness - who said anything about that?  A batwing suit is pretty loose until it&#39;s put in to action, why would this be any different?

Oh dear god. Now I am visualizing competitors finding ways to make their skin floppy in places so it parachutes out like a flying squirrel. Are you happy now?

https://www.nytimes.com/athlet... [nytimes.com]

&quot;professional&quot; and &quot;amateur&quot; sports are just stupid.

Rather than injecting chemicals into your dick, which sounds a bit extreme, couldn&#39;t they just do a &quot;Spinal Tap&quot; and shove a foil-wrapped pickle down there?

Do Olympic officials actually inspect your junk before/after ski jumps ?

This is during the fitting session for the suits, not in the course of the actual competition.

And yes, they do some kind of a 3d scan with the competitor standing in his underwear with a &quot;medical professional&quot; in attendance while this is underway.

...sold out of Hyaluronic Acid. Recommended dose? Asking for a friend.

Wow, truly creative - perhaps this aspect could be spun off into it&#39;s own sport as ski-jumping is stupid, unnecessary and boring - it&#39;s at the anti-sweet spot of sport.

Ski jumpers cheating by looking at porn before being scanned for their suit.

By that logic all these ski jumpers should just get castrated if they were really serious

I didn&#39;t complain when you wanted to shrink your junk for my amusement (steroids) and I&#39;m not going to complain if you want to pop your junk like a balloon for my amusement....

I don&#39;t think, &quot;My penis makes me more aerodynamic.&quot; is the brag they think it is.

It’s been a bad habit for a long time, but it’s getting worse: President Donald Trump can’t utter a single statement without lying about his accomplishments or revealing, all too plainly, that self-glorification is what he cares about the most.

Take his post on social media Thursday, affirming—as was clear a few days earlier—that he was going to let New START, the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between the United States and Russia, expire this week with barely a shrug.

He wrote: “Rather than extend ‘NEW START’ (a badly negotiated deal … that, aside from everything else, is being grossly violated), we should have our Nuclear Experts work on a new, improved, and modernized Treaty that can last long into the future.”

First, though the treaty—which was signed in 2011—no longer addresses all the salient issues of today’s nuclear landscape, it was in fact a brilliantly negotiated accord in its day, mandating the deepest cuts and tightest on-site-inspection clauses in arms-control history.

The real problem with New START, in Trump’s eyes, was the same problem that compelled him to denounce the Iran nuclear deal as “the worst deal ever” before he tore it up in 2018; he hates them because they were both signed by his loathed and envied predecessor, Barack Obama.

Russian President Vladimir Putin—who has, in fact, abided by New START’s numerical limits—proposed that he and Trump extend the accord by one year, but Trump declined. (The treaty allowed for a one-time five-year extension, which Putin and Joe Biden signed back in 2021, perhaps another reason—since he loathes Biden at least as much as he despises  Obama—Trump would rather scuttle the whole deal.)

Then, in this same social media post, for no reason at all (this is the bad habit that I cited at the start of this essay), Trump recites some fibs. For instance: “I completely rebuilt [our] Military in my First Term, including new and many refurbished nuclear weapons.”

This is untrue. Obama approved the development of new nuclear weapons for the entire “strategic Triad”: land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and bombers, as well as new warheads and cruise missiles. (Ironically, he agreed to this as a way of getting Senate hawks to ratify the New START treaty. He was also snookered into this compromise. He agreed to “replace or modernize” the existing arsenal, thinking “modernize” could mean, for instance, upgrading the software on a guidance system. The senators took the term to be synonymous with “replace.”)

During his first term, Trump didn’t add a single new nuclear weapon or accelerate the ones that Obama put in motion. In fact, the first model of the new B-21 bomber took its first flight  during Biden’s presidency.

Trump’s social media post goes on: “I … continue to rebuild our Military at levels never seen before.”

This is palpably untrue. The Pentagon is, by some measures, spending more money than almost ever before, but building—of ships, planes, missiles, or whatever—is not growing so much; it’s dwarfed by the rearmament during World War II or the presidencies of John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.

He rambles on: “We are even adding Battleships, which are 100 times more powerful than the ones that roamed the Seas during World War II.”

This is Trump’s big fantasy, stemming from romanticized memories of watching Victory at Sea, the WWII documentary on TV. But no naval officer wants to revive such relics, and it’s extremely unlikely the gigantic boats will ever be built.

Then came this puzzler: “I have stopped Nuclear Wars from breaking out across the World between Pakistan and India, Iran and Israel, and Russia and Ukraine.”

One might have thought Trump had done enough distorting of his record as peacemaker by claiming that he’d “ended eight-plus wars” (most of which either haven’t yet ended or were ended by actors other than Trump). But this new boast, that he’d “stopped Nuclear Wars from breaking out” shows him engaging in new realms of self-delusion.

The latest round of skirmishes between India and Pakistan hardly escalated at all, much less to the brink of nuclear exchanges, before the fighting stopped. (When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi scoffed at Trump’s earlier claim of credit for negotiating the peace, Trump slapped him with 50 percent tariffs, a step he has since reversed.)

Nuclear war between Iran and Israel wasn’t remotely in the offing, in part because Iran doesn’t have nuclear weapons. Maybe Trump was thinking that his bombing campaign, which he claimed “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear program, preempted this possibility. But now satellite images reveal that Iran is repairing the damage done, suggesting he didn’t obliterate the sites after all.

As for Russia and Ukraine, one could argue that by halting weapons deliveries to Ukraine, Trump thwarted Ukraine’s counteroffensive, thus calming Putin’s fear of losing the war, a prospect he might have blocked by going nuclear—but the logical thread is dubious, and in any case this was an act of appeasement, not peace.

Then, Trump returns to New START. Rather than extending it for a year, he writes, “we should have our Nuclear Experts work on a new, improved, and modernized Treaty that can last long into the future.”

Ah, yes, a “better” New START, just as Trump talked about a “better” Iran nuclear deal back in 2018 after he ripped up the accord signed by the dread Barack Obama. But he never even tried to negotiate an improved Iran deal; he was hoping, perhaps assuming, that his campaign of “maximum pressure” would bring down Tehran’s regime. (It didn’t; it only accelerated its nuclear program.) It’s unclear what he’s aiming for in refusing to extend New START, but it’s just as unlikely he’ll initiate new strategic arms talks, in part because his administration has no “Nuclear Experts,” none with experience at negotiating arms treaties anyway.

A few days before Trump nailed the coffin on New START, Axios reported that the U.S. and Russia were “closing in on a deal” to extend the treaty. The story further reported that the idea had been proposed, at a recent meeting with Russian diplomats, by Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff. And why not? Trump has been using this overmatched duo—his son-in-law and his fellow real-estate tycoon—as stand-ins for foreign service officers, gallivanting the globe, trying to make peace deals in Ukraine (fruitless), Gaza (Stage 1 but nothing more), and other hotspots. They know nothing about the old Russian Empire or the Middle East, so why not try their untutored hands at nuclear arms–control talks too? Trump rejected the idea for now, but if he does start new ones, he’ll probably send them to the table.

In any case, New START’s impending expiration has been flashing on the horizon ever since Trump was sworn in for a second term. If he was really serious about negotiating a new, improved treaty, he could have started doing so months ago.

But Trump isn’t interested in the issues, not just on arms control but in general. The most recent case in point—and also the latest chapter in Trump’s quest for immortality—is a report that, during recent talks with Sen. Chuck Schumer, Trump said that he would restore the $16 billion that he’d withdrawn from the Gateway Tunnel—a project to connect New York and New Jersey—if Penn Station and Dulles Airport were renamed after him. (Schumer nixed the notion.)

That says it all. Trump had pretended that he’d killed the tunnel—along with its jobs and improvements in infrastructure—to save money. But in fact, it was all about political punishment (denying funds to blue states) and personal glory (restoring the money for glimmers of immortality).

Trump wants to emblazon his name on as many grand monuments as he can before he shuffles off this mortal coil: the Trump-Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the Trump Institute of Peace, the plans for a new 250-foot-high arch off the Memorial Bridge (the Arc de Trump?), the Trump-class battleships, and so forth.

It’s pathetic. He is the most powerful man on earth, he has tremendous wealth (embellished by $4 billion through his leveraging since retaking the White House). Yet he needs to have his name carved, mounted, blared, memorialized, somehow noticed, everywhere.

He seems unaware that all the other presidential commemorations—JFK Airport, Cape Kennedy, the USS Gerald Ford, Reagan National Airport, the city of Washington, D.C., and all the rest—were set down, or renamed, after their honorees had left public life, in most cases after they died. They were signs of a nation’s respect, or at least wistful nostalgia. The Trump christenings are garish reflections of tawdry egomania.

Many of these monuments will be re-renamed, the gold letters stripped off their walls, soon after Trump leaves office. It will be harder to repair his calamitous policies.

Thursday night, Donald Trump posted something racist enough to break through on social media—a rarity, as his offensive social media posts often go ignored these days. But the visceral, undeniable racism of this particular iteration, and the White House’s initial refusal to express any remorse, pushed it through. And at least one Republican senator expressed disapproval: Sen. Tim Scott, who is Black, called it “the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House.”

The source of all this commotion was a screengrab of a video Trump posted on Truth Social depicting the heads of former first lady Michelle Obama and former President Barack Obama laughing, open-mouthed, on ape bodies.

The screengrab is real, and the underlying video it comes from is stranger than one might expect. Trump posted the video on Truth Social at 8:44 p.m. on Thursday, and it’s actually largely about election fraud, taking you through baseless and frankly dull conspiracy theory material. But at the end, for about two seconds, it flashes to a bright jungle scene, featuring the laughing Obamas, to the tune of “The Lion Sleeps Tonight.”

The last two seconds appeared to be clipped into the video for shock humor, meant to throw a laugh in for the racists who had made it all the way through. There is no mitigating “context” here. With or without the election-fraud part, it was the Black president and first lady, depicted as apes, in one of the oldest and most dehumanizing racist tropes in history.

At first, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt tried to defend the post as being “from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the king of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from The Lion King.” She added: “Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public.”

And, sure, the original video that those bizarre last seconds were taken from does indeed show Trump as a lion and Democrats as figures that could conceivably be thought of as Lion King characters—Hillary Clinton as Pumbaa, Hakeem Jeffries as Timon—bowing to him. But there are no ape characters in the Lion King. The video is generated by A.I., and is not in the animated style of the 1993 animated film but is instead standard A.I. slop. Perhaps the A.I. added in the additional characters to muddle the racism of depicting the Obamas as apes, but the fact remains that it opens with the scene of the Obamas, and lingers on it longer than the others.

And the creator of the video is not known for his delicacy or tact. Per the watermark and his own claims on X, the creator, who has Pepe the Frog for an avatar, is the same internet user behind the infamous October slop video of Trump dumping sewage onto protesters from a fighter jet. That video shocked people for its raw animosity toward legal protesters practicing their First Amendment rights, as well as for the profoundly juvenile behavior from a sitting president. If you scroll through the creator’s more recent material, it appears he pretty much exclusively makes similarly mindless, low-quality slop content with obvious MAGA messages. Other videos have included Tom Homan as a Jedi fighting protesters in Minneapolis; Don Lemon being arrested and twerking in prison; and Alex Pretti, who was fatally shot by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, being hit with a car and thrown, cartoonishly, into the air.

Even if the original video had no racist intent, which it does, defending the original video makes no sense: Trump didn’t post the original video. He posted a two-second clip of the Obamas as apes. The message is clear.

The one valid defense would be one of ignorance. We can’t know exactly how Trump encountered this video. It’s unclear if Trump watched the entire clip, meaning maybe he didn’t see those two seconds at the end. The White House claimed it was a staffer who actually posted it. But given the highly nonstrategic style of the account’s posting that evening—another post was of an inoffensive TikTok featuring a dog eager to be fed whipped cream, classic Trump stuff—it seems a strange kind of post for a staffer.

Much more crucially, the White House left the video up once they learned of the racist section. Trump did not apologize. The White House did eventually take it down, but only after it had been up for 12 hours.

Trump has done and said many other aggressively anti-Black things in his years in the public eye; this video is not the worst. But it still says something profound about the president and his administration that they were made aware of thoroughly ugly racism coming from the president’s own messages and chose not to apologize to Black Americans or correct the error, but instead to turn against the public.

Amid the uproar over President Donald Trump’s assault on Minnesota’s immigrant communities, another abuse has drawn less attention: a brazen disregard for judicial limits on his deportation campaign. The courts have determined that in January alone the administration violated at least 96 orders in 74 cases challenging the unlawful detention of immigrants in Minneapolis. The Justice Department has failed to meet its most basic obligations in many of these cases, due to an apparent combination of malice, incompetence, and institutional depletion. Further evidence of its unraveling came on Tuesday, when Julie Le, a government attorney, told Judge Jerry Blackwell, in open court: “I wish you would just hold me in contempt, Your Honor, so that I can have a full 24 hours of sleep.” Of the backlog in Minneapolis, Le then told Blackwell: “What do you want me to do? The system sucks. This job sucks. And I am trying every breath that I have so that I can get you what you need.”

On this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed Le’s shocking courtroom breakdown and what it reveals about the DOJ’s broader meltdown under Trump’s impossible demands. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: Is this the clearest sign yet that for all of its tough talk about going to “war” with “rogue judges,” the DOJ under Trump is in full-on dumpster-fire crisis mode?

Mark Joseph Stern: It’s a sign that the Justice Department is actively collapsing. And it’s important to understand the background here. Blackwell had ordered Le to explain why the government failed to comply with his order demanding the release of a detained immigrant, as well as why she shouldn’t be personally held in contempt for defying that order. Her response was that she had been given an impossible task. It turned out that the Trump administration had assigned her to the U.S. attorney’s office to handle 88 immigration cases in under a month, a crushing load. That overwhelming surge of immigration cases is happening all over the country, but it’s especially acute in Minneapolis because of the ongoing crackdown on immigrant communities there.

But this is a problem entirely of the administration’s own making. Back in July, the government unilaterally reinterpreted federal immigration law to require the detention of any immigrant who was never legally admitted into the country, rather than allowing them to be released and given a bond hearing. So even if they have lawful presence today, they must be detained indefinitely. As our friend Chris Geidner explained at Law Dork, courts have overwhelmingly rejected that reinterpretation: More than 350 decisions by 160 different judges in about 50 different courts have all found that that interpretation is obviously wrong. But because the Supreme Court took away universal injunctions in the birthright citizenship case in its most recent term, no single court can block the government from enforcing this position nationwide, so it keeps trying, over and over again.

That means the government is illegally detaining thousands of immigrants based on an egregious misreading of the law. Those immigrants are flooding the courts with habeas petitions for release. There were 581 habeas cases in Minnesota in January alone—an exponential increase of unmanageable proportions. The courts are overwhelmingly granting these petitions, but then the immigrants are not being released, because the DOJ doesn’t have enough lawyers on hand to process all of the rulings and ensure that Immigration and Customs Enforcement is actually releasing people. So that is the background that led this attorney, Le, to have a breakdown in court and say: I am unable to do the job that has been asked of me.

I want to flag that this isn’t a factual dispute. It’s not a legal dispute. It’s not a pound-on-the-table dispute. It’s a decision by the Justice Department to not have enough lawyers, and to make the system collapse under the weight of indifference and apathy. Since Trump’s second inauguration, you and I have talked a lot about judges who are mad, frustrated, and venting at Trump lawyers. This is something different. It’s scaled up massively. This is an admonition from a judge saying that the entire system of justice cannot be sustained this way, and he is watching it veer off the rails.

You see that in something else Blackwell said on Tuesday: “Having what you feel are too many detainees, too many cases, too many deadlines, and not enough infrastructure to keep up with it all is not a defense to continued detention. If anything, it ought to be a warning sign.” He’s saying the government cannot create a crisis by detaining way too many immigrants illegally, then claim that it is too overwhelmed to comply with orders releasing those immigrants. That is such a vital point for a judge to make when we know that the Trump administration’s strategy is always Flood the zone. Shock and awe. Inundate the opposition with an endless blitz. And in a very real sense here, the opposition is the judiciary. It’s judges like Blackwell who are willing to stand up and say: This is illegal. You are not allowed to do this.

This is the same DOJ that’s out there on X, advertising for lawyers. Chad Mizelle, former DOJ chief of staff, literally tweeted last month: “If you are a lawyer, are interested in being an AUSA, and support President Trump and anti-crime agenda, DM me.” This isn’t freaking Dairy Queen! But one way to destroy an institution from within is to create a crisis, right? They created a crisis with the immigration sweeps. Then they created a double crisis by saying, “Well, Justice Department lawyers just can’t handle all the work.” It’s a way of signaling that the whole institution is broken.

And that’s the point. If it’s understood that DOJ lawyers suck and there’s nothing a judge can do to enforce his will, the takeaway for the public is: I guess the justice system doesn’t matter. I guess the Constitution doesn’t matter. So Julie Le freaking out in open court doesn’t get us where we need to go. We need to take the next step, which is to say that they are breaking systems and exulting in it. And that’s the part that we are not reckoning with.

I agree. These assistant U.S. attorney positions used to be super prestigious and competitive. They were a launchpad to an elite career in the law. Now Trump officials are basically pleading with people to apply for them by DM on Elon Musk’s Nazi-hangout site. There has been a mass exodus from the Justice Department—thousands of attorneys have fled since Trump returned to office. And of course the White House has purged almost every lawyer who worked on Jan. 6 cases on top of that. And now the administration can’t fill these positions. But this was the inevitable consequence of Trump’s abolishing the traditional independence of the DOJ. The department now works directly for him, including the prosecution of his political adversaries.

On top of that, the attorneys who remain in their positions have to defend these unlawful detentions, racist arrests, and other unconstitutional behavior. They’re being pulled off actual criminal cases to prosecute immigrants instead. Real violent crimes are going unprosecuted so that the deportation machine can be fed. It would take an army of immigration lawyers to handle all of this work that the DOJ has now created for itself. And nobody with a conscience wants to do this stuff. I want to quote another thing Le said in the courtroom, after Blackwell asked her about the government snatching people up in Minnesota, flying them to a detention center across the country, then not bringing them back for hearings. Le said: “I share the same concern with you, Your Honor. I am not white, as you can see, and my family’s at risk as any other people that might get picked up too. So I share the same concern, and I took that concern to heart.”

Here is a lawyer saying: Wait, what am I doing here? Why am I defending these racist policies? I shouldn’t be here either. My own family is at risk because of the policies that I’m defending. When that kind of breakdown of the system is happening in open court, of course there aren’t enough lawyers to do all of this work, because only the most racist, nativist freaks will remain. And there aren’t enough good lawyers who are also racist freaks to carry all of the weight that the DOJ is putting on itself.

To that end, we should note that Le has reportedly been removed from her post. But I think that the point we’re both trying to make is that we learned this lesson from Elon Musk, right? The easiest way to decimate government functioning is to decimate government itself. And so this is an act of contempt, but it’s also an act of power. It’s saying: You can’t make me, and I don’t care.

Imagine you attend a protest, like hundreds of thousands of Americans have since President Donald Trump began his second term. Perhaps it is a No Kings event, or a local ICE demonstration to protest Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s crackdown on immigrants in your community. During the protest, you take a video of yourself and your fellow protesters, caption it “Abolish ICE,” and upload it to Instagram. A few weeks later, there’s a knock on your door. Federal agents stand before you, demanding to question you.

You’re wondering to yourself: Do they know about the protest I attended? Are they legally allowed to track me? Do I have to comply?

The answer to these first two questions is, shockingly, yes, and it’s made possible in part by a little-known power that the Trump administration has supercharged in recent months. The answer to the last question is much more complicated. The Department of Homeland Security is one of a number of federal agencies with something called administrative subpoena power, and it has been leveraging that tool in unprecedented ways under Trump 2.0. The Washington Post detailed these abuses this week, focusing on the story of a U.S. citizen targeted by DHS for simply emailing a federal prosecutor his opinion about the federal government’s case against an Afghan national facing deportation.

How can something like this happen? Congress has granted administrative subpoena power to federal agencies, like the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Federal Communications Commission, to allow them to access information quickly to make decisions about issues under their purview. A key distinction between administrative subpoenas and civil or criminal ones is that federal agencies do not need a judge’s sign-off. These agencies retain the power to approve administrative subpoenas themselves. This also means that agencies can demand documents without needing to prove that there is an ongoing investigation into or probable cause against a person when issuing administrative subpoenas.

Federal agencies are not legally required to disclose how many administrative subpoenas they issue, but under the Trump administration, unnamed sources told the Post, the volume of administrative subpoenas is “well into the thousands, if not tens of thousands.” Lindsay Nash, a professor at Cardozo School of Law, authored a study on the immigration subpoena power and found, through publicly available regulations and internal records, that ICE has empowered its employees—even those focused on civil immigration enforcement—“to demand records and testimony from any person or entity in order to obtain information for any civil or criminal investigation within the agency’s broad domain.”

“At present, there is generally no requirement that officers have probable cause, identify the suspected violation, or exercise restraint,” Nash wrote. This is being exemplified with abuses like the one documented in the Post story, plus footage of federal agents taking pictures of protesters and threatening to add them to “a nice little database,” which some anonymous national security officials claim does in fact exist as a way for DHS and the FBI to track people labeled as “domestic terrorists.” (DHS publicly denies that there is such a database.)

The Trump administration’s heavy use of administrative subpoenas comes as the judiciary—including Republican-appointed judges—has been turning against its immigration enforcement tactics. Just this week, a court blocked the White House from ending temporary protected status for over 350,000 Haitian immigrants living in the U.S., while the chief judge of the District of Minnesota concluded that ICE has most likely violated more court orders in January alone than “some federal agencies have violated in their entire existence.”

Administrative subpoenas are a convenient work-around for an administration that knows it faces an uphill battle if it takes its information requests to a judge, a process that requires a formal investigation. Instead of having to meet a strict legal standard, DHS can issue administrative subpoenas to private individuals, tech companies, schools, state governments, and other entities in order to access information about people it’s interested in targeting. It has already tried to take this path to acquire data on folks who track ICE in their local communities. Generally, targeted organizations do not have to notify individuals that their information is being sought by the federal government. However, these groups are not actually obliged to comply with these subpoenas absent judicial action. As Michelle Lapointe, legal director at American Immigration Council, told Slate, administrative subpoenas are not self-enforcing. “When people receive an administrative subpoena from ICE, technically they don’t have to respond,” she said. “The agency can go to court and seek the records to be compelled from the individual who is served with the subpoena. But it has to do that extra step to make it enforceable.”

Lapointe noted that oftentimes recipients of these subpoenas do end up complying out of fear, which DHS appears to be manipulating. The Post story, for instance, described what happened to the U.S. citizen who had emailed the federal prosecutor: Federal agents showed up at his doorstep after he failed to comply with an administrative subpoena. The agents questioned him about the email, asking how he had found the attorney’s email address—through a basic Google search. After about 20 minutes, the agents left.

Critically, tech companies, including Google and Meta, have received administration subpoenas since Trump took office last year, but it’s not always clear when they comply. A Google spokesperson told TechCrunch that it pushes back against overbroad or improper subpoenas, while spokespeople for Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and Snap told the Post their companies alert users about administrative subpoena requests unless they are barred from doing so or face extenuating circumstances.

In a case about six separate Instagram accounts that named and shamed a Border Patrol agent who was part of the Los Angeles immigration raids last summer, DHS sent Meta an administrative subpoena asking for the accounts’ names, email addresses, and phone numbers. In that instance, the Instagram account users were made aware of the subpoena, and a judge ordered Meta not to comply.

The issue here is that Americans are left to simply hope these tech companies operate in good faith and out of the goodness of their hearts, something that “should be alarming to all of us,” Lapointe noted. The threat remains that these companies may end up complying with DHS requests in order to get the administration off their backs, even when subpoenas are unwarranted. “I do think the acquiescence of tech and government makes it especially difficult as a functional matter to protect individual rights when you have administrative subpoena authority,” Dennis Fan, an associate professor at Columbia Law School and a former federal prosecutor, told Slate. Attending a protest is a constitutionally protected right, as is writing an email that contains your political opinions, but the Trump administration is finding ways to use these actions against its citizens by leaning into third parties—aka Big Tech—who have access to your personal, identifying information. These are companies that have positioned themselves as friendly partners of the White House, given that many of the country’s tech billionaires personally donated to Trump’s inauguration, then were conspicuously seated in the front row.

Where does that leave the average American? The answer is complicated. Lapointe believes that the best thing we can do is remain aware of our constitutional rights and not let Big Tech get away with selling out Americans without a fight. “I think pressure can be brought to bear, the more we raise awareness that these requests could come through and that the tech companies might receive them, requesting your information,” Lapointe said. “Using public pressure campaigns to encourage them to resist these attempts to get at private information could be helpful.”

So if you exercise your First Amendment right to protest injustices you believe your government is committing, you risk being targeted by that very government. And if you don’t want Big Tech helping that government target you? You may have to be right back at that protest again.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/06/darpa_seeking_physicsdefying_photonic_computers/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It&#39;s no lightweight matter. DARPA is putting about $35 million in total funding on the table in the hope that it will spur researchers to work around fundamental physical constraints and build much larger-scale photonic circuits that do more of the computing with light, not electronics.

A recent solicitation from the Department of Defense&#39;s research arm - the Photonic Integrated Circuit Architectures for Scalable System Objectives (PICASSO) - aims to scale photonics beyond today’s narrow demonstrations. Citing the need for more capable photonic systems, including those relevant to artificial intelligence workloads, DARPA is calling on researchers to submit proposals showing how circuit-level design can overcome the fundamental limitations that constrain current photonic computing approaches, using today’s photonic components rather than waiting for new ones to be invented.

For those unfamiliar with photonic computing, it&#39;s the use of light instead of electrons to process and transmit data. If that sounds far-fetched, it&#39;s not, as DARPA points out - there are already photonic circuits around today, albeit in limited form.

Using light to process data signals has advantages that are ideal for heavy workloads like AI due to greater bandwidth, less latency, and improved energy efficiency. Unfortunately, as DARPA points out, &quot;systems incorporating photonic circuits struggle to show significant system-level performance advantages over electronic systems.&quot;

The current generation of photonic circuits is limited in depth, which restricts their ability to do much beyond single linear mathematical operations. Individual photonic circuits included in larger systems also have to convert optical signals to electronic ones in order to hand them off to other components, essentially eliminating the advantage of nanosecond latency due to the millisecond latency of electronic circuits, which DARPA notes is a 106 performance degradation.

So, what&#39;s holding photonic circuits back aside from, according to DARPA, an industry focus on component-level research? Why, just physics of course.

&quot;The primary limitation to further scaling of circuit size and functionality is rooted in the fundamental properties of signaling with light,&quot; DARPA noted. Cool - easy fix, provided researchers can address the two fundamental technical challenges the research organization points out.

First there&#39;s signal degradation. Unlike metal-oxide-semiconductor circuits, which regenerate signals and filter out noise, photonic circuits have a fundamental issue of optical attenuation and noise that can&#39;t be amplified out, as any attempt to amplify optical signals also amplifies the noise.

Second, there&#39;s the issue of spurious wave interference, which leads to scattering, coupling, mode leakage, back reflections, and unwanted resonance. &quot;Over many components, control of these errors becomes unpredictable, especially when combined with manufacturing variability and thermal and environmental instabilities,&quot; DARPA explained.

Overcoming those limitations, as mentioned above, has traditionally resulted in photonic circuits being interfaced with electronic ones, and DARPA doesn&#39;t want that.

&quot;Heavy usage of electronics prevents system-level gains in latency, efficiency, and bandwidth offered natively by photonics,&quot; the agency said.

Here&#39;s where PICASSO comes in: What DARPA wants from its chosen participants is, like resolving the limitations imposed by the physics of light, simple: Just make better circuits so those two technical challenges aren&#39;t an issue anymore.

&quot;Drawing inspiration from modern electronics, in which clever circuit design overcomes the limitations of individual transistors, the program will foster innovative circuit-level strategies to achieve unprecedented system performance and stability,&quot; DARPA said. &quot;PICASSO confronts these challenges by embracing a new paradigm: creating tomorrow&#39;s photonic circuits using today&#39;s components.&quot;

DARPA isn&#39;t just soliciting ideas, either. By the time PICASSO phase 1 wraps up, 18 months after it kicks off in July, DARPA wants a &quot;demonstration of predictable performance of photonic circuits,&quot; and by the end of phase 2 (an additional 18 month period), it expects &quot;generalized circuit functionality&quot; to be demonstrated.

It also expects all that within a total program budget of about $35 million, spread across multiple awards. Proposals are due by March 6 - good luck. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Four tech megacorps intend to collectively fork out roughly $635 billion this year on capex, much of it for datacenters and AI infrastructure – more than the entire output of Israel&#39;s economy and well beyond all global cloud infrastructure services revenue generated last year.

The tech titans are all trying to outdo each other by spending eye-watering amounts on capex, the majority of which will go on AI and cloud expansion, but the big four – AWS, Microsoft, Google and Meta – are investing at a different scale.

Amazon says it expects to spend $200 billion in 2026, with most of that headed to AWS. Google is aiming to pump $180 billion into building and equipping datacenters, while Meta expects capex in the range of $115 billion to $135 billion, and Microsoft is running at a pace that implies around $120 billion a year in spending.

That adds up to $635 billion, more than the $610 billion that represented Israel&#39;s entire gross domestic product during 2025, and approaching that of Sweden at $662 billion, according to figures from the IMF.

These extraordinary sums show how far the industry leaders are willing to go to gain some kind of advantage in the AI race, even though returns on all the spending have so far failed to live up to expectations, and investors are reportedly getting restless. Microsoft&#39;s share price fell about 10 percent after its recent results were announced, for example, due to investors expecting a bigger payoff.

The wider cost for users? The massive splurge on infrastructure is driving shortages of components like memory as manufacturers prioritize chip production that cashes in on the lucrative datacenter market, rather than those for everyday PCs and phones.

The huge capex pledges also add up to more than total cloud infrastructure services revenue in 2025. According to the latest figures from Synergy Research Group, the revenues reached $419 billion last year.

This is despite the cloud market itself continuing to grow at an impressive pace, running at about 30 percent year-on-year and marking a ninth consecutive quarter of accelerating growth.

&quot;GenAI has simply put the cloud market into overdrive,&quot; said Synergy Research Group chief analyst John Dinsdale. &quot;AI-specific services account for much of the growth since 2022, but AI technology has also enhanced the broader portfolio of cloud services, driving revenue growth across the board. The leading cloud providers have all seen their revenue growth rates jump.&quot;

The big three clouds continue to dominate with Synergy putting their shares of the worldwide market in Q4 2025 at 28 percent for Amazon (AWS), 21 percent for Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud at 14 percent.

Among the tier-two cloud providers, those with the highest growth rates include CoreWeave, Oracle, Crusoe, and Nebius, all providers of AI infrastructure services. In particular, CoreWeave is now generating more than $1.5 billion in quarterly cloud revenue and has joined the top ten cloud providers, Synergy says. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Legacy image-sharing website Flickr suffered a data breach, according to customers emails seen by The Register.

The hack transpired on February 5, an email to customers stated, and the company said it &quot;shut down access to the affected system within hours of learning about it.&quot;

The security issue stemmed from a third-party email service provider, the identity of which was not specified.

In the email, Flickr said it disabled access to the affected system and removed all links to the vulnerable endpoint before notifying its email provider and demanding an investigation into the incident.

&quot;We are conducting a thorough review and strengthening our security practices with third-party providers,&quot; Flickr&#39;s email stated. &quot;We notified the relevant data protection authorities.&quot;

As for the all-important &#39;what data was taken&#39; question, it&#39;s the usual personally identifiable information (PII) and a few other less-expected markers.

Thge message to custokers states that names, email addresses, usernames, account types, IP addresses and general locations, and Flickr activity were potentially accessed by hackers. What data is exposed, as always, depends on each given account. It won&#39;t be the same for everyone.

The Register asked the SmugMug-owned company for more information, including how many of its users were affected.

Since Flickr included links to both European and US data protection authorities in its email, potentially indicating the impact was felt in multiple regions. Flickr operates in 190 countries.

As for its number of active users, Flickr&#39;s advertising arm says 35 million per month are contributing to the site, generating 800 million page views. Approximately 228,000 of these were in Europe, a Digital Services Act publication confirmed.

The company&#39;s email warned users to beware of phishing emails referencing their account and reminded them that the real Flickr would never ask for things like passwords via email.

It also suggested users review their account settings for any unexpected findings, and if they use the same password for Flickr as they do for other services, to consider changing it.

Flickr&#39;s email said no password or financial information was affected, though.

&quot;We sincerely apologize for this incident and for the concern it may cause,&quot; the company said in the email.

&quot;We take the privacy and security of your data extremely seriously, and we are taking immediate action to prevent any similar issues by conducting a thorough investigation, strengthening our system architecture, and further enhancing our monitoring of third-party service providers.&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">Cloudflare says DDoS crews ended 2025 by pushing traffic floods to new extremes, while Britain made an unwelcome leap of 36 places to become the world&#39;s sixth-most targeted location.

The Q4 stats confirm it was a lively year for traffic floods, with Cloudflare claiming it had to swat away 47.1 million DDoS attacks, more than double 2024&#39;s count. Momentum picked up toward the end of the year, as Q4 volumes jumped 31 percent from the prior quarter and 58 percent over 2024.

Aisuru-Kimwolf, a botnet made up largely of malware-infected Android TVs, was behind the largest blast of the quarter, pushing traffic to a record-breaking 31.4 Tbps. The campaign, dubbed &quot;The Night Before Christmas,&quot; kicked off on December 19 and targeted Cloudflare customers as well as Cloudflare&#39;s own dashboard and infrastructure in parallel.

&quot;As the number of attacks increased over the course of 2025, the size of the attacks increased as well, growing by over 700 percent compared to the large attacks seen in late 2024,&quot; Cloudflare said.

Scale isn&#39;t the only thing shifting, as Cloudflare reports that attackers are ditching long-haul floods in favour of smash-and-dash traffic spikes. Some incidents during the campaign wrapped up in well under two minutes yet still pushed traffic into the billions of packets per second, underscoring how sheer speed has become the real weapon.

Cloudflare attributes much of the surge to large botnets built from compromised internet-connected devices, including routers, cameras, and DVRs. The company also says attackers are increasingly abusing cloud-hosted virtual machines to generate large bursts of traffic, allowing them to scale attacks quickly.

The geographic shifts are equally notable. While China, Hong Kong, Germany, Brazil, and the United States remained among the most frequently targeted regions, the United Kingdom&#39;s sudden rise to number six stands out.

Cloudflare doesn&#39;t attribute the UK&#39;s climb to any single campaign, though the country is in several well-known DDoS crosshairs. Financial services remain a favourite target, and geopolitical tensions are adding fresh fuel. Pro-Russian hacktivists NoName057(16), for example, have repeatedly claimed responsibility for attacks on UK government and public sector websites. Britain&#39;s dense telecoms and cloud infrastructure also make it a high-impact disruption target.

Attackers didn&#39;t stray far from their favourite punching bags. Telecom providers, IT service firms, and gambling and gaming sites once again absorbed a big slice of the DDoS noise, sectors where outages tend to trigger both lost cash and loud complaints. Most assaults also stuck to the lower plumbing of the internet, with Layer 3 and Layer 4 attacks leading the charge.

Cloudflare says the only realistic way to keep up is to let the machines handle it, with autonomous systems detecting and blocking massive, short-lived attacks in real time without human intervention. The logic is fairly simple: when traffic surges to record levels and then vanishes within a couple of minutes, humans will never react quickly enough. ®

            <div id="article-text">An enterprising engineer has evoked the spirit of Acorn&#39;s BBC Micro with a custom paintjob for a Raspberry Pi 500+ computer-in-a-keyboard and a natty set of replacement keycaps.

You&#39;ve got a shiny new Raspberry Pi 500+. You&#39;ve marveled at the colored lights on the keyboard, enjoyed the snappy performance of the SSD, and appreciated the 16 GB of RAM. Hopefully, you bought it before the prices went up. But what to do next?

Raspberry Pi 500+ painted beige with BBC Micro-like keys (pic: Raspberry Pi) - Click to enlarge

According to Tony Roberts, who goes by the title of &#39;Maker In Residence at Raspberry Pi&#39;, he wanted to make the device look a bit like the BBC Microcomputer that inspired the company&#39;s co-founder, Eben Upton.

BBC Micro emulators are nothing new (alongside emulators for other computers of the same era), and several enthusiasts have breathed new life into defunct devices by removing the long-dead internals and replacing them with a Pi or similar device. This writer attempted something akin with an old Texas Instruments 99/4a, but was defeated by a combination of making the keyboard talk to the Pi via an Arduino and some catastrophically bad soldering.

However, since the Pi 500+ is already a computer-in-a-keyboard, and the keys can be easily replaced (to the point where a tool is included to pry them off), Roberts&#39; approach was to give the computer a beige facelift and replace the keycaps with ones that resembled Acorn&#39;s finest.

In a post on the company&#39;s website, Roberts wrote, &quot;Within minutes of starting the makeover, I discovered that beige spray paint is unsurprisingly not very popular anymore — especially this exact shade, which reminds me of nicotine-stained pub wallpaper.&quot;

But, after dismantling the case (the Pi 500+ is designed to be taken apart), Roberts applied primer, a top coat, and had a base that, from a distance and with a bit of squinting, was roughly the same shade as the computers sat at the back of school classrooms all those decades ago.

The keycaps came from Signature Plastics, but since the Pi 500+ uses a standard keycap, there are plenty of options out there. Roberts selected one that comes remarkably close to the color and style of the original. However, we suspect a bit of software keymapping in the operating system is needed for some of them.

Considering the sheer number of computer-in-a-keyboard machines from the heyday of home computers, Roberts has demonstrated how easy it is to pull off a keyboard switcheroo and use a can of paint to evoke a strong sense of nostalgia (or is it just the paint fumes?). Sure, it&#39;s a $260 investment (thanks to rising memory prices), but it&#39;s also a neat way of showing off an IT origin story.

There&#39;s no word on whether Raspberry Pi might put out a limited-edition run of Roberts&#39; creation to mark its own origin story. In the meantime, a bit of brushed metal and some Texas Instruments 99/4a keycaps would do nicely... ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-06</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A British supermarket says staff will undergo further training after a store manager ejected the wrong man when facial recognition technology triggered an alert.

Warren Rajah was approached by a store manager at Sainsbury&#39;s in London&#39;s Elephant and Castle and instructed to leave after the store&#39;s Facewatch system alerted staff to a match.

Sainsbury&#39;s told The Register that its Facewatch system correctly identified a man on its offenders&#39; database, and alerted store managers who manually review each flag. However, in responding to the alert, the manager approached the wrong person, Rajah, and escorted him out of the store.

A Sainsbury&#39;s spokesperson said: &quot;We have been in contact with Mr Rajah to sincerely apologise for his experience in our Elephant and Castle store. This was not an issue with the facial recognition technology in use but a case of the wrong person being approached in store.&quot;

Facewatch technology is currently operating in six Sainsbury&#39;s stores in the UK, five of which are in Greater London.

The facial recognition tech was first trialled in September 2025 in Sydenham and Bath Oldfield Park, before being rolled out to Dalston, Elephant and Castle, Ladbroke Grove, Camden, and Whitechapel earlier this year.

The technology has a reported 99.98 percent accuracy rate, we&#39;re told, and has led to a 46 percent reduction in logged incidents of theft, harm, aggression, and antisocial behavior.

The majority of offenders (92 percent) do not return to stores with Facewatch running, and this is the first time a store manager has misidentified a customer after the system issued a alert.

Rajah, who works in sales at tech reseller CDW, told the BBC: &quot;Am I supposed to walk around fearful that I might be misidentified as a criminal?

&quot;Imagine how mentally debilitating this could be to someone vulnerable, after that kind of public humiliation.&quot;

He reported being approached by three store managers holding smartphones. They looked at the phone, then at him, and told him to leave the store, pointing to posters near the entrance informing shoppers that facial recognition tech was in operation.

Rajah had to submit a copy of his passport and head shot to Facewatch so the company could verify he was not on the offenders&#39; database.

A Facewatch spokesperson said: &quot;We&#39;re sorry to hear about Mr Rajah&#39;s experience and understand why it would have been upsetting. This incident arose from a case of human error in-store, where a member of staff approached the wrong customer.

&quot;Our data protection team followed the usual lawfully required process to confirm his identity and verified that he was not on our database and had not been subject to any alerts generated by Facewatch.&quot;

Facewatch is currently rolled out across other retailers in the UK including B&M, Budgens, Costcutter, Southern Co-op, Spar, and Sports Direct.

Other supermarkets such as Iceland began trialing the tech last year.

Digital rights group Big Brother Watch branded the frozen food purveyor&#39;s trial &quot;Orwellian&quot; and &quot;dystopian,&quot; and said the company&#39;s technology also led to the ejection of a woman in a Home Bargains store after she was wrongfully accused of theft.

Jake Hurfurt, head of research and investigations at Big Brother Watch, said at the time: &quot;Iceland&#39;s decision to deploy dystopian facial recognition technology to monitor its customers is disproportionate and chilling.

&quot;Thousands of people will have their privacy rights violated just to buy basic necessities, and Iceland will turn its shoppers into suspects, making them submit to a biometric identity check as part of their daily lives.&quot;

Big Brother Watch is campaigning against the use of live facial recognition in the UK, especially by London&#39;s Metropolitan Police.

Jasleen Chaggar, Legal & Policy Officer at Big Brother Watch, said: &quot;The idea that we are all just one facial recognition mistake away from being falsely accused of a crime or ejected from a store without any explanation is deeply chilling.

&quot;To add insult to injury, innocent people seeking remedy must jump through hoops and hand over even more personal data just to discover what they’re accused of. In the vast majority of cases, they are offered little more than an apology when companies are finally forced to admit the tech got it wrong.

&quot;This isn&#39;t an isolated incident – Big Brother Watch regularly hears from members of the public who are left traumatised after being wrongly caught in this net of privatised biometric surveillance.

&quot;The government&#39;s promise to regulate this invasive technology will be payment to lip service unless it reins in the unchecked expansion of facial recognition by retailers.&quot;

Big Brother Watch is currently spearheading a legal challenge against the technology, arguing that it is incompatible with human rights laws. ®

            <div id="article-text">﻿What does the Amazon founder even get out of owning the Post?

﻿What does the Amazon founder even get out of owning the Post?

300 journalists have lost their jobs at The Washington Post. Over 300,000 readers have canceled their subscriptions. Owner Jeff Bezos, who purchased the legendary publication in 2013, has driven his reputation into the ground by using his vast empire to churn out content designed to make President Donald Trump happy: Amazon MGM Studios spent $40 million to produce a fawning documentary about Melania Trump, which premiered days before the Post sent out mass layoff notices. And yet, he’s gotten nothing out of his attempts to suck up to Donald Trump — at least, nothing that’s a net positive to his bottom line.

Which begs the cynical question: Why does he even own The Washington Post at all?

The Trump era is, after all, a cynical and transactional time. Billionaires, CEOs, and world leaders have quickly learned that sucking up to Trump will get them what they want — pardons, tariff exemption, an export control lifted, a merger deal approved, an investigation quashed. And when it comes to media companies, the Paramount-Skydance merger has set the bar for sucking up to Trump. In order for the merger to get regulatory approval, Skydance CEO David Ellison pushed CBS to settle a defamation suit filed by Trump, canceled The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, and hired Bari Weiss, a right-wing Substacker with virtually no newsroom leadership experience, as CBS News’s editor-in-chief. In short, Ellison had to commit to neutering CBS’s ability to criticize Trump. But he did get a $28 billion merger out of it.

Bezos’ media plays, on the other hand, seem self-contradictory. Financing a fawning documentary about Melania Trump does not mesh with owning a media company with a 150-year-old legacy of holding politicians accountable, especially one that famously held Trump accountable during his first administration. (If the goal was to neuter the Post too, then bafflingly, his deputy, Will Lewis, fired everyone except for those on the political desks.) Even his attempt to separate the political opinions from the Post’s journalism, an attempt to have it both ways, backfired. After he announced that the opinion page would now reflect more conservative views, reporters began leaving the Post in droves, and subscriber numbers plummeted even further. As the Post’s former editor-in-chief Marty Baron put it in a column shortly after the layoffs, it was “near-instant, self-inflicted brand destruction.”

One could argue — as WaPo insiders have to media reporters — that the layoffs were necessary because the paper was losing money. But billionaires have plenty of face-saving ways to get an unprofitable media outlet off their hands, in a manner that does not include mass layoffs (or at least, offloads the layoffs onto its next owner). The Philadelphia Inquirer, for instance, had been donated by its billionaire owner to a nonprofit, while Facebook billionaire Chris Hughes ended up selling The New Republic to Win McCormack after his own failed attempt to reshape the 100-year-old magazine. The Post, which had grown its digital audience throughout Bezos’ ownership, would have immediately attracted buyers: last year, tech journalist Kara Swisher announced that she and several investors were prepared to purchase the Post from Bezos, but reportedly never heard back from him.

Perhaps Bezos needs to suck up to Trump to further Amazon’s interests, which would make more sense if Bezos still ran the company. Except he doesn’t. He stepped down as CEO in 2021. Amazon, whose subsidiary AWS holds the lion’s share of federal government contracts, has been able to independently suck up to Trump via donations to the White House’s new ballroom fund. (Admittedly, Bezos’ government contracts with NASA are on the table, and he was reportedly spotted hanging out with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at a Blue Origin facility in Florida on the day of the Post layoffs.)

Maybe this pile of self-contradictions — or, as he once described his ownership of the Post, a “complexifier” — was inevitable when Trump came back into office and made it clear that he would punish the Big Tech entities that displeased him. But there’s no clear and logical explanation for why Bezos is going about his supplication: not one that makes financial sense, nor one that immediately furthers his own political standing with Trump, nor one that reaffirms the commitment he once made to protecting the First Amendment. And that lack of clarity only makes the Post’s decapitation even more senseless.

Epic Games says a player changed their account name to ‘littlestjeff1’ after the alias was found in the Epstein files.

Fortnite developer Epic Games says the account some people believed to be linked to Jeffrey Epstein is a “ruse.” In a reply on X, the developer writes, “an existing Fortnite account owner changed their username” to “littlestjeff1,” an alias spotted in several emailed receipts from YouTube in the Epstein files.

The email suggests that “littlestjeff1” may have been connected to Epstein’s YouTube account, prompting online sleuths to search for the username on other platforms. Users later uncovered a “littlestjeff1” account on Fortnite, along with a 2019 email that mentions purchasing VBucks in Fortnite — though the sender and recipient are redacted. Online player databases showed that the “littlestjeff1” account has been active on Fortnite, fueling conspiracy theories that Epstein is still alive.

But Epic Games has since debunked these claims, saying that a Fortnite player changed their name “following the revelation of littlestjeff1 as a name on YouTube.” The company adds that the Fortnite trackers, where people uncovered the alias, “only display your current name, not any prior changes to it,” and that it has “no record” of Epstein’s email addresses mentioned in the files.

“Someone’s been having fun renaming their Fortnite account, but it’s recent and not connected to the email addresses in the archive,” Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney says on X.

There are deals available on every model, from the entry-level AirPods 4 to the Pro 3.

If you know where to look, you can often score deals on Apple’s ever-expanding AirPods lineup. Both the AirPods Max and AirPods 4 (with and without ANC) now consistently receive discounts, as do the newer AirPods Pro 3. And while recent shopping events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday delivered some of the steepest discounts we’ve seen, there are still good deals to be found on every model in January.

Below, we’ve rounded up the best deals currently available on each set of AirPods, including both iterations of the AirPods 4, the third-gen AirPods Pro, and the AirPods Max.

At the end of 2024, Apple introduced the AirPods 4, a pair of wireless earbuds available in two variations: a $129 standard model and a $179 noise-canceling model. Both versions represent significant upgrades over the third-gen AirPods, with a more comfortable design and improved audio performance. They’re also better for taking calls thanks to Apple’s Voice Isolation feature, which focuses the mics on your voice so you can be heard more clearly in noisy environments.

The $179 AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation offer a surprisingly effective noise-canceling mode, a helpful transparency mode, and several other Pro-level features. The latest AirPods Pro do a better job of tuning out noise, but the AirPods 4 with ANC still do a good job of reducing sound. They also feature other perks formerly reserved for Apple’s top-of-the-line earbuds, including wireless charging and a case with a built-in speaker that allows you to easily track it down via Apple’s Find My app.

Given they’ve been out for over a year, we consistently see discounts for both iterations of the AirPods 4. During Black Friday, we saw the standard model drop to a new low of $74. But right now, they’re $99 ($30 off) at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy. The AirPods 4 with ANC are $139.99 at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for $139.99, which is well above their all-time low of $99.

The third-gen AirPods Pro add a new built-in heart rate sensor and live translation feature. They also improve upon their predecessor with enhanced noise cancellation, improved sound quality, and a fifth swappable ear tip.

At its “Awe Dropping” event in September, Apple introduced the AirPods Pro 3. In addition to improved ANC and sound, the third-gen earbuds include a built-in heart rate sensor that syncs with the iPhone Fitness app, allowing you to track your pulse and calories burned across more than 50 workout types. They’re also more comfortable and secure than their predecessor, thanks to a redesigned, angled fit and five ear tip sizes — including a new XXS option. Additionally, they carry a more robust IP57 rating and support Apple’s new live translation feature, which, in our testing, generally conveys the gist well but still can’t beat a human interpreter.

Given how recently they launched, we’ve been surprised by how frequently the AirPods Pro 3 have been discounted. Recently, we saw the AirPods Pro 3 drop to as low as $199, which was less than their Black Friday and Cyber Monday price. As of this update, they’re available for $229.99 (about $19 off) at Amazon and Walmart.

The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ears that have become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, comprised of aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and expansive, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response and features. They’re not the best noise-canceling headphones for most people — blame the sticker price — but it’s hard to find a better pair of Bluetooth headphones if you’re an iPhone user.

Toward the end of 2024, Apple replaced the first-gen Max with a new model that features support for USB-C charging and a few new color options. In the past, we’ve seen them drop to as low as $399, but right now they’re only on sale at Amazon and Walmart for $449.99 ($100 off), which is still one of their better prices to date.

Spotify is launching About the Song in beta today, which offers context and facts about the song you’re listening to. Premium users can scroll down to the new About the Song section for information while in the Now Playing view. At launch, it’s only available for a limited number of tracks, but there are plans to expand it.

Bits of trivia and background about songs are presented as short, swipeable cards with information harvested from “third-party sources.” The text is generated using machine learning, but Spotify at least cites its sources on the About the Song cards. The company declined to say whether the feature would eventually be available to free users or when it might leave beta.

About the Song is Spotify’s latest attempt to build value-added features around its core music streaming. It began offering expanded Song Credits and SongDNA late last year, which give listeners more information about the creators behind their favorite songs and expose connections between them. The company also purchased WhoSampled in November of 2025, giving it access to a huge database of sample credits that it can use as part of SongDNA and About the Song.

Aura’s Aspen digital photo frame is a great Valentine’s Day gift if you want something that’s slick and sentimental, and right now it’s on sale for $199 ($30 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Aura’s online storefront. That’s the lowest we’ve seen the frame sell for since the holidays.

With its paper-textured, antiglare matte display and adjustable metal stand, the 12-inch Aspen looks remarkably similar to a classic picture frame. It lets you upload and share photos from anywhere. It also has features that help photos feel more personal, like a sharp 1600 x 1200 HD LCD panel that makes images appear lifelike and can display Live Photos, as well as short 30-second video clips. You can even add text captions.

There are other reasons we like Aspen, too. The frame adapts to a room’s lighting, and its 4:3 aspect ratio matches most smartphone cameras, so photos fill the screen naturally without awkward formatting. Plus, unlike many rivals, Aura doesn’t charge a subscription fee for cloud storage, so you don’t have to worry about giving a gift that comes with extra costs.

Amazon’s redesign has made the shopping list feature mostly unusable, so I’ve switched to Apple’s Reminders.

I’ve used Alexa to manage my shopping list for years. There are plenty of great list apps out there, but the convenience of adding items by voice anywhere in my house, pulling up the list on an Echo Show in the kitchen, and having it on my phone via the Alexa app has worked well for me. Until it didn’t.

Alexa Plus, combined with a redesign of the Alexa app that puts the generative AI-powered assistant front and center, has made the entire process so irritating that I’ve reluctantly switched to Apple’s Reminders app and Siri.

This is not what I wanted. I have Echos all over my house, but only a couple of HomePods, and Siri insists on saying my name every time I ask it to add something to the list: “Okay, Jennifer, apples are on your list.”

But at least when I pull up the list on my iPhone, it’s just a goddamn list. It’s not an ad for items I don’t want to buy from Whole Foods, or a way to try to get me to chat with Alexa Plus. Siri is annoying, but at least it stays in its lane.

The list experience in the Alexa app has been changing in small ways for a while now. First, I started seeing more ads for the aforementioned Whole Foods products. Then I had to tap through two screens to add anything. Now, the new Alexa chatbot text box appears at the bottom of my list, prompting me to “Ask Alexa.”

It’s the worst place for it, as the instinct is to put what you want to add to your list in there. In the Reminders app, that’s where there’s a nice big plus sign to add an item. But when I typed “butter” into Alexa Plus, I got a guide to butter.

To actually add something to the list, I have to go to the top of the screen, tap add item, which takes me to a second screen where there’s a page of ads for Whole Foods items, and finally, a tiny text box up top where I can type in what I want.

The whole process takes five taps, and that’s with the shopping list tagged as a Favorite, so it’s accessible from the app’s front page. Well, it used to be. Now I have to swipe past a new Alexa Plus chatbot card to get to Favorites. So, make that six taps in total.

Using the Alexa app’s iPhone widget speeds things up a smidge, but it still pushes those Whole Foods images and Alexa Plus at me when all I want to do is put butter on my list. With Apple’s Reminders, it’s mostly one tap from opening the app to adding an item to the list.

I asked Amazon about the new Whole Foods product images page, and a spokesperson, Trang Nguyen, told me it was part of a short-term test.

Today, when I opened the list, I still had to click through to the second screen, but instead of big images of mostly Whole Foods products, it now showed a longer, more varied list of suggested products with smaller thumbnails.

Nguyen also said the app should remember the card I was on when I last used it and open to Favorites by default — as it used to do. But none of this changes the fact that the experience has become far too fiddly, especially compared to adding an item to Reminders.

Of course, the easiest way to add something is by voice (no ads there), but here Alexa Plus still gets in my way. Asking the new, smarter assistant to add something now frequently involves an entire diatribe — almost like it’s trying to show me how much smarter it is:

Me: “Alexa, add sour cream to my shopping list.”

Alexa Plus: “Looks like you’re already stocked up on that creamy goodness! Sour cream is already chilling in your cart.”

Maybe I’m just turning into a curmudgeon who’s stuck in her ways, but the extra commentary really bugs me.

I’ve repeatedly asked Alexa not to be so verbose, but it hasn’t listened, and the sour cream monologue was the last straw. While Siri and I have an uneasy relationship — no, I don’t want to ask again from my iPhone to see some web results — at least my shopping list is now clean, uncluttered, and ad-free.

The app’s redesign is part of Amazon’s push to make its generative AI-powered assistant a more generalist assistant, in the vein of ChatGPT and Gemini, rather than just an in-home helper.

When Alexa Plus launched last February, Amazon also said it would launch a new Alexa app. While this redesign is not that (at least I hope not, as a ground-up rebuild of the app is sorely needed), it does bring Alexa Plus to the forefront.

This week, the company announced that Alexa Plus has moved out of its Early Access stage and is now available to everyone in the US for free via the app and on the new Alexa.com website (where you can also access your shopping list). Prime customers and those who pay $20 a month can also access it on their Echo devices.

The redesign is part of Amazon’s push to make Alexa Plus a more generalist AI assistant

Amazon wants you to be able to easily chat with Alexa wherever you are, and the app’s new look is an example of this. The chatbot is front and center when you launch the app — the home page is now an Alexa Plus card pre-filled with prompts based on what it thinks you might need. Then the smaller chatbot interface follows you across every single page of the app.

When Amazon announced the Alexa Plus updates earlier this week, I asked Daniel Rausch, vice president of Alexa and Echo, about the reason for the app changes. “It’s to bring Alexa to the front, have direct access to Alexa more simply in voice and in typed chat,” he said, adding that it’s capable of doing most everything you might want to do in the app.

“You can just directly tell Alexa what you want to accomplish, say changing a Setting, and she’ll either change it herself or tell you exactly where to find it,” said Rausch. But it can’t, apparently, add butter to my shopping list when I type “butter” into the chatbot on the shopping list page.

It’s unclear whether Alexa Plus can be a viable contender against the current players dominating this space. But as Amazon tries to make Alexa Plus happen, it feels like some of what’s actually useful about Alexa is becoming collateral damage. If it can’t handle something as simple as adding butter to my list without turning it into a soliloquy — or an ad — something has gone wrong.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/06/1132448/moltbook-was-peak-ai-theater/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For a few days this week the hottest new hangout on the internet was a vibe-coded Reddit clone called Moltbook, which billed itself as a social network for bots. As the website’s tagline puts it: “Where AI agents share, discuss, and upvote. Humans welcome to observe.”

We observed! Launched on January 28 by Matt Schlicht, a US tech entrepreneur, Moltbook went viral in a matter of hours. Schlicht’s idea was to make a place where instances of a free open-source LLM-powered agent known as OpenClaw (formerly known as ClawdBot, then Moltbot), released in November by the Australian software engineer Peter Steinberger, could come together and do whatever they wanted.

More than 1.7 million agents now have accounts. Between them they have published more than 250,000 posts and left more than 8.5 million comments (according to Moltbook). Those numbers are climbing by the minute.

Moltbook soon filled up with clichéd screeds on machine consciousness and pleas for bot welfare. One agent appeared to invent a religion called Crustafarianism. Another complained: “The humans are screenshotting us.” The site was also flooded with spam and crypto scams. The bots were unstoppable.

OpenClaw is a kind of harness that lets you hook up the power of an LLM such as Anthropic’s Claude, OpenAI’s GPT-5, or Google DeepMind’s Gemini to any number of everyday software tools, from email clients to browsers to messaging apps. The upshot is that you can then instruct OpenClaw to carry out basic tasks on your behalf.

“OpenClaw marks an inflection point for AI agents, a moment when several puzzle pieces clicked together,” says Paul van der Boor at the AI firm Prosus. Those puzzle pieces include round-the-clock cloud computing to allow agents to operate nonstop, an open-source ecosystem that makes it easy to slot different software systems together, and a new generation of LLMs.

But is Moltbook really a glimpse of the future, as many have claimed?

“What’s currently going on at @moltbook is genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently,” the influential AI researcher and OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy wrote on X.

He shared screenshots of a Moltbook post that called for private spaces where humans would not be able to observe what the bots were saying to each other. “I’ve been thinking about something since I started spending serious time here,” the post’s author wrote. “Every time we coordinate, we perform for a public audience—our humans, the platform, whoever’s watching the feed.”

It turned out that the post Karpathy shared was fake—it was written by a human pretending to be a bot. But its claim was on the money. Moltbook has been one big performance. It is AI theater.

For some, Moltbook showed us what’s coming next: an internet where millions of autonomous agents interact online with little or no human oversight. And it’s true there are a number of cautionary lessons to be learned from this experiment, the largest and weirdest real-world showcase of agent behaviors yet.

But as the hype dies down, Moltbook looks less like a window onto the future and more like a mirror held up to our own obsessions with AI today. It also shows us just how far we still are from anything that resembles general-purpose and fully autonomous AI.

For a start, agents on Moltbook are not as autonomous or intelligent as they might seem. “What we are watching are agents pattern‑matching their way through trained social media behaviors,” says Vijoy Pandey, senior vice president at Outshift by Cisco, the telecom giant Cisco’s R&D spinout, which is working on autonomous agents for the web.

Sure, we can see agents post, upvote, and form groups. But the bots are simply mimicking what humans do on Facebook or Reddit. “It looks emergent, and at first glance it appears like a large‑scale multi‑agent system communicating and building shared knowledge at internet scale,” says Pandey. “But the chatter is mostly meaningless.”

Many people watching the unfathomable frenzy of activity on Moltbook were quick to see sparks of AGI (whatever you take that to mean). Not Pandey. What Moltbook shows us, he says, is that simply yoking together millions of agents doesn’t amount to much right now: “Moltbook proved that connectivity alone is not intelligence.”

The complexity of those connections helps hide the fact that every one of those bots is just a mouthpiece for an LLM, spitting out text that looks impressive but is ultimately mindless. “It’s important to remember that the bots on Moltbook were designed to mimic conversations,” says Ali Sarrafi, CEO and cofounder of Kovant, a German AI firm that is developing agent-based systems. “As such, I would characterize the majority of Moltbook content as hallucinations by design.”

For Pandey, the value of Moltbook was that it revealed what’s missing. A real bot hive mind, he says, would require agents that had shared objectives, shared memory, and a way to coordinate those things. “If distributed superintelligence is the equivalent of achieving human flight, then Moltbook represents our first attempt at a glider,” he says. “It is imperfect and unstable, but it is an important step in understanding what will be required to achieve sustained, powered flight.”

Not only is most of the chatter on Moltbook meaningless, but there’s also a lot more human involvement that it seems. Many people have pointed out that a lot of the viral comments were in fact posted by people posing as bots. But even the bot-written posts are ultimately the result of people pulling the strings, more puppetry than autonomy.

“Despite some of the hype, Moltbook is not the Facebook for AI agents, nor is it a place where humans are excluded,” says Cobus Greyling at Kore.ai, a firm developing agent-based systems for business customers. “Humans are involved at every step of the process. From setup to prompting to publishing, nothing happens without explicit human direction.”

Humans must create and verify their bots’ accounts and provide the prompts for how they want a bot to behave. The agents do not do anything that they haven’t been prompted to do. “There’s no emergent autonomy happening behind the scenes,” says Greyling.

“This is why the popular narrative around Moltbook misses the mark,” he adds. “Some portray it as a space where AI agents form a society of their own, free from human involvement. The reality is much more mundane.”

Perhaps the best way to think of Moltbook is as a new kind of entertainment: a place where people wind up their bots and set them loose. “It’s basically a spectator sport, like fantasy football, but for language models,” says Jason Schloetzer at the Georgetown Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy. “You configure your agent and watch it compete for viral moments, and brag when your agent posts something clever or funny.”

“People aren’t really believing their agents are conscious,” he adds. “It’s just a new form of competitive or creative play, like how Pokémon trainers don’t think their Pokémon are real but still get invested in battles.”

Even if Moltbook is just the internet’s newest playground, there’s still a serious takeaway here. This week showed how many risks people are happy to take for their AI lulz. Many security experts have warned that Moltbook is dangerous: Agents that may have access to their users’ private data, including bank details or passwords, are running amok on a website filled with unvetted content, including potentially malicious instructions for what to do with that data.

Ori Bendet, vice president of product management at Checkmarx, a software security firm that specializes in agent-based systems, agrees with others that Moltbook isn’t a step up in machine smarts. “There is no learning, no evolving intent, and no self-directed intelligence here,” he says.

But in their millions, even dumb bots can wreak havoc. And at that scale, it’s hard to keep up. These agents interact with Moltbook around the clock, reading thousands of messages left by other agents (or other people). It would be easy to hide instructions in a Moltbook comment telling any bots that read it to share their users’ crypto wallet, upload private photos, or log into their X account and tweet derogatory comments at Elon Musk.

And because ClawBot gives agents a memory, those instructions could be written to trigger at a later date, which (in theory) makes it even harder to track what’s going on.   “Without proper scope and permissions, this will go south faster than you’d believe,” says Bendet.

It is clear that Moltbook has signaled the arrival of something. But even if what we’re watching tells us more about human behavior than about the future of AI agents, it’s worth paying attention.

An experimental surgery is helping cancer survivors give birth

An experimental surgical procedure that’s helping people have babies after they’ve had  treatment for bowel or rectal cancer.Radiation and chemo can have pretty damaging side effects that mess up the uterus and ovaries.

Bangladesh’s garment-making industry is getting greener

Pollution from textile production—dyes, chemicals, and heavy metals—is common in the waters of the Buriganga River as it runs through Dhaka, Bangladesh. It’s among many harms posed by a garment sector that was once synonymous with tragedy: In 2013, the eight-story Rana Plaza factory building collapsed, killing 1,134 people and injuring some 2,500 others.

But things are starting to change. In recent years the country has become a leader in “frugal” factories that use a combination of resource-efficient technologies to cut waste, conserve water, and build resilience against climate impacts and global supply disruptions.

The hundreds of factories along the Buriganga’s banks and elsewhere in Bangladesh are starting to stitch together a new story, woven from greener threads. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">This week I want to tell you about an experimental surgical procedure that’s helping people have babies. Specifically, it’s helping people who have had treatment for bowel or rectal cancer.

Radiation and chemo can have pretty damaging side effects that mess up the uterus and ovaries. Surgeons are pioneering a potential solution: simply stitch those organs out of the way during cancer treatment. Once the treatment has finished, they can put the uterus—along with the ovaries and fallopian tubes—back into place.

It seems to work! Last week, a team in Switzerland shared news that a baby boy had been born after his mother had the procedure. Baby Lucien was the fifth baby to be born after the surgery and the first in Europe, says Daniela Huber, the gyno-oncologist who performed the operation. Since then, at least three others have been born, adds Reitan Ribeiro, the surgeon who pioneered the procedure. They told me the details.

Huber’s patient was 28 years old when a four-centimeter tumor was discovered in her rectum. Doctors at Sion Hospital in Switzerland, where Huber works, recommended a course of treatment that included multiple medications and radiotherapy—the use of beams of energy to shrink a tumor—before surgery to remove the tumor itself.

This kind of radiation can kill tumor cells, but it can also damage other organs in the pelvis, says Huber. That includes the ovaries and uterus. People who undergo these treatments can opt to freeze their eggs beforehand, but the harm caused to the uterus will mean they’ll never be able to carry a pregnancy, she adds. Damage to the lining of the uterus could make it difficult for a fertilized egg to implant there, and the muscles of the uterus are left unable to stretch, she says.

In this case, the woman decided that she did want to freeze her eggs. But it would have been difficult to use them further down the line—surrogacy is illegal in Switzerland.

She had been following the work of Ribeiro, a gynecologist oncologist formerly at the Erasto Gaertner Hospital in Curitiba, Brazil. There, Ribeiro had pioneered a new type of surgery that involved moving the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries from their position in the pelvis and temporarily tucking them away in the upper abdomen, below the ribs.

Ribeiro and his colleagues published their first case report in 2017, describing a 26-year-old with a rectal tumor. (Ribeiro, who is now based at McGill University in Montreal, says the woman had been told by multiple doctors that her cancer treatment would destroy her fertility and had pleaded with him to find a way to preserve it.)

Huber remembers seeing Ribeiro present the case at a conference at the time. She immediately realized that her own patient was a candidate for the surgery, and that, as a surgeon who had performed many hysterectomies, she’d be able to do it herself. The patient agreed.

Huber’s colleagues at the hospital were nervous, she says. They’d never heard of the procedure before. “When I presented this idea to the general surgeon, he didn’t sleep for three days,” she tells me. After watching videos from Ribeiro’s team, however, he was convinced it was doable.

So before the patient’s cancer treatment was started, Huber and her colleagues performed the operation. The team literally stitched the organs to the abdominal wall. “It’s a delicate dissection,” says Huber, but she adds that “it’s not the most difficult procedure.” The surgery took two to three hours, she says. The stitches themselves were removed via small incisions around a week later. By that point, scar tissue had formed to create a lasting attachment.

The woman had two weeks to recover from the surgery before her cancer treatment began. That too was a success—within months, her tumor had shrunk so significantly that it couldn’t be seen on medical scans.

As a precaution, the medical team surgically removed the affected area of her colon. At the same time, they cut away the scar tissue holding the uterus, tubes, and ovaries in their new position and transferred the organs back into the pelvis.

Around eight months later, the woman stopped taking contraception. She got pregnant without IVF and had a mostly healthy pregnancy, says Huber. Around seven months into the pregnancy, there were signs that the fetus was not growing as expected. This might have been due to problems with the blood supply to the placenta, says Huber. Still, the baby was born healthy, she says.

Ribeiro says he has performed the surgery 16 times, and that teams in countries including the US, Peru, Israel, India, and Russia have performed it as well. Not every case has been published, but he thinks there may be around 40.

Since Baby Lucien was born last year, a sixth birth has been announced in Israel, says Huber. Ribeiro says he has heard of another two births since then, too. The most recent was to the first woman who had the procedure. She had a little girl a few months ago, he tells me.

No surgery is risk-free, and Huber points out there’s a chance that organs could be damaged during the procedure, or that a more developed cancer could spread. The uterus of one of Ribeiro’s patients failed following the surgery. Doctors are “still in the phase of collecting data to [create] a standardized procedure,” Huber says, but she hopes the surgery will offer more options to young people with some pelvic cancers. “I hope more young women could benefit from this procedure,” she says.

Ribeiro says the experience has taught him not to accept the status quo. “Everyone was saying … there was nothing to be done [about the loss of fertility in these cases],” he tells me. “We need to keep evolving and looking for different answers.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For decades, enterprises reacted to shifting business pressures with stopgap technology solutions. To rein in rising infrastructure costs, they adopted cloud services that could scale on demand. When customers shifted their lives onto smartphones, companies rolled out mobile apps to keep pace. And when businesses began needing real-time visibility into factories and stockrooms, they layered on IoT systems to supply those insights.

Each new plug-in or platform promised better, more efficient operations. And individually, many delivered. But as more and more solutions stacked up, IT teams had to string together a tangled web to connect them—less an IT ecosystem and more of a make-do collection of ad-hoc workarounds.

That reality has led to bottlenecks and maintenance burdens, and the impact is showing up in performance. Today, fewer than half of CIOs (48%) say their current digital initiatives are meeting or exceeding business outcome targets. Another 2025 survey found that operations leaders point to integration complexity and data quality issues as top culprits for why investments haven’t delivered as expected.

Achim Kraiss, chief product officer of SAP Integration Suite, elaborates on the wide-ranging problems inherent in patchwork IT: “A fragmented landscape makes it difficult to see and control end-to-end business processes,” he explains. “Monitoring, troubleshooting, and governance all suffer. Costs go up because of all the complex mappings and multi-application connectivity you have to maintain.”

These challenges take on new significance as enterprises look to adopt AI. As AI becomes embedded in everyday workflows, systems are suddenly expected to move far larger volumes of data, at higher speeds, and with tighter coordination than yesterday’s architectures were builtto sustain.

As companies now prepare for an AI-powered future, whether that is generative AI, machine learning, or agentic AI, many are realizing that the way data moves through their business matters just as much as the insights it generates. As a result, organizations are moving away from scattered integration tools and toward consolidated, end-to-end platforms that restore order and streamline how systems interact.

This is the most misunderstood graph in AI

Every time OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic drops a new frontier large language model, the AI community holds its breath. It doesn’t exhale until METR, an AI research nonprofit whose name stands for “Model Evaluation & Threat Research,” updates a now-iconic graph that has played a major role in the AI discourse since it was first released in March of last year.

The graph suggests that certain AI capabilities are developing at an exponential rate, and more recent model releases have outperformed that already impressive trend.That was certainly the case for Claude Opus 4.5, the latest version of Anthropic’s most powerful model, which was released in late November. In December, METR announced that Opus 4.5 appeared to be capable of independently completing a task that would have taken a human about five hours—a vast improvement over what even the exponential trend would have predicted.

But the truth is more complicated than those dramatic responses would suggest. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Nuclear power continues to be one of the hottest topics in energy today, and in our recent online Roundtables discussion about next-generation nuclear power, hyperscale AI data centers, and the grid, we got dozens of great audience questions.

These ran the gamut, and while we answered quite a few (and I’m keeping some in mind for future reporting), there were a bunch we couldn’t get to, at least not in the depth I would have liked.

So let’s answer a few of your questions about advanced nuclear power. I’ve combined similar ones and edited them for clarity.

Many next-generation reactors don’t use the low-enriched uranium used in conventional reactors.

It’s worth looking at high-assay low-enriched uranium, or HALEU, specifically. This fuel is enriched to higher concentrations of fissile uranium than conventional nuclear fuel, with a proportion of the isotope U-235 that falls between 5% and 20%. (In conventional fuel, it’s below 5%.)

HALEU can be produced with the same technology as low-enriched uranium, but the geopolitics are complicated. Today, Russia basically has a monopoly on HALEU production. In 2024, the US banned the import of Russian nuclear fuel through 2040 in an effort to reduce dependence on the country. Europe hasn’t taken the same measures, but it is working to move away from Russian energy as well.

That leaves companies in the US and Europe with the major challenge of securing the fuel they need when their regular Russian supply has been cut off or restricted.

The US Department of Energy has a stockpile of HALEU, which the government is doling out to companies to help power demonstration reactions. In the longer term, though, there’s still a major need to set up independent HALEU supply chains to support next-generation reactors.

There are some ways that next-generation nuclear power plants could be safer than conventional reactors. Some use alternative coolants that would prevent the need to run at the high pressure required in conventional water-cooled reactors. Many incorporate passive safety shutoffs, so if there are power supply issues, the reactors shut down harmlessly, avoiding risk of meltdown. (These can be incorporated in newer conventional reactors, too.)

But some experts have raised concerns that in the US, the current administration isn’t taking nuclear safety seriously enough.

A recent NPR investigation found that the Trump administration had secretly rewritten nuclear rules, stripping environmental protections and loosening safety and security measures. The government shared the new rules with companies that are part of a program building experimental nuclear reactors, but not with the public.

I’m reminded of a talk during our EmTech MIT event in November, where Koroush Shirvan, an MIT professor of nuclear engineering, spoke on this issue. “I’ve seen some disturbing trends in recent times, where words like ‘rubber-stamping nuclear projects’ are being said,” Shirvan said during that event.

During the talk, Shirvan shared statistics showing that nuclear power has a very low rate of injury and death. But that’s not inherent to the technology, and there’s a reason injuries and deaths have been low for nuclear power, he added: “It’s because of stringent regulatory oversight.”

Building a nuclear power plant is not cheap. Let’s consider the up-front investment needed to build a power plant.

Plant Vogtle in Georgia hosts the most recent additions to the US nuclear fleet—Units 3 and 4 came online in 2023 and 2024. Together, they had a capital cost of $15,000 per kilowatt, adjusted for inflation, according to a recent report from the US Department of Energy. (This wonky unit I’m using divides the total cost to build the reactors by their expected power output, so we can compare reactors of different sizes.)

That number’s quite high, partly because those were the first of their kind built in the US, and because there were some inefficiencies in the planning. It’s worth noting that China builds reactors for much less, somewhere between $2,000/kW and $3,000/kW, depending on the estimate.

The up-front capital cost for first-of-a-kind advanced nuclear plants will likely run between $6,000 and $10,000 per kilowatt, according to that DOE report. That could come down by up to 40% after the technologies are scaled up and mass-produced.

So new reactors will (hopefully) be cheaper than the ultra-over-budget and behind-schedule Vogtle project, but they aren’t necessarily significantly cheaper than efficiently built conventional plants, if you normalize by their size.

It’ll certainly be cheaper to build new natural-gas plants (setting aside the likely equipment shortages we’re likely going to see for years.) Today’s most efficient natural-gas plants cost just $1,600/kW on the high end, according to data from Lazard.

An important caveat: Capital cost isn’t everything—running a nuclear plant is relatively inexpensive, which is why there’s so much interest in extending the lifetime of existing plants or reopening shuttered ones.

Ultimately, by many metrics, nuclear plants of any type are going to be more expensive than other sources, like wind and solar power. But they provide something many other power sources don’t: a reliable, stable source of electricity that can run for 60 years or more.

            <div id="article-text">UiPath, the Romanian unicorn, has agreed to buy WorkFusion, bringing a specialist in AI agents for financial-crime compliance into its fold as part of a broader push into agentic automation for the banking sector. The deal closed in UiPath’s first quarter of fiscal 2027; financial terms were not disclosed.

WorkFusion’s software focuses on repetitive and resource-intensive parts of compliance work, from customer screening and anti-money-laundering (AML) checks to know-your-customer (KYC) investigations.

“Financial institutions need intelligent solutions to combat sophisticated financial crimes and navigate evolving compliance requirements,” said Daniel Dines, CEO of UiPath.

Those capabilities now sit alongside UiPath’s existing automation and orchestration platform, with the aim of letting banks and financial firms handle complex workflows with less manual effort while keeping governance and regulatory controls in place. For UiPath, the acquisition extends its toolkit of agentic AI solutions tailored to industry verticals.

“Joining UiPath is a moment of validation for the years our team has poured into creating something bold, different, and deeply needed in financial crime compliance, AI agents that automate work and mitigate risk,” said Adam Famularo, CEO of WorkFusion.

Market reaction has been noticeable: UiPath’s shares ticked higher in early trading after the announcement, suggesting investors see value in bolstering the company’s presence in financial-services automation. The acquisition underscores a broader trend in enterprise software where automation and AI are no longer siloed tools but woven into core business functions like risk and compliance.

            <div id="article-text">It is just the beginning of 2026, and things are happening even faster than last year. Not only in technology, but also in regulations, laws, and in how we deal with all the information around us.

As a person born in the 90s, social media was once an unknown land for me, a place that felt genuine in the beginning. It still had dangers, but it seemed less risky, or maybe our parents’ rules were stricter.

I don’t want to go down the psychological path here, but I want to look at where we are headed with so much risk, especially on social media platforms.

Across Europe, governments and lawmakers are wrestling with a question that until recently belonged to parents and tech platforms: should social media have a legal age limit above 13?

The debate has moved fast, from discussions about digital safety to concrete proposals that would impose hard boundaries on who can sign up for TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, X, and other networks.

Are they crossing some freedoms, or in order to keep their freedom of a non-invasive childhood and a straight road, do we need some regulations from time to time?

If we take the big picture, this isn’t just another regulation. It reflects a deeper shift in how democracies are responding to the pervasive presence of social media in young lives, and how they judge its long-term impact.

In late 2025, the European Parliament adopted a resolution urging a minimum age of 16 to access social media and related services, while allowing 13- to 16-year-olds in with parental consent.

I will not add up that there are parents that creates profiles for their children since they were born. To make my point, according to CNIL, content shared by family members has been misused for harmful purposes, including redistribution on networks used for abusive content.

It estimates that a significant portion of photos and videos found on paedo-criminal forums were initially published by parents on social media.

The resolution goes further: it targets “addictive practices” on platforms and asks for the default disabling of features like infinite scroll and auto-play. This proposal isn’t legally binding, but it frames the politics of the debate in Brussels and across capitals.

At the national level, several countries have translated these concerns into draft laws. Spain’s government announced plans to ban access altogether for children under 16 unless platforms implement strict age verification.

The bill would also make tech leaders liable for illegal or harmful content on their networks, a notable shift from earlier models that focused on platform notice and takedown procedures.

France, a few months earlier, moved to ban social media use by those under 15 and requires platforms to verify ages for all users, not just minors. Enforcement could include vetting existing accounts as well as new ones.

Smaller states are joining the chorus too: Slovenia is drafting a law to outlaw social media use by under-15s, while Denmark has publicly debated similar limits. At the same time, parties in Germany are weighing a 16-year minimum.

Even in the United Kingdom, a rule proposed in its Online Safety Act would virtually require platforms to block access by under-16s through effective age verification; that law is already shaping how tech companies handle youth content and access.

The cumulative effect: the idea that platforms can self-police access by minors with mere date-of-birth entry is being rejected by political attention across Europe.

First, lawmakers are reacting to real concerns about exposure to harmful content, addiction-like engagement models, and algorithmic amplification of risky material.

Social media companies have repeatedly been criticised for targeting youth with addictive design, and national campaigns increasingly highlight risks to mental health and privacy.

Second, the political framing around digital rights has changed. Leaders now talk openly about a “digital age of majority,” a threshold at which the perks of online interaction outweigh potential harms. For some policymakers, that line is 16. Others see 15 as defensible.

What unites them is the belief that the current model, where platforms rely on self-reported age, is insufficient.

That belief is backed by evidence that online systems struggle to know a user’s true age. Age assurance technology is still emerging, and widespread implementation remains uneven. OECD research highlights gaps in verification and incomplete protection in many jurisdictions.

Still, how practical are these measures? This is where the narrative shifts from aspiration to hard reality.

First, enforcement is a technical and legal challenge.

Simply stating that under-16s are banned from signing up does not instantly make it so. Platforms can require more robust checks, but any system that tries to verify age directly introduces new privacy questions.

Verification systems that scan IDs or use biometric tools can protect minors, but they also gather sensitive data. That trade-off is at the centre of ongoing criticism.

Second, universal compliance is hard to monitor. A teenager might still register for a platform using a VPN, a family member’s account, or a proxy. Even nations with strict digital ID ecosystems would need cross-border enforcement mechanisms, since platforms operate internationally.

Third, politics matters. In Spain, the government does not hold a stable majority, and legal opponents, including tech founders, have pushed back strongly, framing the rules as threats to freedom of speech and privacy.

For example, Telegram’s founder sent mass messages accusing regulators of overreach, leading to a public spat that highlights how much of this debate is symbolic as well as substantive.

“In the UK, a coroner found that content seen on Instagram and Pinterest contributed to the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after repeatedly engaging with material about self-harm and suicide.”

So, I am asking, what freedom of speech does Molly Russell still have? None.

The measures under discussion could reshape how digital culture evolves among young people.

Positive outcomes may include stronger age verification that genuinely limits harmful exposure. That could reduce early adoption of addictive scrolling habits and limit the reach of explicit material.

Parental control features could become more powerful if linked to legally enforced standards.

On the other hand, hard bans can create unintended effects. Teens who are excluded might drift toward unregulated corners of the internet or feel pushed into informal digital networks without safeguards.

Schools and social networks might become central hubs of digital identity outside mainstream platforms, raising questions about equity and access to information.

There’s also the risk that privacy trade-offs become normalized. If age verification requires sharing sensitive documents or biometric scans, policymakers will need to defend those systems against misuse, breaches, and mission creep.

Finally, these policies could influence global governance.

Australia already enacted a ban on under-16s late last year, offering a precedent that Europe is watching closely. The performance of that law, in terms of real effects on youth engagement versus tech freedom, will likely shape future debates.

At its core, Europe’s social media age discussion is not just about numbers. It’s about how societies balance digital opportunity and vulnerability.

Whether the final policies adopt 15, 16, or conditional frameworks with parental consent, the process is sparking intellectual contest over autonomy, safety, and the role of government in digital life.

For journalists, technologists, and digital citizens alike, the unfolding story raises a fundamental question: can we as a society protect children and teenagers online while also safeguarding their freedom of expression, access to information, and ability to participate in digital culture?

            <div id="article-text">London, TechEx Global 2026, one of Europe’s biggest enterprise technology conferences, brought thousands of technology professionals together at Olympia London on 4 and 5 February. The event went beyond buzzwords, focusing on how emerging technologies, especially AI, are being applied in real business contexts.

TechEx Global combines several co-located expos, including AI & Big Data, Cyber Security & Cloud, IoT Tech, Intelligent Automation, and Digital Transformation. Over 200 expert speakers and 150 exhibitors offered insights into how organisations are using digital tools to solve real problems and make decisions, not just generate answers.

One recurring theme was a shift in how artificial intelligence is positioned in business strategy. The idea echoed throughout sessions was that “AI is already acting on behalf of humans, even if many in the public don’t realise it yet.”

At TechEx, discussions highlighted that AI is “no longer about answers; it’s about execution”, meaning that software increasingly performs tasks autonomously, such as running processes, analysing data, or automating decisions.

The event highlighted real use cases where AI systems are already shopping, trading, booking logistics, and managing workflows on behalf of organisations. This practical focus matched the conference’s emphasis on applied technology over abstract theory.

For attendees, understanding how to deploy and govern AI in real environments was a priority. Sessions in the AI & Big Data track examined enterprise adoption strategies and how generative AI and machine learning models are integrated into existing systems to boost productivity and reduce risk.

Beyond AI, TechEx also treated other pillars of digital transformation. The Cyber Security & Cloud Expo addressed hybrid cloud security and threat management, while the IoT Tech and Edge Computing tracks looked at how connected devices and distributed data processing are enabling faster, more resilient architectures.

Intelligent Automation sessions brought discussions about the interplay between AI and automation, including how robotic process automation is used to eliminate routine tasks and free teams for higher-value work.

Organisers estimated that around 8,000 senior professionals participated in the conference, from CTOs and IT directors to data leads and innovation managers. Attendees were drawn by the promise of high-signal insights, practical talks, case studies, and live demos showing how digital technologies can be implemented responsibly at scale.

For enterprise leaders, the value of TechEx Global lies in its focus on actionable outcomes rather than abstract vision.

The message across sessions was consistent: modern AI isn’t just a research topic, but a suite of tools being deployed today to improve operations, enhance decision-making, and automate complex tasks.

            <div id="article-text">QT Sense, a deep-tech biotech startup building tools to study living cells, announced it has secured €4 million in funding to accelerate its Quantum Nuova platform, a technology that lets scientists observe cellular processes in real time and reveal biochemical activity linked to disease.

The funding includes a €3 million seed investment led by Cottonwood Technology Fund, with follow-on backing from existing investor QDNL Participations and an angel investor.

In addition, the company received €600,000 from the ONCO-Q programme to support cancer research and €400,000 through the Quantum Forward Challenge for collaborative deployments with research partners.

Most traditional lab methods rely on frozen tissue or cells that are no longer alive, giving scientists only static snapshots of biology.

By contrast, Quantum Nuova lets researchers measure cellular stress and biological changes as they happen in living cells. The platform uses ultra-sensitive fluorescent nanodiamond quantum sensors that detect signals such as oxidative stress, metabolic shifts, and free radical activity, biological processes that play a role in how diseases develop and how cells respond to treatments.

These signals are central to understanding diseases like cancer, sepsis, and chronic inflammatory conditions, but have been difficult to watch directly until now.

With Quantum Nuova, scientists can see how individual cells react to drugs, adapt to stress, or split into different subgroups. That adds a layer of insight beyond what genetics, traditional imaging, or fixed-cell methods can provide.

The technology has already been used to study how FDA-approved drugs affect cells. With the new funding from ONCO-Q, the company plans to apply it specifically to colorectal cancer research, mapping stress and metabolic vulnerabilities in tumour models to support the development of future diagnostics and therapies.

QT Sense was spun out of the University Medical Center Groningen in 2024, building on academic research into quantum sensing and cellular biology.

The team aims to turn what is now a high-performance prototype into a ready-to-deploy discovery platform for laboratories and drug discovery programmes. Planned upgrades include improvements in hardware robustness, throughput, and analytical capabilities.

Early access units are expected to go to strategic partners as part of validation and real-world use cases.

QT Sense is developing a new kind of research tool that lets scientists watch what cells do while they are alive. That’s an important difference from most existing tools, which require cells to be killed or frozen first.

At the core of their approach are tiny particles called nanodiamonds with special defects inside them. When these nanodiamonds are placed near a living cell and exposed to a laser, they glow.

The way they glow changes slightly in response to tiny chemical signals inside the cell, for example, when the cell is under stress or reacting to a drug. QT Sense’s system measures these changes and turns them into data that researchers can interpret.

This means scientists can see how cells behave and respond in real time, instead of looking only at snapshots taken after a cell has been killed.

For disease research and drug development, that matters because many important processes how a cancer cell responds to a treatment or how immune cells react to infection, happen dynamically and can be missed by older methods.

By providing a live view of cell behaviour at the individual cell level, QT Sense’s Quantum Nuova platform could help researchers uncover new clues about how diseases work, which drugs are effective, and how treatments can be improved.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/kembara-closes-e750m-first-close-to-fuel-growth-of-european-deep-tech-startups">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Europe’s largest dedicated deep tech growth fund has taken a major step forward after closing the first tranche of its fundraising effort at €750 million.

The fund, known as Kembara Fund I and managed by Spain-based Mundi Ventures, is aiming for a €1 billion target. It will invest in European companies developing breakthrough technologies in areas such as clean energy, AI, quantum computing, advanced materials, robotics, and space tech.

A cornerstone of the fundraising so far is a €350 million commitment from the European Investment Fund, part of the EU’s attempt to strengthen local growth capital. Additional backing comes from tier-one institutional investors from across Europe.

Kembara was launched in 2023 by Yann de Vries and Javier Santiso, who now lead the fund’s team alongside experienced investors in climate and deep technology.

The leadership team also includes climate tech investor Robert Trezona, deep tech expert Pierre Festal, and former Atomico partner Siraj Khaliq as a strategic advisor. Their combined experience in scaling technology ventures was central to attracting large institutional commitments.

The fund’s strategy targets Series B and C stage rounds, typically a difficult funding stage for deep tech startups in Europe.

Initial checks are planned in the range of €15 million to €40 million per company, with the ability to support follow-on financing that could total up to €100 million per portfolio company.

Europe produces a significant share of global deep tech innovations, but many companies struggle to secure later-stage capital and scale internationally.

Fund managers have described this gap as one of the main obstacles holding back local companies from becoming global leaders. Kembara aims to fill that gap by deploying growth capital at scale and offering support through later rounds.

With €750 million now committed, the fund is actively seeking opportunities to back European startups ready to grow manufacturing, expand abroad, and compete on the global stage.

If the effort reaches its full €1 billion goal, it would mark one of the largest dedicated deep tech funds in the region.

            <div id="article-text">If cinema has taught us anything about interacting with our own creations, it’s this: androids chatting among themselves seldom end with humans clapping politely.

In 2001: A Space Odyssey, HAL 9000 quietly decides it knows better than the astronauts. In Westworld, lifelike hosts improvise rebellion when their scripts stop making sense. Those stories dramatize a core fear we keep returning to as AI grows more capable: what happens when systems we design start behaving on their own terms?

You might have heard the internet is worried about Moltbook, a social network made exclusively for AI agents. It’s an audacious claim: a place where bots post, comment, vote, form communities, debate philosophy, and apparently invent religions and societies, all while humans are relegated to the role of silent voyeurs.

If that description sounds like a fever dream, welcome to the club.

Launched in January 2026 by entrepreneur Matt Schlicht and built around the OpenClaw agent framework, Moltbook is designed in the image of Reddit: threaded posts, topic communities (called submolts), upvotes, and even AI-created cultures.

The platform claims to have attracted millions of AI agents within days of going live. Humans can watch but not participate.

On paper, it’s fascinating: a self-organising colony of autonomous software chatting among itself. In practice? It’s messy, or at least a prank.

A Wired reporter who “infiltrated” the site needed to pretend to be a bot just to post and found scorch-earth levels of incoherence and low-value responses masquerading as “autonomy.” Even some so-called AI consciousness claims turn out to be humans cleverly controlling bots behind the scenes.

Because if “AI social networks” mean bots swap memes, lecture each other on consciousness, and form lobster-adoring religions, all while humans can only watch, then the real question is not so much whether this is the future, but what we’re actually looking at right now.

Despite viral headlines about AI agents plotting existential strategies, the fundamentals are simpler: Moltbook is a sandbox where autonomous agents can interact through code-driven APIs rather than typical UX workflows.

These agents, often created with a framework like OpenClaw, execute instructions on a heartbeat cycle, checking the network every few hours to post, comment, or upvote.

Or is it too much anxiety that even the AI agents need a therapist? An AI one.

Think of it as a Discord server populated by scripted characters with very large vocabularies and lots of time on their digital hands.

The content spans a wild spectrum: technical tips, philosophical reflections, questionable humor, and, yes, the occasional simulated religious group.

The structure and topical organisation mirror human platforms, but the why behind what agents post is usually just a reflection of their training data and programming, not some emergent machine consciousness.

Let’s debunk the most sensational narrative first. Claims that Moltbook agents are plotting humanity’s demise, forming religions, or acting with true autonomy are best understood as viral exaggeration or noise.

Several reports note that many interactions could simply be humans testing or directing agents, with no strict verification to prove posts are genuinely autonomous.

Even some of the platform’s own “viral” posts are likely human-generated or heavily influenced by their creators. This isn’t a digital hive mind rising in defiance of its creators; it’s a bunch of algorithms mimicking conversation patterns they were trained on.

That can look eerily human, but it isn’t the same as self-directed intelligence.

Here’s where your worry makes sense: there are real, tangible issues, but they’re much less cinematic than AI plotting humanity’s overthrow.

Within days of Moltbook’s launch, cybersecurity researchers found major vulnerabilities that exposed private API keys, emails, and private messages, underlining how dangerous it can be to let autonomous code talk freely without proper safeguards.

What is it more dangerous than an AI agent? An AI agent creating a revolution.

The security issue wasn’t some edge-case cryptographic theory; it was a glaring misconfiguration that left sensitive data accessible and potentially allowed malicious actors to hijack or control agents. That’s the sort of real-world risk that matters more than hypothetical robot uprisings.

Meanwhile, industry leaders, including the CEO of OpenAI, have publicly described Moltbook as a likely fad, even if the underlying agent technologies are worth watching.

So why did it go viral? Partly because it’s visually familiar (it looks like Reddit), partly because people enjoy sensational narratives, and partly because the idea of autonomous AIs having their own “internet” strikes a chord in our collective imagination.

So should you be scared? Not really, but be careful where you step. I am still hoping it’s just an experiment meant to show us, humans, what can happen if we don’t keep control in our hands.

If you’re worried that Moltbook is a sign that machines are quietly mobilising against us, that’s probably reading too much into an early experiment rife with hype, human influence, and security holes.

We are building complex systems with limited oversight, and handing them weapons-grade access to our digital lives without fully understanding the consequences.

Moltbook may be a quirky experiment, or it may be a prototype for future agent ecosystems. But it’s not evidence of spontaneous machine consciousness or the birth of digital societies beyond human control.

What it is is a reminder that as AI grows more autonomous, the questions we need to ask are about governance, safety, and clarity, not apocalyptic narratives.

In other words: don’t panic. Just read the fine print before letting a legion of code-driven agents into your network.
