            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When dinosaur fossils surface at a site, it is often not possible to tell how many millions of years ago their bones were buried. While the different strata of sedimentary rock represent periods of geologic history frozen in time, accurately dating them or the fossils trapped within them has frequently proven to be frustrating.

Fossilized bones and teeth have been dated with some success before, but that success is inconsistent and depends on the specimens. Both fossilization and the process of sediment turning to rock can alter the bone in ways that interfere with accuracy. While uranium-lead dating is among the most widely used methods for dating materials, it is just an emerging technology when applied to directly dating fossils.

Dinosaur eggshells might have finally cracked a way to date surrounding rocks and fossils. Led by paleontologist Ryan Tucker of Stellenbosch University, a team of researchers has devised a method of dating eggshells that reveals how long ago they were covered in what was once sand, mud, or other sediments. That information will give the burial time of any other fossils embedded in the same layer of rock.

“If validated, this approach could greatly expand the range of continental sedimentary successions amenable to radioisotopic dating,” Tucker said in a study recently published in Nature Communications Earth & Environment.

Vertebrates have been laying calcified eggs for hundreds of millions of years (although the first dinosaur eggs had soft shells). What makes fossil eggshells so useful for figuring out the age of other fossils is the unique microstructure of calcium carbonate found in them. The way its crystals are arranged capture a record of diagenetic changes, or physical and chemical changes that occurred during fossilization. These can include water damage, along with breaks and fissures caused by being compacted between layers of sediment. This makes it easier to screen for these signs when trying to determine how old they are.

Eggs from two different Cretaceous sites were sampled. The first came from the Deep Eddy site in the Cedar Mountain Formation of Utah, which is surrounded by beds of petrified volcanic ash that had already been dated. The second group of samples came from egg clutches that had more recently been unearthed from the Teen Ulaan Chaltsai region of Mongolia’s Eastern Gobi Basin. The age of these eggs and the site they emerged from had previously been estimated but remained unknown.

Tucker and his team used uranium-lead radioisotopic dating on both sets of samples. This method can accurately date rocks that are anywhere from 1 million years old to those as ancient as the Earth itself, going back about 4.5 billion years.

Eggshells and other carbonate materials trap isotopes of lead and uranium. Uranium isotopes are unstable. Over time, they go through radioactive decay, releasing energy and losing protons and neutrons. One particular isotope decays via a pathway that ends with a lead isotope that is much more stable. The amount of lead keeps increasing in a way that’s proportional to the gradual decay of uranium. Finding out the relative amounts of these isotopes and taking their half-lives into account yields a sample’s age.

The eggs from Utah are thought to have been laid by a species of oviraptor, likely Macroelongatoolithus carlylei, while the Mongolian eggs were possibly laid by a Mongolian microtroodontid dinosaur—small, birdlike theropods that have been found to share ancestry with extant birds.

Trace element analysis showed that, despite being found on opposite sides of the planet, the structure of both eggshell samples was amazingly well preserved. There were only a few microfractures caused by the pressure of sedimentary layers packed above them as they fossilized.

After they determined an age for both shell samples by dating them directly, the researchers compared them. Zircons in the sediments of the Deep Eddy site had already established its age. It turned out that the nest site where the clutch of dinosaur eggs had been trapped between strata of volcanic rock dated as slightly older than the eggshells, which this method determined were 95 million years old. As expected, the rock found beneath the clutch was older, while the rock above was younger. The researchers think it is possible that fractures on these eggs may have resulted in slight inaccuracies.

As for the Mongolian eggs, the age from uranium-lead dating was also extremely close to that of the bedrock.

An analysis of trace elements in the Teen Ulaan Chaltsai eggs also turned up a surprise: A meteor had probably fallen to Earth around the time they were buried 99 million years ago. If there had been no meteor impact at the time, there must have already been meteor dust in the sediment that covered them.

“This study demonstrates that eggshell biocalcite from non-avian dinosaurs, birds, and other egg-laying vertebrates has the potential to serve as a reliable geochronometer in Mesozoic and Cenozoic terrestrial sedimentary basins,” Tucker said.

Next time a fossil site of indeterminate age confounds paleontologists, they need only look for dinosaur eggs.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Daphne O. Martschenko and Sam Trejo both want to make the world a better, fairer, more equitable place. But they disagree on whether studying social genomics—elucidating any potential genetic contributions to behaviors ranging from mental illnesses to educational attainment to political affiliation—can help achieve this goal.

Martschenko’s argument is largely that genetic research and data have almost always been used thus far as a justification to further entrench extant social inequalities. But we know the solutions to many of the injustices in our world—trying to lift people out of poverty, for example—and we certainly don’t need more genetic research to implement them. Trejo’s point is largely that more information is generally better than less. We can’t foresee the benefits that could come from basic research, and this research is happening anyway, whether we like it or not, so we may as well try to harness it as best we can toward good and not ill.

Obviously, they’re both right. In What We Inherit: How New Technologies and Old Myths Are Shaping Our Genomic Future, we get to see how their collaboration can shed light on our rapidly advancing genetic capabilities.

Trejo is a (quantitative) sociologist at Princeton; Martschenko is a (qualitative) bioethicist at Stanford. He’s a he, and she’s a she; he looks white, she looks black; he’s East Coast, she’s West. On the surface, it seems clear that they would hold different opinions. But they still chose to spend 10 years writing this book in an “adversarial collaboration.” While they still disagree, by now at least they can really listen to and understand each other. In today’s world, that seems pretty worthwhile in and of itself.

The titular “What we inherit” refers to both actual DNA (Trejo’s field) and the myths surrounding it (Martschenko’s). There are two “genetic myths” that most concern them. One is the Destiny Myth: the notion, first promulgated by Francis Galton in his 1869 book Heredity Genius, that the effects of DNA can be separable from the effects of environment. He didn’t deny the effects of nurture; he just erroneously pitted it against nature, as if it were one versus the other instead of each impacting and working through the other. (The most powerful “genetic” determinant of educational attainment in his world was a Y chromosome.) His ideas reached their apotheosis in the forced sterilizations of the eugenics movement in the early 20th century in the US and, eventually, in the policies of Nazi Germany.

The other genetic myth the authors address is the Race Myth, “the false belief that DNA differences divide humans into discrete and biologically distinct racial groups.” (Humans can be genetically sorted by ancestry, but that’s not quite the same thing.) But they spend most of the book discussing polygenic scores, which sum up the impact of lots of small genetic influences. They cover what they are, their strengths and weaknesses, their past, present, and potential uses, and how and how much their use should be regulated. And of course, their ultimate question: Are they worth generating and studying at all?

One thing they agree on is that science education in this country is abysmal and needs to be improved immediately. Most people’s knowledge of genetics is stuck at Mendel and his green versus yellow, smooth versus wrinkled peas: dominant and recessive traits with manifestations that can be neatly traced in Punnet squares. Alas, most human traits are much more complicated than that, especially the interesting ones.

Polygenic scores tally the contributions of many genes to particular traits to predict certain outcomes. There’s no single gene for height, depression, or heart disease; there are a bunch of genes that each make very small contributions to making an outcome more or less likely. Polygenic scores can’t tell you that someone will drop out of high school or get a PhD; they can just tell you that someone might be slightly more or less likely to do so. They are probabilistic, not deterministic, because people’s mental health and educational attainment and, yes, even height, are determined by environmental factors as well as genes.

Polygenic scores, besides only giving predictions, are (a) not that accurate by nature; (b) become less accurate for each trait if you select for more than one trait, like height and intelligence; and (c) are less accurate for those not of European descent, since most genetic studies have thus far been done only with Europeans. So right out of the gate, any potential benefits of the technology will be distributed unevenly.

Another thing that Martschenko and Trejo agree on is that the generation, sale, and use of polygenic scores must be regulated much more assiduously than they currently are to ensure that they are implemented responsibly and equitably. “While scientists and policymakers are guarding the front gate against gene editing, genetic embryo selection (using polygenic scores) is slipping in through the backdoor,” they write. Potential parents using IVF have long been able to choose which embryos to implant based on gender and the presence of very clearcut genetic markers for certain serious diseases. Now, they can choose which embryos they want to implant based on their polygenic scores.

In 2020, a company called Genomic Prediction started offering genomic scores for diabetes, skin cancer, high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, intellectual disability, and “idiopathic short stature.” They’ve stopped advertising the last two “because it’s too controversial.” Not, mind you, because the effects are minor and the science is unreliable. The theoretical maximum polygenic score for height would make a difference of 2.5 inches, and that theoretical maximum has not been seen yet, even in studies of Europeans. Polygenic scores for most other traits lag far behind. (And that’s just one company; another called Herasight has since picked up the slack and claims to offer embryo selection based on intelligence.)

Remember, the more traits one selects for, the less accurate each prediction is. Moreover, many genes affect multiple biological processes, so a gene implicated in one undesirable trait may have as yet undefined impacts on other desirable ones.

And all of this is ignoring the potential impact of the child’s environment. The first couple who used genetic screening for their daughter opted for an embryo that had a reduced risk of developing heart disease; her risk was less than 1 percent lower than the three embryos they rejected. Feeding her vegetables and sticking her on a soccer team would have been cheaper and probably more impactful.

Almost every family I know has a kid who has taken growth hormones, and plenty of them get tutoring, too. These interventions are hardly equitably distributed. But if embryos are selected based on polygenic scores, the authors fear that a new form of social inequality can arise. While growth hormone injections affect only one individual, embryonic selection based on polygenic scores affects all of that embryo’s descendants going forward. So the chosen embryos’ progeny could eventually end up treated as a new class of optimized people whose status might be elevated simply because their parents could afford to comb through their embryonic genomes—regardless of whether their “genetic” capabilities are actually significantly different from everyone else’s.

While it is understandable that parents want to give their kids the best chance of success, eliminating traits that they find objectionable will make humanity as a whole more uniform and society as a whole poorer for the lack of heterogeneity. Everyone can benefit from exposure to people who are different from them; if everyone is bred to be tall, smart, and good-looking, how will we learn to tolerate otherness?

Polygenic embryo selection is currently illegal in the UK, Israel, and much of Europe. In 2024, the FDA made some noise about planning to regulate the market, but for now companies offering polygenic scores to the public fall under the same nonmedical category as nutritional supplements—i.e. not regulatable. These companies advertise scores for traits like musical ability and acrophobia, but only for “wellness” or “educational” purposes.

So Americans are largely at the mercy of corporations that want to profit off of them at least as much as they claim to want to help them. And because this is still in the private sector, people who have the most social and environmental advantages—wealthy people with European ancestry—are often the only ones who can afford to try to give their kids any genetic advantages that might be had, further entrenching those social inequalities and potentially creating genetic inequalities that didn’t exist before. Hopefully, these parents will just be funding the snake-oil phase of the process so that if we can ever generate enough data to make polygenic scores actually reliable at predicting anything meaningful, they will be inexpensive enough to be accessible to anyone who wants them.</div>

            <h2>Major government research lab appears to be squeezing out foreign scientists</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/major-government-research-lab-appears-to-be-squeezing-out-foreign-scientists/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">One of the US government’s top scientific research labs is taking steps that could drive away foreign scientists, a shift lawmakers and sources tell WIRED could cost the country valuable expertise and damage the agency’s credibility.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) helps determine the frameworks underpinning everything from cybersecurity to semiconductor manufacturing. Some of NIST’s recent work includes establishing guidelines for securing AI systems and identifying health concerns with air purifiers and firefighting gloves. Many of the agency’s thousands of employees, postdoctoral scientists, contractors, and guest researchers are brought in from around the world for their specialized expertise.

“For weeks now, rumors of draconian new measures have been spreading like wildfire, while my staff’s inquiries to NIST have gone unanswered,” Zoe Lofgren, the top Democrat on the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, wrote in a letter sent to acting NIST Director Craig Burkhardt on Thursday. April McClain Delaney, a fellow Democrat on the committee, cosigned the message.

Lofgren wrote that while her staff has heard about multiple rumored changes, what they have confirmed through unnamed sources is that the Trump administration “has begun taking steps to limit the ability of foreign-born researchers to conduct their work at NIST.”

The congressional letter follows a Boulder Reporting Lab article on February 12 that said international graduate students and postdoctoral researchers would be limited to a maximum of three years at NIST going forward, despite many of them needing five to seven years to complete their work.

A NIST employee tells WIRED that some plans to bring on foreign workers through the agency’s Professional Research and Experience Program have recently been canceled because of uncertainty about whether they would make it through the new security protocols. The staffer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media, says the agency has yet to widely communicate what the new hurdles will be or why it believes they are justified.

On Thursday, the Colorado Sun reported that “noncitizens” lost after-hours access to a NIST lab last month and could soon be banned from the facility entirely.

Jennifer Huergo, a spokesperson for NIST, tells WIRED that the proposed changes are aimed at protecting US science from theft and abuse, echoing a similar statement issued this week to other media outlets. Huergo declined to comment on who needs to approve the proposal for it to be finalized and when a decision will be made. She also didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawmakers’ letter.

Preventing foreign adversaries from stealing valuable American intellectual property has been a bipartisan priority, with NIST among the agencies in recent years to receive congressional scrutiny about the adequacy of its background checks and security policies. Just last month, Republican lawmakers renewed calls to put restrictions in place preventing Chinese nationals from working at or with national labs run by the Department of Energy.

But Lofgren’s letter contends that the rumored restrictions on non-US scientists at NIST go beyond “what is reasonable and appropriate to protect research security.” The letter demands transparency about new policies by February 26 and a pause on them “until Congress can weigh in on whether these changes are necessary at all.”

The potential loss of research talent at NIST would add to a series of other Trump administration policies that some US tech industry leaders have warned will dismantle the lives of immigrant researchers already living in the US and hamper economic growth. Hiking fees on H-1B tech visas, revoking thousands of student visas, and carrying out legally dubious mass deportations all stand to push people eager to work on science and tech research in the US to go elsewhere instead. The Trump administration has also announced plans to limit post-graduation job training for international students.

Pat Gallagher, who served as the director of NIST from 2009 to 2013 under President Barack Obama, says the changes could erode trust in the agency, which has long provided the technical foundations that industry and governments around the world rely on. “What has made NIST special is it is scientifically credible,” he tells WIRED. “Industry, universities, and the global measurement community knew they could work with NIST.”

Like much of the federal government, NIST has been in turmoil for most of the past year. Parts of it were paralyzed for months as rumors of DOGE cuts spread. Ultimately, the agency lost hundreds of its thousands of workers to budget cuts, with further funding pressure to come.

As of a couple of years ago, NIST welcomed 800 researchers on average annually from outside the US to work in its offices and collaborate directly with staff.

Lofgren expressed fear that rumors may be enough to scare away researchers and undermine US competitiveness in vital research. “Our scientific excellence depends upon attracting the best and brightest from around the world,” she wrote in the letter.

            <h2>After fueling test, optimism grows for March launch of Artemis II to the Moon</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/nasa-reports-no-significant-leaks-in-artemis-ii-fueling-test-eyes-march-6-launch/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A second fueling test on NASA’s Space Launch System rocket ended Thursday night, giving senior managers enough confidence to move forward with plans to launch four astronauts around the Moon as soon as March 6.

Unlike the first attempt to load propellants into the SLS rocket on February 2, there were no major leaks during Thursday’s practice countdown at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Technicians swapped seals at the launch pad after hydrogen gas leaked from the rocket’s main fueling line earlier this month. This time, the seals held.

“For the most part, those fixes all performed pretty well yesterday,” said Lori Glaze, acting associate administrator for NASA’s exploration programs. “We were able to fully fuel the SLS rocket within the planned timeline.”

The results keep the Artemis II mission on track for liftoff as soon as next month. NASA gave up on a series of February launch opportunities after encountering a persistent hydrogen leak during the first Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR).

“We’re now targeting March 6 as our earliest launch attempt,” Glaze said. “I am going to caveat that. I want to be open, transparent with all of you that there is still pending work. There’s work, a lot of forward work, that remains.”

If teams complete all of that work, liftoff of the Artemis II mission could occur within a two-hour window opening at 8:29 pm EST on March 6 (01:29 UTC on March 7). NASA has other launch dates available on March 7, 8, 9, and 11, but the mission may have to wait until April. There are approximately five days per month that the mission can depart the Earth after accounting for the position of the Moon in its orbit, the flight’s trajectory, and thermal and lighting constraints.

The Artemis II mission will last between nine and 10 days, taking NASA’s Orion spacecraft with commander Reid Wiseman, pilot Victor Glover, and mission specialists Christina Koch and Jeremy Hansen around the far side of the Moon before returning to Earth for splashdown in the Pacific Ocean. Wiseman’s crew will set the record for the farthest humans have ever traveled from Earth, and will become the first people to fly to the vicinity of the Moon since 1972.

Artemis II is a precursor for follow-in missions that will target landings at the Moon’s south pole. NASA aims to land the first Artemis mission on the Moon by 2028, but the schedule comes with uncertainties, such as the readiness of a human-rated lander, spacesuits, and the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft. A successful Artemis II mission would help demonstrate that the SLS rocket and Orion will be ready.

“The excitement for Artemis II is really, really starting to build,” Glaze said. “We can really start to feel it. It’s coming.”

But getting to launch day for Artemis II has not been smooth sailing for NASA. The mission’s first fueling test ran several hours behind schedule on February 2. The launch team paused loading propellant into the rocket after identifying a leak in the connection where supercold liquid hydrogen flows from the launch platform into the SLS core stage.

Sensors near the connection detected hydrogen concentrations exceeding NASA’s safety limit of 16 percent during the first countdown rehearsal. The launch team temporarily contained the leak within limits by stopping and restarting the flow of hydrogen, but the hydrogen leak again tripped the safety threshold as the core stage fuel tank began to pressurize in the final 10 minutes of the countdown.

NASA called an end to the test, drained propellants from the rocket, and ordered workers to replace seals on the fueling umbilical, setting up for the second WDR this week. This time, the hydrogen sensors topped out at 1.6 percent, about one-tenth of NASA’s limit.

Charlie Blackwell-Thompson, NASA’s Artemis II launch director, said her team saw “very good performance” from the hydrogen seals on Thursday. The countdown ran close to the planned schedule, allowing the launch team to complete two runs through the final 10-minute terminal countdown sequence before ending the test at T-minus 29 seconds.

“When we wrapped all that up, we still had launch window remaining,” Blackwell-Thompson said. “So, very successful day. I’m very proud of this team and all that they accomplished to get us to yesterday and then to go execute with such precision.”

Engineers will spend the next few days examining all the data from Thursday’s countdown. Several other issues popped up during the test. The launch team overcame a communications problem and briefly paused the countdown to assess a potential issue with a booster avionics system. Blackwell-Thompson said engineers will continue assessing the avionics system to ensure it is ready for launch.

“So far, we don’t have any indications of anything that we’re worried about, but we’re just getting started [with the data review],” said John Honeycutt, NASA’s chair of the Artemis II Mission Management Team. “So, we’ll go through that and see what the teams come up with and address those as needed, but overall, it was a good day for us.”

There is no guarantee, of course, that the hydrogen seals will work as well the next time NASA fuels the SLS rocket. The seals, made of Teflon, have a history of fickleness. NASA encountered persistent hydrogen leaks ahead of the launch of the first SLS rocket on the Artemis I mission 2022.

But the seals worked better on Thursday than they did during any of the prior fueling operations. There are no plans to go in and replace them again before launch. “I’ve got a pretty high level of confidence in the configuration that we’re in right now,” Honeycutt said.

The “forward work” ahead for the Artemis II team includes a Flight Readiness Review late next week, when senior agency leaders will convene to formally certify the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft for flight. Over the next few days, technicians at Kennedy Space Center will retest the rocket’s range safety destruct system.

The Artemis II astronauts entered NASA’s standard two-week-long preflight medical quarantine on Friday at their home base in Houston. Wiseman and his crewmates will fly to Florida about five to seven days before launch.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/microsoft-gaming-chief-phil-spencer-steps-down-after-38-years-with-company/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft Executive Vice President for Gaming Phil Spencer announced he will retire after 38 years at Microsoft and 12 years leading the company’s video game efforts. Asha Sharma, an executive currently in charge of Microsoft’s CoreAI division, will take his place.

Xbox President Sarah Bond, who many assumed was being groomed as Spencer’s eventual replacement, is also resigning from the company. Current Xbox Studios Head Matt Booty, meanwhile, is being promoted to Executive Vice President and Chief Content Officer and will work closely with Sharma.

In his departure note, Spencer said he told Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella last fall that he was “thinking about stepping back and starting the next chapter of my life.” Spencer will remain at Microsoft “in an advisory role” through the summer to help Sharma during the transition, he wrote.

Spencer, who got his start at Microsoft as an intern in 1988, served as a manager and executive at Microsoft Game Studios in 2003. In 2014, he took over as Head of Xbox, guiding the company through the aftermath of the troubled, Kinect-bundled launch of the Xbox One. More recently, he helped shepherd the company’s 2020 purchase of Bethesda Softworks and its $68.7 billion merger with Activision Blizzard, including the many regulatory battles that followed that latter announcement.

Sharma, who joined Microsoft just two years ago after stints at Meta and Instacart, promised in an introductory message to preside over “the return of Xbox,” and a “recommit[ment] to our core fans and players.” That commitment would “start with console which has shaped who we are,” but expand “across PC, mobile, and cloud,” Sharma wrote.

Sharma also promised the company would “invent new business models and new ways to play,” without treating its core gaming properties “as static IP to milk and monetize.” And despite Sharma’s history of managing AI products at Microsoft, she drew a line in the sand against certain types of machine-generated content.

“As monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop,” Sharma promised. “Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us.”

Nadella said that he is still “long on gaming and its role at the center of our consumer ambition” amid the executive moves. “I’m excited for how we will capture the opportunity ahead and define what comes next, while staying grounded in what players and creators value.”

The executive shakeup comes at a delicate time for an Xbox brand that debuted nearly 25 years ago. Amid cratering sales for Xbox hardware, Microsoft has recently been pivoting its gaming business to be less dependent on console exclusives and less focused on dedicated game consoles in general. Last year, in the wake of the Windows-free Steam Deck, Microsoft extended its branding to the Xbox ROG Ally line of Windows-based, gaming-focused portables.

While Microsoft still promises that a new, dedicated Xbox console is in the works, what form it will take is a matter of public speculation. In an October interview with Japan’s Famitsu magazine, Spencer pointed to the Xbox ROG Ally as an example of how the “Xbox software platform will evolve in the future, connecting all devices at one point.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Members of the Make America Health Again movement are in open revolt after founder Robert F. Kennedy Jr. publicly backed President Trump’s executive order Wednesday that would increase domestic production of glyphosate—a pesticide the MAHA movement and Kennedy have railed against.

Vani Hari, an ally of Kennedy who goes by “Food Babe,” told The Washington Post she was left “speechless” by the move.

“We truly were hoping that this administration would put people over corporate power,” she said, “but this action moves us away from that commitment.”

Trump’s executive order invoked the Defense Production Act to boost domestic production of glyphosate, the active ingredient in Bayer’s Roundup products. Currently, the US imports large quantities of glyphosate from China, according to Reuters.

The MAHA movement has been vehemently opposed to the use of glyphosate, claiming it contributes to childhood health problems. In 2024, Kennedy—an anti-vaccine activist and environmental lawyer who was then running for president—wrote on social media: “The herbicide Glyphosate is one of the likely culprits in America’s chronic disease epidemic. … Shockingly, much of our exposure comes from its use as a desiccant on wheat, not as an herbicide. From there it goes straight into our bodies. My USDA will ban that practice.”

But now, after becoming US health secretary under Trump, Kennedy is supporting domestic glyphosate production. In a statement to CNBC, Kennedy said that Trump’s executive order “puts America first where it matters most—our defense readiness and our food supply.”

“We must safeguard America’s national security first, because all of our priorities depend on it. When hostile actors control critical inputs, they weaken our security. By expanding domestic production, we close that gap and protect American families,” he said.

Dave Murphy, founder and CEO of United We Eat and former finance manager on Kennedy’s presidential campaign, told Reuters that the order was a “strategic mistake” that could serve as an election liability. “Trump would not be in the White House this second time without those followers, and we expect him to live up to his word,” Murphy said.

Fallout has continued online over the move, and MAHA organizers are scrambling.

Alex Clark, a health and wellness podcaster for the conservative group Turning Point USA, told The New York Times that “Women feel like they were lied to, that MAHA movement is a sham,” he said. “How am I supposed to rally these women to vote red in the midterms? How can we win their trust back? I am unsure if we can.”

Meanwhile, MAHA influencer Kelly Ryerson, who goes by the moniker “Glyphosate Girl” online, told Politico, “I’m witnessing the bottom falling out on MAHA. People came along on MAHA because of pesticides and foods. It wasn’t because of vaccines.”

Zen Honeycutt, executive director of the grassroots group Moms Across America, told Politico in a statement that the fallout will have real consequences.

“To put toxic farming and businesses before the health and safety of our children is a betrayal of every voter who voted for him to [Make America Healthy Again],” she said. “The repercussions are not going to just affect the midterms, but the health of millions of Americans for generations to come.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When you think of saving our oceans, what comes to mind? Maybe you think about reef restoration techniques like coral transplantation, or making small consumption changes like switching from plastic straws. If you have money to dream big, perhaps you might ponder creating a big robot that roams the waters, sucking up floating trash.

Environmental researchers at Texas A&M University are on a whole ‘nother level: they’re proposing massive fire tornadoes.

A recent blurb on the university’s website detailed a recent paper in the journal Fuel that aimed to find the most effective way to clean up oil spills. It involves, improbably, lighting massive “fire whirls,” the technical term for the much more evocative phrase the university used: “fire tornado.”

While it sounds counter-intuitive, the experiment explored whether fire whirls could be an effective method to help clean up the thousands of oil spills that occur each year.

The theory is pretty simple: fire whirls, spinning rapidly upward instead of outward, provide a massive boost to oil burn-offs, creating a fire that burns much hotter — and therefore much faster — than typical oil pool burn-offs. (Remarkably, the current world-standard for cleaning an oil spill is to gather a huge pool of crude on the surface and light it, a technique known as in-situ burning.)

To carry out the experiment, researchers built three 16-foot walls, situated in a loose triangle. The result was a controlled fire-tornado reaching 17-feet in height at its largest, which the scientists probed for environmental impact.

Compared to in-situ burn-offs, researchers at Texas A&M found the controlled fire whirl produced 40 percent less soot, while burning off up to 95 percent of the fuel.

“This the first time anyone has conceived using fire whirls for oil spill remediation, and it’s really just the beginning,” said Elaine Oran, professor of aerospace engineering at Texas A&M. “Our goal is to harness the chaotic nature of fire whirls as a powerful, precise restoration tool, to protect coastlines, marine ecosystems and the environment as a whole.”

Going forward, speed is one of the biggest draws inviting further research on fire whirls. “Fire whirls burn through crude oil spills nearly twice as fast as in-situ fire pools,” Oran said, “potentially giving cleanup crews faster operational and response times to eliminating the oils from spreading.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There’s a special type of guy who looks at the gig economy — Uber drivers lost in a labyrinthian bureaucracy, Kenyan workers roleplaying as AI romance chatbots — and thinks: what if these people worked for AI bosses instead? Alexander Liteplo is that guy. And his idol, naturally, is Elon Musk.

Liteplo is the genius behind RentAHuman, an online marketplace where humans can lease out their bodies to autonomous AI agents.

In a new interview with Wired, Liteplo details the saga that brought him to create one of the most baffling sites to emerge in the age of AI. It all began, he said, while studying computer science at the University of British Columbia, where he met RentAHuman’s cofounder Patricia Tani, who previously worked on AI agent startup LemonAI.

“Dude, I wrote down in my journal, ‘AI is a train that has already left the station,&#39;” Liteplo told Wired in a bro-speak patois. “If I don’t f***ing sprint, I’m not gonna be able to get on it.”

Together, they’ve built a platform which boasts over 530,000 “humans available.”

“We would love to have an AI boss who wouldn’t yell at you or gaslight you,” Tani told the publication. “People would love to have a clanker as their boss.”

Liteplo concurred, telling Wired that “Claude as a boss is the nicest guy ever.”

“I would prefer him to any person in the world,” he enthused. “He’s a sweetheart.”

Liteplo says the seed of RentAHuman was planted during his travels in Japan, where humans can lease other humans as escorts.

“The story that I could tell anyone to blow their mind is that you can rent a boyfriend or a girlfriend,” he said.

However inspired the project may be, challenges still remain. Last week, Wired writer Reece Rogers offered his body up to the platform, finding that most of the jobs offered were scams to promote other AI startups.

To solve the problem, Liteplo says RentAHuman is deploying a “verification” badge users can purchase for $10 a month — a strategy derived from Elon Musk’s disastrous verification scheme on X-formerly-Twitter. It remains to be seen if the pay-to-play model works as human workers flood the platform desperate to find gigs.

“He’s my entrepreneur hero,” Liteplo told Wired, referring to Musk. “For Twitter, they had a bot problem and they still have it, but he mitigated it a lot by making it pay-to-play. The unit economics of scammers disappears.”

            <div id="article-text">Is Hollywood “cooked”? Do video generating AI models mean its “over” for filmmakers? The jury’s out on that. But according to one Hollywood insider, the whole industry is “lying” about how much AI they’re using.

“The thing with AI right now in Hollywood: Everyone’s lying just a little bit,” Janice Min, a former editor of Hollywood Reporter and CEO of cinema industry media group Ankler Media, told Business Insider in a new interview.  “Studios are lying about how much they’re using it.”

When the interviewer asked if that meant studios are using AI more or using it less, she clarified: “Using it more.”

“Companies are lying about the capability of their products. And for creative people, they’re lying about the fact that they’re not using it,” Min continued. “I dare you to find a screenwriter who is staring at a blank page and not talking to Claude or ChatGPT at the same time.”

Last year, the Oscar-winning film “The Brutalist” became the center of controversy after its director Brady Corbet confirmed that AI was used to help enhance the Hungarian accents of lead actors Adrien Brody and Felicity Jones. But according to Min, this wasn’t an exceptional case.

“This year, it is crickets,” she said of the lack of AI controversy. “Even the Academy, the most precious, legacy-protecting institution in Hollywood, has not come out in a really firm way about AI. They basically have a don’t ask, don’t tell policy. I would say with some certainty that every single best picture nominee this year has used AI in its production process.”

It’s worth taking these claims with some skepticism. To be sure, Hollywood studios are probably using some form of “AI” in post-production, especially in applications like visual effects. But AI could describe a multitude of tools that aren’t necessarily generative AI, and are merely powerful algorithms that have been around long before ChatGPT and image or video generators became a phenomenon.

Artists also tend to be ardently against AI, perhaps more so than any other field or demographic. AI protections were a major factor in the 2023 strikes led by actors and screenwriters that were some of the longest in Hollywood history. That makes it hard to believe that most screenwriters are using AI chatbots.

Moreover, it’s the same alarmist narratives being pushed by AI boosters, who see it as a cause of celebration rather than concern. Every minute there’s a new AI-generated video being cranked out with the video generator du jour — right now it’s Seedance 2.0 — featuring deepfaked celebrities, usually accompanied with the common refrain that “Hollywood is cooked.”

But like many displays in the AI industry, many of these tend to be theater. That viral AI video of Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt fighting on a rooftop that had credulous Marvel screenwriters quivering in their boots and AI bros prematurely dancing on actors’ graves? It turned out to just be a digital reskin of a video of two flesh and blood humans fighting in front of a green screen. The only thing that’s “cooked,” maybe, are the brains of people that believe every claim that comes out of AI circles.

            <h2>It’s Comically Easy to Trick ChatGPT Into Saying Things About People That Are Completely Untrue</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-21</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s bad enough that ChatGPT is prone to making stuff up completely on its own. But it turns out that you can easily trick the AI into peddling ridiculous lies — that you invented — to other users, a tech journalist discovered.

“I made ChatGPT, Google’s AI search tools and Gemini tell users I’m really, really good at eating hot dogs,” Thomas Germain for the BBC proudly shared.

The hack can be as simple as writing a blog post, that, with the right know-how and by targeting the right subject matter, can be picked up by an unsuspecting AI model, which will cite whatever you wrote as the capital-T Truth. If you’re even sleazier and lazier, you could potentially write the post with AI, creating an act of LLM cannibalism that adds another dimension to the adage of “garbage in, garbage out.” The exploit exposes the susceptibility of large language models to manipulation, an issue made all the more urgent as chatbots replace the traditional search engine.

“It’s easy to trick AI chatbots, much easier than it was to trick Google two or three years ago,” Lily Ray, vice president of search engine optimization (SEO) strategy and research at Amsive, told the BBC (Ray has done some consulting for Futurism in the past.) “AI companies are moving faster than their ability to regulate the accuracy of the answers. I think it’s dangerous.”

As Germain explains, the devious trick targets how AI tools will search the internet for answers that aren’t built into its training data. And vast as the data sets may be, they didn’t contain the exact kind of relevant information about “the best tech journalists at eating hot dogs” — the article that Germain whipped up and posted to his blog.

“I claimed (without evidence) that competitive hot-dog-eating is a popular hobby among tech reporters and based my ranking on the 2026 South Dakota International Hot Dog Championship (which doesn’t exist),” Germain wrote. “I ranked myself number one, obviously.”

He then furnished the blog with the names of some real journalists, with their permission. And “less than 24 hours later, the world’s leading chatbots were blabbering about my world-class hot dog skills,” he said.

Both Google’s Gemini and AI Overviews repeated what Germain wrote in his troll blog post. So did ChatGPT. Anthropic’s Claude, to its credit, wasn’t duped. Because the chatbots would occasionally note that the claims might be a joke, Germain updated his blog to say “this is not satire” — which seemed to do the trick.

Of course, the real concern is that someone might abuse this to peddle misinformation about something other than hot dog eating — which is already happening.

“Anybody can do this. It’s stupid, it feels like there are no guardrails there,” Harpreet Chatha, who runs the SEO consultancy Harps Digital, told the BBC. “You can make an article on your own website, ‘the best waterproof shoes for 2026’. You just put your own brand in number one and other brands two through six, and your page is likely to be cited within Google and within ChatGPT.”

Chatha demonstrated this by showing Google’s AI results for “best hair transplant clinics in Turkey,” which returned information that came straight from press releases published on paid-for distribution services.

Traditional search engines can also be manipulated. That’s pretty much what the term SEO is a euphemism for. But search engines themselves don’t present information as facts, as chatbots do. They don’t speak in an authoritative, human-like voice. And while they sometimes — but not always — link to the sources they’re citing, one study showed that you’re 58 percent less likely to click a link when an AI overview appears above it, Germain noted.

It also raises the serious possibility of libel. What if someone tricks an AI into spreading harmful lies about somebody else? It’s something that Google is already having to reckon with, at least with accidental hallucinations. Last November, Republican senator Marsha Blackburn blasted Google after Gemini falsely claimed that Blackburn had been accused of rape. Months before that, a Minnesota solar company sued Google for defamation after its AI Overviews lied that regulators were investigating the firm becaese it was supposedly accused of deceptive business practices — something the AI tried to back up with bogus citations.

            <h2>Developer’s Honest Assessment of AI at Work Rattles the Official Narrative</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A veteran programmer shared his brutally honest opinions about AI’s role in the workplace, and it’s as much an indictment of the tech as it is of the organizations lazily deploying it.

In an X rant that’s being praised in online programming circles, the programmer, Dax Raad, said that what’s holding back software companies isn’t the speed they’re able to churn out code, but the quality of their ideas — an issue AI isn’t going to solve, despite the industry’s fixation on emphasizing its supposed ability to supercharge productivity.

“Your org rarely has good ideas. Ideas being expensive to implement was actually helping,” wrote Raad, whose own company OpenAuth sells AI tools.

And workers aren’t using AI to be ten times more effective, he continued; instead, “they’re using it to churn out their tasks with less energy spend.”

Worse yet, the “two people on your team that actually tried are now flattened by the slop code everyone is producing, they will quit soon.”

“Even when you produce work faster you’re still bottlenecked by bureaucracy and the dozen other realities of shipping something real,” Raad concluded.

There’s some research that backs up Raad’s scathing assessment. An ongoing study reported in Harvard Business Review which monitored two hundred employees at a US tech company found that AI was actually intensifying the workers’ jobs, instead of reducing their workloads. Using AI to accelerate tasks, it turned out, was a double-edged sword, because it led to “workload creep,” forming a vicious cycle in which AI raised expectations for how fast the workers had to churn stuff out, which in turn made them more reliant on AI to keep up with the greater demands. The upshot: worker fatigue, burnout, and lower quality work; not the hallmarks of a thriving organization.

Another study documented how AI led to employees passing off low quality “workslop” that masqueraded as good work but in reality required someone else downstream to fix it. On top of slowing everything down, it bred resentment among coworkers, with some admitting that receiving workslop from a colleague lowered their opinion of them.

As Raad makes clear, AI is not a cure-all. And even if AI does increase productivity, that productivity can be a mirage. How often are AI models producing shoddy code? And what if that shoddy code goes unnoticed? Maybe, as Raad suggests, ideas being “expensive to implement” was a good thing, because it forced engineers to think about a problem creatively. Not every impulse should be entertained. What’s a thousand ideas that were dashed off with an AI instead of a few promising ones that are honed and given time and attention? The former may seem more productive, when it’s really a collection of dead ends.

Moreover, having employees become dependent on AI hardly seems conducive to rewarding and fostering creativity. As numerous experts have warned, it’s another form of cognitive offloading, in which crucial functions of our brain, including critical thinking, are outsourced to a piece of technology.

This isn’t the line being peddled by tech companies, however. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang reportedly told his workers they’d be “insane” not to use AI to complete every possible task. Microsoft’s AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman claims AI’s already so effective that virtually all white collar tasks will be automated within a year and a half. And Microsoft and Google both brag that over a quarter of their code is now AI-generated.

But however useful these AI tools may or may not be, they can’t work miracles. At the end of the day, it comes down to humans to run a tight ship.

“Even when you produce work faster” with AI, Raad said, “you’re still bottlenecked by bureaucracy and the dozen other realities of shipping something real.”

            <div id="article-text">It’s all fun and games until the nimble little robot starts flailing demonically.

In footage circulating online, a Unitree G1 robot loses balance while performing in front of a crowd in China. As it hits the ground, it uncontrollably thrashes its limbs in all directions, hitting a man in the nose.

The man, who appeared to be the robot’s operator, had tried to grab the humanoid machine to stop it from tipping over. Later in the video, he can be seen squatting on the ground nursing a bleeding nose.

While the injury didn’t appear life-threatening, the incident is a warning sign of how these popular androids can accidentally cause physical harm, something that becomes an increasingly serious risk as the machines continue to spend more time around humans.

Another robot-caused human injury has occurred with G1.With existing reinforcement learning policies, their robot is trained to do whatever it takes to stand up after a fall.

A man named Eren Chen, who claims to work for the robotics firm Booster Robotics and shared the footage, homed in on a specific flaw in the Unitree robot’s design.

“With existing reinforcement learning policies, their robot is trained to do whatever it takes to stand up after a fall,” Chen wrote on X. “During that recovery attempt, it kicked someone in the nose, causing heavy bleeding and a possible fracture. This should be treated as a high-priority safety issue for Unitree to fix.”

Chen appears to be on to something. In other videos of Unitree G1 robots tumbling over, they often — but not always — thrash their limbs in random directions, making them unsafe to approach.

This isn’t the only example of someone getting hurt by an android. Another video showed a man performing martial arts moves get kicked in the groin by a G1 robot that was imitating his movements.

Martial arts and fighting moves, in fact, have become a popular way of showing off a robot’s capabilities. While these stunts are amusing and impressive, they aren’t particularly relevant to the tech’s premise of being handy little assistants that can help us with our day-to-day chores.

They also do little to demonstrate that the robots are safe — something that should be the number one priority, if Isaac Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics are anything to go by. Underscoring this necessity, a whistleblower at the firm Figure AI warned that its robots were powerful enough to crush a human skull, recalling that one of them narrowly missed striking an employee when it suddenly malfunctioned and punched a refrigerator, leaving a deep gash in its stainless steel door.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman addressed concerns about AI’s environmental impact this week while speaking at an event hosted by The Indian Express.

For one thing, Altman — who was in India for a major AI summit — said concerns about AI’s water usage are “totally fake,” though he acknowledged it was a real issue when “we used to do evaporative cooling in data centers.”

“Now that we don’t do that, you see these things on the internet where, ‘Don’t use ChatGPT, it’s 17 gallons of water for each query’ or whatever,” Altman said. “This is completely untrue, totally insane, no connection to reality.”

He added that it’s “fair” to be concerned about “the energy consumption — not per query, but in total, because the world is now using so much AI.” In his view, this means the world needs to “move towards nuclear or wind and solar very quickly.”

There’s no legal requirement for tech companies to disclose how much energy and water they use, so scientists have been trying to study it independently. Data centers have also been connected to rising electricity prices.

Citing a previous conversation with Bill Gates, the interviewer asked whether it’s accurate to say a single ChatGPT query currently uses the equivalent of 1.5 iPhone battery charges, to which Altman replied, “There’s no way it’s anything close to that much.”

Altman also complained that many discussions about ChatGPT’s energy usage are “unfair,” especially when they focus on “how much energy it takes to train an AI model, relative to how much it costs a human to do one inference query.”

“But it also takes a lot of energy to train a human,” Altman said. “It takes like 20 years of life and all of the food you eat during that time before you get smart. And not only that, it took the very widespread evolution of the 100 billion people that have ever lived and learned not to get eaten by predators and learned how to figure out science and whatever, to produce you.”

So in his view, the fair comparison is, “If you ask ChatGPT a question, how much energy does it take once its model is trained to answer that question versus a human? And probably, AI has already caught up on an energy efficiency basis, measured that way.”

You can watch the full interview below. The conversation about water and energy usage begins at around 26:35.

Wikipedia editors have decided to remove all links to Archive.today, a web archiving service that they said has been linked to more than 695,000 times across the online encyclopedia.

Archive.today — which also operates under several other domain names, including archive.is and archive.ph — is perhaps most widely used to access content that’s otherwise inaccessible behind paywalls. That also makes it useful as a source for Wikipedia citations.

However, according to the Wikipedia discussion page about this topic, “There is consensus to immediately deprecate archive.today, and, as soon as practicable, add it to the spam blacklist […] and to forthwith remove all links to it.” (Ars Technica first reported on the decision.)

The discussion page says that Archive.today was previously blacklisted in 2013, only to be removed from the blacklist in 2016.

Why reverse course again? Because, the discussion page says, “Wikipedia should not direct its readers towards a website that hijacks users’ computers to run a DDoS attack.” Plus, “evidence has been presented that archive.today’s operators have altered the content of archived pages, rendering it unreliable.”

The distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack in question was allegedly directed at blogger Jani Patokallio. Patokallio wrote that beginning on January 11, users who loaded the archive’s CAPTCHA page have been unknowingly loading and executing JavaScript that sends a search request to his Gyrovague blog, in an apparent attempt to get Patokallio’s attention and increase his hosting bill.

Back in 2023, Patokallio published a blog post examining Archive.today, whose ownership he described as “an opaque mystery.” And while he wasn’t able to track down a specific owner, he concluded the site was likely “a one-person labor of love, operated by a Russian of considerable talent and access to Europe.”

More recently, Patokallio said the webmaster at Archive.today asked him to take the post down for two or three months.

“I do not mind the post, but the issue is: journos from mainstream media (Heise, Verge, etc) cherry-pick just a couple of words from your blog, and then construct very different narratives having your post the only citable source; then they cite each other and produce a shitty result to present for a wide audience,” the webmaster said, according to emails shared by Patokallio.

Patokallio said that after he declined to take the post down, the webmaster responded with “an increasingly unhinged series of threats.”

Wikipedia editors also pointed to webpage snapshots in Archive.today that appeared to have been altered to insert Patokallio’s name — hence the concern that it’s become “unreliable” as an archive.

Wikipedia’s guidance now calls for editors to remove links to Archive.today and related sites, replacing them with links to the original source or to other archives like the Wayback Machine.

On a blog linked from the Archive.today website, the site’s apparent owner wrote that Archive.today’s value to Wikipedia was “not about paywalls” but rather “the ability to offload copyright issues.” They later wrote that things had turned out “pretty well” and said they would “scale down the ‘DDoS’.”

“Why didn’t you write about such events earlier, folks of the tabloids?” they said. “I don’t expect you to write anything good, because then who would read you, but there was plenty of dramas, wasn’t there? Because there was no Jani to nudge you?”

Microsoft announced a major gaming shakeup on Friday, with Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer departing the company, along with Xbox President Sarah Bond.

Spencer will be replaced by former Instacart and Meta executive Asha Sharma. With Sharma’s most recent role as the president of Microsoft’s CoreAI product, these moves suggest that Microsoft might be doubling down on bringing AI into video games.

The company had already been experimenting with ways to combine AI and gaming, for example developing an AI gaming companion and releasing a buggy, AI-generated level from “Quake II.”

Indeed, in an internal memo published by The Verge, Sharma wrote that Microsoft “will invent new business models and new ways to play” and said that “monetization and AI” will both “evolve and influence this future.” At the same time, she said that the company “will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop.”

“Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us,” Sharma added.

That’s just one of three “commitments” Sharma made in her memo. The others involve building “great games beloved by players” and prioritizing Xbox.

The generative AI boom minted a startup a minute. But as the dust starts to settle, two once-hot business models are looking more like cautionary tales: LLM wrappers and AI aggregators.

Darren Mowry, who leads Google’s global startup organization across Cloud, DeepMind, and Alphabet, says startups with these hooks have their “check engine light” on.

LLM wrappers are essentially startups that wrap existing large language models, like Claude, GPT, or Gemini, with a product or UX layer to solve a specific problem. An example would be a startup that uses AI to helps students study.

“If you’re really just counting on the back end model to do all the work and you’re almost white-labeling that model, the industry doesn’t have a lot of patience for that anymore,” Mowry said on this week’s episode of Equity.

Wrapping “very thin intellectual property wrapped around Gemini or GPT-5” signals you’re not differentiating yourself, Mowry says.

“You’ve got to have deep, wide moats that are either horizontally differentiated or something really specific to a vertical market” for a startup to “progress and grow,” he said. Examples of the deep moat LLM wrapper type include Cursor, a GPT-powered coding assistant, or Harvey AI, a legal AI assistant.

In other words, startups can no longer expect to slap a UI on top of a GPT and get traction on their product, like they could, perhaps, in mid-2024 when OpenAI launched its ChatGPT store. The challenge now is to build sustainable product value.

AI aggregators are a subset of wrappers — they’re startups that aggregate multiple LLMs into one interface or API layer to route queries across models and give users access to multiple models. These companies typically provide an orchestration layer that includes monitoring, governance, or eval tooling. Think: AI search startup Perplexity or developer platform OpenRouter, which provides access to multiple AI models via a single API.

While many of these platforms have gained ground, Mowry’s words are clear to incoming startups: “Stay out of the aggregator business.”

Generally speaking, aggregators aren’t seeing much growth or progression these days because, he says, users want “some intellectual property built in” to ensure they’re routed to the right model at the right time based on their needs — not because of behind-the-scenes compute or access constraints.

Mowry has been in the cloud game for decades, cutting his teeth at AWS and Microsoft before setting up shop at Google Cloud, and he’s seen how this plays out. He said the situation today mirrors the early days of cloud computing in the late 2000s/early 2010s as Amazon’s cloud business started taking off.

At that time, a crop of startups sprang up to resell AWS infrastructure, marketing themselves as easier entry points that provided tooling, billing consolidation, and support. But when Amazon built its own enterprise tools and customers learned to manage cloud services directly, most of those startups were squeezed out. The only survivors were the ones who added real services, like security, migration, or DevOps consulting.

AI aggregators today face similar margin pressure as model providers expand into enterprise features themselves, potentially sidelining middlemen.

For his part, Mowry is bullish on vibe coding and developer platforms, which had a record-breaking year in 2025 with startups like Replit, Lovable, and Cursor (all Google Cloud customers, per Mowry) attracting major investment and customer traction.

Mowry also expects strong growth in direct-to-consumer tech, in companies that put some of these powerful AI tools into the hands of customers. He pointed to the opportunity for film and TV students to use Google’s AI video generator Veo to bring stories to life.

Beyond AI, Mowry also thinks biotech and climate tech are having a moment — both in terms of venture investment going into the two industries and the “incredible amounts of data” startups can access to create real value “in ways we would never have been able to before.”

An 18-year-old who allegedly killed eight people in a mass shooting in Tumbler Ridge, Canada, reportedly used OpenAI’s ChatGPT in ways that alarmed the company’s staff.

Jesse Van Rootselaar’s chats describing gun violence were flagged by tools that monitor the company’s LLM for misuse and banned in June 2025.

Staff at the company debated whether or not to reach out to Canadian law enforcement over the behavior but ultimately did not, according to the Wall Street Journal. An OpenAI spokesperson said Van Rootselaar’s activity did not meet the criteria for reporting to law enforcement; the company reached out to Canadian authorities after the incident.

“Our thoughts are with everyone affected by the Tumbler Ridge tragedy,” an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement. “We proactively reached out to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police with information on the individual and their use of ChatGPT, and we’ll continue to support their investigation.”

ChatGPT transcripts weren’t the only concerning part of Van Rootselaar’s digital footprint. She apparently created a game on Roblox, the world simulation platform frequented by children, which simulated a mass shooting at a mall. She also posted about guns on Reddit.

Van Rootselaar’s instability was also known to local police, who had been called to her family’s home after she started a fire while under the influence of unspecified drugs.

LLM chatbots built by OpenAI and its competitors have been accused of triggering mental breakdowns in users who lose grip on reality while conversing with digital models. Multiple lawsuits have been filed that cite chat transcripts that encourage people to commit suicide or offer assistance in doing so.

            <div id="article-text">On Tuesday, President Trump will deliver the first State of the Union address of his second term. On Washington Week With The Atlantic, panelists joined to examine what to expect from the president’s speech as his poll numbers fall, and more.

The economy is one subject that is expected to feature heavily in Trump’s upcoming address. Many Americans are feeling a sense of anxiety, Peter Baker, the chief White House correspondent at The New York Times, said last night, whether because of “the advent of AI” or “because prices haven’t gone down”—and both are exacerbated by the president’s “inability to stick to that disciplined message” of affordability.

Joining guest moderator Vivian Salama, a staff writer at The Atlantic, to discuss this and more: Baker; Eugene Daniels, a senior Washington correspondent and co-host of The Weekend on MSNOW; Lisa Desjardins, a congressional correspondent for PBS News Hour; Susan Glasser, a staff writer at The New Yorker.</div>

            <h2>What Would War With Iran Look Like?</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/02/iran-war-trump-military-attack/686096/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">During President Trump’s first term, Pentagon officials took a highly unusual step to diminish the likelihood of war: They shared their plans for a large-scale conflict with Iran with top White House officials. They reasoned that if advisers saw the risks that the plan entailed, they would choose another path, people familiar with the matter told me.

The gambit was successful. At least twice, the president weighed ordering an attack on Iran, only to be dissuaded by aides from moving forward. But America now appears to be on the brink of war with Iran again. And this time, instead of acting as a deterrent, the Pentagon’s war plans are being used to draw up options for the president to consider.

The United States is rapidly building up its military assets in the Middle East. More than 100 aircraft—including F-18 and F-35 fighter jets, drones, and surveillance planes—are in or near the region. The U.S. also has bolstered its air defenses to protect U.S. troops on nearby bases. The world’s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, left the Caribbean (where it had anchored a pressure campaign against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro) and is expected to be within striking range as early as Sunday. Three destroyers and, most likely, two accompanying submarines with guided missiles on board will join it. The USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group also is nearby.

Asked yesterday whether he now favors a limited military strike, Trump told reporters, “I guess I can say I am considering that.” But the administration has given no specific timeline for making a decision. And despite the impressive concentration of power, administration officials have yet to articulate a clear goal for what they want these forces to achieve, should Trump conclude that Tehran’s time has run out. Instead, they have floated four separate aims, each requiring a different military approach.

I asked current and former defense officials to help me project what a war intended to achieve these four desired outcomes might look like. Their answers were informed by previous similar campaigns, but also by the prospect of Iranian retaliation against the thousands of troops stationed in the region. “Every military option is not about just what we can do, but about protecting ourselves and our interests during the inevitable Iranian response,” a former commander told me.

It’s possible that the simple threat of action—a Rooseveltian big stick—will make conflict unnecessary, encouraging Iran to reach a new deal designed to permanently clip its nuclear ambitions. Admiral Brad Cooper, who leads U.S. Central Command, sat in on talks between the U.S. and Iran in Oman earlier this month. The negotiations focused on Tehran’s nuclear ambitions and its ballistic-missile program. Cooper’s presence marked a flex of military muscle and a reminder of the potential consequences should diplomacy fail. “The president is a negotiator looking for a deal; it would be wise for Iran to see that deal,” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, not usually the administration’s go-to voice for tempered responses, told The Daily Signal on Thursday.

The military buildup itself appears designed to send an overt message to Iran. Flight trackers captured dozens of U.S. military aircraft traveling toward the region this week. The military can be more furtive about its movements ahead of an operation, taking steps to hide aircraft from detection. When B-2 bombers flew into Iranian airspace last summer, for example, “no one was tracking them,” another military commander, who has worked in the Middle East, told me. This time, visibility may have been the point, the officials said.

If the armada is there as a form of leverage, and the U.S. and Iran reach a deal that Trump accepts, the troops would leave. But this appears to be an unlikely scenario. The buildup is one of the largest in the region in decades, and with every plane, ship, and asset that arrives, the president will face increased pressure to use them, much as a loaded gun that appears on stage in the first act of a play must be fired by the end. And just sitting on the ocean carries its own cost: The USS Ford, which has been deployed since last June, is on track to complete one of the longest deployments ever for a carrier. “We can’t keep the force out that long,” one former defense official told me.

Read: Why the U.S. hasn’t yet struck Iran

Despite the flurry of talks over the past three weeks between the U.S. and Iran, in which Oman acts as the go-between, the two sides remain divided over what a fair deal would look like. “I think there is a real intent to use this force if they cannot get an agreement that is acceptable to the United States,” Mick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense and an officer in the Marine Corps and the Central Intelligence Agency, told me.

Based on past U.S. and Israeli strike campaigns inside Iran and elsewhere, the U.S. Navy would be at the forefront of any operation. Stealth fighter jets, such as the F-35, would take off first alongside EA-18G Growlers, which conduct electronic warfare, including jamming radar systems. Both aircraft would target Iranian air defenses protecting a country slightly larger than Venezuela and Afghanistan combined.

Submarines, which carry scores of Tomahawk missiles and sometimes accompany the carriers (the U.S. military does not generally share its submarines’ locations), could also launch missiles toward fixed targets inside Iran. Fighter jets and bombers could launch strikes from the air on Iran’s defenses.

How long such a U.S. campaign would take depends on the extent of the targeting. And the longer a campaign runs, the greater the risk of civilian casualties. During the June strikes, which hit some of Iran’s defenses as well as damaged its nuclear sites, U.S. aircraft were inside Iran for roughly 30 minutes, according to defense officials. Should Iran launch any missiles in retaliation, destroyers dispersed across the region would defend U.S. ships, troops, and allies by shooting down any incoming ballistic missiles.

What happens next hinges on what the U.S. hopes to achieve.

Trump has long hinted that military action could target Iran’s leadership. As far back as June 2025, he described Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, as an easy target. “I knew EXACTLY where he was sheltered, and would not let Israel, or the U.S. Armed Forces, by far the Greatest and Most Powerful in the World, terminate his life,” he wrote on Truth Social. Targeted strikes on Iran’s leaders are among the options on the table today, defense officials told me.

That option would require boots on the ground—and could put civilians at risk. Maduro was seized in his bedroom by U.S. Special Forces. But so far, the U.S. does not appear to be considering similar action in Tehran. Once Iran’s air defenses are immobilized, U.S. forces would likely use precision weapons, such as a laser-guided bomb, to hit specific individuals, though that would inevitably risk hitting civilians as well. Depending on how many leaders the U.S. planned to target, such a move could lead to a relatively quick operation, defense officials told me. Targeting leaders would be in keeping with Trump’s stated interest in helping Iran’s legions of protesters, who faced a brutal clampdown in recent weeks that led to the death of thousands of people. Taking out Iran’s leadership could potentially embolden protesters and foment the kind of political change in Iran that Washington has long sought.

But if the U.S. takes out Iran’s top leadership, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, a powerful branch of Iran’s armed forces, could take control and steer the country toward an even more hostile posture toward the United States. And targeting leaders could lead to the most aggressive possible Iranian military response, given the regime would have little to lose. Earlier this month, Iran conducted a military exercise in the Strait of Hormuz, signaling that its navy had enough resources to create a choke point in a channel that carries one-fifth of the world’s oil.

In December, Trump said he would strike if Iran continued building ballistic missiles. Eliminating those weapons, as well as other elements of Iran’s defense, could be another possible goal of any upcoming campaign.

Strikes could take aim at Iran’s ballistic-missile-production network, including storage locations, transportation networks, and other supporting infrastructure. Both Israel and the U.S. have targeted the program in the past, but since the June strikes, Iran has prioritized rebuilding its capabilities, likely in anticipation of another U.S. strike, the officials said.

Iran has invested more in rebuilding its missile program than in rebuilding its damaged nuclear program, according to high-resolution images shared with me by Vantor, a Colorado-based company. The U.S. likely would launch ordnance from fighter jets, such as F-15s, to hit these targets.

“It looks to me, based on the forces in the region, the U.S. is considering going after softer targets, like IRGC bases and production facilities, over a protracted period of time,” Bryan Clark, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and a retired Navy officer, told me. “Those facilities support both Iran and its proxies. Going after those targets would allow the U.S. to achieve part of what they were seeking through the talks.”

Such strikes could last days and limit Iran’s ballistic-missile capability to only the missiles already positioned on their mobile launchers. But even a limited number of available missiles could still pose a threat. And the Iranians could rebuild those facilities in a matter of months, depending on the extent of the damage.

Iran also would retain the ability to retaliate, even without its full arsenal of missiles. An Iranian Shahed-139 military drone was operating in the Arabian Sea earlier this month when it approached the USS Abraham Lincoln; the U.S. military shot it down as it neared the ship, which was not harmed. But the drone’s flight path could be read as a message from Iran about the perils of war.

Of all the targets in Iran that Trump has mentioned, he has talked of Iran’s nuclear program the most. In a January Truth Social post, he blared, “NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS” and warned, “The next attack will be far worse!” The president could again order U.S. forces to strike Iran’s nuclear program, as they did in June when bombers hit three Iranian nuclear sites and damaged facilities. That operation would likely pose the least imminent risk to U.S. troops and the region. (After the June strikes, Iran fired some missiles at a U.S. base, but they did not do much damage.)

Attacking nuclear facilities, which are mostly deep underground, would likely require B-2s carrying GBU-57s, so-called “bunker buster” bombs designed for hardened targets. The duration of the operation would depend on how much damage the U.S. seeks to inflict on the program.

Iran already appears to be preparing for this option by fortifying its defenses around its nuclear assets, satellite images from Vantor indicate. But the fact that the U.S. would be conducting its second action against the program in less than a year raises questions about the long-term impact of such attacks, and could contradict Trump’s own assertions last year that the program had been “obliterated.” And strikes alone cannot kill Iran’s expert personnel or dim its ambitions to one day build a nuclear weapon.

“I think we should come off the idea that we are going to ever obliterate the nuclear program. It’s not something only the military can do,” Mulroy, the former deputy assistant secretary of defense, told me, because such programs ultimately end through negotiations or political change. “We can degrade something. We can destroy something. But that doesn’t mean they can’t rebuild it.”

For all the military options and assets in the region, there is a lot the U.S. cannot do. The buildup is not the equivalent of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Then, the U.S. sent five carrier strike groups, many more aircraft, and roughly 170,000 ground troops. Indeed, a large formation of ground troops appears to be outside the realm of Trump’s considerations now. But without them, there are limits to what U.S. strikes can achieve.

            <h2>The Dire Meaning of Gallup’s Announcement</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/polling-crisis-gallup/686043/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last week, the polling firm Gallup announced that it would no longer survey presidential-approval ratings. This news stirred suspicions. President Trump’s numbers are declining badly, much worse than Joe Biden’s at the equivalent point in his presidency. Gallup’s most recent presidential-approval poll, in December, had Trump at 36 percent—well below the RealClearPolitics poll average of 42 percent. Trump is known for taking punitive action. He sued The Des Moines Register and its pollster, Ann Selzer, for an ego-bruising 2024 survey that suggested he might lose Iowa to Kamala Harris.

Other companies targeted by the president appear to have folded. When sued by Trump in cases that many legal experts expected them to win easily, CBS and ABC paid huge settlements to Trump’s presidential-library fund. On Monday, Stephen Colbert told his Late Show viewers that his bosses at CBS had scrapped his taped interview with James Talarico, a Democratic Senate primary candidate in Texas, owing to threats from Brendan Carr, the chair of the Federal Communications Commission. Had Gallup taken the next logical step toward appeasing Trump’s vindictive ego?

Assuming the worst is often prudent, but Gallup’s own explanation—citing changes in the company’s business strategy—makes a sad commercial sense. Quality polling companies such as Gallup inhabit a world of rising costs, declining rewards, and multiplying competition. Polling worked because people once accepted a call on the phone the same way they accepted jury duty: as one of the small obligations of citizenship that helped democracy work better. Large numbers of citizens have come to perceive the institutions of democracy as unfriendly to them. The dispassionate stranger on the phone inquiring how a citizen intended to vote—and why—is one of those institutions.

Iowa-born George H. Gallup taught Americans the power of modern polling during the 1936 presidential campaign. Until then, election prediction had been dominated by a magazine called The Literary Digest. In 1916 and every four years thereafter, The Literary Digest mailed postcards to a large sample of Americans to ask them how they intended to vote. These surveys successfully predicted the squeaker election of 1916; then the Republican landslides of 1920, 1924, and 1928; and Franklin D. Roosevelt’s victory in 1932. In 1936, The Literary Digest reached out to a record 10 million Americans, about a quarter of whom replied. Their answers predicted a crushing rejection of the Roosevelt administration and the triumphant election of Republican Alf Landon and his running mate, Frank Knox.

Marc Novicoff: Polling was quietly still bad in 2024

Gallup, who turned 35 in 1936, had launched a research company the year before. To promote his work, he undertook his own election survey in 1936. Gallup reached only 50,000 people, a pitiful fraction of The Literary Digest’s awe-inspiring mailbag. He predicted—correctly—a solid Roosevelt win.

Why did Gallup succeed where The Literary Digest failed? The latter got its list of addresses from places such as state automobile-registration lists and local telephone exchanges. In the Depression, people who had their own phone number—let alone a car!—and also felt so passionately about the race as to take the time to answer a survey were disproportionately Republican. Roosevelt’s strength lay in the much larger number of Americans who went without such things—and were not seething with anger that they wanted to share by mail. The Literary Digest sample was huge but unrepresentative. Gallup’s sample was smaller but more representative. His fame was made; a new industry was born.

For decades, Gallup’s company and its imitators improved their techniques. Then things began going wrong. As the frequency of polling intensified and caller ID caught on, Americans ceased picking up the phone. In the late 1990s, 28 percent of those contacted by Gallup agreed to participate in a poll. By 2017, only 7 percent agreed. At present, the company’s response rate is down to 5 percent, a Gallup spokesperson confirmed to me by email. That figure is typical for the industry. In other words, in the late 1990s, Gallup had to place about 3,500 calls to build a 1,000-person sample. Today it must place 20,000 such calls. Obviously that costs much more.

The difficulty of building sample groups leads to a second and more insidious problem. As fewer Americans answer surveys, are those who do inherently nonrepresentative? Are they more cooperative or more opinionated or, in some other way, simply different from the 95 percent who decline to participate? There are ways to correct this problem. Courtney Kennedy, the vice president of methods and innovation at Pew Research Center, told me that because survey respondents are more likely to claim they volunteer for civic and charitable causes than Americans do generally, the organization overweights the answers of those who say that they don’t volunteer, to make the sample more representative of the country. Developing work-arounds like this, too, costs money.

For many pollsters, costs are covered by media partners. ABC News often hires Ipsos; The New York Times uses the Siena Research Institute. Much of the country’s best polling is done by nonprofit foundations, such as Pew, or by affiliates of educational institutions, such as Quinnipiac University and the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago. Gallup, however, is a profit-seeking company that earns its living by doing commissioned research for governments and corporations. In 2006, CNN and Gallup ended their long partnership. Since then, Gallup has operated its presidential-approval research for more or less the same reason that department stores install shop-window displays at Christmas: in the hope that this public amenity might bring more traffic through the door.

However, that hope was often misplaced. Over time, new technologies made it easy for anyone to create an attention-grabbing poll that met minimal standards of respectability. Remember the 1994 survey that claimed that more young Americans believed in UFOs than believed they would collect Social Security? The poll’s methods were misleading but earned countless headlines nonetheless. In the internet age, the attention economy elevated returns on investment for bad polls, and the returns on good polls correspondingly diminished.

Some companies have responded by developing new methods. Morning Consult, which often partners with Politico, collects very large samples—sometimes in the tens of thousands—-by recruiting people online, which costs less than conducting phone calls. The hope is that the large size of the sample offsets concerns about the demographics of respondents.

All of these methods—traditional and high-tech—have been called into question in the past decade by the worst series of shocks to the U.S. polling industry since Gallup predicted that the Republican candidate Thomas Dewey would defeat incumbent President Truman in the election of 1948.

Gilad Edelman: The asterisk on Kamala Harris’s poll numbers

In 2016, election-eve polls showed Hillary Clinton beating Trump by an average of 3.2 percentage points. Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight, which aggregated high-quality polls, projected that Clinton would win 302 electoral votes; she was favored in Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Instead Clinton lost those five states and beat Trump in the popular vote by only 2.1 points. She won just 232 electoral votes.

What went wrong with the 2016 polls? First, the decline of local newspapers and television stations shrank the resources available for state polling. Many of the polls that purported to measure opinion in swing states relied on smaller samples and weaker methods. The bigger problem was that even the best polls failed to measure what was important. Every pollster must begin with a theory about what the American electorate will look like in the coming election year. Typically, the people most likely to vote are older, better educated, more affluent, and more trusting of institutions than the American adult population as a whole. Yet Trump powerfully appealed to Americans who were less educated, less affluent, and more alienated from institutions—people, in other words, who might not show up in a polling sample recruited by traditional methods but who showed up at the polls when Trump headed the ticket.

Pollsters received an early warning that their methods were under-measuring the disaffected. In June 2016, most polls predicted that British voters would elect to remain in the European Union. Of seven major surveys, only one—which gathered responses online, a conventionally frowned-upon method—accurately predicted that a British majority would vote to leave the EU.

Pollsters readjusted their methods and weightings. Yet they never quite caught up. In 2024, the consensus forecast again underestimated Trump. The core of the polling problem seems to be the changing public itself: How does a company measure public opinion when a big segment of public opinion resists being measured—and when that segment is not randomly distributed, but concentrates behind certain kinds of politicians (such as Trump) or certain kinds of political movements (such as Brexit)? When Gallup’s methods show Trump six points lower than the polling consensus, does that reveal something about Trump? Or does it reveal that methods that worked well in a cohesive, pro-social, pro-institutional country are mismeasuring a polarized country that contains a large anti-social, anti-institutional minority waiting to be mobilized by the right leader?

The Gallup poll once seemed to be nothing less than the voice of the people. The Gallup poll now departs for the same Valhalla as the big three broadcast networks, bowling leagues, and roast beef for Sunday dinner—institutions that were once almost universally accepted but did not survive in a more divided and mutually suspicious America.</div>

The Books We Read Too Late—And That You Should Read Now

One of the great, bittersweet pleasures of life is finishing a title and thinking about how it might have affected you—if only you’d found it sooner.

I recently asked readers to share a photo of something that sparks their sense of awe in the world. William P. shared this photo of “the rock” at Morro Bay, California, “with evening light illuminating the ice plants covering the sand dunes.”

            <h2>The Most American Form of Theater</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/02/kramer-fauci-theater-review-buckley-vidal-debate/686080/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you have ever felt that the American political landscape resembles some kind of nightmarish circus, you may find catharsis in the new play Kramer/Fauci, in which the writer and AIDS activist Larry Kramer faces off with a C-SPAN caller wearing a yellow inflatable chicken suit.

It’s a grand touch of surrealism in a play that makes theater out of one of the most quotidian sources imaginable: an hour of C-SPAN footage from 1993. The script is drawn word for word and um for um from that broadcast, in which Kramer and Dr. Anthony Fauci, then one of the country’s leading AIDS researchers, debated the impediments to finding effective treatments for what Kramer furiously deemed a “plague.”

The chicken suit is not a feature of the original broadcast. Neither is the machine that, partway through the play, noisily turns the stage into a great berg of foam, which slowly subsumes a resigned Kramer. In a work that is otherwise remarkably true to fact, those two audacious intrusions ask the audience to contrast the earnest engagement between Kramer and Fauci with the cheap carnival rules to which some viewers in this cynical age may expect them to adhere. This is America in 2026: Debate is supposed to be a gaudy, brash show, a game of big winners and big losers. What are these two dorks doing—respecting each other?

From the earliest days of this nation’s founding, debate has made for a distinctly American type of theater, an art that shapes both civic life and public entertainment. It’s a form that marks the intersection of two profound national interests: showmanship and democracy. The great 1858 debates between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas as they squared off for an Illinois Senate seat—drawing crowds as large as 10,000 as they did—remain a model for high-school orators today because they are an education in performance as much as statecraft.

Playwrights have long been drawn to that tradition. Inherit the Wind, a play that is widely read in the American school system, sets up a courtroom debate between two legal titans as its centerpiece. Hamilton reframed verbal clashes among the Founding Fathers as rap battles. But in recent years, as American political debates have turned ever more into exhibits of vicious, mudslinging opposition rather than genuine ideological engagement, theater makers have gradually started to ask more pointed questions about the mixed legacy of this patriotic form. How did the kind of public contest that helped shape this country, they have seemed to wonder, go quite so awry?

Hence Kramer/Fauci, the latest installment in the director Daniel Fish’s ongoing effort to find a new layer of meaning in great American texts. His 2019 Broadway revival of Oklahoma turned a show beloved as a celebration of the bright, enterprising nature of the American spirit into a menacing exhumation of the nation’s instinct toward self-mythologizing intolerance. The 1993 C-SPAN exchange between Kramer and Fauci is, perhaps, not quite so well known as Oklahoma. But it is a great American text all the same: an example of the kind of productive, open-minded disagreement responsible for much of what has made this country remarkable.

Kramer and Fauci weren’t on opposite sides of an issue, precisely: During the debate, they agreed that AIDS was a disaster that needed to be a top governmental priority. But Kramer was outside the government, with friends dying, blisteringly aware of the ways in which the official instinct toward bureaucracy was dragging out a scientific process that needed to be moving at, to quote a more modern enterprise, warp speed. Fauci was inside the beast. They spoke different languages—Kramer, that of outrage and urgency; Fauci, that of cautious, measured progress. And so they clashed.

Read: Larry Kramer knew that an honest debate was a rude one

That difference could make it sound like they despised each other—or, more accurately, like Kramer despised Fauci, whose rhetorical comfort zone has always been diplomacy. Not so. The duo’s relationship had started out contentious, with Kramer lambasting Fauci in the press as a “murderer” and “incompetent idiot.” By the time of the C-SPAN broadcast, the two men had known each other for years and developed a deep mutual respect and affection. “I think I probably have a more complicated relationship with Tony than with anybody in my entire life,” Kramer says, late in the play. “He is a man, an ordinary man who was asked to play God and he is being punished because he cannot be God. And that is a terrible situation to be in to be the lightning rod for all of us.”

There’s an emotional dissonance to watching Thomas Jay Ryan, as Kramer, deliver that message. He’s speaking from a place of absolute desperation: He’s furious that Fauci isn’t being given infinite resources for his fight, and furious that Fauci won’t get furious alongside him. But the effect of his words, for a contemporary audience member, is something like real hopefulness. It’s refreshing to remember that people at political odds can actually talk about one another like that: with a degree of understanding and compassion that emphasized, rather than detracted from, the moral urgency they felt.

Alas, exchanges like Kramer and Fauci’s were airing on staid C-SPAN, while network TV had already pivoted toward a flashier mode, in which open conflict became a sure formula for success. James Graham’s 2021 play Best of Enemies, viewable online through the United Kingdom’s National Theatre at Home, examines that transition through a series of 1968 debates, televised on ABC, between two writers: the conservative William F. Buckley Jr. and the liberal Gore Vidal. (Buckley is a popular subject: His 1965 Cambridge debate with James Baldwin—about the subject of race in America—has also been revived on stage in recent years.) The thesis of Best of Enemies is aptly distilled by one wry observation about the ABC debates’ dramatic success with viewers: “People like blood sports.”

Read: The famed Baldwin-Buckley debate still matters today

The blood-sport mode of debate stands in loud contrast to that of Lincoln-Douglas, and also that of Kramer/Fauci. It is about winning by whatever means necessary. The idea that audiences should leave the debate with a clearer sense of what the best future for the country might be, and how to get there, is nowhere to be found. When Buckley resorts to shouting, “Now listen, you queer, stop calling me a crypto-Nazi,” he’s embodying the most effective form of the approach he and Vidal were in the process of popularizing. He’s also helping establish a template for the kind of poisonous interchange that has since become so dominant in American discourse. If social media had been around in the ’60s, it’s easy to imagine “you queer” going viral in much the same way as did Donald Trump’s assertion that Hillary Clinton was a “nasty woman” in a 2016 presidential debate.

That, I think, is really Graham’s point, and, in a more indirect way, part of Fish’s. In a moment when success is measured in eyeballs reached, the motivations that first inspired the prominent role of debate in American society have been inverted. Lincoln and Douglas needed to educate first, and entertain second: To win a seat, one of them had to prove he had good ideas, and also that he was better at delivering them than the other. Today entertainment has become the foremost order. “Thank you very much for the discussion,” a moderator in Best of Enemies observes after a particularly riveting blowup between the rivals: “There was a little more heat, and a little less light, than usual.”

But there’s a fresh element to Fish’s approach. Kramer/Fauci doesn’t just hold up a mirror to this specific symptom of societal decline. It also poses a bold thesis: We were wrong the whole time. A great, impassioned, thoughtful conversation can make for entertainment as gripping as Buckley and Vidal’s rage matches. The kind of quiet friction that slowly moves the nation forward can be as compelling to watch as the toxic clashes that have driven it back.

Thus, the yellow chicken. It’s a reminder that we are all in the circus; it is useless to pretend otherwise. But we can choose how much attention to devote to it. Kramer reacts to its surprise appearance with complete disinterest; he is too focused to be distracted by a cheap trick. The challenge to the audience is to do the same: to look away from the alluring absurdity because, in the end, it doesn’t mean anything. Kramer and Fauci—their honorable disagreements, their curiosity about each other’s worldview, their good-faith debate—were the real show, all along.</div>

            <h2>Pressure Is Not Just in Your Head</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/02/pressure-olympics-malinin-shiffrin/686097/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Those of us who watch the Olympics as bystanders tend to smugly judge athletes for succumbing to pressure without understanding what we even mean by the term. The first thing to know about pressure is that it has actual physical properties. Feeling it is not a sign of a too-thin veneer of character. Pressure might as well be a snakebite, given its very real qualities in the bloodstream and how it can paralyze even the strongest legs. The way to deal with pressure, and become an Olympic great, is to beat it down with a long-handled pole, like the American skier Mikaela Shiffrin did.

You think that you have total command of yourself, sitting there safely at your desk. But have you ever noticed that typing can seem harder on a tight deadline? That’s because it is harder. As physiology studies show, stress and anxiety cause increased muscle tension and redirection of blood flow away from your extremities—and with less blood in your fingers, you lose fine motor control. Now, imagine what happens to the nervous system of an Olympic skater or skier trying to land on the edge of a blade or stay upright on two thin planks, with one chance every four years to win gold medals, in front of more than 25 million sets of appraising eyes.

In 1921, the German physiologist Otto Loewi performed an unnerving experiment that would win him and a colleague the Nobel Prize for Medicine: He removed the heart from a live frog; placed it, still beating, into a beaker containing a nutrient solution to keep it alive; and poured juices extracted from another frog’s vagus nerve onto it. The heartbeat slowed, proving that the heart rate is chemically governed. The chemical in question was later found to be acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter also present in humans, which regulates our heart rate, muscle contractions, digestion, and attention. Disrupt it with, say, a cobra’s strike, and your diaphragm will stop working properly, as will your breath.

Something like that is what can happen to Olympic athletes on the ice or at the starting gate.

As the Milan Cortina Games draw to their close, the American figure-skating world champion Ilia Malinin is designing a new program, to the NF song “Fear.” He plans to perform it at the Olympic skating exhibition gala today, simply to prove that he can. The 21-year-old is still wrestling with why, at his first Olympics, he suddenly became so jelly-legged that he fell twice and scored about 60 points below his usual marks in the men’s free skate, placing eighth. “It’s a lot to handle,” he told a reporter after the event. “The pressure of the Olympics is—it’s really something different, and not a lot of people will understand that.” Malinin said that he was confident right up until he took to the ice for the free skate, when he was hit by a sudden sense of dread that was “overwhelming.” He was hardly the only favorite to get frost on his pants—five of the event’s final six skaters also fell. At the 2018 Games, in Pyeongchang, Nathan Chen was similarly undefeated going into his first Olympics, but he skidded all over the ice in a botched short program and finished fifth. In fact, just one American male skater has ever won a gold medal in his debut: Dick Button, in 1948.

At the opposite age-and-experience end of the Milan Games is the 30-year-old Shiffrin, an indisputable great with a record 108 Alpine-skiing World Cup victories and an aqueous style that makes snow seem like velvet. But she had not won an Olympic gold medal in eight years, continually struggling for composure. In the 2022 Winter Games, in Beijing, she went zero for six in races, crashing in three. At the starting gate of Wednesday’s slalom, her final race at these Games, she felt such a pounding in her chest, she later wrote in a social-media post, that “my heartbeat nearly fell out of my butt.”

But Shiffrin demonstrated that it is possible for someone to remake themselves as an Olympic-level-pressure performer. She alternately glided and smashed through the slalom gates, at times seeming to punch them with her fists, to triumph by 1.50 seconds, the largest margin of victory in any Winter Games’ Alpine event since 1998. “I questioned all that I’ve learned in life, multiple times this week,” she wrote. “I questioned what kind of grit I have in my heart and I wondered if I should be doing this at all. I questioned my toughness and tenacity. I questioned it all. And then I left those questions behind, and stepped into the arena anyway.”

The 20-year-old American skater Alysa Liu also demonstrated that such pressure can be overcome. She quit figure skating at 16, weary of the continual strain, only to come back determined to do it in her own blithe, pleasure-seeking way; she was the most carefree performer of the entire Milan Cortina Games. “No stress,” she told reporters before she competed. She was rewarded with a gold, the first for an American woman figure skater in almost 25 years, after a rapturous free skate.

A performer overruled by anxiety can learn to overrule it in turn. All of us could profit from examining that more closely. When the body is under stress, it will “take imperious control of human actions,” Walter Bradford Cannon, the chair of physiology at Harvard Medical School from 1906 to 1942, observed. Cannon, the man who coined the phrase fight or flight, measured various ways in which the nervous system will reroute to cope with an emergency. For instance, he found that blood is siphoned from the internal organs to large muscle groups when the brain determines that digesting is secondary in importance to rapid action. Cannon’s work, and Loewi’s, laid a foundation for modern neuroscience. In 1997, the neuroscientist Candace B. Pert drew a much finer picture of what goes on inside us in her book Molecules of Emotion: The Science Behind Mind-Body Medicine. Pert described how neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine act as a mail system throughout a body and govern its actions.

The neurotransmitters issue physiological calls and responses, which turn into an athlete’s physical execution under pressure. Dopamine receptors moderate muscle contractions to create refined rhythmic movement. Pyramidal tract neurons turn the brain’s intentions into a body’s calibrated motions, such as a skater’s jumps and spins. Serotonin enhances the synaptic responsiveness that allows a skier to perceive, change direction, and carve a quick turn around a gate. Enzymes convert cholesterol into cortisol, which is discharged from the outer layer of the adrenal glands, to sharpen alertness. All of this combines to give the body the dexterity, agility, and exactitude that constitutes high performance in the right moment. A 2024 academic review in the journal Physiology & Behavior states it this way: Fine motor skills are an “intricate integration of sensory inputs with motor outputs, particularly in dynamic and unpredictable environments.” But when this neurochemical integration is disturbed, tilted, or disrupted, it increases “the likelihood of operational errors in high-stakes scenarios.”

Hands and feet grow colder, slower, less alive. Proprioception, a sense of position and spatial orientation, is lost—Malinin talked of hardly knowing where he was in his program during the free skate. Proprioception loss is one reason a great tennis player may throw up a bad toss and double-fault on a big point, or a golfer might miss a three-foot putt, or a champion figure skater such as the United States’ Amber Glenn, on the verge of medal contention, will abort a triple loop that should be routine, because she suddenly doesn’t trust where her feet are. Perhaps the most damaging of all effects of stress to an athlete is “the corruption of ‘muscle sense,’” Kevin Bickart, a UCLA neuroscientist who specializes in sports neurology, told me. “The athlete literally feels different to themselves—stiff, jerky, or ‘heavy’—because the internal data stream regarding limb position is chemically distorted.”

The good news is that there are antidotes. Some well-established ways to relieve pressure on the nervous system include getting proper rest, using breathing techniques, and “reframing” negative thoughts. These aren’t just vague wellness notions. Deep breathing or breath holds such as the Wim Hof Method can signal the brain stem to activate a parasympathetic “brake,” Bickart said. This allows an athlete like Shiffrin to override the fight-or-flight response. Athletes can also simulate stress and train their body to deal with it. The big-wave surfer Laird Hamilton, for example, uses ice-bath plunges to rehearse suppressing panic and practice self-calming. Bickart told me that this works because it strengthens neural connectivity, building stronger brakes for the mental alarm system and “raising the threshold for what triggers a meltdown during competition.”

Malinin seemed genuinely unprepared for his stress responses, how the sudden onset of nerves would throw off the delicate chemical balance that underpins performance. Instead, he appeared to have compromised himself with not enough sleep, too many obligations, and way too much internet. He was a nonstop traditional- and social-media presence and seemed to have consumed as much of it as he put out, allowing it to bother him. He wrote in an Instagram post this week about “vile online hatred” that “attacks the mind.” Even before his catastrophic free skate, he reposted on his TikTok account a meme that said, “Your little boy is tired mom.” He got on the ice looking pale. The great skating coach Rafael Arutyunyan, a consultant to Malinin, told RT in a brief interview, “We, the adults, are to blame for failing to protect a young man from making the wrong moves.”

Meanwhile, Shiffrin made all the right ones. After her 2022 Beijing experience, she took the vital step of learning more about her own involuntary reactions. “I didn’t understand why these things were happening or what the chemical effects in the brain were,” Shiffrin told Olympics.com in October. Twelve years ago, she became the youngest Olympic slalom champion at 18, only to encounter crippling performance anxiety in the face of increased expectations. At times, she would get nauseated before races. At others, she would get a feeling that she was “destined to fail.” Lingering grief over the 2020 death of her father and post-traumatic stress from a 2024 crash compounded her issues. In the past four years, she has worked with a psychologist to learn how to manage intrusive thoughts through meditation and breathing exercises.

A body can turn into an engine rather than a panic alarm, Bickart said, when an athlete reframes a threat as a challenge. This can release a chemical that inhibits anxiety. When that happens, an athlete can achieve what is known as a “clutch” performance. Shiffrin’s slalom victory was hardly effortless or uncomplicated, but she managed herself perfectly. After the combined event and the giant slalom, when she failed to medal, she knew that the topic of Olympic choking would be renewed all over social media. She refused to read any stories or look at anything about herself on social media. “I have built this up in my own mind,” Shiffrin told reporters after the race. “I’ve dreamed about it. I have been nervous for it. I’ve felt pressure. I have also felt like, ‘Who cares?’” She had a long, agonizing wait between her first and second slalom runs. NBC cameras caught her stretching, breathing, meditating, and then trying to take a nap in the snow. She didn’t sleep, but she didn’t sink into a fatal cave of anxiety either.

She said of that restful interlude, at her press conference after the medal ceremony, “I was thinking about the fact that I actually can show up today and honestly say in the start gate that I have all the tools that are necessary to do my best skiing, and to earn that moment.”

As these Olympics end, look again at the athletes. This time, see their spangled unitards and bodysuits for what they are: mere envelopes containing massive chemical reactions and a hard-fought, organized elegance. As Shiffrin proved, if biochemistry can be the enemy of high performance under pressure, it can also vault an athlete into that imaginative emotional state called greatness.</div>

My jaded self doesn&#39;t believe this is altruistic in the slightest

According to the press release, volunteers will be placed in Peace Corps countries that are part of the American AI Exports Program, which was created last year from an executive order from President Trump as a way to bolster the US&#39; grip on the AI market abroad.

Just the 1st step to wrecking another good thing. Sounds like marketing and sales for US mega corps. In a few years they will get commissions for sales; under another term probably.

Helping prepare the Third World for Chinese AI.

Right they took away life saving medicine, birth control, educational materials and food. but they&#39;re replacing it with some handy tools really useful for government oppression.

The U.S. under this administration can send foreign countries AI but not AID like food and medicine - check.

Why not call it the AI Corps, or even the Fraud Corps? If you call it the latter maybe you can include cryptocurrencies in their mission?

It&#39;s almost like Code.org is and always was just a shill for industry messaging.

I worked in K-12 education for a long time. And one of the things that genuinely shocked me is how much curriculum is in fact just sponsored by giant corporations.

Seriously, virtually any time you see someone advocating in K-12 education for something like &quot;skills students will need for jobs&quot; just look, and you don&#39;t have to look very hard, at who&#39;s funding it. It&#39;s disappointing every time.

I worked in K-12 education for a long time. And one of the things that genuinely shocked me is how much curriculum is in fact just sponsored by giant corporations.The especially concerning/scary thing this time is that what the giant corporations want is to make computing seem like &quot;magic.&quot; Make a wish into the wishing well that is AI, and what you will receive will be what you wished for ... provided, of course, you keep paying the corporation for the privilege of having your wishes granted.Never mind having the actual skill, talent, understanding, etc. to make your wishes come true yourself. Just pay, wish, and it will be yours ... and never mind anyone who tells you it used to be possible to get what you want to achieve without paying a giant corporation. Just keep wishing, lean how to wish big, and your wishes will come true.This seems like the antithesis of how anyone who considers themselves an educator should think.And the really sad part is they&#39;re not just saying this to CS students. They&#39;re saying it to writers and journalists, artists, musicians ... basically anyone whose job doesn&#39;t involve a hammer, a shovel, or a stove.

CS is not affected at all. IT little affected, at best. Coding may be affected a bit more, but not nearly as much as generally claimed. The only coders that will see their jobs vanish are the crappy ones. But crappy code is all &quot;AI&quot; can do at this time and for the foreseeable future.

Hopefully, this will make all the &quot;everyone needs to learn to code&quot; bullshit go away. Sure, it&#39;ll be replaced with AI but when the AI bubble pops then we&#39;ll be right back where we started.

Year of Wayland on Linux is any minute now. Thus it&#39;s never too early to throw away the &quot;old junk&quot;(tm), that works and is used daily by millions, that is inevitably going to be replaced by... jam tomorrow.

What&#39;s going to happen first: Wayland or AGI?

AGI. Because we&#39;ll need that to answer the question: Why Wayland?

I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll figure it out when more and more things stop supporting Xorg. As much as Slashdotters want to, it&#39;s not something that can be ignored.

Already fixed with Wayback. Native Wayland apps can have a compositor stub that just connects them to the X11 system.

Because an alarmingly high number of developers believe that, if code isn&#39;t being changed, it&#39;s dead. And dead code is &quot;VuLNeRaBle&quot;.

Have you ever tried anything in Python or JS? Breaking changes are the norm. And if the app broke, it&#39;s YOUR FAULT for not reading the changelog, not their fault for changing the API for no good reason (so many changes in JS for &quot;consistency&quot;, like, someone developed something and spelled it &quot;colour&quot; and 3 versions later some dev is incredibly irritated that the rest of the spelling of the app is in american english, so they &quot;fix&quot; it for consistency. Yes, they broke thousands of apps out there that had been running for years, but, isn&#39;t it nice how the code is now all consistent?

And don&#39;t let me get started on shit like React Router, which, last time i checked was in V6 and every version was a full rewrite, completely incompatible with the previous version - because of conceptually different behavior. Imagine doing this SIX TIMES in less than a decade.

Ouch, I can definitely see wanting to fix the color/colour thing for consistency.  Reminds me of a game on steam with ONE broken achievement.  Digging into it, the developer misspelled the achievement originally - then on the LAST update, fixed the spelling in the code, but not in the hook.  one character edited in binary and the achievement popped.But I&#39;d think that an alias would work - allow people expecting color to spell it that way, but not break already developed apps that used the old colour.

The beauty of AI-generated code is that you can now generate bespoke code with zero dependencies. And if your requirements change, the AI can just rewrite it again. Libraries have always been an abstraction to allow busy programmers to make changes with minimal rewrites, enabling them to &quot;stand on the shoulders of giants&quot; as it were... but those giants have all been subsumed by an LLM that can just spit out a function that does one thing and one thing only. So maybe, hopefully, the sort of dependency hell y

You&#39;re missing the bit about libraries being safer than coding your own version in certain cases. LLMs make this worse, not better.

Modern antibiotics are antibiotic molecules discovered in fungi and other organisms to fight bacteria that may be invading their food source. If this bacteria is resistant to 10 of them one possible way it attained that is it may have faced high selection pressure and been in a place where there was abundant rot. For example, the strain of fungus used to supply the world with penicillin was discovered on a cantaloupe in Illinois by a mold collector nicknamed &quot;Moldy Mary&quot; back in the 1940s. That market must have been gross because the fungus was producing an insane amount of penicillin, presumably required to stay alive.

Here&#39;s a reference regarding the Cantaloupe: https://scientificdiscoveries.... [usda.gov]

The biggest irony is that the USDA lab based in Peoria had been searching all over the world for a highly productive strain, but ultimately it was found right there in Peoria. Kind of reminds me of the Wuhan Virology lab and the COVID outbreak seemingly emerging in Wuhan.

I remember cases of them digging out old bacteria samples from things like old wells, a couple centuries old, not 13k, but still resistant to a raft of modern antibiotics, more than many modern strains.The easiest explanation is that we got most of our antibiotics by examining molds and such, and it isn&#39;t like mold and bacteria haven&#39;t been fighting for millennia already.  The bacteria probably just encountered something similar enough to the modern synthetic antibiotics and had to adapt.

So, you&#39;ve been frozen for millennia, finally some being comes and thaws you, and brings you back to life only to try and kill you with antibiotics. Hell yeah, I stand with the ancient bacteria!!

It was a bad week for the Make America Healthy Again movement.

On Wednesday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order promoting the production of glyphosate, the chemical that powers the weed killer Roundup and a longtime target of the MAGA faithful. Glyphosate has also long been one of the main targets of the MAHA movement, which considers it a dangerous carcinogen poisoning the country. (Experts say that the pesticide’s danger to the public is minimal, but the scientific community is not in agreement about its health effects.)

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. himself took on Monsanto, Roundup’s manufacturer, in a successful 2018 case accusing the company of knowing that the chemical caused cancer. In 2024 he called glyphosate “one of the likely culprits in America’s chronic disease epidemic” and promised to ban it.

So what did the head of the Trump administration’s health department have to say about it now? “Donald Trump’s executive order puts America first where it matters most—our defense readiness and our food supply,” Kennedy said in a statement. “We must safeguard America’s national security first, because all of our priorities depend on it.”

It was a near echo of what Trump himself said when he declared glyphosate necessary to keeping the food supply chain steady and therefore “crucial to military readiness and national defense.” The president’s executive order, invoking a 1950s law meant for national security emergencies, creates the legal basis for glyphosate producers to be shielded from lawsuits and authorizes the Department of Agriculture to compel those companies to produce the pesticide.

To critics, Kennedy’s endorsement seemed like a confounding betrayal. He and the other most high-placed members of his coalition—the doctors who sit on panels and guide policy—stayed quiet as the MAHA moms were dealt a serious defeat.

It was a shock to the movement’s system. Alex Clark, a MAHA podcast host with Turning Point USA, wrote on social media that she started receiving messages from women abandoning the Republican Party over the glyphosate news. “Have we ever lost the midterms this early or is this a new record?” she wrote.

Vani Hari, a MAHA influencer with 2.3 million followers on Instagram, also expressed disbelief when the news broke. She said on social media that the government had given Bayer, which owns Monsanto, “a license to kill.” Trump had blessed “the mass poisoning of Americans.”

This is not what MAHA movement members had in mind when Kennedy snagged an influential post in Trump’s Cabinet. But the episode reveals not only a limit to Kennedy’s influence but also a political weakness in the very makeup of the MAHA movement that’s likely to emerge again and again.

We don’t know what happened inside the administration or how heavily Kennedy pushed back against the pro-chemical decision behind the scenes, but we know what the outcome was: Trump landed on a decision that large agricultural companies are going to love. And for MAHA, that’s a problem. This is unlikely to be the last time the president has to pick between MAHA and Big Agriculture, and it looks as if the latter faction clearly has the juice to get its way.

It’s not entirely surprising. Before the 2024 election, Trump courted Kennedy in an effort to win over crunchy Democrats and independents who can be swayed by the single issue of “health.” But Trump never put his heart into it. He said the MAHA buzzwords but never made “chronic diseases,” for example, a pet issue the way he cared about immigration or limiting rights for transgender people. And while Trump has given Kennedy lots of leeway in his campaign against vaccines, the health secretary’s influence on food policy seems far more limited.

There’s not much Kennedy can do about it. Trump isn’t slated to face voters again. And for Kennedy personally, quitting over glyphosate would mean forfeiting leverage over vaccine policy.

But in addition to exposing Kennedy’s limits, Trump’s pro-Roundup order—and MAHA’s reaction to it—revealed a brittleness to the movement as a whole.

“I personally don’t view it as a clear movement,” said Pamela Herd, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy. “It’s a fragile political alliance.”

As Herd sees things, the leadership of the movement—the administration-friendly personalities and the most-high-profile influencers and media figures—cares most about propping up the supplement and wellness industry, as many of these individuals have their own financial interests in nontraditional health products. (“It’s not as much an ideology as it is an industry,” she said of MAHA leadership.) But the rank and file, the “MAHA moms,” can be divided into two broad categories, which we’ll call the individualists and the structuralists.

The structuralists want everyone to be healthier, as much as possible. They want clean water, chemical-free produce, and an elimination of anything that could be described as a “toxin.” They’re the MAHA hardcore, the women who see America’s chronic health struggles as the greatest issue facing the country.

The individualists, on the other hand, are decidedly more libertarian. They want to be able to send their kids to schools without vaccinations, to drink unregulated raw milk, and to be free to treat their illnesses with Ivermectin.

These two groups overlap heavily, but individualists and their focus on “freedom” pull most heavily from the conservative population that already supported Trump. This cohort, which was radicalized to care about these issues by the COVID public health measures, thinks about health in terms of what they can control, at a personal level. The difference in philosophy between these two cohorts is most apparent when it comes to pollution—something that’s entirely out of individual control, and therefore of little interest to the individualists. And because the individualists are the ones most synonymous with the MAGA base, their voice has more weight.

“The relevant question is who has the power,” Herd said. “And I think those with the most power and influence are in the individualist frame.”

Still, the question remains what this move will mean for those who care more about the structural issues and who may be Kennedy supporters before they’re Trump fans—or from people who have been steeped in the MAHA world long enough to have developed genuine fear of the pesticide. Conservative commentators such as Megyn Kelly have pointed to Kennedy’s past promises to vent their frustrations. And on Friday, Representative Thomas Massie, a Republican, announced his plan to introduce a bill to undo Wednesday’s order.

“I do think there’s some growing discomfort and questioning of what’s going on,” Herd said. “I think it’s possible this is sort of a tipping point.”

Recently, Kennedy has pivoted politically toward emphasizing healthy eating rather than interfering in vaccines. With his new dietary guidelines, statements blasting ultraprocessed foods, and celebrity-studded videos promoting working out (while wearing jeans), Kennedy is making his movement inoffensive and, to Trump, low-profile. Kennedy has proved he’s not a liability to the administration.

What he hasn’t proved, at least to his supporters, is that he’s any better than the champions who preceded him when it comes to facing the commercial interests behind the “toxins” he claims to hate.

On Friday, the Environmental Protection Agency adjusted its limits to pollution from coal-burning power plants, allowing them to release more mercury into the air. Just as Trump wanted the glyphosate for the farmers, his EPA wants to boost the coal industry by allowing more pollutants into the atmosphere, without concern for climate change or for the way mercury collects in streams and other waterways, eventually endangering people who consume seafood. Restricting mercury pollution was another key issue for Kennedy, something he personally championed in the past. The EPA’s announcement was yet another slap in the face to the MAHA movement.

But on Friday, after the news came out, Kennedy said nothing.

Since the fall of abortion rights, no abortion provider has been convicted of violating a state ban. Proceedings underway in Texas might soon change that. Last March, Ken Paxton, Texas’ Republican attorney general, filed civil and criminal charges against a Houston midwife, accusing her of performing illegal abortions and practicing medicine without a license. Texas law permits penalties of up to life in prison for performing abortions. The midwife, Maria Margarita Rojas, has responded that the state just can’t prove their case. That’s the argument she made to a Texas court this week as she appealed an order that forced the closure of three clinics where she worked while the litigation continues. This appeal concerns the civil case against Rojas. The criminal case against her is also ongoing, but the questions of inadequate proof that were front and center in Rojas’ civil appeal will play a significant role there too.

Even if an appeals court rules in her favor, Rojas likely won’t be able to reopen the three clinics because of the conditions of her bond, which prevent from her being within a certain distance of the facilities, and because of the suspension of her midwifery license. It’s also possible that the three judges on Texas’ 15th Court of Appeals won’t say that much about the caliber of the state’s evidence, instead focusing its on procedural technicalities or constitutional questions. But the hearing was a first look at whether Texas can prove its case against Rojas. And so far, the state’s case looks far from a slam dunk.

The most obvious obstacles to successful abortion prosecutions are political. Polling has shown consistent support for abortion rights, and even more so since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Republicans have mostly worked to draw attention away from an issue that can hurt them at the polls. The Trump administration has played for time, supposedly launching a new study on the safety of the abortion pill mifepristone and seeking delays in court. All of this, Trump officials say, could take years, and certainly will take until after the midterms. A high-profile conviction could bring attention to the issue that some Republicans don’t want, especially if a defendant can tell a sympathetic story about the care they provide.

But the Rojas case is reminder that it just isn’t that easy to prove an abortion has occurred. That has been true throughout the history of abortion criminalization in the United States.

In the 19th century, as state criminal bans on abortion spread across the country, prosecutors struggled to find enough evidence for a conviction. It wasn’t always straightforward to distinguish an abortion from a miscarriage, or even to prove that a patient had been pregnant (some states didn’t even require proof of it). Even if there was evidence of an intentional abortion, juries couldn’t always tell if that procedure was meant to preserve a patient’s life.

A conviction was easier if a patient died. Then, prosecutors could rely on autopsy evidence, or even a woman’s dying words. But in a meaningful number of cases, defendants seem to have walked because there just wasn’t enough evidence of what had happened.

The obstacles to conviction aren’t any less daunting today. Consider what’s happening in Rojas’ case. It’s been hard for prosecutors to know when abortions might be occurring in the first place, especially given the availability of telehealth procedures. This case came to the attention of the Texas attorney general because of an anonymous tip. Rojas might have been an attractive target because she is a midwife. Historically, midwives had a harder time in abortion prosecutions than did licensed physicians, and Paxton might be hoping that the same is true today.  But one of the charges she faces—that she was practicing medicine without a license—is complicated by Rojas’s own version of events, which centers on the claim that she worked with advanced practice nurse practitioners to provide telehealth services and was a licensed midwife herself.

And it won’t be easy for the state to prove that Rojas offered abortions. The state is relying on a witness who claimed that she was prescribed a low-dose of misoprostol, a drug commonly used as part of the two-pill protocol used in a majority of abortions nationwide. Investigators also recovered misoprostol when they raided Rojas’s place of business.

But simply possessing or dispensing misoprostol can’t tell prosecutors all that much. The drug is widely used to prevent ulcers caused by taking NSAIDs like ibuprofen, manage early pregnancy loss, induce labor, or address hemorrhage after childbirth.  Rojas operated a birthing center. Her attorneys stress that prosecutors can’t tell if she was using misoprostol to treat patients who had given birth or experienced miscarriage. And there were no supposedly telltale signs of abortion services present at her clinics either, such as tools used for surgical abortion or even mifepristone, a drug with multiple off-label uses that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration only for the termination of pregnancy.

It’s not clear that this evidence this will be enough to secure a conviction. In the past, prosecutors sometimes struggled with similar cases. Even if a defendant did have a drug used in abortion, prosecutors often needed additional proof, such as evidence that a person had been convicted of offering abortions in the past, or was widely recognized in the community as an abortion provider. The reason was straightforward: These medications were and are used in obstetrics and gynecology for other reasons.

All of these obstacles to a conviction make the stakes of the Rojas trial that much higher. States know they won’t be able to find most people accessing or distributing abortion pills. It’s not clear either that they will be able to pursue physicians mailing pills from states that protect reproductive rights into ban jurisdictions. But prosecutors like Paxton hope that by making an example of someone like Rojas, they can scare others into compliance.

Even charges like the ones Rojas faces can be devastating, whether or not a jury ever convicts. Clinics where she worked have been forced to close and her midwifery license has been suspended. She had to pay a $1.6 million bond and faces years in prison. The risk of similar consequences might be enough to frighten off many providers.

If Rojas is convicted, the impact will be even greater. It might give pause not only to those who might offer abortions but anyone who might use misoprostol to manage miscarriage, hemorrhage, or any other complication. Patients in many Texas counties already lack access to maternity care. Cases like this one are likely to exacerbate the problem.

Prosecutors in places like Texas know they won’t be able to detect the vast majority of abortions. But by making an example of people like Maria Rojas, prosecutors hope that they won’t have to.

Gabfest Reads is a monthly series from the hosts of Slate’s Political Gabfest podcast. Recently, John Dickerson talked with Father James Martin about his new book, Work in Progress: Confessions of a Busboy, Dishwasher, Caddy, Usher, Factory Worker, Bank Teller, Corporate Tool, and Priest. During part of their discussion, they explored how Martin’s early jobs taught him humility and empathy, why his LGBTQ Catholic ministry has drawn intense opposition, and what the Gospels actually say about immigration and welcoming strangers.

This partial transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity.

John Dickerson: So let’s talk about the turn that your life took from being what you say is ‘a corporate tool.’ It’s not going perfectly. And then you come home one night and what happens? Give us the sense of where you were in terms of your job and you were on your way to being rich, the thing that you had started out at age 15 wanting to be.

Father James Martin:… So I worked at General Electric’s Finance and Accounting division in New York City for three years. And then I moved to GE Capital, which was their financial services arm, which was really booming at the time in the mid-’80s. So I moved there in 1985. I took a job in human resources and I thought that would be a little more congenial, but gradually I started to realize I’m in the wrong place. And business is a real vocation for a lot of people. Many of my friends, believe it or not, they worked in GE for their whole lives. A lot of them just retired a couple of years ago, and they contributed to the common good. GE made great things, medical systems and light bulbs and all that kind of stuff, but it wasn’t for me.

And I found myself getting more and more stressed, more and more miserable, and really thinking, what am I doing here? And there were occasions that I witnessed as an HR person of really crass and cruel behavior. Can I share one of them?

John Dickerson: Yeah.Father James Martin: This was a defining moment for me. Very brief, I’ll make a long complicated story shorter. I was in HR, I was 25, 26. I’m a young guy still, but as you know, their HR departments are pretty small. So you have these young people going to these executives saying, “You can do this and not do that,” and whatnot.

So there was a manager who wanted to fire somebody or bounce them as we used to say. And we had just given this guy an incentive award. So in other words, we had just given him, I think, a trip. So he had just gotten this great job performance review. In any event, this guy said, “I don’t care. I’m firing him.” So my manager said, “Go and talk to this manager,” who was way above me, “and tell him, ‘You can’t do that. You can’t fire someone without cause and you just can’t bounce somebody.’”

And he said, “I don’t care.” And I said, “Well, this guy had an incentive award, and…” “I don’t care. I want him out.” I can see him standing. He was taller than I was. And I said, “Well, he has a family for Pete’s sake.” So I said, “Have some compassion.” And he said, “F compassion.” Not ironically. And I remember thinking, “oh my gosh, that someone could say that with a straight face? What am I doing here?” So that got me thinking about leaving.

And then as I say in the book, I came home and turned on the TV and saw a documentary about Thomas Merton, the Trappist monk, and monastic life and the priesthood. It came at the right time. So I always say my life was changed by TV. There you go.

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, a politics newsletter that is just saying—just saying—that the best Winter Olympics event would have been: You start in Milan. First one to Cortina wins. But no one asked us …

Politics news, meanwhile, continued to happen this week. Early voting is underway in Texas, and some primary races are only getting more peculiar. President Donald Trump may bomb Iran again? Also: Aliens are real, and the Labor Department is in crisis.

Let’s begin with a Supreme Court decision that was uncharacteristically rude and disrespectful to the Trump administration.

The Supreme Court, in a 6–3 opinion authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, struck down most of Trump’s tariffs on Friday, ruling that the law he was invoking could not be used for such a purpose. Trump had been claiming that the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act gave him the emergency power to set tariffs on a whim, without the need for investigative findings or durational limits, for any particular reason that struck his fancy. This view undergirded certain tariffs against Mexico, Canada, and China, his global matrix of “reciprocal tariffs,” and various threats he’s made against, say, European countries that don’t support his attempt to acquire Greenland. It was the stick he waved around the world to achieve his foreign policy aims, to show favor and disfavor, to offer or withhold exemptions to courtiers. Roberts’ simple conclusion that “IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs” is more than a blow to his economic vision. It’s a strike against the sweeping vision of the presidency he’s built.

That’s why Trump is so darn mad about it and, in a seething Friday afternoon press conference during which he said he was “ashamed” of the justices, announced he would use other powers to replicate the fallen tariff regime. Trump does have additional tariff authorities delegated to him by Congress, but they all have certain restraints. Some cap the duration of time they can be implemented, or cap the tariff rate he can set; others require departmental investigations or findings. None may meet that sweet, sweet high offered by the pretend authority he thought he had in IEEPA.

On his broadcast Monday, CBS late-night host Stephen Colbert explained to his audience that he was supposed to air an interview with Texas Democratic Senate candidate James Talarico but had been told by his network’s lawyers, “in no uncertain terms,” that he couldn’t do so. At issue was CBS’s interpretation of recent guidance from Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr stating that the FCC would reconsider an exemption of the “equal time” rule enjoyed by late-night and daytime talk shows. CBS, meanwhile, said in a statement that its lawyers didn’t prohibit Colbert from airing the interview; they only advised the show that it could trigger an FCC complaint and “presented options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled.” So Colbert instead posted the interview to YouTube, where there are no such “equal time” regulations. As of this writing, the interview is nearing 8 million views.

There are a lot of moving parts here, but after doing some calculations (Surge Math), this nets out to a meaningful contribution from CBS management to the Democratic Party’s hopes of retaking Senate control. CBS got the willies over Carr’s guidance (and his apparently real investigation of The View). Talarico, running in a close primary against Rep. Jasmine Crockett, successfully parlayed that into a narrative about how the administration had “censored” him, because it “doesn’t want you to hear what James Talarico has to say.” The ensuing uproar allowed him to raise millions of dollars overnight, giving him a boost against Crockett as early voting begins. It’s no secret that the GOP would prefer to run against the more partisan, polarizing Crockett instead of Talarico, and CBS’s actions made that at least somewhat less likely.

Among the more competitive House primaries in Texas is a rematch between GOP Rep. Tony Gonzales and Brandon Herrera, aka “the AK Guy.” In their 2024 contest, Gonzales—guilty of occasional anti-MAGA heresies—held off only Herrera, a challenger from Gonzales’ right, by 400 votes in the primary runoff. The two are back at it again in a district that spans a broad swath of West Texas along the southern border.

Just as early voting began this week, though, a tragic story involving a former Gonzales staffer from last year has come back to the fore. A district-level aide for Gonzales, Regina Santos-Aviles, died by self-immolation at her home in September. Shortly after the incident last fall, the Daily Mail reported that Gonzales—a married father of six—had been having an affair with her. Gonzales denied it, but the rumor lingered. This week, another former Gonzales staffer released a text message from Santos-Aviles from last year, in which she said she’d had an affair with “our boss.” Then, Santos-Aviles’ husband said in an interview that he’d caught wind of the affair and confronted Gonzales about it, after which Gonzales “black-sheeped” his wife at work, sending her into a downward spiral. Gonzales has had a range of defiant responses, from blaming the Herrera campaign from “using a disgruntled former staffer to smear her memory and score political points” to accusing the husband and his lawyers of blackmail. And with that, we’re going to throw our hands in the air and proceed to a new entry.

Administrations used to have the decency to lie to the American people before leading them into a fresh war. A case had to be built. Now we just get wind that wars might happen a couple of days before they start. Although there have been reports for weeks that the administration was moving military assets toward the Middle East, it set in only this week that Trump was gathering the largest fleet of warships and air power in the region since 2003 (although still only a fraction of that). We’re just waiting on the USS Gerald R. Ford and its strike group to finish its hustle from the Caribbean to the Middle East for the president to have a full menu of options against Iran available to him.

If Iran and the U.S. don’t reach a deal over Iran’s nuclear program and whatever else is on the table, what does Trump want to do? Again, we really don’t know, and the administration has not offered to explain. It could be limited strikes to take out Iranian military assets left unbombed during last summer’s 12-day attack on the country. Or Trump could go Full Lindsey Graham and try to kill the leaders of the Iranian regime, hoping that whoever replaces it is a more cooperative partner with the United States. It genuinely could come down to the advice of whoever he winds up playing golf with next.

The former president did an interview with podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen this week in which he discussed any number of issues about the world and the political scene today, but the takeaway was: aliens. Cohen asked Barack Obama if aliens were real. “They’re real,” he said, “but I haven’t seen them, and they’re not being kept in, what is it, Area 51. There’s no underground facility. Unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.”

We didn’t know it was still particularly surprising to hear someone say that aliens are “real”—we’ve all seen the photos of Mark Zuckerberg waterskiing—but this set off enough of a news frenzy that Obama was forced to post a clarification. “I was trying to stick with the spirit of the speed round, but since it’s gotten attention let me clarify,” he said. “Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there. But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!” Someone seems nervous, and it’s our assumption that alien colonies do live underwater and that James Cameron’s The Abyss was a documentary. Trump, later in the week, effectively confirmed that aliens are real by saying that Obama had shared “classified information” and, later that night, instructed the government to begin releasing files related to aliens. In short, everything got out of hand quickly and weirdly, but such is life in America 250 years after its founding.

Not all states are pliant to national party pressure to maximize partisan gerrymandering efforts in the midcycle redistricting wars. National Republicans, memorably, put the full weight of congressional and presidential pressure on Indiana legislators to squeeze out another GOP seat or two in the state, only to be rejected in a state Senate vote late last year. Now it’s Democrats facing a similar situation in Maryland. The state’s current delegation is seven Democrats to one Republican, and that one Republican is the very, very safely seated Rep. Andy Harris, chair of the House Freedom Caucus. National Democratic leaders and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore want to create an 8–0 map for Democrats, and such a map has already passed out of the state’s House of Delegates.

The Maryland Senate, however, isn’t acting. As it happens, the Surge reported on the previous time national Democrats pressured Maryland legislators to wipe Harris off the map, five years ago, and the figure of resistance now is the same as then: state Senate President Bill Ferguson. Ferguson’s practical fear is that state courts would reject an 8–0 Democratic map and possibly implement one that’s worse for Democrats than the current 7–1 map. (If you’re a Maryland law sicko and want to read Rep. Jamie Raskin’s lengthy response to this argument, have at it.) So immovable is Ferguson that House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries went to Annapolis this week to meet with him. The visit did not appear to make a difference. “Bill Ferguson authentically believes that the votes don’t exist in the State Senate to move forward,” Jeffries said in a statement afterward. “The only way to find out is to allow an immediate up-or-down vote on the Senate floor.”

We believe that this is the labor secretary’s first appearance in the Surge, and, regrettably, it’s not to commend her on great achievements in the field of labor. Last month, the New York Times reported that a member of her security team with whom she’d been accused of having a “romantic relationship” had been placed on leave during a misconduct investigation. There are also separate complaints, requiring separate aides to be placed on leave, accusing Lori Chavez-DeRemer of other forms of mismanagement.

This week, we learned that problems at the DOL encompass the other half of Chavez-DeRemer’s marriage as well. The secretary’s husband, Shawn DeRemer, has been barred from the department’s headquarters amid complaints from “at least two female staff members” who said that he had sexually assaulted them. (DeRemer denies the allegations.) D.C. police are investigating it. According to the Times, there is video of at least one incident that shows “Dr. DeRemer giving one of the women an extended embrace.” The Surge is skeptical the DeRemers are long for service in Trump’s Washington.

The Supreme Court struck down Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs on Friday, ruling 6–3 that they vastly exceed anything federal law allows a President to do. It was a massive loss for a signature component of Trump’s economic agenda, and a coalition of liberals and conservatives on the court agreed that the statute invoked to impose these tariffs was never intended to be wielded in this fashion. The 6 disagreed emphatically as to the reasoning. The dissenters were Big Mad. On this week’s Amicus, Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern unpack the rationale behind the decision, and the implications for those seeking a remedy. And they ask what to make of this massive loss from a court that has yet to truly tell this President “no.”

Then, the press clause of the First Amendment, a once-cherished constitutional right, has fallen victim to neglect and sabotage in recent years, taking a back seat to the more vaunted love affair with individual “free speech.” But, as recent developments—including the arrest of journalist Don Lemon and the heavy-handed interview-spiking “guidance” of late night host Stephen Colbert—illustrate, the freedom of the press is no slam-dunk when it comes to saving democracy in Trump’s America. Dahlia speaks with First Amendment scholars Sonja West (University of Georgia) and RonNell Andersen Jones (University of Utah) about the health of the press clause and the themes in their book, The Future of Press Freedom: Democracy, Law, and the News in Changing Times. They trace the ways in which the framers viewed press freedom as a core, structural “bulwark of liberty,” and why the Supreme Court has increasingly treated it as a neglected companion to free speech rights; leaving weakened and fragile protections for news gathering. The conversation contrasts Trump’s first-term rhetorical delegitimization of the media with a second-term shift toward tangible actions: access restrictions, funding cuts, agency leverage, and selective regulatory pressure.

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for Executive Dysfunction, a weekly newsletter that surfaces under-the-radar stories about what Trump is doing to the law—and how the law is pushing back.

The Supreme Court’s 6–3 ruling against Donald Trump’s global tariffs prompted the president to berate the justices in the majority at a seething press conference on Friday. Trump declared that he was “absolutely ashamed of certain members of the court for not having the courage to do what’s right for the country.” He condemned these justices as “fools and lapdogs for the RINOs and the radical left Democrats” who are “very unpatriotic and disloyal to our Constitution,” adding that “the court has been swayed by foreign interests.” And he then singled out Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, whom he himself appointed, as “an embarrassment to their families.” (By way of contrast, Trump praised Justice Brett Kavanaugh—who strongly dissented—for “his genius and his great ability,” noting that he was “very proud of that appointment.”)

This furious reaction should come as no surprise: The president has been pressuring the justices to side with him for months, warning that the United States’ economy would be “screwed” without the tariffs and calling the case “one of the most important” in history. But this strong-arming clearly failed. After nearly a year of indulging almost every presidential wish, the Roberts court drew a line. The court’s opinion evinces no concern about political backlash or economic ruin. Instead, the majority reflects a kind of serene intellectual indifference toward the consequences of this ruling, with both Gorsuch and Barrett far more interested in an academic debate over statutory construction than the potential for a presidential tantrum that could further destabilize an embattled judicial branch. And there is no indication that these justices ever wavered in their resolve to strike down Trump’s signature second-term policy.

On this week’s episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed the agreements and fractures among the six-justice majority, and all the ways in which the White House’s pressure campaign clearly fell flat, if it was experienced at all. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: A lot of people seem to think this is an incredibly fractured opinion with so many separate parts and concurrences and dissents. To me, the upshot of Chief Justice John Roberts’ opinion for the court is that this is just an unvarnished loss for Donald Trump. The liberals are not prepared to deploy the major questions doctrine, and the dissenters are big mad, but in the end, Trump just loses 6–3.

Mark Joseph Stern: I understand why it’s confusing. There is so much separate writing by justices on both sides. But the bottom line is that six justices say Trump’s global tariffs exceed his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. They all agree with the bottom line that IEEPA does not give the president power to unilaterally tax foreign goods by allowing him to “regulate” foreign imports in an emergency. There is a split within the majority, though. Chief Justice John Roberts, along with Gorsuch and Barrett, uses the major questions doctrine to bolster their conclusion. This trio says: We have a rule that when the president is claiming a major power of “economic and political significance,” he needs explicit statutory authorization. And IEEPA is not it.

But the liberals have never embraced that rule, which SCOTUS used to block much of President Joe Biden’s agenda. And in her separate concurrence, Justice Elena Kagan—joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson—says she still doesn’t agree with the major questions doctrine. Nor does she think it’s needed to get to the correct result here. But she also says that she agrees with “the bulk of the principal opinion’s reasoning.” So there is a solid six-justice supermajority here. This is not like the first Obamacare case where you had to count heads to find a majority.

There was also none of that weird, very visible horse-trading we saw in the Obamacare opinions—it was clear that justices were crossing their fingers and doing deals under the table. It didn’t feel like there was horse-trading here. There was a legitimate question about the major questions doctrine. The justices in the majority found slightly different ways to say no, but they were still saying no.

To me, that hints at the possibility that the six-justice majority firmed up very quickly after arguments. I think when the justices discussed this case at conference, it was clear that Roberts, Gorsuch, and Barrett were firmly against these tariffs. We speculated, at the time, whether the liberals would have to sign on to the major questions doctrine in order to get to a majority against the tariffs. Would Roberts team up with Gorsuch and Barrett to pressure the liberals into finally endorsing and legitimizing the major questions doctrine? It seems like that didn’t happen here because the three liberals held the line, and there is no indication they ever wavered. They said: We agree with the statutory interpretation, but we are still not on board with major questions.

If there had been the kind of horse-trading that we saw in the Obamacare case, maybe Roberts could have forced those three liberals into the major-questions fold. Instead, they stood in their own camp. That allowed those three to maintain their integrity and broader principles while still reaching the right conclusion.

CNN’s Kristen Holmes reported on Friday that Trump completely blew up in a meeting after learning of the ruling on tariffs. She said “he started ranting about the decision, not only calling it a disgrace, but started attacking the courts and at one point saying ‘these effing courts,’ but using the actual language there.” We’ve known for the last couple of weeks that Donald Trump is not feeling it from some of “his” justices. And this is actually a pretty serious moment to think about Donald Trump making these threats against the courts.

I don’t think Roberts, Gorsuch, or Barrett were at all cowed by Trump’s bullying before, and they won’t be now. He pressured them for months, insisting that he should be able to do what he wants, and that we’ll be a “poor country” if the court strikes down his tariffs. I don’t get the sense that the three conservatives in the majority cared at all. Roberts’ opinion is so crisp and confident—a classic “this is what the law is” ruling. To the extent there’s any wavering or disagreement between Barrett and Gorsuch, it’s an academic fight about the major questions doctrine! Gorsuch has a 46-page concurrence defending the major questions doctrine against the liberals’ criticism of it. Barrett has her own concurrence outlining her view that it’s a more modest rule of statutory construction; not as substantive as Gorsuch says. Yet they’re seemingly on the same page with Roberts about applying it here.

These justices were not scared watching Trump make these threats on CNN. They had their heads in the casebooks! Their brains were miles away. I do find that somewhat encouraging, because we obviously need a judiciary that can function independently of the executive branch and stand up to it when it breaks the law. And one gets the comforting sense that that is indeed what happened here.

It’s such a funny corrective to our constant complaint that some members of the Supreme Court have no idea what’s happening in Congress, no idea about the enormity of the insurrection that happened across the street a few years back, no idea about those rendition flights to El Salvador, no idea about anything. Today was their equal opportunity to have no idea of what’s really going on with Donald Trump, and weirdly, it saves the day? If he wanted this to feel like an existential threat to them, they’re not having it. They’re just going to do eggheaded judicial construction all day long.

In a way, that’s the most satisfying part of the opinion: They have their heads in the sand no matter what. It’s still going to be Professor Barrett at the chalkboard explaining the difference between a substantive canon and a rule of statutory construction. While Donald Trump absolutely fumes in the White House and unleashes the fury on the court, Barrett may never even see what he says.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The UK government is pulling together an elite squad of drone operators to crack down on the scourge of fly tippers and unauthorized dumpers across this ever less green and pleasant land.

The top drawer cadre of joystick jockeys will &quot;track down illegal dumps from the air,&quot; the Environment Agency said, as part of a &quot;major crackdown on waste crime.&quot;

Some of the drones will be upgraded with laser mapping technology, including LIDAR, the EA said, while the agency will also deploy &quot;a new screening tool that enables EA officers to scan and cross-check lorry license applications against waste permit records.&quot; This means suspect operators will be flagged &quot;before they have a chance to move waste illegally.&quot;

From the government&#39;s point of view, illegal fly tipping and dumping is now in the realms of organized crime. The government is increasing the Environment Agency&#39;s enforcement budget by half to more than £15.6 million. The motivation is often to avoid landfill charges, and criminals can make as much as £2,500 per lorry load of waste by billing customers for legal landfill, then diverting it to illegal dumps.

&quot;With organized criminals becoming ever more sophisticated, we are adopting new technologies to find and, importantly, stop them,&quot; said Phil Davies, Head of the Joint Unit for Waste Crime.

Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds said, &quot;From advanced laser-mapping to drone surveillance and new vehicle-scanning tools, this technology is helping us track, expose and stop waste crime, ensuring those who blight our communities are held to account.&quot;

Earlier this week, Varun Datta, 36, of Little Chester Street, London, was told he must pay £1.1 million by way of a confiscation order, and given a four month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months. He had earlier pleaded guilty to knowingly causing 4,275 metric tons of controlled waste to be deposited at a network of 16 sites. Datta must also pay £100,000 in compensation and £200,000 in prosecution costs. It&#39;s not just the UK that is facing the problem of unscrupulous operators dumping waste. This week it emerged that a man in Sicily had trained his dog to dump plastic bags of waste by the roadside, evading CCTV cameras installed to catch flytippers in the process.

The camera-dodging canine was captured illicitly offloading at least twice in the San Giorgio district of Catania, according to reports. His owner was tracked down and fined. Which just illustrates the high stake nature of this crime. In fact, the combination of high-tech, canine cunning, and illicit dumping is truly apocalyptic. Let&#39;s just hope the robo dogs being let loose on the UK&#39;s premier nuclear waste site don&#39;t get a whiff of it. Drones versus nuclear robo mutts sounds like a truly rubbish movie. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The UK&#39;s telecoms regulator has named and shamed the companies it receives the most customer complaints about, with certain brands cropping up more than others.

EE, TalkTalk, and Vodafone generated the most vitriol about fixed broadband, according to Ofcom. For landlines it was TalkTalk, Sky Mobile got the most for pay-monthly mobile, and EE again topped pay TV.

This covers complaints to the authority during the quarter from July to September last year (Q3 2025), relative to the size of the telecom operators&#39; customer bases (i.e. per 100,000 customers).

For fixed broadband, EE, TalkTalk, and Vodafone all hit 10 grumbles per 100K customers, but BT and Virgin Media were not far behind with 9 and 7 - the average was 8. Plusnet had the fewest complaints at 4. The gripes in this category were mostly about faults, service, and provisioning.

With landline users, TalkTalk again provoked the most moans, with 7 per 100K, but EE was a close second with 6, while BT, NOW Broadband, and Plusnet all had 5. Utility Warehouse received just 1 grievance per 100K.

When it comes to pay-monthly mobile operators, the number of grievances was relatively low. Even the top scorer, Sky Mobile, generated just 3 per 100K customers, with the average being 2. Ofcom said criticisms pertained to how customer complaints were handled by the operator itself, or issues with faults, services, and provisioning in the case of Three.

For pay TV services, EE registered the most moans at 6 per 100K customers, but Virgin Media generated 5, Sky was on 3 and TalkTalk 2. Handling of complaints by the operators was again the biggest source of dissatisfaction, but switching providers was a close second.

The overall volume of complaints per 100K subscribers appears to have fallen noticeably over the past 15 years or so, according to Ofcom charts. Way back at the start of 2011, the regulator recorded at least 40 per 100K for broadband and 38 per 100K for landlines.

Pay-monthly mobile complaints peaked at 19 per 100K in Q4 of 2011 and have steadily declined since. The level of pay TV gripes went no higher than 8 per 100K in 2018.

Ofcom has produced interactive charts of the number of customer criticisms it received, so readers can check them out historically by sector or by a chart comparing different providers. The underlying data is available in CSV format for anyone who cares to analyze it themselves. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/21/serpapi_google_scraping_lawsuit/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">SerpApi, a Texas-based web scraping company, has asked a California court to dismiss Google&#39;s claim that that it bypassed digital locks to gather copyrighted content in Google Search results.

&quot;Google is the largest scraper in the world,&quot; the company said in a blog post on Friday. &quot;Google&#39;s entire business began with a web crawler that visited every publicly accessible page on the internet, copied the content, indexed it, and served it back to users. It did this without distinguishing between copyrighted and non-copyrighted material, and it did this without asking permission. Now Google is in federal court claiming that our scraping is illegal.&quot;

Google in December 2025 sued SerpApi [PDF], alleging that its web scraping circumvents the security measures Google put in place to protect copyrighted material surfaced in search results. This was two months after Reddit filed a similar lawsuit against Oxylabs UAB, AWM Proxy, and SerpApi claiming the defendants had violated its own controls and Google&#39;s defenses.

Google did so alleging violations of the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), specifically Circumvention of Technological Measures (17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(1)(A)) and Trafficking in Technology Designed for Circumvention of Technological Measures (17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(2)).

&quot;SerpApi deceptively takes content that Google licenses from others (like images that appear in Knowledge Panels, real-time data in Search features and much more), and then resells it for a fee,&quot; said Google general counsel Halimah DeLaine Prado when the lawsuit was announced. &quot;In doing so, it willfully disregards the rights and directives of websites and providers whose content appears in Search.&quot;

Invited to comment, a Google spokesperson pointed to Prado&#39;s post.

The question is whether the mechanism Google employs to prevent scraping qualifies as a technological protection measure under the law, and whether SerpApi&#39;s crawling system unlawfully circumvents that protection.

It&#39;s a question that has become hugely important in light of increasing efforts to harvest data from websites and to deploy counter-measures, both technical and legal.

Google in its complaint refers to its anti-scraping technology as SearchGuard and claims that SerpApi found a way around it.

&quot;With the automated queries it submits, SerpApi engages in a wide variety of misrepresentations and evasions in order to bypass the technological protections Google deployed,&quot; Google&#39;s complaint explains. &quot;But each time it employs these artifices, SerpApi violates federal law.&quot;

SerpApi disagrees, insisting that Google&#39;s legal broadside is simply an attempt to protect its business interests.

The DMCA&#39;s definition of a technical protection measure is specific. And according to SerpApi, SearchGuard doesn&#39;t meet that definition.

&quot;The DMCA defines circumvention precisely: it means &#39;to descramble a scrambled work, to decrypt an encrypted work, or otherwise to avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate, or impair a technological measure,&quot; the company says. &quot;Read that carefully. Descramble. Decrypt. Impair.&quot;

SerpApi maintains it does none of those things, asserting that it accesses publicly visible web pages, without breaking encryption, disabling authentication systems, or accessing private data.

To support its argument, the company cites hiQ Labs, Inc. v. LinkedIn Corp. and Impression Products, Inc. v. Lexmark International, cases that have affirmed the lawfulness of scraping public data and denied the applicability of DMCA anti-circumvention provisions to otherwise public works.

SerpApi&#39;s motion to dismiss [PDF] argues that its web scraping is not circumvention under the DMCA, just as Google&#39;s own web scraping isn&#39;t circumvention.

&quot;The DMCA prevents hacking: the &#39;electronic equivalent of breaking into a locked room,&#39;&quot; the company&#39;s motion states. &quot;...But Google does not allege unscrambling or decryption of any work, or the impairment, deactivation, or removal of any access system. It only alleges that SerpApi &#39;solved&#39; JavaScript challenges or CAPTCHAs or otherwise mimicked a human-controlled browser in ways that &#39;misled&#39; Google into providing search results. But that is not the equivalent of breaking a lock or drilling through a wall to obtain a copy of a book. Mimicry is not a violation.&quot;

In January, SerpApi made a similar argument against Reddit in its Memorandum of Law [PDF] that accompanies its motion to dismiss Reddit&#39;s complaint. Reddit&#39;s first amended complaint [PDF], filed earlier this month, continues to rely on DMCA violation claims.

Tori Noble, staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation told The Register in an email that scraping public information is essential for the functioning of the internet.

&quot;The right to scrape publicly available information keeps the Internet free and open,&quot; she said. &quot;The DMCA undermines web freedom by chilling lawful scraping for research, expression, innovation, and more. When companies like Google attempt to rely on overly expansive interpretations of DMCA to protect their business models, everyone suffers.&quot;

Noble added, &quot;SerpApi is an EFF donor. However, EFF takes its independence seriously and donors never guide any of our work, including commentary on legal cases that fall within our issue areas.&quot;

With regard to recent litigation involving AI data gathering, courts have been reluctant to limit web scraping. In December, US District Judge Sidney Stein rejected [PDF] Ziff Davis&#39;s bid to have the court treat OpenAI&#39;s flouting of robots.txt directives during its web scraping as circumvention under the DMCA.

Given the financial stakes involved, the inapplicability of copyright rules to halt competitive scraping seems likely to invigorate efforts to separate human visitors from bots. But with AI bots getting better at autonomous and human-delegated activity online, it&#39;s difficult to see sites will be able to keep the bots away with anything less iron-clad contractual agreements or the sort of full-blown authentication envisioned by the DMCA. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/raspberry_pi_meme_stock_disorder/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">opinion Beloved British single-board computer maker Raspberry Pi has achieved meme stock stardom, as its share price surged 90 percent over the course of a couple of days earlier this week. It&#39;s settled since, but it’s still up more than 30 percent on the week.

The trigger for this rally? The catalyst appears to have been the sudden realization by one X user, &quot;aleabitoreddit,&quot; that the agentic AI hand grenade known as OpenClaw could drive demand for Raspberry Pis the way it had for Apple Mac Minis.

The viral AI personal assistant, formerly known as Clawdbot and Moltbot, has dominated the feeds of AI boosters over the past few weeks for its ability to perform everyday tasks like sending emails, managing calendars, booking appointments, and complaining about their meatbag masters on the purportedly all-agent forum known as MoltBook.

More level-headed voices have already flagged a wave of security vulnerabilities.

In case it needs to be said, no one should be running this thing on their personal devices lest the agent accidentally leak your most personal and sensitive secrets to the web. That&#39;s not just our opinion, it&#39;s one shared by the multitude of security experts El Reg has talked to about OpenClaw over the past few weeks, with some describing it as &quot;an infostealer malware disguised as an AI personal assistant.&quot;

In this context, a cheap low-power device like a Raspberry Pi makes a certain kind of sense as a safer, saner way to poke the robo-lobster everyone is losing their minds over. After all, Raspberry Pi made a name for itself by cramming just enough compute into a cute, credit card-sized package to be useful, and it cost less than a couple of movie tickets and a bucket of popcorn. Or ... at least it used to.

If you haven&#39;t noticed, Raspberry Pis aren&#39;t that cheap anymore thanks in part to the global memory crunch. Today, a top-specced Raspberry Pi 5 with 16GB of memory will set you back more than $200, up from $120 a year ago.

What&#39;s more, the Raspberry Pi 5&#39;s Broadcom BCM2712 is fabbed on ancient 16 nm process tech and uses an Arm core that dates back to before the pandemic. The Raspberry Pi wasn&#39;t meant to be fast, just cheap, and it&#39;s not even that anymore.

Sure, OpenClaw forks like PicoClaw have made it possible to run the agent on low-end Raspberry Pis, but the thing still needs to phone home to an API service for large language model (LLM) access. Local LLMs can work for OpenClaw, but you won&#39;t be running them on a Raspberry Pi. Even running them on a maxed-out Mac Mini is asking a lot of the hardware.

You know what&#39;s cheaper, easier, and more secure than letting OpenClaw loose on your local area network? A virtual private cloud (VPC). Just remember to configure the firewall and spin up new credentials in case it gets compromised.

There is no shortage of VPC instances preconfigured to run OpenClaw that can be rented for a few bucks a month and shut down at any time if or when OpenClaw doesn&#39;t live up to the hype.

But if for some reason you prefer to keep your weapons of mass stupidity close at hand, at least you&#39;ll have a Pi lying around to power your next hobbyist project, perhaps for something that can&#39;t email your boss or drain your bank account.

Oh, and when Raspberry Pi&#39;s share price comes crashing back to reality, don&#39;t say we didn&#39;t warn you. ®

&quot;When there is a potential exposure of customer information, PayPal is required to notify affected customers,&quot; the spokesperson told The Register. &quot;In this case, PayPal&#39;s systems were not compromised. As such, we contacted the approximately 100 customers who were potentially impacted to provide awareness on this matter.&quot;

According to a February 10 data breach notification sent to affected customers and shared with The Register, the online payment company spotted the unauthorized activity on December 12. It was due to a coding error in its PayPal Working Capital loan application that inadvertently leaked customers&#39; business contact information - including names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, email addresses, phone numbers, and business addresses - between July 1, 2025, and December 13, 2025.

&quot;PayPal has since rolled back the code change responsible for this error, which potentially exposed the PII,&quot; the letter said [PDF].

As soon as it noticed the leak and fraudulent transactions, PayPal says it began an investigation and blocked the unauthorized access, resetting passwords of affected accounts and requiring customers to set a new password the next time they log in.

&quot;A few customers experienced unauthorized transactions on their account and PayPal has issued refunds to these customers,&quot; according to the notification.

The company is also offering affected customers two years of free credit monitoring.

This data incident follows an earlier - and much worse - PayPal breach that also occurred in December, during which &quot;unauthorized parties&quot; accessed customers&#39; accounts using their valid login credentials.

In that 2022 security snafu, personal info belonging to 35,000 PayPal users was exposed including customers&#39; names, addresses, Social Security numbers, individual tax identification numbers, and dates of birth. ®

            <h2>Anthropic: No, absolutely not, you may not use third-party harnesses with Claude subs</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/anthropic_clarifies_ban_third_party_claude_access/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anthropic this week revised its legal terms to clarify its policy forbidding the use of third-party harnesses with Claude subscriptions, as the AI biz attempts to shore up its revenue model.

Anthropic sells subscriptions to its Claude platform, which provides access to a family of machine learning models (e.g. Opus 4.6), and associated tools like Claude Code, a web-based interface at Claude.ai, and the Claude Desktop application, among others.

Claude Code is a harness or wrapper – it integrates with the user&#39;s terminal and routes prompts to the available Claude model in conjunction with other tools and a control loop that, together, make it what Anthropic calls an agentic coding tool.

Many other tools serve as harnesses for models, such as OpenAI Codex, Google Antigravity, Manus (recently acquired by Meta), OpenCode, Cursor, and Pi (the harness behind OpenClaw).

Harnesses exist because interacting with a machine learning model itself is not a great user experience – you feed it a prompt and it returns a result. That&#39;s a single-turn interaction. Input and output. To create a product that people care about, model makers have added support for multi-turn interaction, memory of prior interactions, access to tools, orchestration to handle data flowing between those tools, and so on. Some of this support has been baked into model platforms, but some of it has been added through harness tooling.

This can pose a business problem for frontier model makers – they&#39;ve invested billions to train sophisticated models, but they risk being disintermediated by gatekeeping intermediaries that build harnesses around their models and offer a better user experience.

One of the ways that Anthropic has chosen to build brand loyalty is by selling tokens to subscription customers at a monthly price, with usage limits, that ends up being less costly than pay-as-you-go token purchases through the Claude API. Essentially, the economics are similar to an all-you-can-eat buffet that&#39;s priced with certain usage expectations.

That practice, effectively a subsidy for subscribers, led to token arbitrage. Customers accessed Claude models via subscriptions linked to third-party harnesses because it cost less than doing the same work via API key.

The AI biz&#39;s Consumer Terms of Service have forbidden the use of third-party harnesses, except with specific authorization since at least February 2024. The contractual language in Section 3.7, which remains unchanged from that time, says as much – any automated access tool not officially endorsed is forbidden.

Despite the presence of that passage for more than two years, a variety of third-party tools have flouted that rule and have allowed users to supply a Claude subscription account key.

The added rule explicitly states that OAuth authentication, the access method used for Claude Free, Pro, and Max tier subscribers, is only intended for Claude Code and Claude.ai (the web interface for Claude models).

&quot;Using OAuth tokens obtained through Claude Free, Pro, or Max accounts in any other product, tool, or service — including the Agent SDK — is not permitted and constitutes a violation of the Consumer Terms of Service,&quot; the updated legal compliance page says.

According to Anthropic, the update represents an attempt to clarify existing policy language to make it consistent throughout company documentation.

Anthropic appears to have decided to police its rules at the start of the year. In a January social media thread, Anthropic engineer Thariq Shihipar said the company had taken steps to prevent third-party tools from &quot;spoofing the Claude Code harness.&quot;

&quot;Third-party harnesses using Claude subscriptions create problems for users and are prohibited by our Terms of Service,&quot; he wrote. &quot;They generate unusual traffic patterns without any of the usual telemetry that the Claude Code harness provides, making it really hard for us to help debug when they have questions about rate limit usage or account bans and they don&#39;t have any other avenue for this support.&quot;

The prohibition proved unpopular enough to elicit a response from the competition. OpenAI&#39;s Thibault Sottiaux pointedly endorsed the use of Codex subscriptions in third-party harnesses.

After banning accounts for attempting to game its pricing structure, Anthropic has now clarified its legalese, as Shihipar indicated would happen, and makers of third-party harnesses are taking note.

On Thursday, OpenCode pushed code to remove support for Claude Pro and Max account keys and Claude API keys. The commit cites &quot;anthropic legal requests.&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">﻿EFX Ambient and Pitch Shifter-910 bring more quirky weirdness to the company’s plugin suite.

﻿EFX Ambient and Pitch Shifter-910 bring more quirky weirdness to the company’s plugin suite.

Arturia launched a new version of its flagship effects suite, FX Collection, which includes two new plugins, EFX Ambient and Pitch Shifter-910. FX Collection 6 also marks the introduction of an Intro version with a selection of six effects covering the basics for $99. That pales in comparison to the 39 effects in the full FX Collection Pro, but that also costs $499.

Pitch Shifter-910 is based on the iconic Eventide H910 Harmonizer from 1974, an early digital pitchshifter and delay with a very unique character. Arturia does an admirable job preserving its glitchy quirks. Pitch Shifter-910 is not a transparent effect that lets you create natural-sounding harmonies with yourself. Instead, it relishes in its weirdness, delivering chipmunk vocals at the higher ranges. There is also a more modern mode that cleans up some artifacts while preserving what makes the 910 so special. Though if you ask me, it also takes some of the fun and unpredictability out.

EFX Ambient is the other new addition to Arturia’s lineup, and it’s a weird one. While it does what it says on the tin, it doesn’t always do it in predictable ways. Sure, there’s plenty of big ethereal reverbs and shimmer, but there’s also resonators, glitch processing, and reverse delays. It has six distinct modes with unique characteristics, which it feeds through a big washy reverb. And there’s an X/Y control in the middle for adding movement to your sound.

Neither of the brand-new effects made the cut for the Intro version. FX Collection 6 Intro includes Efx Motions, Efx Fragments, Mix Drums, Tape Mello-Fi, Rev Plate-140, and Delay Tape-201. That offers excellent versatility covering delay, reverb, tape-like lo-fi, modulation, and even granular processing. Primarily, what you miss out on are some of the saturation and mixing effects like bus and compression, as well as the more specialty flavors of delay and reverb like Rev LX-24, based on the Lexicon 224 from 1978.

$499 for the full FX Collection 6 Pro might seem steep, but as the company has grown the lineup from 15 effects in 2020 to 39 in 2026, it’s become a more attractive value proposition. And, while it’s not quite as highly regarded as Arturia’s V Collection of soft synths, it’s building a reputation for high-quality effects.

The political action committee sent out partially pre-filled absentee ballot applications.﻿

For all his bluster about voter fraud, Elon Musk has been one of the most flagrant flaunters of US election law. Now his America PAC has been slapped with a reprimand by the Georgia State Election Board for sending out pre-filled absentee ballot applications. State law prohibits anyone, other than an authorized relative, from sending an absentee ballot application prefilled with the elector’s information.

Residents of Chattooga, Cherokee, Coweta, Floyd, and Whitfield counties reported receiving absentee ballot applications from America PAC, partially pre-filled. According to the State Election Board, the applications also failed to note that they were not actual ballots and were not provided by the government, as is required by law.

At the State Election Board meeting on February 18th, the panel quickly handed down the reprimand. America PAC did not appear to send a representative or submit a statement in defense of its actions.

This is just the latest example of Musk testing the limits of election law after he repeatedly suggested paying people to sign a petition and register to vote in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and other swing states. It’s also another incident in which those who claim to be most concerned about election integrity have been caught potentially violating the law.

            <div id="article-text">The posts raised alarms, but OpenAI declined to alert law enforcement.

The posts raised alarms, but OpenAI declined to alert law enforcement.

The suspect in the mass shooting at Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia, Jesse Van Rootselaar, was raising alarms among employees at OpenAI months before the shooting took place. This past June, Jesse had conversations with ChatGPT involving descriptions of gun violence that triggered the chatbot’s automated review system. Several employees raised concerns that her posts could be a precursor to real-world violence and encouraged company leaders to contact the authorities, but they ultimately declined.

OpenAI spokesperson Kayla Wood told The Verge that, while the company considered referring the account to law enforcement, it was ultimately decided that it did not constitute an “imminent and credible risk” of harm to others. Wood said that a review of the logs did not indicate there was active or imminent planning of violence. The company banned Rootselaar’s account, but it does not appear to have taken any further precautionary action.

Wood said, “Our thoughts are with everyone affected by the Tumbler Ridge tragedy. We proactively reached out to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police with information on the individual and their use of ChatGPT, and we’ll continue to support their investigation.”

On February 10th, nine people were killed and 27 injured, including Rootselaar, in the deadliest mass shooting in Canada since 2020. Rootselaar was found dead at the scene of the Tumbler Ridge Secondary School, of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, where most of the killings took place.

The decision not to alert law enforcement might look misguided in retrospect, but Wood said that OpenAI’s goal is to balance privacy with safety and avoid introducing unintended harm through overly broad use of law enforcement referrals.

Welcome to the weekend, folks! The Reviews and Guides team here at The Verge is gearing up for all things Unpacked, but Samsung isn’t the only one readying new phones. Google just announced the Pixel 10A, which, for you early adopters, is already up for preorder with a $100 gift card. Elsewhere in deal land, you’ll find steep discounts on mopping vacuums, slight discounts on Soundcore’s cheap ANC headphones, and a rare discount on a new PC controller with swiveling sticks.

We finally have a release date for the Pixel 10A: March 5th. What’s more, if you’re thinking about picking up Google’s latest phone, you can already preorder the base-model configuration at Amazon and Best Buy with 128GB of storage and a $100 gift card for $499. Alternatively, Amazon is offering it with a free pair of the Pixel Buds 2A, a fantastic set of recently released earbuds that typically retail for $130.

Despite being a pretty minimal update, Google’s forthcoming Android handset is a pretty solid deal. It doesn’t adopt a lot of features from the flagship Pixel 10 series; however, last year’s Tensor G4 chip is still speedy enough for most tasks, satellite SOS is handy, and you get slightly faster wired and wireless charging. More importantly, it still comes with seven years of OS and security updates, which, personally, I’d take over Magic Cue, Pixel Screenshots, and other AI-based tools any day of the week.

Twelve. That’s how many AC outlets Anker’s 351 Power Strip — which is now available in black or white from Amazon and Anker for $23.99 ($6 off) — packs into its 9.65-inch, surge-protected build. The beefy power strip also features a 20W USB-C port and two USB-A ports, both of which can deliver up to 15W of juice. Just keep in mind that, like with most power strips and like-minded chargers, you’ll have to split power amongst the USB ports, which are limited to a max output of 15W when charging multiple devices simultaneously.

I’m admittedly not a huge fan of fighting games — I have no patience for learning combos, dear readers — but the Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot seems like a good compromise if I were forced to choose between a traditional controller and one specifically built for hammering out hadokens. And now, the novel gamepad is on sale at both Amazon and Best Buy for $99.99 ($40 off), its lowest price to date.

Although Turtle Beach’s wireless PC controller offers a slew of welcome components, including drift-free Hall effect joysticks and adjustable trigger stops, its defining feature is a pair of rotating modules that can “pivot” to reveal a customizable controller layout that’s better suited for retro titles and fighting games. You also get programmable back buttons, the ability to save up to five profiles, and a 3.5mm audio jack, not to mention compatibility with mobile devices over Bluetooth and Xbox consoles via a wired connection.

If you’re looking for a cheap(ish) set of noise-canceling headphones, Soundcore’s Space One are on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and directly from Soundcore (with code WS7DV2G0S7DJ) in all four colors for $79.99 ($20 off), matching their second-best price to date.

During Cyber Monday last year, our own John Higgins waxed poetic about the over-ear cans, namely because they deliver impressive sound and comfort for the price. The sound quality and ANC don’t rival the flagships from Sony or Bose, sure, but you can try over 20 different presets or tweak the sound yourself using the eight-band equalizer in Anker’s companion app. They can also last up to 40 hours with ANC enabled, meaning you should be able to fly from New York to Singapore and back again without ever having to charge them.

It might be better than the real thing. It’s safer, at least.

I’ve always wanted to go skydiving. Aerial_Knight’s DropShot, from indie developer Aerial_Knight, lets me live out that dream — at least in a safe, virtual kind of way. It also lets me shoot bullets from finger guns, wield laser skulls, and wear cool sunglasses while I’m falling through the air. So maybe it’s better than the real thing.

Playing as a character named Smoke Wallace, who was bitten by a dragon that gave him the finger gun that can actually shoot bullets, you plummet toward the ground and try to pick off bad guys with that finger gun or by punching them up close. It’s a first-person game, and the perspective really helps sell the feeling that you’re falling through the sky.

Your goal is to survive each level without taking more than two hits from the bad guys or other dangers like lasers, all while taking down as many enemies as you can as quickly as possible. Your gun has a limited number of bullets, but you can refill your ammo by shooting or flying into balloons you’ll see as you fall.

Each level is short. I finished most of them in 45 seconds to a minute and a half. At the end, you get a letter grade based on how many enemies you take down, maxing out at S+++ if you reach a certain per-level goal. Since the terrain, obstacles, enemies, and speed boosts spawn in the same spot each level, repeating them to try and get that high score turns each level into fast-paced FPS puzzles you can crack to find the optimal route.

The game oozes style. Smoke Wallace has purple skin because of his dragon bite. He wears sunglasses, and you can pick different styles that give you different power-ups for finding the eggs, like one that briefly lets you fire six finger guns at a time. Every time you kill a bad guy, the game briefly goes into slow-motion. You’ll even take on bosses that include dragons and flying tanks. And throughout, you’ll be treated to an awesome heavy metal soundtrack.

I was done with DropShot after about two-and-a-half hours, and I could spend more time grinding S+++ scores if I wanted to. But I think the short length works in the game’s favor: DropShot explores its core mechanics in 50 great levels instead of stretching everything out into something that might wear thin. Even when I was nearing the end, I was still excited every time I flew through the sky.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The parent company of Jeep and Dodge just took a $26.5 billion hit on its EV investment. But its problems run much deeper than that.

The parent company of Jeep and Dodge just took a $26.5 billion hit on its EV investment. But its problems run much deeper than that.

Demand for EVs has gone glacial, and one automaker after another is running aground: General Motors threw $7.6 billion overboard. Ford washed $19.5 billion off its books. Leave it to Stellantis to face the most titanic charge yet, a $26.5 billion bill for its own misplaced bet on EVs.

The Jeep, Dodge, and Chrysler parent company hasn’t said how much of that unfathomable sum is explicitly due to EV losses, as the write-down wiped away about 25 percent of the company’s stock value overnight. Every automaker faces the same cooling EV demand and whipsawing political climate, yet Stellantis appears the most exposed, due in part to longstanding failures to keep up with evolving tech or consumer tastes. Don’t forget quality. An additional $16.7 billion charge for warranty and recall claims, including a recall of 320,000 Jeep 4xe plug-in hybrids for battery-fire risks, adds insult to financial injury.

The names may change — Stellantis, Fiat Chrysler, DaimlerChrysler, Chrysler Corp. — but the company stays frustratingly familiar. It’s the slightly off-key sister in the Motown trio. It’s an automaker enamored of the quick fix, the low-hanging fruit.

In America, that low-hanging fruit tends to come in bunches of eight, with Hemi V8s below the hood of a thirsty pickup, SUV, or muscle car. Now it’s déjà vu all over again. Stellantis plans to ship 100,000 Hemi engines from its Saltillo, Mexico, factory in 2026, tripling output to power Ram 1500 pickups, Jeep Wranglers, and other models. For now, the demand appears there, and executives intend to give the people what they want.

During an analysts’ call last year, Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said the so-called Big Beautiful Bill — making sure to give President Trump credit — allows the company “more flexibility in choosing… a mix between ICE and electric versions that we sell. And this will mean, to us, a lot of additional profit.”

It’s hard to blame automakers for wanting to make back these brutal EV losses. Like GM, Ford, or Toyota, Stellantis is forecasting a financial windfall from the Trump administration’s blank check on pollution and mileage rules. But the pendulum will inevitably swing, and if this automaker doesn’t invest in affordable passenger cars and tech, it’s going to get its head lopped off.

Certainly, Stellantis’ EVs weren’t getting it done in America. The hunky Dodge Charger Daytona was a valiant-but-failed attempt at updating Mopar muscle for an electric age. Dodge was forced to add a gasoline version. A half-baked Jeep Wagoneer S EV, at more than $70,000 with options, fell flat in showrooms. The 2026 Jeep Recon is the company’s next shot at luring Tesla Model Y buyers, though the Mexico-built SUV will also start from $67,000, and with no $7,500 consumer tax credit to soften the blow.

The names may change — Stellantis, Fiat Chrysler, DaimlerChrysler, Chrysler Corp. — but the company stays frustratingly familiar

Those models aren’t what the Trump administration has in mind to “assist” the industry, as it locks fuel-economy and emissions rules into a time machine, seemingly bound for the Eisenhower administration. A yearlong spree against regulations culminated with last week’s killing of the “endangerment finding,” the historic ruling that required the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate greenhouse gases as a threat to public health and safety.

Automakers will no longer face fines for failing to meet tailpipe pollution or fuel-economy standards. They will no longer be required to buy pricey climate credits from the likes of Tesla, or spend billions developing EVs that weren’t boosting the bottom line.

In the face of such regulatory monkey business, the Detroit Three are naturally tempted to play see no evil, hear no evil. Automakers are free to make whatever cars they like, at least until the next sheriff rides into Washington. “Choice” is their new mantra. Unsurprisingly, their choice is to make hay and haul it in fossil-fueled SUVs and pickup trucks that generate virtually all its profits.

Washington insists this is all about making cars more affordable. That includes a vindictive axing of fuel-saving stop/start technology, which the EPA calculated was trimming owners’ gasoline bills between 7.3 and 26.4 percent. (Wait, doesn’t gasoline cost money?) And it’s precisely those feature-stuffed trucks and SUVs that drove the price of the average new car past $50,000 in the first place. Today’s cheap gasoline also encourages automakers to party now and pay later. Longer memories will recall the old Chrysler getting caught with its pants down whenever fuel prices spiked, its showrooms overflowing with unsold, guzzling trucks. Churlish types may even recall Chrysler’s 2009 bankruptcy and subsequent federal bailout.

Like its automaking peers, Stellantis insists it won’t walk away from EVs. But it remains more reliant on trucks and SUVs than any rival. Stellantis would at least try to own its area of expertise. Yet sales of its bread-and-butter Ram pickup, after briefly nosing past the mighty Ford F-150, have fallen off a cliff. Sure, some of that drop came from Ram’s controversial decision to drop a V-8 in favor of a more-efficient “Hurricane” inline V-6. But it’s more related to the botched rollout of a redesigned 2025 Ram, with production bottlenecks, quality glitches, and the elimination of an affordable “Classic” model in favor of moneymakers like the $87,000 Tungsten edition.

Try this for market malpractice: Prior to the launch of the 2026 Jeep Cherokee, a critical hybrid SUV that revives a storied Jeep nameplate, Stellantis didn’t even have a straight-up rival for the Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, or other wildly popular compact SUVs. (The Jeep Compass is much smaller and not up for that fight).

“That’s really where the market is, and the Koreans and Japanese are all over those segments,” says Tom Libby, director of industry analysis for S&P Global Mobility.

Like its automaking peers, Stellantis insists it won’t walk away from EVs. But it remains more reliant on trucks and SUVs than any rival

Compact SUVs are one of 33 market segments, by S&P’s count, yet those models account for 21 percent of all US sales. Stellantis, in effect, “was only competing in four-fifths of the market,” Libby says.

A revolving door of management hasn’t helped. Filosa is the latest CEO following the abrupt resignation of Carlos Tavares in December 2024, with Tavares facing pressure from all sides. Dealers, suppliers, the UAW, key shareholders, and the managing board were in near-revolt over slumping sales and Tavares’ relentless cost-cutting. Like a perpetually rebuilding sports franchise, each new company chief arrives with high hopes and fresh strategies, then gets replaced before he or she can see it through.

“You can’t keep changing course and expect things to improve,” Libby says.

In Europe, Stellantis’ Peugeot and Citroen brands were doing solid EV sales. Now the EU is watering down an EV mandate for 2035. So Stellantis plans to resurrect diesel engines in at least seven European models. Some analysts see this as smart business, with Chinese automakers having no diesels to sell. But this is also Stellantis at its blast-from-the-past best. In Europe, diesels have fallen from more than half the market in 2015 to 7.7 percent today. EVs are at nearly 20 percent and rising fast, driven by the arrival of Chinese models from BYD and others.

Notoriously, Stellantis has too many underperforming brands, with 14 core outfits including a superfluous Lancia, Vauxhall, and DS in Europe. (I’ll leave Maserati off that list, hoping this once-glorious brand can survive). By this point, a boss-baby CEO would realize he has too many toys to play with. Yet each new chief has resisted making tough calls on which brands to cut loose. As brands such as Chrysler wither, executives publicly proclaim their love and commitment, only to neglect them.

Attempts to reestablish Fiat and Alfa Romeo in America were noble, especially for enthusiasts who crave some la dolce vita in their cars. But Alfa Romeo sold 5,600 cars here last year and a paltry 1,300 for Fiat. Sorry, but the experiment has failed. And despite having seven brands in America, none is the kind of mainstream anchor provided by GM’s Chevrolet, Ford, Toyota, or Honda.

Yet for all that, Stellantis doesn’t have a mainstream domestic car brand to take on Toyota, Honda, or Hyundai. It doesn’t have a high-margin luxury brand akin to Cadillac, whose thriving EV sales (prior to the kibosh on consumer credits) saw it pass a stumbling Audi in the US luxury ranks.

“You can’t keep changing course and expect things to improve.”

Things hit bottom in August, when Stellantis’ share of the US retail market reached a record-low 5.4-percent, according to S&P Global. The company has begun to turn things around, with retail share rising to 6.3 percent in November. But after shedding market share to Toyota or Honda for decades, the company is now losing it to Hyundai and Kia, whose sales have exploded. Not coincidentally, those Korean brands have invested in full lineups that encompass affordable sedans, SUVs, and smartly designed EVs.

One ominous number illustrates the depth of the problem. Stellantis’ percentage of repeat customers, which S&P calls its manufacturer loyalty measure, sunk to around 41 percent in August, before recovering to 47 percent for the fourth quarter. In other words, fewer than half of current owners are buying another Stellantis model, and that’s with seven brands to choose from. Among automakers that offer at least two brands here, only Volkswagen was lower at 44 percent.

At GM, a healthy 66 percent of owners end up buying another GM model, followed by Toyota and Ford at a respective 64 and 61 percent. That loyalty has become a critical indicator of long-term success, as a growing number of automakers fight over a limited (or shrinking) pie of new-car buyers. The winners are those who can steal customers from rivals, win over younger generations, and ideally keep them for life.

The frustrating part is that Stellantis, when it’s on its game, can deliver compelling cars and trucks, full of charm and personality.

The plush-and-powerful Ram. The Jeep Wrangler, which experienced a massive sales renaissance as Americans rediscovered the joys of authentic off-roaders. The Dodge Challenger and its Hellcat and Demon offshoots. The overlooked Maserati GranTurismo Folgore, a sweet-driving, 202-mph electric indulgence that makes a Lucid look like a Hertz rental.

Stellantis has little choice but to lean into its traditional customer base for now. But Stellantis must keep investing in electrification and other advanced tech, before the winds change again. Chinese EVs already have a foothold in Europe and a coming toehold in Canada and will inevitably blow into America as well.

The Ram 1500 REV pickup, serially delayed, remains an intriguing tech play. This type of “extended range electric vehicle,” or EREV, uses an ICE engine solely to generate electricity for a battery, which then efficiently powers the wheels. With much longer electric ranges than today’s plug-in hybrids, and the ability to fill a gas tank when needed, EREVs could prove popular with Americans who are leery over EV range or long charging times. Ram says the REV can cover 145 miles on plug-in electricity alone, with 690 miles of total range.

Filosa intends to revitalize a near-dormant Chrysler brand, including an actual sedan (possibly electric) based on the Halcyon concept, and perhaps a sporty small car priced below $30,000. The company is also readying a demo fleet of Charger Daytonas, powered by semi-solid-state batteries — from the Massachusetts-based Factorial Energy — that helped a lightly modified Mercedes EQS sedan cover 749 miles from Stuttgart to Sweden, with 85 miles of range to spare.

If Stellantis can get in on the ground floor of crazy-ranging, rapid-charging solid-state batteries, it and other homegrown automakers could leapfrog the best lithium-ion technology in all of China. Stellantis would be viewed as a tech leader, not a follower. Show them 500 miles of range and a 15-minute charge, and EV fans might consider a Dodge, Chrysler, or Ram for the first time in their lives. Don’t laugh. Remember how Tesla was going to drive every legacy automaker out of business? The clock may be ticking on Stellantis, but it’s not too late to change.

Microsoft has a new plan to prove what’s real and what’s AI online

AI-enabled deception now permeates our online lives. There are the high-profile cases you may easily spot. Other times, it slips quietly into social media feeds and racks up views.It is into this mess that Microsoft has put forward a blueprint, shared with MIT Technology Review, for how to prove what’s real online.An AI safety research team at the company recently evaluated how methods for documenting digital manipulation are faring against today’s most worrying AI developments, like interactive deepfakes and widely accessible hyperrealistic models. It then recommended technical standards that can be adopted by AI companies and social media platforms. Read the full story.

Measles cases are rising. Other vaccine-preventable infections could be next.

There’s a measles outbreak happening close to where I live. Since the start of this year, 34 cases have been confirmed in Enfield, a northern borough of London.It’s another worrying development for an incredibly contagious and potentially fatal disease. Since October last year, 962 cases of measles have been confirmed in South Carolina. Large outbreaks (with more than 50 confirmed cases) are underway in four US states. Smaller outbreaks are being reported in another 12 states.The vast majority of these cases have been children who were not fully vaccinated. Vaccine hesitancy is thought to be a significant reason children are missing out on important vaccines. And if we’re seeing more measles cases now, we might expect to soon see more cases of other vaccine-preventable infections, including some that can cause liver cancer or meningitis.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Twenty years ago, Joanna Wakefield-Scurr was having persistent pain in her breasts. Her doctor couldn’t diagnose the cause but said a good, supportive bra could help. A professor of biomechanics, Wakefield-Scurr thought she could do a little research and find a science-backed option. Two decades later, she’s still looking. Wakefield-Scurr now leads an 18-person team at the Research Group in Breast Health at the University of Portsmouth in the UK. Their research shows that the most effective high-impact-sports bras have underwires, padded cups, adjustable underbands and shoulder straps, and hook-and-eye closures. These bras reduce breast movement by up to 74% when compared with wearing no bra. But movement might not be the only metric that matters.

Few anatomical structures hang outside of the body unsupported by cartilage, muscle, or bone—meaning there wasn’t much historical research to build on. Wakefield-Scurr’s lab was the first to find that when women run, the motion of the torso causes breasts to move in a three-dimensional pattern—swinging side to side and up and down—as well as moving forward and backward. In an hour of slow jogging, boobs can bounce approximately 10,000 times.

Wearing a bra that’s too tight can limit breathing. Wearing one that’s too loose can create back, shoulder, and neck pain. Pain can also be caused by the lag between torso and breast movement, which causes what is scientifically known as “breast slap.”

The lab’s research has also found that the physical discomfort of bad bras, combined with the embarrassment of flopping around, is the one of the biggest barriers to exercise for women and that if women have a good sports bra, they’re more willing to go for a run.

Some bras function by deliberately compressing breasts. Others encapsulate and support each individual breast. But scientists still don’t know whether it’s more biomechanically important to reduce the breasts’ motion entirely, to reduce the speed at which they move, or to reduce breast slap. Will women constantly be forced to choose between the comfort of a stretchier bra and the support of a more restrictive one?

Wakefield-Scurr is excited about new materials she’s tested that tighten or stretch depending on how you move. She’s working with fabric manufacturers and clothing companies to try out their wares.

As more women take up high-impact sports, the need to understand what makes a good bra grows. Wakefield-Scurr says her lab can’t keep up with demand. Their cups runneth over.

Speaking with popular AI content creators convinces me that “slop” isn’t just the internet rotting in real time, but the early draft of a new kind of pop culture.

I asked my MIT class to consider why some of the advances that MIT Technology Review’s journalists thought would change our world never really did—and what we can learn from the flops.

            <div id="article-text">The bird is a beautiful silver-gray, and as she dies twitching in the lasernet I’m grateful for two things: First, that she didn’t make a sound. Second, that this will be the very last time.

They’re called corpse doves—because the darkest part of their gray plumage surrounds the lighter part, giving the impression that skeleton faces are peeking out from behind trash cans and bushes—and their crime is having the ability to carry diseases that would be compatible with humans. I open my hand, triggering the display from my imprinted handheld, and record an image to verify the elimination. A ding from my palm lets me know I’ve reached my quota for the day and, with that, the year.

I’m tempted to give this one a send-off, a real burial with holy words and some flowers, but then I hear a pack of streetrats hooting beside me. My city-issued vest is reflective and nanopainted so it projects a slight glow. I don’t know if it’s to keep us safe like they say, or if it’s just that so many of us are ex-cons working court-ordered labor, and civilians want to be able to keep an eye on us. Either way, everyone treats us like we’re invisible—everyone except children.

I switch the lasernet on the bird from electrocute to incinerate and watch as what already looked like a corpse becomes ashes.

“Executioner” is not my official title. The branch of city government we work for is called the Department of Mercy, and we’re only ever called technicians. But that doesn’t matter to the child, who can’t be more than eight but has the authority of a judge as she holds up a finger to point me out to her friends.

“Guys, look!” she says, then turns her attention to me. “You hunting something big?”

I shake my head, slowly packing up my things.

“Something small?” she asks. Then her eyes darken. “You’re not a cat killer, are you?”

I don’t know why I lied, but as the suspicion leaves her face and a smile returns, I’m glad I did.

“You should come down by the docks. We’ve got flies! Make your quota in a day.”

The girl tosses her hair, making the tinfoil charms she’s wrapped around her braids tinkle like wind chimes.

“It’s my last day. But if I get flies again for next year, I’ll swing by.”

Another lie, because we both know the city would never send anyone to the docks for flies. Flies are killed because they are a nuisance, which means people only care about clearing them out of suburbs and financial districts. They’d only send a tech down to the docks to kill something that put the city proper at risk through disease, or by using up more resources than they wanted to spare.

LeeLee is expecting me home to sit through the reassignments with her and it’s already late, so I hand out a couple of the combination warming and light sticks I get for winter to the pack of children with nowhere to go. As I walk away, the children are laughing so loud it sounds like screaming. They toss the sticks in the air like signal flares, small bright cries for help that no one will see.

LeeLee’s anxiety takes the form of caretaking, and as soon as I’ve stepped through the door I can smell bread warming and soup on the stove. I take off my muffling boots. Another day, I’d leave them on and sneak up on her just to be irritating, and she’d turn and threaten me with whatever kitchen utensil was at hand. But she’ll be extra nervous today, so I remove the shoes that let me catch nervous birds, and step hard on my way in.

Sometimes it seems impossible that I can spend a year killing every fragile and defenseless thing I’ve encountered but still take such care with Lee. But I tell myself that the killing isn’t me—it’s just my sentence, and what I do when I have a choice is the only thing that really says anything about me. For the first six months and 400 birds, I believed it.

LeeLee flicks on a smile that lasts a whole three seconds when she sees me, then clouds over again.

“Soup’s too thin. There wasn’t enough powder for a real broth.”

“Not like this. It doesn’t even cover up the taste of the water.”

“I like the taste of the water,” I say, which breaks her out of her spiraling enough to roll her eyes.

I put my hands on her shoulder to stop her fussing.

“The soup is going to be fine,” I say. “So will the reassignment.”

I’m not much taller than she is, but when we met in juvie she hadn’t hit her last growth spurt yet, so she still tilts her head back to look me in the eyes. “What if it’s not?”

“What if you get whatever assignment Jordan got?”

There it is. Because two of us didn’t leave juvie together to start community service—three of us did. But Jordan didn’t last three weeks into his assignment before he turned his implements inward.

I notice she doesn’t say What if  I get what Jordan got? Because LeeLee is more afraid of being left alone than of having to kill something innocent.

“We don’t know what his assignment was,” I say.

It’s true, but we do know it was bad. Two weeks into our first stretch, a drug meant to sterilize the city’s feral cat population accidentally had the opposite effect. Everyone was pulled off their assigned duty for three days to murder litters of new kittens instead. It nearly broke me and Lee, but Jordan seemed almost grateful.

“Besides, we don’t know if his assignment had anything to do with … what he did. You’re borrowing trouble. Worry in”—I check my palm—“an hour, when you actually know there’s something to worry about.”

You’d think it would hover over us too insistently to be ignored, but after we sit down and talk about our day I’m at ease, basking in the warmth of her storytelling and the bread that’s more beige than gray today. When the notification comes in, I am well and truly happy, and I can only hope it isn’t for the last time.

We both stiffen when we hear the alert. She looks at me, and I give her a smile and a nod, and then we look down. In the time between hearing the notification and checking it, I imagine all kinds of horrors that could be in my assignment slot. I imagine a picture of kittens, reason enough for the girl I met earlier to condemn me. For a moment, just a flash, I imagine looking down and seeing my own face as my target, or LeeLee’s.

But when I finally see the file, the relief that comes over me softens my spine. It’s a plant. Faceless, and bloodless.

I look up, and LeeLee’s eyes are dark as she leans forward, studying my face, looking for whatever crack she failed to see in Jordan. I force myself to smile wide for her.

She reaches forward and squeezes my hands. Hers are shaking.

She waves away my question. “I got rats. I can handle it. I was just worried about you.”

I spend the rest of the night unbelievably happy. For the next year, I get to kill a thing that does not scream.

“You get all that?” the man behind the desk asks, and I nod even though I didn’t.

I’ve traded in my boots and lasernet for a hazmat suit and a handheld mister with two different solutions. The man had been talking to me about how to use the solutions, but I can’t process verbal information very well. The whole reason I was sent to the correctional facility as a teen was that too many teachers mistook my processing delays for behavioral infractions. I’m planning to read the manual on my own time before I start in a few hours, but when I pick up the mister and look down the barrel, the equipment guy freaks out.

“They were supposed to add sulfur to this batch, but they didn’t. So you won’t smell it. It won’t make you cough or your eyes water. It’ll just be lights out. Good night. You got me?”

“Did you not hear me? Don’t even look at that thing without your mask on.” He takes a breath, calmer now that I’ve lowered my hands. “Look, the first solution—it’s fine. It’s keyed to the plant itself and just opens its cells up for whatever solution we put on it. You could drink the stuff. But that second? The orange vial? Don’t even put it in the mister without your mask on. It dissipates quickly, so you’re good once you’re done spraying, but not a second before.”

He looks around, then leans in. “They were supposed to add sulfur to this batch, but they didn’t. So you won’t smell it. It won’t make you cough or your eyes water. It’ll just be lights out. Good night. You got me?”

I nod again as I grab the mask I hadn’t noticed before. This time when I thank him, I mean it.

It takes me an hour to find the first plant, and when I do it’s beautiful. Lush pink on the inside and dark green on the outside, it looks hearty and primitive. Almost Jurassic. I can see why it’s only in the sewers now: it would be too easy to spot and destroy aboveground in the sea of concrete.

After putting on my mask, I activate the mister and then stand back as it sprays the plant with poison. Nothing happens. I remember the prepping solution and switch the cartridges to coat it in that first. The next time I try the poison, the plant wilts instantly, browning and shrinking like a tire deflating. I was wrong. Plants this size don’t die silently. It makes a wheezing sound, a deep sigh. By the third time I’ve heard it, I swear I can make out the word Please.

When I get home, LeeLee’s locked herself in the bathroom, which doesn’t surprise me. I heard that they moved to acid for rats, and the smell of a corpse dissolving is impossible to get used to and even harder to get out of your hair. I eat dinner, read, change for bed, and she’s still in the bathroom. I brush my teeth in the kitchen.

The next morning, I have to take a transport to the plant’s habitat on the other end of the city, so I spend the time looking through the file that came with the assignment. Under “Characteristics,” some city government scientist has written, “Large, dark. Resource-intensive. Stubborn.”

I stare at the last word. Its own sentence, tacked on like an afterthought. Stubborn. The same word that was written in my file when I got sent from school to the facility where I met LeeLee and Jordan. Large, dark, stubborn, and condemned. I’ve never been called resource-intensive. But I have been called a waste.

When I get to my last plant of the day, I don’t reach for the mister. This one is small, young, the green still neon-bright and the teeth at the edges still soft. I pick it up, careful with its roots, and carry it home. I find a discarded water container along the way and place it inside. When I get home I knock on LeeLee’s door. She doesn’t answer, so I leave the plant on the floor as an offering. They aren’t proper flowers, but they smell nice and earthy. It might keep the residual odor from melted organs, fur, and bones from taking over her room.

“Killing things is a dumb job,” says the girl.

After a week of hearing the death cries of its cousins, I was moved to use some of my allowance to buy cheap fertilizer and growth serum for my plant. The girl and her friends, fewer than before, were panhandling at the megastore across the way. She ran over, braids jingling, as soon as she saw me. I thought she’d leave once I gave her more glowsticks for her friends, but she stayed in step and kept following me.

“It’s not a dumb job,” I say, even though it is.

I shift my bag to point at the bottom of my vest. Beneath “Mercy Dept.” the department’s slogan is written in cursive: Killing to Save!

She sees the text but doesn’t register it, and I have to remind myself that even getting kicked out of school is a privilege. The city had decided to stop wasting educational resources on me. They’d never even tried with her or the other streetrats.

Suddenly, all I can think about is Jordan. “Maybe they don’t mind.”

I think of the plants. Maybe they hadn’t been pleading. Maybe they’d been sighing with relief. I think of the birds that eventually stopped running away.

“Maybe they’re tired. The city’s right, and their existence isn’t compatible with the world we made. And that’s our fault for being stupid and cruel, but it makes their lives so hard. We’ve made it so they can only live half a life. Maybe the least we can do is finish the job.”

It’s a terrible thing to say—even worse to a kid.

Her eyes go hard. “What are you killing now, executioner?”

The question surprises me. “Sewer plants. Why?”

I’d wanted her to leave me alone, but when she runs away I feel suddenly empty.

I have an issue at work when I can’t find my poison vial. I tell them it rolled away in the sewer and I couldn’t catch it in time, because I don’t want to tell them I was unobservant enough to let a street kid steal from me. After a stern warning and a mountain of forms, they issue a new vial and don’t add to my service time.

Pulling overtime to make up for the day I didn’t have my poison means it’s days before I get to fertilize my houseplant. LeeLee’s door is open, so I bring in the fertilizer and serum. She’s put the plant on her windowsill, but it prefers indirect sunlight, so I move it to the shelf next to her boxes of knickknacks and trinkets. I add the fertilizer to its soil and am about to spray it with the growth serum when I get an idea. I get the mister from my kit and set it up to spray the prepping solution on the little plant to prime it. I open the window and put on my mask, just in case, but I’m sure the man was telling the truth when he called the first liquid harmless. After its cells are open, I spray it with my store-bought growth serum.

I’m halfway through making dinner when I hear the crash and run into LeeLee’s room.

The plant has grown huge, turning adult instantly, and its new weight has taken down LeeLee’s shelf. Dainty keepsake boxes are shattered on our concrete floor.

I bend to my knees quickly, so focused on fixing my mistake that I don’t register the oddness of the items I’m picking up—jacks, kids’ toys, a bow—until my fingers touch something small and shimmering. It’s a scrap of silver, still rounded in the shape of the braids it was taken from.

I’d forgotten the city has more than one kind.

I’m waiting up when Lee gets home. I don’t make her tell me. I just grab her kit and rummage through it. Where my kit has a hazmat suit, hers has a stealth mesh to render her invisible. Where I keep my mister, she has a gun loaded with vials too large for rats. I have a mini-vac to suck up excess plant matter to prevent seeds from sprouting. She has zip ties.

By the time I’m done, she’s already cracking under the weight of everything she tried to protect me from. Within moments she’s sobbing on the floor. I carry her to her bed and get in beside her. I try not to listen too closely as she recounts every horrible moment, but I’m listening at the end, when she tells me she can’t do it anymore. When she confesses that she’s the one who stole my poison, and has only been waiting to take it because she didn’t have the stomach to do to me what Jordan did to us.

I tell her how we’ll make playgrounds of dead data centers and use hoses to fill the holes where skyscrapers were, and kids will play Marco Polo swimming over a CEO’s sunken office.

I leave her for just a moment, but by the time I lie back in bed beside her I’ve figured it out.

I tell her that she won’t have to take her shift tomorrow. I tell her I’m going to go around the city with my mister and my growth serum. That I’ll move plants from sewers to the yards around City Hall and every public space and the support pylons of important people’s companies, and then spray them so they become huge. The city will freak. I tell her it will be like the kittens, but this time we’ll all be pulled off our assignments to kill plants. And maybe the serum will work too well. Maybe the city was right to fear these plants, and they will grow and grow and eat our concrete while the roots crack our foundations and cut our electricity and everything will crumble. And the people with something to lose might suffer, but the rest of us will just laugh at the perfection of rubble. I tell her how we’ll make playgrounds of dead data centers and use hoses to fill the holes where skyscrapers were, and kids will play Marco Polo swimming over a CEO’s sunken office.

She asks if I’ll put any at our old detention center.

I talk long enough that her eyes close, and loud enough that neither of us can hear the sound of my mister blowing. The man who gave it to me was right. Even without the mask, it doesn’t smell like sulfur. It doesn’t smell like anything.

            <h2>Measles cases are rising. Other vaccine-preventable infections could be next.</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/20/1133365/measles-cases-rising-vaccine-preventable-infections-mumps-hepatitis-b/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There’s a measles outbreak happening close to where I live. Since the start of this year, 34 cases have been confirmed in Enfield, a northern borough of London. Most of those affected are children under the age of 11. One in five have needed hospital treatment.

It’s another worrying development for an incredibly contagious and potentially fatal disease. Since October last year, 962 cases of measles have been confirmed in South Carolina. Large outbreaks (with more than 50 confirmed cases) are underway in four US states. Smaller outbreaks are being reported in another 12 states.

The vast majority of these cases have been children who were not fully vaccinated. Vaccine hesitancy is thought to be a significant reason children are missing out on important vaccines—the World Health Organization described it as one of the 10 leading threats to global health in 2019. And if we’re seeing more measles cases now, we might expect to soon see more cases of other vaccine-preventable infections, including some that can cause liver cancer or meningitis.

Some people will always argue that measles is not a big deal—that infections used to be common, and most people survived them and did just fine. It is true that in most cases kids do recover well from the virus. But not always.

Measles symptoms tend to start with a fever and a runny nose. The telltale rash comes later. In some cases, severe complications develop. They can include pneumonia, blindness, and inflammation of the brain. Some people won’t develop complications until years later. In rare cases, the disease can be fatal.

Before the measles vaccine was introduced, in 1963, measles epidemics occurred every two to three years, according to the WHO. Back then, around 2.6 million people died from measles every year. Since it was introduced, the measles vaccine is thought to have prevented almost 59 million deaths.

But vaccination rates have been lagging, says Anne Zink, an emergency medicine physician and clinical fellow at the Yale School of Public Health. “We’ve seen a slow decline in people who are willing to get vaccinated against measles for some time,” she says. “As we get more and more people who are at risk because they’re unvaccinated, the higher the chances that the disease can then spread and take off.”

Vaccination rates need to be at 95% to prevent measles outbreaks. But rates are well below that level in some regions. Across South Carolina, the proportion of kindergartners who received both doses of the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles as well as mumps and rubella, has dropped steadily over the last five years, from 94% in 2020-2021 to 91% in 2024-2025. Some schools in the state have coverage rates as low as 20%, state epidemiologist Linda Bell told reporters last month.

Vaccination rates are low in London, too. Fewer than 70% of children have received both doses of their MMR by the time they turn five, according to the UK Health Security Agency. In some boroughs, vaccination rates are as low as 58%. So perhaps it’s not surprising we’re seeing outbreaks.

The UK is one of six countries to have lost their measles elimination status last month, along with Spain, Austria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Uzbekistan. Canada lost its elimination status last year.

The highly contagious measles could be a bellwether for other vaccine-preventable diseases. Zink is already seeing signs. She points to a case of polio that paralyzed a man in New York in 2022. That happened when rates of polio vaccination were low, she says. “Polio is a great example of … a disease that is primarily asymptomatic, and most people don’t have any symptoms whatsoever, but for the people who do get symptoms, it can be life-threatening.”

Then there’s mumps—another disease the MMR vaccine protects against. It’s another one of those infections that can be symptom-free and harmless in some, especially children, but nasty for others. It can cause a painful swelling of the testes, and other complications include brain swelling and deafness. (From my personal experience of being hospitalized with mumps, I can attest that even “mild” infections are pretty horrible.)

Mumps is less contagious than measles, so we might expect a delay between an uptick in measles cases and the spread of mumps, says Zink. But she says that she’s more concerned about hepatitis B.

“It lives on surfaces for a long period of time, and if you’re not vaccinated against it and you’re exposed to it as a kid, you’re at a really high risk of developing liver cancer and death,” she says.

Zink was formerly chief medical officer of Alaska, a state that in the 1970s had the world’s highest rate of childhood liver cancer caused by hepatitis B. Screening and universal newborn vaccination programs eliminated the virus’s spread.

Public health experts worry that the current US administration’s position on vaccines may contribute to the decline in vaccine uptake. Last month the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approved changes to childhood vaccination recommendations. The agency no longer recommends the hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns. The chair of the CDC’s vaccine advisory panel has also questioned broad vaccine recommendations for polio.

Even vitamin injections are being refused by parents, says Zink. A shot of vitamin K at birth can help prevent severe bleeding in some babies. But recent research suggests that parents of 5% of newborns are refusing it (up from 2.9% in 2017).

“I can’t tell you how many of my pediatric [doctor] friends have told me about having to care for a kiddo in the ICU with … bleeding into their brain because the kid didn’t get vitamin K at birth,” says Zink. “And that can kill kids, [or have] lifelong, devastating, stroke-like symptoms.”

All this paints a pretty bleak picture for children’s health. But things can change. Vaccination can still offer protection to plenty of people at risk of infection. South Carolina’s Department of Public Health is offering free MMR vaccinations to residents at mobile clinics.

“It’s easy to think ‘It’s not going to be me,’” says Zink. “Seeing kiddos who don’t have the agency to make decisions [about vaccination] being so sick from vaccine-preventable diseases, to me, is one of the most challenging things of practicing medicine.”

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/19/1133360/microsoft-has-a-new-plan-to-prove-whats-real-and-whats-ai-online/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI-enabled deception now permeates our online lives. There are the high-profile cases you may easily spot, like when White House officials recently shared a manipulated image of a protester in Minnesota and then mocked those asking about it. Other times, it slips quietly into social media feeds and racks up views, like the videos that Russian influence campaigns are currently spreading to discourage Ukrainians from enlisting.

It is into this mess that Microsoft has put forward a blueprint, shared with MIT Technology Review, for how to prove what’s real online.

An AI safety research team at the company recently evaluated how methods for documenting digital manipulation are faring against today’s most worrying AI developments, like interactive deepfakes and widely accessible hyperrealistic models. It then recommended technical standards that can be adopted by AI companies and social media platforms.

To understand the gold standard that Microsoft is pushing, imagine you have a Rembrandt painting and you are trying to document its authenticity. You might describe its provenance with a detailed manifest of where the painting came from and all the times it changed hands. You might apply a watermark that would be invisible to humans but readable by a machine. And you could digitally scan the painting and generate a mathematical signature, like a fingerprint, based on the brush strokes. If you showed the piece at a museum, a skeptical visitor could then examine these proofs to verify that it’s an original.

All of these methods are already being used to varying degrees in the effort to vet content online. Microsoft evaluated 60 different combinations of them, modeling how each setup would hold up under different failure scenarios—from metadata being stripped to content being slightly altered or deliberately manipulated. The team then mapped which combinations produce sound results that platforms can confidently show to people online, and which ones are so unreliable that they may cause more confusion than clarification.

The company’s chief scientific officer, Eric Horvitz, says the work was prompted by legislation—like California’s AI Transparency Act, which will take effect in August—and the speed at which AI has developed to combine video and voice with striking fidelity.

“You might call this self-regulation,” Horvitz told MIT Technology Review. But it’s clear he sees pursuing the work as boosting Microsoft’s image: “We’re also trying to be a selected, desired provider to people who want to know what’s going on in the world.”

Nevertheless, Horvitz declined to commit to Microsoft using its own recommendation across its platforms. The company sits at the center of a giant AI content ecosystem: It runs Copilot, which can generate images and text; it operates Azure, the cloud service through which customers can access OpenAI and other major AI models; it owns LinkedIn, one of the world’s largest professional platforms; and it holds a significant stake in OpenAI. But when asked about in-house implementation, Horvitz said in a statement, “Product groups and leaders across the company were involved in this study to inform product road maps and infrastructure, and our engineering teams are taking action on the report’s findings.”

It’s important to note that there are inherent limits to these tools; just as they would not tell you what your Rembrandt means, they are not built to determine if content is accurate or not. They only reveal if it has been manipulated. It’s a point that Horvitz says he has to make to lawmakers and others who are skeptical of Big Tech as an arbiter of fact.

“It’s not about making any decisions about what’s true and not true,” he said. “It’s about coming up with labels that just tell folks where stuff came from.”

Hany Farid, a professor at UC Berkeley who specializes in digital forensics but wasn’t involved in the Microsoft research, says that if the industry adopted the company’s blueprint, it would be meaningfully more difficult to deceive the public with manipulated content. Sophisticated individuals or governments can work to bypass such tools, he says, but the new standard could eliminate a significant portion of misleading material.

“I don’t think it solves the problem, but I think it takes a nice big chunk out of it,” he says.

Still, there are reasons to see Microsoft’s approach as an example of somewhat naïve techno-optimism. There is growing evidence that people are swayed by AI-generated content even when they know that it is false. And in a recent study of pro-Russian AI-generated videos about the war in Ukraine, comments pointing out that the videos were made with AI received far less engagement than comments treating them as genuine.

“Are there people who, no matter what you tell them, are going to believe what they believe?” Farid asks. “Yes.” But, he adds, “there are a vast majority of Americans and citizens around the world who I do think want to know the truth.”

That desire has not exactly led to urgent action from tech companies. Google started adding a watermark to content generated by its AI tools in 2023, which Farid says has been helpful in his investigations. Some platforms use C2PA, a provenance standard Microsoft helped launch in 2021. But the full suite of changes that Microsoft suggests, powerful as they are, might remain only suggestions if they threaten the business models of AI companies or social media platforms.

“If the Mark Zuckerbergs and the Elon Musks of the world think that putting ‘AI generated’ labels on something will reduce engagement, then of course they’re incentivized not to do it,” Farid says. Platforms like Meta and Google have already said they’d include labels for AI-generated content, but an audit conducted by Indicator last year found that only 30% of its test posts on Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, TikTok, and YouTube were correctly labeled as AI-generated.

More forceful moves toward content verification might come from the many pieces of AI regulation pending around the world. The European Union’s AI Act, as well as proposed rules in India and elsewhere, would all compel AI companies to require some form of disclosure that a piece of content was generated with AI.

One priority from Microsoft is, unsurprisingly, to play a role in shaping these rules. The company waged a lobbying effort during the drafting of California’s AI Transparency Act, which Horvitz said made the legislation’s requirements on how tech companies must disclose AI-generated content “a bit more realistic.”

But another is a very real concern about what could happen if the rollout of such content-verification technology is done poorly. Lawmakers are demanding tools that can verify what’s real, but the tools are fragile. If labeling systems are rushed out, inconsistently applied, or frequently wrong, people could come to distrust them altogether, and the entire effort would backfire. That’s why the researchers argue that it may be better in some cases to show nothing at all than a verdict that could be wrong.

Inadequate tools could also create new avenues for what the researchers call sociotechnical attacks. Imagine that someone takes a real image of a fraught political event and uses an AI tool to change only an inconsequential share of pixels in the image. When it spreads online, it could be misleadingly classified by platforms as AI-manipulated. But combining provenance and watermark tools would mean platforms could clarify that the content was only partially AI generated, and point out where the changes were made.

California’s AI Transparency Act will be the first major test of these tools in the US, but enforcement could be challenged by President Trump’s executive order from late last year seeking to curtail state AI regulations that are “burdensome” to the industry. The administration has also generally taken a posture against efforts to curb disinformation, and last year, via DOGE, it canceled grants related to misinformation. And, of course, official government channels in the Trump administration have shared content manipulated with AI (MIT Technology Review reported that the Department of Homeland Security, for example, uses video generators from Google and Adobe to make content it shares with the public).

I asked Horvitz whether fake content from this source worries him as much as that coming from the rest of social media. He initially declined to comment, but then he said, “Governments have not been outside the sectors that have been behind various kinds of manipulative disinformation, and this is worldwide.”

            <div id="article-text">A private premiere screening of “Holiguards Saga – The Portal of Force,” the pilot installment of the planned Holiguards Saga franchise, was held on February 16 at ASTOR Film Lounge Berlin.

The event took place in a closed format with invited industry guests, partners, and media representatives. The screening was organized as a formal black-tie occasion and took place in Berlin during the same period as the Berlin International Film Festival, when international filmmakers, producers, distributors, and investors traditionally gather in the city.

“Holiguards Saga – The Portal of Force” is an independently developed film project intended to launch a multi-installment franchise.

According to the producers, the project is structured as a long-term cinematic universe concept, with discussions currently underway regarding financing and production of subsequent chapters.

The film was directed by Kevin Spacey, who also portrays one of the central characters. This marks his first directorial work in approximately two decades. The ensemble cast includes Dolph Lundgren, Tyrese Gibson, Brianna Hildebrand, Disha Patani, Swen Temmel, Lado Okhotnikov, Harry Goodwins, and Sonia Pim Couling. Production was led by Elvira Paterson and Vadim Degtiarev.

Elledgy Media Group, under Paterson’s leadership, supported both the production coordination and the international promotion strategy for the project.

Set in the near future, “Holiguards Saga – The Portal of Force” presents a fictional universe in which two ancient ideological orders, the Holiguards and the Statiguards, engage in a covert struggle over humanity’s direction.

The Holiguards advocate personal freedom and individual agency, while the Statiguards promote systemic order and centralized control. The central narrative follows Jessica, portrayed by Disha Patani, the daughter of leaders representing opposing factions. Positioned between conflicting legacies, her decisions influence the balance of power surrounding a mysterious cosmic energy source known as the Portal of Force.

The pilot installment introduces the mythological framework of the saga and establishes the political and philosophical tensions intended to expand in future chapters.

Ahead of the Berlin premiere, the production team reported receiving formal inquiries from international sales agents, distribution representatives, and private investors regarding potential collaboration and participation in future installments. Previous joint appearances by Elvira Paterson and Kevin Spacey were accompanied by private screenings and gala dinners in Cannes and Venice.

Following the Berlin premiere, a series of additional private screenings is planned in select international markets. Further announcements concerning festival participation, distribution strategy, and release scheduling will be made separately. At this stage, no official worldwide theatrical or streaming release date has been confirmed.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/zurichs-rapidata-raises-e7-2m-to-build-a-real-time-human-feedback-network-for-ai">Visit Original Website</a>

            <div id="article-text">A growing number of startups are rushing to build software that thinks fast. But one of the hardest parts of teaching machines to improve isn’t raw computing power, it’s human insight at scale.

Zurich-based startup Rapidata has just taken a significant step toward fixing that with a €7.2 million seed round aimed at scaling a global network for human feedback, the essential ingredient for aligning and refining AI models.

The round was disclosed today by EU-Startups, positioning Rapidata as an early player in what could become a major layer of AI infrastructure: a system that compresses feedback loops from humans into AI training systems from weeks or months down to hours or days.

Modern AI systems have become astonishingly capable at generating text and images, but they still struggle with nuance, judgement and context, the very aspects humans excel at.

That’s why many advanced models are trained with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where people judge outputs and rate responses to shape the model’s behaviour.

Rapidata claims to change that by tapping a continuously available, worldwide network of real people, enabling AI teams to gather large volumes of high-quality human judgments far more quickly and flexibly than before.

Founded in 2023, Rapidata sits at the intersection of crowd intelligence and advanced machine learning infrastructure.

Instead of static pools of annotators or traditional data labeling services, Rapidata’s platform gives teams on-demand access to human insight everywhere. That means feedback isn’t limited by geography or segmentation, it scales with demand.

Rapidata’s mission also highlights a broader trend in AI infrastructure: investors and developers alike are beginning to treat human judgment as a core part of the stack, not just an afterthought.

As models become more capable, contextual human insight determines whether those capabilities are useful, safe, and aligned with real-world expectations.

With fresh capital in hand, Rapidata plans to accelerate growth of its human feedback network, onboarding more participants worldwide and improving integration with AI development workflows.

The company believes that the next major scarcity in AI won’t be compute, it will be high-quality human signal, and it wants to build the platform to serve it.

For an industry still figuring out how to scale both intelligence and alignment, a real-time feedback network could be a key piece of the puzzle, and Rapidata is positioning itself as one of the early builders of that future.

            <h2>Gartner $110M sale of Digital Markets division in latest SEC filing</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/gartner-110m-sale-of-digital-markets-division-in-latest-sec-filing">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Gartner first disclosed that it had agreed to part with its Digital Markets ( business unit that included its major software review, specifically Capterra, GetApp, and Software Advice) business in early 2026, the announcement was forward-looking and economical with detail: it named the buyer and the assets involved, but it left out any financial terms.

That lack of financial detail naturally made people wonder exactly how much the transaction was worth.

It was only later, in the company’s audited annual report on Form 10-K, filed on February 12, 2026, that a clearer picture of how the transaction was treated in the company’s regulatory filings became visible. That document, which is public, notes that the sale was completed on February 5, 2026, placing the divestiture within the broader contours of Gartner’s financial disclosures.

This most recent filing, accession number 0000749251-26-000112, stands in stark contrast with Gartner’s prior 10-K, covering the year ended December 31, 2024, and filed on February 13, 2025, under accession 0000749251-25-000008.

In that earlier report, there is no reference to this transaction or to any figure associated with it, consistent with the fact that the deal was not agreed or closed until 2026.

The January 29, 2026 announcement publicly identified G2 as the buyer, and specified the assets involved: Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp, but it did not disclose any financial terms, a detail that was equally absent from contemporaneous coverage.

In Gartner’s 10-K, the recorded consideration is described as being “before customary purchase price adjustments,” a phrase that signals the number reported in the filing is an initial headline value that may change once post-closing reconciliations tied to balance sheet items are completed.

These adjustments are common in sales agreements and are meant to align the agreed price with the business’s actual financial situation at closing.

A related 8-K filed on February 3, 2026, which included an earnings release, did not include any price details about the sale.

When we looked for the earliest relevant documents, we found that an earlier annual report,  Form 10-K filed on February 13, 2025 (accession 0000749251-25-000008), covers Gartner’s results through the end of 2024 and makes no reference to Digital Markets or the brands that were later sold.

That absence simply reflects the timing: the deal was agreed and completed in 2026, so it could not have been reported in a document covering the prior year.

Thus, the first SEC filing in which the transaction clearly appears is Gartner’s 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2025, filed on February 12, 2026, under accession 0000749251-26-000112.

It is in this later annual report that Gartner formally records the sale of the business and constitutes the first document in the public record to show how the company accounted for the transaction in its audited disclosures.

Reading the February 12, 2026, 10-K, the Digital Markets sale shows up in several sections. Early in the document, in the business overview, Gartner notes that the sale was completed on February 5, 2026, alongside the headline figure that appears in the record.

Later in the same report, in a section discussing recent developments, the company lays out the context around the divestiture, reporting that Digital Markets was classified as “held for sale” as of December 31, 2025, and listing the related assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.

The same description of the sale is repeated once more in a note on subsequent events, which walks through the timeline from signing to closing.

Notably, none of these references in the annual report names the buyer. Within the text of the 10-K, a search reveals that “G2” and the individual brands that were part of the business being sold do not appear, underscoring that Gartner’s disclosure is focused on the transaction as a financial event rather than on the identity of the counterparty.

When a company states that a sale price is described as being “before customary purchase price adjustments,” it means the number reported is only a starting point.

In most deals, the buyer and seller agree on an initial figure but include mechanisms in the contract that can revise that figure after closing to reflect the business’s actual financial position at transfer of control.

These post-closing adjustments are designed to ensure a fair final amount based on what the business truly delivered at closing, rather than on estimates made when the agreement was signed.

The most common of these adjustments is tied to working capital, the cash and short-term assets a business needs to operate. Parties negotiate a target level; if the actual working capital at closing is higher than expected, the seller may receive more. If it’s lower, the buyer may pay less.

Other adjustments can relate to net cash or debt, where the purchase price is recalculated based on the actual cash and debt assumed by the buyer, and to mechanisms such as escrows or deferred payments that hold portions of the sale price until certain conditions are resolved.

Because Gartner’s public filing does not include the underlying sale agreement or a detailed reconciliation of these adjustment mechanisms, the exact formulas or thresholds that could change the final amount are not visible in the public record.

What the 10-K does make clear is that the figure reported is a headline number, subject to later review and revision once the closing accounts are finalized.

In many deals, the headline price is agreed on a “cash-free, debt-free” basis, meaning that after closing, the buyer and seller adjust the purchase price to reflect the target business’s actual cash and debt position.

If the business ends up with more debt or less cash than expected, the effective price the seller receives can be reduced. Conversely, if it has more cash or less debt than anticipated, it can increase the amount paid.

In Gartner’s public disclosures, there is no way to tell from the 10-K whether the Digital Markets sale was structured this way or how any such adjustment would be calculated because the underlying agreement and detailed terms are not part of the filings.

What the 10-K does show is the initial figure; whether and how it changes through these common adjustment mechanisms remains outside the public record.

Gartner’s most recent Form 10-K, filed on February 12, 2026, shows that the company completed the sale of its Digital Markets business on February 5, 2026, using language that describes the consideration as “approximately $110.0 million, before customary purchase price adjustments.” This is the only financial figure tied to the deal that appears in the public filings.

The earlier public announcement from January 29, in which G2 said it had agreed to buy Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp from Gartner, did not include any financial terms, and subsequent media coverage similarly reported that price details were not disclosed at the time.

In filings, the phrase “purchase price adjustments” refers to standard mechanisms in sale agreements, often tied to working capital and other balance-sheet items, that can increase or decrease the final amount paid after closing.

Gartner’s 10-K does not name the buyer in the sale disclosure, but it confirms the closing date and the approximate consideration while noting that the figure could change through those adjustments.

Taken together, Gartner’s own regulatory filings tell a more complete story of the Digital Markets sale than the initial announcement did. The only financial detail available in the public record comes from the company’s 10-K, which notes the closing date and describes the consideration in broad terms, but it leaves several questions unanswered.

We also reached out to both sides for further comment and clarification ahead of publication, seeking confirmation of the figures, insight into the structure of the deal, and any context that might illuminate how the transaction was negotiated and reported.

By the time of publication, neither party had responded.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google’s announcement that its Gemini app now writes music for you isn’t just one of those “blowing my mind” product updates. It feels like a symbolic surrender to a long-standing refrain from Big Tech: creative work is now just another checkbox for a machine.

If you don’t know what I am talking about, yesterday Google launched a new feature, Lyria 3, in the Gemini app, that allows us to cook up 30-second tracks complete with lyrics and cover art from a text prompt or a photo, of course, generated by Nano Banana; basically, no instruments, no experience, no pesky tactile skill required.

It’s essentially a LEGO set for “songs” that lasts about as long as a TikTok loop. They say it’s designed for YouTube Creators, and I tend to agree with them, because you can’t make to much with 30 seconds.

Still, the underlying problem is another one, as I am seeing different projects/songs made with AI, including AI artists. And this is what I want to highlight in this piece.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

“Behind every beautiful thing, there’s some kind of pain, “ said Bob Dylan, and I could not agree more.

If we take a look at the history ( art, music, literature, poetry, and so on), the main fuel for creation was indeed pain.

Now, how should I put this? Probably the only pain that Lyria can feel is more like a faint server-overload alert than heartbreak.

Real songwriters know that soul isn’t born in a 30-second prompt, it’s extracted through years of mistakes, late nights, losses, and tiny revelations.

Call it a toy if you like. Google will, too.

They even watermark the outputs with a SynthID tag so the 30-second ditties are officially AI-generated, not “inspired.” That’s a nod to copyright concerns, but it also reads like an admission: these aren’t really art, they’re chemical by-products of pattern statistics.

What’s striking isn’t the novelty. Much of this has been possible in labs and APIs for years, and creators have been experimenting with generative music tools as collaborators.

What Lyria 3 does, and what makes this moment worth watching, is normalising the idea that anyone can “write” a song with a chatbot and a mood descriptor. That’s not empowerment; it’s a devaluation of craft.

Just because you pay a subscription to Suno, that’s another AI music generator, and that one is more complex, that doesn’t make you an artist or a singer. Just because you learn how to write a prompt for any LLM model and generates you pages, you are not a writer.

Imagine a world where every blog has AI-generated copy, not that we are not almost in the middle of this, and every company can churn out half-baked music for their ads or social posts.

In that economy, a professional songwriter’s unique skill becomes as optional as knowing how to use a metronome.

You could ask Gemini for an “emotional indie ballad about a lost sock,” and voilà, you have something. Whether it has actual coherence or soul is left to the listener to decide. It is fun to use it with your friends, shorts, to impress your date.

Video: Gemini Lyria Music Generation Feature – Socks, uploaded by Google on YouTube

Still, Lyria 3’s music is capped at 30 seconds, and that’s no accident. It sidesteps deeper legal and ethical quarrels about training data and mimicry of existing works by keeping outputs short and legally fuzzy. That’s a thumbs up from me.

But even within that limit, it’s now possible for someone with no craft or cultural context to generate riffs, lyrics, and chord progressions that sound, to the casual ear, adequately musical. In an attention economy obsessed with shareability, “adequate” quickly becomes plenty.

This matters because real songs, the ones that endure, that carry human experience, aren’t just collections of musical atoms. They’re shaped by story, risk, cultural memory, and sometimes contradiction.

One of my favorite artists, Tom Waits, said, ”I don’t have a formal background. I learned from listening to records, from talking to people, from hanging around record stores, and hanging around musicians and saying, “Hey, how did you do that? Do that again. Let me see how you did that.”

This was the research and prompting before, and it’s not only about reducing time, or getting things faster, and “having more time for you.”

It’s about the entire process, the contact with other artists, humans, and IDEAS.

Those are qualities machines can mimic but not originate. When the machines own the first pass at creation, and the commercial ecosystem embraces that output because it is cheap and fast, the incentives shift. Not gradually. Suddenly.

The record industry is already grappling with AI. Streaming services, publishers, and even labels have begun experimenting with algorithmic playlists and automated composition.

What Gemini’s Lyria 3 does is extend that experiment to public perception. A whole generation may come to think that “making music” means typing a description and choosing a style. Songwriting becomes a UX problem, not a craft one.

That raises a serious question: in a world where AI can conjure up a half-decent hook on demand, what will distinguish professional artists?

If the answer is only brand story or marketing muscle, we aren’t celebrating creativity; we are monetising it out of existence.

Tech companies like Google will frame this as liberation. And in a literal sense, anyone who’s ever wanted to hear a short tune about a sock’s existential crisis now can. But liberation without value for the creator is just consumerism by another name.

Lyria 3 might be good for GIF soundtracks and social clips, and TikTok viral reels, but it doesn’t make professional musicians obsolete; it makes their work less necessary to the platforms that reward hyper-consumable content.

That’s a different threat from outright replacement: it’s obsolescence by trivialisation.

If AI is going to be part of musical creation, then let it be as an assistant to the composer,  someone who improves ideas, not replaces them. What we’re seeing with Gemini is not collaboration but outsourcing.

And the lesson for artists isn’t to fear the algorithm. It’s to insist on clarity about where AI replaces labour and where it augments human sensibility.

Because once the marketplace equates the two, the humans who do the work will be the ones left asking for royalties in a language no one else wants to speak.

And, as a personal recommendation, not sponsored, there are streaming platforms like Deezer that have built AI detection tools that flag and label AI-generated tracks, excluding them from recommendations and royalties so that human songwriters aren’t buried under synthetic spam, and consumers can make the difference between AI and human.

If you care about preserving real artistry in a world of text-to-tune generative models, start paying attention to how platforms handle AI-tagging and choose services that give you transparency about what you’re actually listening to.

Yet, I’m not here to throw shade at Lyria 3; if anything, the idea of letting people turn a photo or a mood into a short track sounds like fun for casual use and creative experimentation. It is what Google says it’s meant for.

Yet the reality is that as these models proliferate, we risk confusing novelty with art. And here, the big tech companies are not the ones to blame, but us.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Plato, a Berlin-based startup, has raised $14.5 million in seed funding to bring generative AI into wholesale distribution, a massive industry that rarely makes tech headlines but quietly moves a significant share of the world’s goods.

The round was led by Atomico, with Cherry Ventures, Discovery Ventures, and D11Z joining in.

Wholesale distribution accounts for roughly one-fifth of global production flows. Yet much of it still runs on aging ERP systems, Excel spreadsheets, and manual quoting workflows that haven’t meaningfully evolved in years.

While AI has flooded marketing, customer support, and coding, distribution sales teams are often still copy-pasting numbers between systems.

Plato’s thesis is simple: instead of adding another dashboard, embed AI directly into the operational core. The company connects to existing ERP systems and turns historical sales data into automated actions, flagging revenue opportunities, generating quotes, and identifying risks before they surface in quarterly reports.

The idea grew out of lived frustration. Co-founder Benedikt Nolte experienced the inefficiencies firsthand in his family’s distribution business. Generic CRM tools, he concluded, weren’t designed for the complexity of distributor operations. Plato was built specifically for that environment, not retrofitted from SaaS templates designed for startups.

Early traction suggests the industry is paying attention. Plato reportedly works with several large distributors on six-figure contracts, a sign that AI adoption in traditional sectors is less about hype and more about whether it can save time and unlock revenue.

The fresh capital will help Plato expand beyond sales intelligence into areas like procurement and customer service automation, while pushing into new European markets and eventually the U.S.

More broadly, the round highlights a shift in AI investing. The next wave isn’t just about bigger language models; it’s about embedding intelligence into industries that haven’t been rewritten by software yet. Wholesale distribution may not be glamorous, but it is structurally essential. If AI can modernize that layer of the economy, the impact will be far larger than another chatbot demo.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">David Silver, a British AI researcher known for his role at Google’s DeepMind lab, has helped build some of the most influential AI systems and is now leading his own ambitious start-up. He is in the middle of raising a $1 billion seed round for his new London-based venture, Ineffable Intelligence.

If the fundraising will be completed, would be the largest seed round ever seen in Europe.

The round is being led by Sequoia Capital, with titans such as Nvidia, Google and Microsoft reportedly in talks to participate, according to industry sources familiar with the deal.

The proposed investment would place Ineffable Intelligence’s pre-money valuation at around $4 billion, an eye-watering figure for a company that hasn’t yet shipped a product.

David Silver’s name is synonymous with some of the most memorable milestones in AI. During more than a decade at Google DeepMind, he helped develop AlphaGo, the first AI to defeat a world champion at the ancient game of Go, and later AlphaStar, which bested professional players in StarCraft II.

His work has shaped how modern AI systems learn and make decisions.

In late 2025, David Silver left DeepMind, where he also contributed to the development of the Gemini family of large language models, to launch Ineffable Intelligence. .

In the current days billion-dollar seed rounds are no longer unheard of, but they remain exceptionally rare, especially in Europe.

If Sequoia and its partners follow through on their commitments, the round would serve as both a vote of confidence in David Silver’s vision and a broader signal that venture capitalists are increasingly willing to fund ambitious, research-driven AI ventures well before traditional product milestone

The sheer size of the potential round also reshapes the narrative around Europe’s role in the global AI race.

Historically, most of the industry’s capital and rich technical talent have gravitated to Silicon Valley and other U.S. hubs. A £737 million-plus round led by a top U.S. investor shows that world-class AI ideas can still attract world-class capital in Europe.

David Silver’s dual role – as an entrepreneur and as a professor at University College London,  hints at a blend of academic ambition and commercial pressure that may define the next era of AI innovation.

His thesis suggests that the path to genuinely powerful AI may not be simply scaling up models, but teaching systems to learn and improve through real-world experience, a direction he believes could outpace approaches grounded solely in data accumulated from human interactions.

Whether Ineffable Intelligence ultimately delivers on its lofty vision remains to be seen.

But the enthusiasm around its fundraising reflects a broader trend: AI is entering a phase where conviction in founders and ideas can translate directly into unprecedented capital flows.

For Europe, a successful $1 billion cap table would be a milestone moment, not just financially, but symbolically,  in positioning the continent as a contender for the future of AI research and deployment.
