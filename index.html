            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/how-europes-new-carbon-tax-on-imported-goods-will-change-global-trade/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For people living in the European Union, the price of their next car, home renovation, and even local produce may soon reflect a climate policy that many have never even heard of. This new regulation, which comes fully into force on New Year’s Day, does not just target heavy industry—it affects everyday goods which now face an added carbon cost when they enter Europe.

The carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) puts a carbon price on many imported goods—meaning that EU-based importers will pay for the greenhouse gases emitted during the production of certain carbon-intensive materials.

If goods come from countries with weaker climate rules, then the charge will be higher. To sell to the EU, producers will effectively need to show their goods aren’t too carbon-intensive.

The goal is to prevent companies from relocating their production to places with looser regulations, ensuring fair competition between EU and non-EU companies, while incentivising global decarbonisation.

After a trial phase, full payment obligations begin on January 1 2026, when importers will need to buy CBAM certificates to cover the embedded emissions in goods such as iron and steel, aluminium, cement, fertilisers, hydrogen and (eventually) electricity.

Although it is an EU climate policy, CBAM looks set to be a game-changer for global trade. Countries that rely on EU exports may need to make costly investments in cleaner technologies and better emissions tracking, or risk losing market share. The UK government plans to introduce its own version of CBAM in 2027—although how this links to the EU’s is yet to be decided.

A positive shift is already underway: more and more companies are now measuring and reporting their emissions accurately, responding to the growing demand for reliable carbon data. At the same time, an increasing number of countries are introducing their own carbon pricing systems to stay aligned with the EU and protect the competitiveness of their exports.

Morocco is a prominent example: its 2025 finance law gradually introduces a carbon tax from January 2026. As Moroccan firms will already pay a carbon price domestically, their exports are likely to avoid additional CBAM charges at the EU border, helping them remain competitive.

In many countries, CBAM is also accelerating interest in renewable energy and greener industrial processes. Some see it not as a threat, but an opportunity to attract investment and position themselves as low-carbon manufacturing hubs.

However, this mechanism is still controversial. For businesses, CBAM is complex and administratively heavy. Firms need robust systems to measure embedded emissions, collect data from suppliers, and produce environmental product declarations. Many will also need new renewable energy contracts to cut their carbon footprint.

Around the world, CBAM has faced strong criticism. India and China describe it as “green protectionism,” arguing that it puts unfair pressure on developing economies. At the same time, the EU has not yet created dedicated funding to help exporters in lower-income countries adapt. Without this support, the mechanism may not achieve the desired results.

Although CBAM is mainly aimed at industry, its ripple effects will reach consumers in the EU. Importers are unlikely to absorb the full additional cost, meaning prices are likely to rise—particularly for goods that rely heavily on steel, aluminium, or cement. This could mean Europe sees higher costs for cars, home appliances, electronics, building materials, and, indirectly, food production (through fertilizers).

At the same time, CBAM may bring more transparency. Because importers must report the emissions embedded in their goods, consumers may eventually have clearer information about the climate impact of what they buy.

The mechanism will also generate EU revenues from certificate sales. These are expected to support vulnerable households in many European countries, as well as funding clean technologies and improving energy efficiency. How the funds are used will be crucial to public acceptance of Europe’s new carbon tax.

Even before full implementation, CBAM is already reshaping supply chains and influencing government policies far beyond Europe’s borders. It may trigger trade disputes, push exporters to adopt carbon pricing, and highlight the need for more climate finance to support developing countries undergoing green industrial transitions.

For many European consumers, it’s likely to mean gradual price increases—and potentially, more climate-conscious purchasing decisions. Behind the scenes, it marks a significant shift in how global trade accounts for carbon—and how climate policy reaches into people’s everyday lives.

            <h2>Google lobs lawsuit at search result scraping firm SerpApi</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/12/google-lobs-lawsuit-at-search-result-scraping-firm-serpapi/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google has filed a lawsuit to protect its search results, targeting a firm called SerpApi that has turned Google’s 10 blue links into a business. According to Google, SerpApi ignores established law and Google’s terms to scrape and resell its search engine results pages (SERPs). This is not the first action against SerpApi, but Google’s decision to go after a scraper could signal a new, more aggressive stance on protecting its search data.

SerpApi and similar firms do fulfill a need, but they sit in a legal gray area. Google does not provide an API for its search results, which are based on the world’s largest and most comprehensive web index. That makes Google’s SERPs especially valuable in the age of AI. A chatbot can’t summarize web links if it can’t find them, which has led companies like Perplexity to pay for SerpApi’s second-hand Google data. That prompted Reddit to file a lawsuit against SerpApi and Perplexity for grabbing its data from Google results.

Google is echoing many of the things Reddit said when it publicized its lawsuit earlier this year. The search giant claims it’s not just doing this to protect itself—it’s also about protecting the websites it indexes. In Google’s blog post on the legal action, it says SerpApi “violates the choices of websites and rightsholders about who should have access to their content.”

It’s worth noting that Google has a partnership with Reddit that pipes data directly into Gemini. As a result, you’ll often see Reddit pages cited in the chatbot’s outputs. As Google points out, it abides by “industry-standard crawling protocols” to collect the data that appears on its SERPs, but those sites didn’t agree to let SerpApi scrape their data from Google. So while you could reasonably argue that Google’s lawsuit helps protect the rights of web publishers, it also explicitly protects Google’s business interests.

The kind of data scraping that SerpApi uses is not new—Google has simply put up with it until now. However, the company claims that SerpApi’s deceptive behavior, like spoofing user agents and hammering sites with armies of bots, has increased significantly over the past year. That may have something to do with the ever-growing hunger for search data in the AI era.

Google is coming out of its antitrust cases relatively unscathed so far, which affects the availability of its data. It has avoided the harshest remedies, like the government’s demand that Google offer search data to competitors. That might have turned businesses like SerpApi legit, but with that no longer an option, Google may feel emboldened to unleash the lawyers.

While Google paints this as a benevolent action, it stands to benefit by stopping SERP scrapers. However, this may make some of Google’s competitors happy, too. Since the search giant doesn’t offer an official API for search (and the courts declined to force the issue), SERP scraping provides a way for companies to get Google’s search data on the down-low. This reduces demand for the handful of other web indexes that do have APIs, including Brave and Bing. Without illicit search APIs, chatbots may have to lean on official data sources.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The trade-off between quality and quantity is a fundamental economic dilemma. Now, a team of British, American, and Japanese researchers describes how it applies to biology, as well. They have discovered that this dilemma most likely shaped the evolutionary trajectory of ants, one of Earth’s most successful groups of organisms.

Their study reveals that, as ant societies grew in complexity and numbers, they didn’t just make their workers smaller—they also made them cheaper.

In the insect world, the exoskeleton known as the cuticle serves as a protective barrier against predators, pathogens, and desiccation, while providing the structural framework for muscle attachment. But this protection comes at a price. Building a robust cuticle requires significant amounts of nitrogen and rare minerals like zinc and manganese. While skimping on armor for an individual insect may be a death sentence, the evolution of ants apparently found a way around it.

“There’s this question in biology of what happens to individuals as societies they are in get more complex?” said Evan Economo, an entomologist at the University of Maryland and co-author of the study. “For example, the individuals may themselves become simpler because tasks that a solitary organism would need to complete can be handled by a collective.”

Economo’s team hypothesized that the metabolic balance behind investing in cuticles in social insects like ants could favor the collective over the individual. The idea was that a colony of 10,000 workers could lose a few individuals to a predator without much consequence, so investing heavily in each worker’s defenses would seem like a waste of precious nutrients. To test this hypothesis, they examined whether ant lineages that maintain massive, specialized workforces reduce the investment in their individual workers’ exoskeletons.

To test this idea, the researchers needed to pull off a comparative study on the anatomy of ants at an unprecedented scale. “We worked with scans of ant specimens and species from all over the world to capture the global diversity of ants,” Economo says. The team used a massive database called Antscan, which contains three-dimensional X-ray microtomography imaging of ants from around the globe.

Microtomography works similarly to medical CT scans, but at a vastly higher resolution. Still, on its own, the technique could only generate lots of precise data—it still had to be interpreted. Parsing through 3D imagery of over 880 specimens, including workers, queens, and males belonging to over 500 different species, was another challenge. “The 3D scanning itself is a very advanced technology,” says Arthur Matte, a researcher at the University of Cambridge and lead author of the study. “But once you have the ants in three dimensions, it’s still very hard to segment manually every tissue you’re interested in.”

To solve this, Matte developed a computer vision algorithm for “unsupervised segmentation.” Because the cuticle is always the outermost tissue of an arthropod, the algorithm could automatically identify and measure the volume of the exoskeleton across all ants in the dataset.

The first thing scientists noticed when the results poured in was that cuticle investment varied wildly, ranging from 6 percent to 35 percent of an ant’s total body volume. So, the next thing they focused on was figuring out the reasons behind these variations.

The team started checking how factors like diet, temperature, humidity, and foraging style correlated with the size of the cuticle. To get a handle on this, segmented 3D scans were fed into evolutionary models. “One of the most insightful things we did was to individually remove such variables from the models to estimate their contributions to the final cuticle investment,” Matte explains. This way, scientists learned that temperature was responsible for just 12 percent of variation in cuticle size and diet—especially its nitrogen content—explained another 37 percent. But the factor that had the strongest impact on the model was the colony size.

Ants that invested less in their cuticle tended to have significantly larger colony sizes. More surprisingly, this reduction in cuticle investment and the resulting increase in colony size appeared to be associated with higher diversification rates. In biological terms, squishier ants could evolve to occupy new niches much faster than their heavily armored cousins. “Requiring less nitrogen could make these ants more versatile and able to conquer new environments,” Matte suggests. This efficiency may have allowed ants to transition from a diet of high-protein prey to more abundant but less nutritious liquid sugar sources, like honeydew or floral nectar.

“Ants reduce per-worker investment in one of the most nutritionally expensive tissues for the good of the collective,” Matte explains. “They’re shifting from self-investment toward a distributed workforce.”

The researchers think the pattern they observed in ants reflects a more universal trend in the evolution of societal complexity. The transition from solitary life to complex societies echoes the transition from single-celled organisms to multicellular ones.

In a single-celled organism, a cell must be a “jack-of-all-trades,” performing every function necessary for survival. In a multicellular animal, however, individual cells often become simpler and more specialized, relying on the collective for protection and resources.

“It’s a pattern that echoes the evolution of multicellularity, where cooperative units can be individually simpler than a solitary cell, yet collectively capable of far greater complexity,” says Matte. Still, the question of whether underinvesting in individuals to boost the collective makes sense for creatures other than ants remains open, and it most likely isn’t as much about nutritional economics as it is about sex.

The study focused on ants that already have a reproductive division of labor, one where workers do not reproduce. This social structure is likely the key prerequisite for the cheap worker strategy. For the team, this is the reason we haven’t, at least so far, found similar evolutionary patterns in more complex social organisms like wolves, which live in packs—or humans with their amazingly complex societies. Wolves and people are both social, but maintain a high degree of individual self-interest regarding reproduction. Ant workers could be made expendable because they don’t pass their own genes—they are essentially extensions of the queen’s reproductive strategy.

Before looking for signs of ant-like approaches to quality versus quantity dilemmas in other species, the team wants to take an even closer look at ants. Economo, Matte, and their colleagues seek to expand their analysis to other ant tissues, such as the nervous system and muscles, to see if the cheapening of individuals extends beyond the exoskeleton. They are also looking at ant genomes to see what genetic innovations allowed for the shift from quality to quantity.  “We still need a lot of work to understand ants’ evolution,” Matte says.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Even before the Department of Justice’s release of a major collection of files pertaining to late billionaire sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein, lawmakers were concerned they would be heavily censored.

On Friday, the department launched an entire webpage that included hundreds of thousands of long-awaited records from its investigation into the deceased financier.

As expected, many of the documents have been heavily redacted, giving little insight into Epstein’s horrifying operation or the many big names — including numerous former presidents and celebrities, as well as a laundry list over other wealthy and powerful figures — who were connected to him.

And adding to the sense that the government doesn’t have the interests of transparency in mind, at least 16 photos have mysteriously disappeared from the archive after its initial release, as the Associated Press reports, including an image that showed president Donald Trump — a revelation that will likely throw gasoline on an already brightly burning political fiasco.

While it remains unclear why the files were being deleted, the news has already sparked major outcry, with some accusing the Trump administration’s Justice Department of trying to protect Trump, who was once close friends with Epstein.

“What else is being covered up?” the official account of the Democrats’ Oversight Committee tweeted in response to the latest news. “We need transparency for the American public.”

The image, appended to the tweet, shows framed photographs on what appears to be a desk. One photo in the bottom left, inside an open drawer, appears to show Trump’s face. (Trump has been photographed alongside Epstein on several occasions.)

By Sunday afternoon, the image was added to the files once again. Deputy attorney general Todd Blanche claimed that the image was taken down over concerns that it contained the images of victims, telling NBC News “absolutely, positively not,” when asked if any material was redacted due to political sensitivities.

“After the review, it was determined there is no evidence that any Epstein victims are depicted in the photograph, and it has been reposted without any alteration or redaction,” the Justice Department said in a Sunday afternoon statement.

The Justice Department has yet to offer an explanation why the other missing images were removed. A spokesman did not respond to the New York Times‘ request for comment.

For now, Democratic lawmakers are bound to continue putting on the pressure.

“It’s all about covering up things that, for whatever reason, Donald Trump doesn’t want to go public, either about himself (or) other members of his family, friends,” Congressman Jamie Raskin (D-MA) told CNN.

“They’re flouting the spirit and the letter of the law,” Congressman Thomas Massie (R-WV) told CBS News. “It’s very troubling the posture that they’ve taken. And I won’t be satisfied until the survivors are satisfied.”

Despite Trump’s name coming up in a number of Epstein’s emails that were released by the House Oversight Committee last month, a simple search for “Trump” flagged “no results” when the Justice Department’s new website was first launched.

The department has since promised on X that “photos and other materials will continue being reviewed and redacted consistent with the law in an abundance of caution as we receive additional information.”

Searching for the president’s name now brings up 625 results as of late Sunday.

Trump, who has long openly raged against ongoing investigations into his relationship with Epstein, previously calling it a “witch hunt,” has been strikingly quiet on the subject since Friday’s release and has yet to comment on the matter.

The president is known to have been close with Epstein as recently as the early 2000s, though he’s said they later had a falling out.

Trump has also said that Epstein “likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side,” in an extremely eyebrow-raising 2002 quote. And in 2011, after his initial conviction for sex crimes, Epstein cryptically referred to the future president as the “dog that didn’t bark” in an email message that was later released.

            <h2>Home Depot Deploys Havana-Style Sonic Weapon Against Day Laborers</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">While federal agents working for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) are running up on migrant workers in Home Depot parking lots, the home improvement corporation has decided to take a stand — against the migrant workers.

Reporting by The Guardian reveals a cruel new initiative being rolled out to one high-traffic Home Depot location in Los Angeles’ Cypress Park: high-pitched noise machines meant to shoo away day laborers.

The Intituto de Educacion Popular del Sur de California (Idepsca), an advocacy group for migrant workers, is calling for the removal of three sonic devices they say are causing migrant workers to suffer headaches and nausea.

In some areas, it’s common for day laborers to congregate outside home improvement stores like Home Depot, where they can find new gigs, catch rides to job sites, and quickly buy new equipment or material. It’s all part of the informal gig economy, a system which exploits poor and working class people for cheap labor.

Home Depot’s sound devices, advocates say, are punishing these folks at the bottom of the ladder.

“They chose to weaponize sound,” Los Angeles city councilwoman Eunisses Hernandes said at a conference. “Devices like these are used as torture against our people.”

One worker described to The Guardian how he has to wear ear plugs to block the excruciating noise, saying it “penetrates your bones.”

Hernandez also said that the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) has begun using the devices on its property.

“This is the people’s land,” she said. “This is Caltrans land that is owned by Californians who pay taxes. The people’s land is being used to torture the people.”

The noise machine evokes tales of a mythic weapon supposedly responsible for the ailment known as “Havana syndrome,” which specifically seems to effect US intelligence officers stationed in Havana, Cuba.

No direct evidence of Cuba’s supposed sonic weapon has ever surfaced, though the Home Depot ear blasters do have another precedent: riot control weapons. In situations like the Ferguson uprising of 2014 or the Dakota Access Pipeline protest of 2016, police have deployed “sound cannons,” mobile arrays capable of incapacitating people with high-amplitude noise.

In other words, the same tactic has been refined from a tool of police control to a mechanism to protect corporate property. In both cases, sound is deployed as a weapon to repel unwanted people from a space, closing any chance for a dialogue.

The timing of the Home Depot deployment is significant, coming on the heels of a high number of brutal ICE raids in which Latino-looking workers are rounded up at random, stuffed into cars, and brought to deportation centers.

So far, Home Depot has been silent about the raids happening on its property. But given the chaos these agents cause, it’s not out of the realm of possibility that Home Depot is trying to wash its hands of the whole thing — “you don’t have to go home but you can’t stay here.”

WATCH: ICE agents jumped out of a rental truck and arrested 16 people outside of a Home Depot in Los Angeles as a part of what CBP calls “Operation Trojan Horse.” In a statement, Penske, the rental truck company ICE agents used during this raid, said the company was not made aware of the operation. #immigration #ice #la #losangeles

Asked for comment on the sonic warfare, Home Depot told The Guardian that the machines are a “safety initiative… intended to deter and prevent illegal overnight parking in the area,” with no connection to any “immigration enforcement.”

            <h2>James Webb Discovers Planet Shaped Like Lemon</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-21</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope have discovered an astonishing exoplanet that’s stretching our understanding of what’s possible for these distant worlds. And when we say say “stretch,” we mean it literally.

The roughly Jupiter-mass object, designated PSR J2322-2650b, orbits just one million miles away from its star, or one percent of the Earth’s distance from the Sun, with a single “year” lasting just 7.8 Earth hours. And at such proximity, the extreme gravity of the star — an exotic type known as a pulsar — pulls the entire planet into an oblong shape, like a lemon or a football.

The findings, published in a new study in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, are so unusual that the astronomers are having to consider if they represent an entirely new class of cosmic object.

“It’s the stretchiest planet that we’ve confirmed the stretchiness of,“ lead author Michael Zhang, an exoplanet scientist at the University of Chicago, told the New York Times.

The planet’s sun is a type of rapidly spinning neutron star. These are the almost impossibly dense stellar cores that are left over in the aftermath of a supernova, containing mass equal to our entire Sun in a package the size of a human city. (The resulting gravity is so extreme that if you could scoop just a tiny teaspoon of one of these objects without being instantly crushed into a soup of pure neutrons, which is what neutron stars are, it’d weigh trillions of pounds.)

Some of these neutron stars spin, becoming pulsars, and emit a sweeping beam of energy along its poles like a lighthouse, appearing to telescopes as a repeating signal.But since it emits mostly in gamma rays, it also means its light is invisible to telescopes like the James Webb, which see in infrared wavelengths. This provides a perfect opportunity to study an exoplanet, which are often outshined by the light of their star.

“This system is unique because we are able to view the planet illuminated by its host star, but not see the host star at all,” coauthor Maya Beleznay, a physicist at Stanford University, said in a NASA statement. “So we get a really pristine spectrum. And we can study this system in more detail than normal exoplanets.”

Their observations revealed that just as unusual as the planet’s lemon shape is the composition of its atmosphere. With surface temperatures up to 3,700 degrees Fahrenheit —which is four times hotter than Venus, the hottest world in the solar system — it’s almost entirely dominated by helium and carbon, something that’s never been seen before on any planet. That’s because molecular carbon easily binds with other elements commonly found on planets and especially gas giants, such as oxygen and nitrogen, suggesting that these elements must not be present.

With a weird composition comes deeply peculiar weather. The astronomers speculate that clouds of carbon soot float through the air. Near the core of the planet, these clouds can condense into shards of solid diamond.

As it stands, everything about PSR J2322-2650b is an enigma. Few pulsars are known to have a planet, let alone one that’s shaped like a lemon, has graphite for clouds, and lacks the elements detected on other worlds.

One possibility is that this configuration is actually a type of star system known as a black widow binary, in which the pulsar slowly siphons material from a smaller stellar object in its orbit, sucking the life out of it until it’s devoured completely.

But this has only been observed between a pulsar and another star, not a planet. That raises the possibility that the exoplanet is actually some kind of stellar remnant that’s already been whittled away at for eons. “It would have lost 99.9 percent of its mass, and we just happened to catch it right at the very end,” coauthor Peter Gao of the Carnegie Earth and Planets Laboratory in Washington told the NYT.

The more exciting alternative is that we’re witnessing an “entirely new type of object that we don’t have a name for,” Zhang suggested to the paper.

“Did this thing form like a normal planet? No, because the composition is entirely different. Did it form by stripping the outside of a star, like ‘normal’ black widow systems are formed? Probably not, because nuclear physics does not make pure carbon,” Zhang elaborated, via NASA. “It’s very hard to imagine how you get this extremely carbon-enriched composition. It seems to rule out every known formation mechanism.”

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/22/tiktok-shop-launches-digital-gift-cards-to-challenge-amazon-and-ebay/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">TikTok Shop has rolled out a new feature that allows users to purchase digital gift cards, making it easier to help friends and family buy from the millions of products on the app.

​The feature was strategically launched during the holiday season — a high-stakes period for the company’s shopping division as it aims to prove its value in the market. ​This move into digital gifting positions TikTok Shop to compete more directly with e-commerce giants like Amazon and eBay, both of which offer gift card options. TikTok Shop has also recently expanded into luxury retail, another move to solidify its footing in e-commerce.

Users can load the gift cards with anything from $10 to $500. What sets these cards apart is the ability to personalize them using a wide variety of animated designs. There are also animations for thank you cards, birthdays, weddings, and other occasions.

Gift cards are delivered via email, and recipients must have a TikTok account. Once redeemed, the card’s value is instantly credited to their TikTok Balance. Recipients can reply with a thank-you note or even send a gift card in return.

However, the gift cards can only be purchased in the U.S. for now.

TikTok said it plans to add features that let users personalize gift cards more. By early 2026, users will be able to record or upload video messages to attach to their digital gift cards. A company spokesperson said the experience will also include an “interactive unboxing that captures their reaction in real-time,” but declined to share further details.

The launch of digital gift cards comes on the heels of a significant milestone for TikTok Shop: Over the four days of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the app recorded sales of more than $500 million in the U.S.

However, despite this achievement, TikTok Shop faces uncertainty as the sale of the app’s U.S. operations to an American investor group looms. If a sale doesn’t occur, TikTok faces a potential ban in the country. President Trump has extended the deadline to January 23, 2026, leaving the app’s future in the U.S. hanging in the balance.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/21/waymo-suspends-service-in-san-francisco-as-robotaxis-stall-during-blackout/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Waymo suspended its robotaxi service in San Francisco on Saturday evening after a massive blackout appeared to leave many of its vehicles stalled on city streets.

Numerous photos and videos posted to social media captured Waymo robotaxis stalled at roads and intersections as human drivers were either stuck behind them or weaved around them.

Waymo said on Saturday that it had temporarily suspended service in the city due to the blackout. It wasn’t until late Sunday afternoon that Waymo spokesperson told TechCrunch in a statement that the company was resuming service.

“Yesterday’s power outage was a widespread event that caused gridlock across San Francisco, with non-functioning traffic signals and transit disruptions,” the spokesperson said. “While the failure of the utility infrastructure was significant, we are committed to ensuring our technology adjusts to traffic flow during such events.”

The Waymo spokesperson added that the company is “focused on rapidly integrating the lessons learned from this event, and are committed to earning and maintaining the trust of the communities we serve every day.”

The blackout also took down many of the city’s traffic lights and affected Muni mass transit, with San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie warning residents to stay off the roads unless they needed to travel.

Waymo said that although its self-driving systems are designed to treat non-functioning traffic lights as four-way stops, the scale of Saturday’s blackout caused some robotaxis to remain stationary for longer than normal as they tried to assess the intersections. The company also said that the majority of active trips were completed successfully.

The blackout appears to have been caused by a fire at a Pacific Gas & Electric substation in the city. SFGate reports that around 120,000 PG&E customers were affected by the blackout, and while the majority of them had power restored by late Saturday, 35,000 customers were still without power on Sunday morning. PG&E’s website also showed thousands of San Francisco customers still affected at that time.

A letter from Tiger Global Management that leaked earlier this month said Waymo is now providing 450,000 robotaxi rides per week, nearly double the amount that the Alphabet-owned company disclosed in the spring.

This post has been updated with Waymo’s statement that service is resuming.

            <div id="article-text">In just about a week, iRobot, Luminar, and Rad Power Bikes all filed for bankruptcy.

They’re very different companies — selling Roombas, lidar, and e-bikes, respectively — but as Sean O’Kane, Rebecca Bellan, and I discussed on the episode of the Equity podcast, they faced some similar challenges, including tariff pressures, major deals that fell through, and a failure to establish themselves beyond the products that first made them successful.

You can read an edited preview of our conversation below, with Sean providing an overview of each filing, Rebecca weighing in on whether she has a Roomba, and me speculating about what the popular narratives about these bankruptcies leave out.

Sean: Rad Power is big for an e-bike company, but small, I think, in most people’s minds, since that’s still a bit of a niche. They were founded a long time ago and became popular even before the pandemic, and really were thought of as an industry leader, as far as quality of the bikes that they’re making, pretty good branding and marketing and trying to connect with with customers — which is really hard to find in the world of e-bikes, where most of them are just like alphabet soup companies on Amazon.

They rode that wave in the pandemic up high as micromobility really took off, and people were really rethinking how they were getting around, they weren’t commuting into the office as much. And we get glimpses of that in the bankruptcy filings. It only shows revenue back three years, but they were pulling in well over $100 million in revenue in 2023 — like $123 million, I think that fell to about $100 [million] last year, and through the bankruptcy this year, they were only at about $63 million, so they were clearly coming down off a pretty big high. They have a pretty diverse product lineup, but they just never really found a way to establish a foothold there.

And I think you could say similar things about these other two companies. Luminar is another company that was founded in the early 2010s, came out of stealth in 2017, and its mission was essentially to take lidar sensors, which at the time were really expensive and big and really only used in, like, defense applications and aerospace. 2017 was sort of the first big hype cycle of autonomous vehicles. They wanted to apply those sensors, make them more affordable for that use case. That helped them get some deals, most notably with Volvo, and then some other deals with Mercedes Benz, and a couple other players. But they were just heavily concentrated in that, and that was one of the reasons they wound up filing this week, too.

And then iRobot [was] the most well known of these three companies — a lot of people listening probably even have a Roomba at home or something very like it. It’s just another one of these situations where iRobot became synonymous with a certain thing, and then the advances in the technology that build that product move so quickly that they wound up in a situation where they were looking for a way out. And we all saw this, they were trying to get acquired by Amazon, and that deal got blocked by the FTC and so here we are.

They’re very different companies, but they all ran into similar problems. Do either of you guys have a Roomba?

Rebecca: No, I don’t have a Roomba. Those freak me out, but I bought my mom a Rad Power bike years ago, and she loves it. But now, you know, they had not only this bankruptcy issue, but they also had the issue with the batteries — they weren’t able to do their recalls because they were, like, “If we have to recall these bikes, we’re going to go bankrupt.” But they’re going bankrupt anyway!

I’m curious about the tariff thing, and how much this affected everyone’s bottom lines. You hear a lot on social media, people who are pro merger, how certain FTC blockings of [mergers] leads to the companies going bankrupt, or getting acquired by a Chinese firm rather than an American firm.

Sean: iRobot represents, to me, the sort of macro global trade problem of, could you have ever built this company here in the United States with a localized supply chain over the last 15 years? Probably not. And so it makes sense that they became so heavily reliant on China — which, let’s be real, probably led to the ability for these other companies to pop up and essentially copy what they did.

That reminds me of in Trump 1, when he flipped on tariffs for Chinese imports, and we saw a bunch of startups like Boosted Boards and other ones in the micromobility space get hit. So they’re contributing factors, for sure. The battery recall with Rad Power absolutely was, I think, a bigger dagger at the end, but the tariff stuff put them on uneven footing that made it harder for them to respond to stuff like that.

Anthony: A lot of times when a company fails, there [are] larger structural issues, and then there’s maybe a more immediate proximate issue. And particularly in the case of iRobot, I think that a lot of former executives and even outside commentators are pointing to this Amazon deal that was reached a few years ago — it kind of looked like the EU was not going to allow it to go through, and there is this sense of, “Okay, well, by blocking this deal, you’ve essentially put the dagger in their heart that eventually killed the company.”

That narrative also maybe ignores the fact that there were other things that caused them to want to get acquired in the first place.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/2025/12/why-charlie-kirk-loved-jewish-sabbath/685374/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Charlie Kirk’s last book, Stop, in the Name of God, was released on the morning of December 9. By afternoon, it had jumped to No. 1 on Amazon and then sold out. On one hand, this should surprise no one. Kirk had a huge following even before his assassination made him, for many, a martyred saint and drove an online surge of both mourning and recrimination over insufficient mourning. On the other hand, this is a book about the Sabbath. Living authors of books investigating the day of rest, a small but select sodality, are probably feeling dizzy right now. I know I am. (Kirk seems to have read my book, The Sabbath World, and mentions me once.) The Sabbath is generally regarded as a topic of specialized interest. I can’t think of any other work of Sabbatarian theology that has attained instant best-seller status.

I should probably define my terms. Sabbatarianism is the doctrine of the Sabbath—the day of the week when, according to the Bible, humankind is commanded to rest, meaning, mostly, not to work. “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy,” says the Fourth Commandment. Kirk began keeping the Sabbath in 2021. His reasons, he explains in the book, had partly to do with mental hygiene and partly to do with God.

Kirk obviously didn’t mean for a book about the Sabbath to comprise his last words. But his turn toward the Sabbath took him in an unexpected direction, and the book contains evidence of genuine spiritual struggle, which is the best testament a man of faith can leave. Americans knew Kirk as a political figure—the right-wing prodigy who had co-founded the conservative youth group Turning Point USA at the age of 18 and was a close adviser to President Donald Trump. But he was moving closer to Christianity when he died. Not that he wasn’t plenty Christian already: Growing up, he went to church, attended a Christian academy, and accepted Jesus as his personal savior in the fifth grade. But Kirk renewed his spiritual journey in 2019 when he gave a sermon at an evangelical church at the pastor’s request. When that pastor—who became Kirk’s pastor—and others resisted church lockdowns during the coronavirus pandemic, Kirk mobilized them for political action. TPUSA already had a spin-off, the political-advocacy group Turning Point Action; in 2021, Kirk created TPUSA Faith, which is meant to “unite the Church around primary doctrine and eliminate wokeism from the American pulpit,” in the words of its website.

All of this additional activity took a toll on Kirk. As he recalls in the book, he was supervising 300 employees and had to meet a fundraising goal of $50 million a year, even as he was spending three hours a day on his radio program, The Charlie Kirk Show. Pretty soon he was “fatigued, tired, and spiritually confused.” A pastor advised him to start keeping the Sabbath. Kirk had some idea of what that entailed because a close friend and mentor, Dennis Prager, who was raised an Orthodox Jew, often talked about Shabbat, the Jewish Sabbath, on his show—Kirk remembers him calling it “the best part of his week.” Kirk had “Shabbat envy,” he writes, but he doubted that he could solve the problem of having too much to do by doing nothing one day a week. Eventually, though, he gave it a try. He turned off his phone and kept it off from Friday night to Saturday night, putting himself out of range of the daily barrage of work messages.

Americans, religious or not, kept the Sabbath for centuries. Blue laws, or Sunday-closing mandates that decreed a 24-hour pause from most work and commerce, were a legacy of the Puritans, who believed in keeping the Sabbath as stringently as possible. Over the past century or so, however, Sunday has come to mean mainly football and kids’ soccer and shopping, and the faithful adding church into the mix. A small minority, including the Amish, keep an old-fashioned Sabbath, putting all work on pause. Others, mainly observant Jews and members of Seventh-Day churches, such as the Adventists, do too, albeit on Saturday.

“The first Saturday was extremely challenging,” Kirk writes, adding a bit later, “What if President Trump calls me and my phone is off?” But before long, he found relief and spiritual reorientation. He was giving up control, and that was a blessing: “The Sabbath calls you to lay down your illusion of self-sufficiency and remember that your life is not your own—it is a gift.”

For the work of a nonhistorian, Stop, in the Name of God is a serious book. I must admit I hadn’t expected that, for two reasons. First, as Kirk says, he was a very busy man. (No writing partner is credited in the book.) Second, he was becoming a popular evangelist, a 21st-century Billy Graham, and I came to his book expecting a conversion narrative and some avuncular advice. Kirk gives advice, but it is not avuncular, and the conversion narrative takes up only three pages. The bulk of his book is apologetics in the classical sense: It mounts a theological argument in defense of a religious doctrine. Kirk does not talk down to the reader, and that is a feat.

The Sabbath goes back thousands of years and is a cornerstone of Western civilization. The rhythm in which six days of work were followed by one day of rest produced basic units of time such as the seven-day week and, ultimately, the weekend, along with foundational principles such as universal equality. After all, when the Bible declares that everyone has a right not to work, it is contending that all human beings have worth beyond their social status and productive function. That was a radical claim to make in an ancient world built on slave labor. In short, as soon you start talking about the Sabbath, you find yourself wrestling with big concepts.

Kirk has two main theses in his book,  and expresses each in a very different tone. One celebrates the beauty and moral uplift of the Sabbath; the other denounces the immorality of the godless in the fiery manner of a tent-revival preacher. The inspirational Kirk dwells lovingly on God’s rest at the end of Creation and compares the Sabbath to a “cathedral in time,” echoing the rabbi and philosopher Abraham Joshua Heschel’s famous description of the Sabbath as “a palace in time.” (Kirk quotes Heschel often.) The Sabbath provides what Kirk calls “the moral architecture of a free society.” It has a countercultural force. Keeping it “is a spiritual act of civil disobedience—an embodied rejection of any system that commodifies the human being.”

Kirk’s skepticism of the marketization of every aspect of life will probably have a broad appeal. But much more often, we hear from the divisive Kirk. This Kirk thunders against the false gods of modernity and cites the Bible to support his hard-right critique of liberalism. Among the supposedly idolatrous cults of our time are atheism, anti-racism (“societal deconstruction, not personal redemption”), climate-change activism (“a millenarian movement, complete with saints” such as Greta Thunberg), and the credulous worship of science: “What motivates someone to bend the knee at the altar of their ninth booster shot?” The link between Kirk’s Sabbath experience and his attacks on his bêtes noires, he says, is humility: The Sabbath demands it, and he thinks that liberals lack it. They believe that they can remake God’s world in their own image.

Read: What Charlie Kirk told me about his legacy

Kirk isn’t particularly humble himself. Perhaps speaking in the harsh style of the prophets gave him an unearned moral certitude. He doesn’t make reasoned arguments to justify equating heathens and leftish social movements; he just throws around pagan metaphors. Nor does he try very hard to understand activists’ worldviews before condemning them, which would have been the intellectually honest move.

The point that I suspect will really resonate with readers, though, is also the most nonpartisan. If one sentiment unites the left and right in the United States today, it is that technology exercises a tyrannical control over our habits of mind. You don’t have to be religious to understand the discomfort—or allure—of spending a day a week without a cellphone. This is why a secular “tech sabbath” has gained cultural currency over the past decade. The Sabbath can promote physical as well as spiritual healing, Kirk says. It can interrupt the cycle of social-media addiction, in which dopamine highs meant to keep us scrolling are followed by lows, making us anxious or depressed. “The Sabbath is a living dopamine fast,” he writes.

The day of rest Kirk proposes is optional. One reason Americans took such a dislike to the day in the past is that they had no choice but to keep it. But I suspect Kirk had another motive for insisting on a voluntary Sabbath, rather than one mandated by law: He didn’t want to be perceived as advocating a Jewish practice. I am not accusing him of having been anti-Semitic. A core tenet of Christian theology holds that Jesus liberated Christians from Mosaic law, superseding its picayune rules; in traditional Christian-supremacist terms, the new faith represented the fulfillment of Judaism, the mother religion. The doctrine is actually called “supersessionism.” In the Gospels, Jesus faults the Pharisees for insisting on a legalistic Sabbath. Yet the Sabbath “is not legalism—it is liberation,” writes Kirk.

From the beginning, Christians have argued about whether they were required to keep the Sabbath. Early Christians moved the rest day to Sunday and renamed it the Lord’s day. From the second century on, Christian leaders castigated those who clung stubbornly to a Saturday Sabbath, saying they “sabbatized” and “Judaized.” Kirk goes into all of this, and yet at the same time he skirts the darker side of the debate—its vitriolic language, its punitiveness.  John Calvin, for example, railed against “the gross and carnal superstition of sabbatism.” And Martin Luther himself mocked Christian Sabbath observers, recommending that they also practice circumcision, since they were already behaving like Jews.

Kirk was clearly aware that he could be accused of “sabbatizing” himself. Yet he never fully explains his decision to keep the Sabbath on Saturday. He does not appear to have belonged to one of the Saturday Sabbath churches or had any Christian Sabbath community at all. He mostly defends his choice of day on the grounds that he loves the Jewish Sabbath—the lighting of the candles on Friday night, the songs welcoming the Sabbath bride, the lingering festive meal.

After this book came out, I began watching Kirk’s videos, and I found two Kirks in them, too. One scathingly ridiculed his political enemies. The other showed genuine warmth, even sweetness, when he talked about his wife and family and faith and, yes, the Sabbath. I’d like to think that the latter is the Kirk who dedicated his book to Dennis Prager, whose “life’s work brought me to honoring the Sabbath.” Maybe this is just me indulging in Jewish fantasies, but I imagine that Kirk declined to dispel the ambiguities surrounding his Saturday observance because he couldn’t. He understood that the aversion to the Jewish Sabbath is part of a larger Christian unease about Judaism itself, and he was loath to get caught up in it.

Do I think that Kirk wished he were Jewish? Definitely not. Could the fact that he essentially Judaized refute Candace Owens’s assertion that he was about to withdraw his support of Israel—which she went on to imply had abetted his murder? No again. Owens’s conspiracy theories are despicable, but Kirk’s affection for the Jewish Sabbath does not, by itself, prove anything: Lots of Christians have loved Judaism and disliked Jews; philo-Semitism is no safeguard against anti-Semitism.

Rightly or wrongly, though, I picture that kind of anti-Semite as unable to acknowledge that they don’t have all the answers. Kirk does acknowledge it. He can seem too sure of himself in this book, but sometimes a less cocky Kirk emerges. “So here I am—still a bit raw. Still tender about it,” he writes in one of the few passages that directly address his Saturday observance. “I honor Saturday as my day of rest, not because I believe it earns me righteousness, but because it reminds me that I’m not God.” We will never know what a lifetime of being reminded on a weekly basis that he is not God would have done for Kirk. This small, diffident moment is one more reason to mourn his death.

            <h2>Trump’s Venezuelan-Tanker Gamble</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2025/12/trump-venezuela-tankers-maduro/685347/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">to Donald Trump, Venezuela was first all about narcotics. Now it is all about narcotics, oil, and the theft of American assets.

In the past week, Trump has added to his pressure campaign on President Nicolás Maduro by targeting the economic lifeblood of the regime: oil exports. The U.S. has seized three oil tankers in 11 days after Trump said on Truth Social that the United States was imposing a “TOTAL AND COMPLETE BLOCKADE” of tankers carrying Venezuelan oil that are subject to U.S. sanctions. The president added that the U.S. would also seek compensation for American assets that the Venezuelan government has seized, an apparent reference to past bouts of oil-industry nationalization by Caracas.

The new focus on Venezuela’s most abundant—and valuable—natural resource (the country has the largest estimated oil reserves in the world) was, in some ways, the clearest articulation yet of Trump’s ultimate aim. And some viewed the mention of a blockade as tantamount to a declaration of war, given that a blockade is recognized by international law as a belligerent act.

But the response of many Venezuela experts we talked with, regardless of their political leanings, was: This is how the pressure campaign should have started all along.

“I’m surprised they didn’t do it much sooner,” Juan Gonzalez, who served as a Latin America adviser at the National Security Council under President Joe Biden, told us. The administration’s previous moves have been dramatic and controversial: sending an armada of 11 ships and roughly 15,000 troops to the Caribbean and launching a series of missile strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats that has killed more than 100 people. But neither action has directly threatened Maduro’s ability to stay in power. Hitting the single biggest source of revenue that has propped up Maduro’s government since 2013, in contrast, sets in motion a process that could undermine him. And providing a way for Maduro to appease the White House with compensation for past acts could bring him to the negotiating table.

“If the objective is to force Maduro to make really big concessions, this is a really smart move,” Gonzalez said.

Jason Marczak, a Latin America expert at the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based think tank, told us the blockade could be what’s needed to sever the “financial lifelines that keep Maduro in power.”

But the Maduro regime also has a long track record of dodging sanctions and withstanding economic hardship. This time could turn out to be no different. “Knocking out drug boats did not stop drug trafficking or hurt the regime,” Francisco Mora, the Obama administration’s deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Western Hemisphere, told us. “I think the now so-called blockade and the increase to the cost to get oil out of Venezuela hurts the regime. But it is not clear how much of an impact it will have.”

Despite the president’s bellicose rhetoric, this isn’t really a blockade. (The U.S. last imposed an actual blockade—preventing all ships from entering or exiting a port—during World War II.) In effect, Trump ordered the U.S. government to strictly enforce anti-Venezuela sanctions, some of which have been on the books for a while and across presidential administrations. That gives the Coast Guard the green light to carry out seizure operations if and when it encounters a tanker under sanction.

Unlike the campaign of air strikes on boats—which many experts consider illegal—there’s solid legal grounding for such seizures. But they’re not without risk. Oil props up both the regime and the Venezuelan economy, so conditions in Venezuela could worsen, driving even more migrants from the country. Gonzalez said it’s unlikely the U.S. can sustain an embargo for very long, “given the humanitarian and migration implications.” The administration appears to be gambling that it can get what it wants from Maduro before tipping his country into total chaos.

Maduro’s government has called the U.S. behavior “theft” and “an act of international piracy,” and filed a complaint with the United Nations Security Council. Maduro also ordered the Venezuelan navy to escort tankers headed to Asia.

Trump, in his social-media post, threatened to keep up the pressure on Maduro’s government “until such time as they return to the United States of America all of the Oil, Land, and other Assets that they previously stole from us.”

Trump appears to have been referring to a 2007 decision by Maduro’s predecessor, the anti-imperialist Hugo Chávez, to nationalize various foreign-owned oil projects. The U.S. oil giants Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips were kicked out of the country after they refused to allow Venezuela’s national oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela, to acquire majority stakes in their Venezuelan operations. Venezuela at the time was the fourth-largest foreign petroleum supplier to the U.S.

Read: There’s a 92 Percent Chance Trump Is Making It Up

Venezuela had previously nationalized its oil industry in 1976, when then-President Carlos Andres Perez vowed to assert greater control over his country’s resources, marking a significant shift in Venezuela’s energy policy after decades of embracing foreign investment. Exxon, Gulf Oil, and Mobil were forced to give up majority stakes in their own projects at the time. Several U.S. oil companies resumed operations in Venezuela in the 1990s, after the country’s economy began to tank and oil revenues were seen as key to revitalization. It remains unclear whether Trump’s comments were intended to take those projects into account.

Chevron is the only U.S. oil firm now operating in Venezuela, through a joint venture with the country’s national oil company. It does so on a restricted license, which was renewed by the Trump administration this year. The joint venture was previously structured so that Chevron sold the oil in the U.S. and then paid Venezuela half of the proceeds in cash. When Secretary of State Marco Rubio renegotiated Chevron’s license renewal, he allowed the joint venture to continue provided that Chevron pays Venezuela in barrels of oil-–not cash-–for any Venezuelan oil sold in the U.S. The idea was to limit Maduro’s ability to gain from Chevron’s output.

Those barrels have to be sold on the black market for Maduro to profit, Francisco Monaldi, an expert in Latin American energy policy at Rice University, told us. The only way he’s able to do that, Monaldi added, is if “he can get them to China”—something made difficult by the new blockade. About 80 percent of Venezuela’s oil currently goes to China, at least 15 percent goes to the U.S. via Chevron’s joint venture, and the remainder goes to Cuba, Monaldi said.

The Trump administration is also seeking to expand America’s direct access to Venezuelan oil fields by reclaiming the nationalized oil projects of 2007. Stephen Miller, Trump’s deputy chief of staff, said Wednesday on X that Venezuela’s oil industry had been built by “American sweat, ingenuity and toil,” and called Venezuela’s nationalization a “tyrannical expropriation” that he claimed constituted the “largest recorded theft of American wealth and property.”

Conoco won an arbitration award of $8.75 billion over the 2007 expropriation of three of its Venezuelan oil projects, Monaldi noted. It was the largest amount awarded to a foreign firm after those nationalizations.

If Maduro leaves or is forced from power and there is a successful transition to a Washington-friendly new government, then the U.S. may be able to push for compensation, though how that would be calculated is unclear. Venezuela’s opposition has a transition plan for revitalizing the country’s devastated economy, which includes inviting U.S. and other foreign oil companies to help restore production, along with a return to some of the old projects that were nationalized. If Maduro stays in power, however, all bets are off.

It’s hard to tell who owns or operates the dilapidated tankers that circumvent official tracking systems, known as the shadow fleets. Their total size is also unknown, though experts believe it has swelled since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, after U.S. and European sanctions forced Russia to go off-radar with its oil shipments, too. S&P Global this year released a report suggesting that shadow fleets grew by 45 percent, from about 420 to 940 ships, in the year ending in May, and that they now account for 17 percent of the global tanker fleet.

Tanker Trackers, an independent monitoring site, says that roughly 400 tankers have entered Venezuelan ports since 2019. Of those, 160 are sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, which administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against foreign entities. Some of those ships are “stateless”—they are not registered with any country under international law—making them relatively straightforward for the U.S. to seize. Others may be sanctioned, but still are registered to another country. If the U.S interdicts one of those without permission, it is technically attacking another nation’s ship in what could be interpreted as an act of war.

The president did not say whether the U.S. would take possession of the ships it seizes or divert them, but so far, the U.S. has seized the tankers it has boarded. U.S. Southern Command, which is responsible for U.S. military operations in the Caribbean Sea, referred questions to the White House, which didn’t respond to a request for comment.

“The key will be in the execution. Do they stop every vessel and then inspect it for contraband cargo? Or do they only stop suspected ships?” Bryan Clark, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and a retired Navy officer, told us. “The former would hinder all traffic in and out of Venezuela, a de facto blockade, which goes beyond what the administration said it was aiming to do.” But, he added, “if they do this selectively, it seems they are enforcing the sanctions put in place.”

Stopping oil tankers could cause severe economic damage to Venezuela but not lead to the fall of the regime, Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela expert at Recorded Future, a threat-assessment company, told us. If Venezuela can’t sell oil, it will hurt the government’s ability to import essential goods. “But that,” Ramsey said, “is not necessarily a death blow.”

White Crane, Kiara M, H Constance, Lattafa, Tamia, and Monique—these are the six additional tankers the Treasury Department sanctioned earlier this month, along with six shipping companies it said had transported Venezuelan crude oil in recent months. The U.S. has sanctions on hundreds of vessels it deems to be operating illegally as part of shadow fleets. This past January, the U.S. sanctioned 183 Russia-linked tankers, and in November, it sanctioned 170 tankers involved with Iran’s oil trade. About 180 Venezuelan tankers are subject to U.S. sanctions, and roughly 30 of those had been in Venezuela this month.

The Department of Justice released dramatic footage recently of the latest vessel seizure. American forces, led by the Coast Guard and joined by Special Forces and Marines, rappelled from a military helicopter onto the Skipper, which had been sanctioned by the Treasury Department in 2022.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the oil on the Skipper would be seized by the U.S. once a legal process to approve possession of the vessel is completed. That process requires the U.S. to get a federal warrant, seize the vessel, and then ask a court to hand it over to U.S. jurisdiction. During Biden’s presidency, the Justice Department followed a similar process to seize Maduro’s Dassault Falcon 900EX aircraft in the Dominican Republic. The aircraft was then transferred to the Southern District of Florida at the request of the U.S. based on violations of U.S. export-control and sanctions laws.

“The downside is it’s a very time-consuming, laborious, and onerous process, which is a problem if the government is trying to do it at scale, and not just a one-off,” says Martin De Luca, a former prosecutor and a partner at the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, who has long worked on Venezuela matters.

If U.S. authorities decide to seize a ship, they inform the crew by radio and board the vessel with troops, led by the Coast Guard. Once on board, the Coast Guardsmen will confirm that it is a sanctioned ship and divert the vessel to a port, likely in U.S. territory. That’s if everything goes smoothly. Last year, two Navy SEALs died during a U.S. bid to board a ship off the coast of Somalia that was suspected of carrying weapons to Houthi rebels in Yemen.

The campaign against Venezuela is already incredibly unpopular with Trump’s base—a CBS News/YouGov poll last month said 70 percent of respondents, including both Democrats and Republicans, would oppose military action. Any mishaps that produce American casualties could lead to all-out war, which would be politically perilous. Not all Republicans love that their party is threatening war to settle scores on behalf of Big Oil. GOP Representative Thomas Massie, in a post on X, said that “no one campaigned on using our soldiers to overthrow Venezuela to make these Oil Companies whole again.”</div>

            <h2>The Pitiful Childishness of Donald Trump</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2025/12/donald-trump-renaming/685376/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Board of Trustees—or, if one prefers, the Board of Toadies—at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts has renamed it the Trump-Kennedy Center. The 47th president of the United States approves. Donald Trump’s appetite for flattery appears as insatiable as the supply of bootlickers among his followers appears inexhaustible. He also blessed engraving his name on the U.S. Institute of Peace building and delivered a cartographic decree that the Gulf of Mexico would henceforth be called the Gulf of America.

Meanwhile, his secretary of defense, in between haranguing generals about physical fitness and ordering the U.S. Navy to engage in the killing of criminals without trial, has renamed the Department of Defense “the Department of War” (illegally, as it happens). Pete Hegseth has also gone about renaming bases that were once named after Confederate generals (traitors, the lot of them, and for the most part incompetent military leaders) but, last year, renamed after real heroes. The Hegsethian names are the same as the originals (Bragg, Hood, Lee) but supposedly refer to different people.

It is all offensive and in some cases skirts the will, such as it is, of a feeble and craven Congress. It is also puerile. The names will come back. In 10 years’ time, the maps will say “the Gulf of Mexico,” and the odds are good that a Democratic administration will yet again rename the Department of Defense and the forts. Trump’s name will be chiseled out of the walls, as will his embarrassing japes at his predecessors in his “President’s Walk of Fame” at the White House. So why do Trump and his minions do things that are childish in and of themselves, and that anyone with political judgment knows will be undone when their opponents eventually return to power?

“Names are powerful,” the exceptional magician Eugene Burger used to say, which is why some mentalists begin their acts by memorizing the names of everyone in the audience. The Confederate names on forts built during the early 20th century were designed to consolidate the myth of the Lost Cause, conferring nobility on what was, in fact, a sordid struggle for chattel slavery—the worst cause for which men ever fought, as Ulysses S. Grant later noted. And in some measure they succeeded.

Names can be tributes too, sometimes of a paradoxical kind. Native Americans were cheated, occasionally massacred, displaced, and defeated by Americans moving West. But in 1973 Jeep named its premier vehicle the Cherokee, hoping to capture ruggedness and pride in the name, even giving the first truck to the then-head of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. The U.S. Army’s most lethal helicopter is the Apache, the Navy’s primary long-range missile is the Tomahawk, and a century ago William Tecumseh Sherman, one of the most formidable of Civil War generals, bore as his middle name that of one of the greatest Indian warriors Americans ever encountered.

One may debate whether such namings are appropriate—in 2021 the leaders of the Oklahoma-based Cherokee Nation, a different federally recognized tribe, formally objected to having the name on a hulking car—but it is clear that they are intended to serve as a tribute. The renamings carried out by Trump and Hegseth are different. They are akin to the newly positive use of the word swagger and to the photo-shoot cosplay of Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem or FBI Director Kash Patel in full tactical combat gear. They are childish.

Much of the leadership of the Trump administration, emphatically beginning at the top, exhibits the behavioral patterns of children—broken children, in many cases, who will never really become fully adult and do not understand what adult behavior is.

Children, particularly the adolescents whom the Trump leadership cadre most resemble, rarely have a strong sense of futurity. It is one of the reasons they so frequently do stupid things. The knowledge that what we do today may be undone tomorrow, that we cannot control the future to any large degree, that our ability to imprint our wishes on the world is limited—those are adult sentiments. The Romans would have a slave whisper in the ears of a Roman general during his triumphal parade, “Sic transit gloria mundi.” Our equivalent, which only adults, or children becoming adults, understand, comes from Johnny Cash:

Adolescents often indulge in magical fantasies, dreaming about being able to manipulate a world that deep down they know is out of their control. That desire to shape their surroundings helps account for a fantastic belief in the power of names. To think that renaming an agency the Department of War can suddenly transform it is childish. Acknowledging the messiness of reality, its intractability, and the limits of what we can do about it is reserved for grown-ups.

Names are a useful way to be mean. Labeling the class nerd a doofus may make the class bully feel bigger than he is—for a little while. Until, that is, the nerd gets into a good college by swotting away at the books, or the doofus, after judo lessons, lands the bully on his back. Trump is a master of the insulting nickname, a tool he uses not only to cut down his opponents but also because he likes to wound. He enjoys the petty cruelty of it.

And to a particular kind of broken child, names can be a way of showing how clever you are in a similarly mean way. The Confederate names had been taken off the forts, but Hegseth no doubt feels that he has been very clever by, for example, restoring the name of Fort A. P. Hill using the last names or initials of Private Bruce Anderson, First Sergeant Robert A. Pinn, and Lieutenant Colonel Edward Hill—A. P. Hill, get it? One can practically see the smirks and elbow nudges and hear the “nyuck nyuck” of adolescent laughter. Hegseth wanted the Confederate names and, for now, got them in by the back door.

Malevolent children can be obnoxious, or even scary. But they are also pitiful creatures. The ones who never grow up will spend their lives hurting others—strangers, friends, and family alike—and usually themselves. They will never feel the weight of adult responsibilities and remorse or know the adult satisfactions and the adult joys. Some of them will forever have an emptiness inside them that they cannot fill. They will live with a deep anxiety that their frauds and cheats will be discovered and that, in the end, the magical names they have devised will be wiped away and the spells dissolved. Their brokenness will remain irreparable, their fears and unhappiness unassuageable. Unfortunately, though, they may grow up to be Cabinet secretaries, and who knows—perhaps even president of the United States of America.</div>

Microsoft not understanding that a toy is for playing and a tool is for working, and thus have very different requirements, is confirmed by their &quot;tool&quot; (Windows) being brittle like a toy, and their toy (Xbox) turning into unwelcome work for buyers to install and maintain. I own both a PC (but running a decent operating system, not Windows), and an Xbox, and I would never for a second thought that both should be &quot;merged&quot; and become &quot;one&quot;.

It is difficult to remember now, but in the aftermath of the assassination of Charlie Kirk, a number of hopeful thinkers on the American right believed his martyrdom would usher in an era of spiritual revolution. This was a position shared by both the old guard and the new. Ross Douthat, the New York Times’ resident wiggy Catholic and eternal Trump skeptic, entertained the idea that Kirk’s death might serve as the “impetus for a genuine revival,” borrowing the theological term for a spike in devotional fervor. (Douthat’s thesis boiled down to the idea that Kirk’s sanctification could pave over the gaping contradictions between scriptural doctrine and Trump’s personal demeanor, which was quite the heat check in retrospect.) Meanwhile, as our own Molly Olmstead reported back in October, hard-line MAGA partisans gamely leveraged Kirk’s killing in the name of Christian nationalism. Jack Posobiec—a dunce, a racist, and a guy whose face looks to have been recently blasted by a power washer—was invited to speak at Kirk’s funeral. In his remarks, Posobiec predicted that the assassination shall be remembered as one of the “two or three pivotal moments that led to the saving of Western civilization,” by “returning the people to Almighty God.”

Three months have come and gone since these proclamations, and to put it mildly, none of them have come to pass. Instead, the exact opposite has happened. MAGA-dom has unraveled over the legacy of Kirk, in ways that are both wildly hallucinogenic and totally predictable.

Generally speaking, mass galvanization requires, at bare minimum, a shared understanding of reality and what that reality means. In the realm of Trump-tinged grievance, that understanding was usually centered around the idea that authority figures are liars beguiling the public. In previous eras of the movement, before MAGA-dom had achieved a certain threshold of social saturation, those enemies were easy to identify. It was Dr. Fauci in his white coat, or Barack Obama in his tan suit. But following the ultimate triumph of Trump, and after a decade spent cobbling together a coalition through the binding power of illusive conspiracy, napalming the population with misinformation designed to stimulate their most spectral fears—Pizzagate, Seth Rich, the Biden crime family, the tao of Q, the stolen election—the gun has been turned around. It is fair to wonder, at this current moment, whether the MAGA right will ever be able to coalesce unity again. At least, that is what I pondered while watching Candace Owens, a pundit bred in the coagulated conservative media ecosystem, single-handedly derail conservative consensus about what Kirk’s killing means.

Owens was a friend of Kirk’s, and no stranger to delusional thinking. I have heard her engage in lunchroom-style postulations about the existence of free energy, or the veracity of the moon landing, as well as a bevy of typical bugaboos that animate the MAGA right. (She believes vaccines cause autism, she thinks Obama was born in Kenya, and so on.) Lately, though, Owens’ penchant for taboo has put her in league with a rising antisemitic tide within conservative airwaves. Her critiques of Israel have been conjoined with some eyebrow-raising comments about the Holocaust. I have heard Owens express the idea that the crimes of Josef Mengele—the “Angel of Death,” who conducted torturous human experiments on concentration camp prisoners—sounded “completely absurd.”

Fast-forward to September, weeks after Kirk was slain. After a brief period of mourning, Owens began to air some characteristically unhinged allegations about the nature of the incident. More specifically, she argued that the government, and Kirk’s organization Turning Point USA, knew more about his death than either entity was letting on. Who was Owens pointing the finger toward? You guessed it: the Jews. The commentator’s claims were hard to parse, but essentially, Owens argued that unspecified pro-Israel forces were, in some way, involved in the assassination, and that the suspect in custody—a 22-year old named Tyler Robinson—is an accessory of a false flag operation. This charge didn’t pass the smell test; Kirk remained an avowed Zionist throughout his life, and he’d never be accused of holding pro-Muslim sympathies. But Owens was undeterred. From the outcropping of her millions-strong social media empire—including more than 5 million subscribers on YouTube—Owens asserted that two days before his fatal date in Utah, Kirk had expressed frustrations with the Israeli state to a variety of donors and Turning Point operatives. He was rewarded for his lack of fealty, as Owens stated on her platform, by “conveniently” catching “a bullet to the throat.”

It goes without saying that there is not even a whiff of evidence connecting Kirk’s death with, say, a clandestine Mossad strike force. But that doesn’t really matter, because in the months afterward, Owens glided toward much more outlandish conspiracies in regard to the assassination. She has suggested that Erika Kirk, Charlie’s widow, was being tailed by Egyptian military aircraft in correlation with Israel’s plot against her husband. She tweeted that the real assassin trained in conjunction with the French military, and was implicitly backed by the Macrons. (Owens is currently embroiled in an unrelated scandal and lawsuit, focused on her insistence that Brigitte Macron is secretly trans.) More psychedelically, Owens recorded a video recounting how Charlie Kirk appeared to her in a dream in order to tell her he had been, in a word, “betrayed”—a perfect distillation of Owens’ ability to marry a woo-woo almond-mom vigor with an esoteric lean.

In sum, Owens was directing her usual diet of conspiracies against the broadside of the MAGA mainstream. If you follow Owens’ thread, then everyone—Turning Point, the Trump administration, FBI Director Kash Patel, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Fox News, and so on—is complicit in a massive cover-up. This demonstration of disloyalty isn’t often rewarded in the far-right orbit, but, somewhat surprisingly, Owens’ takes on Kirk haven’t dampened her audience’s enthusiasm. Instead, the speculation has been rewarded with oodles of views and ominous comments about Owens’ willingness to be a harbinger of forbidden truths. (“Candace is risking her whole life for this,” wrote one user, bearing the name K-Pop-Girl, on a recent Owens TikTok video.)

This all came to a head last week after Erika Kirk, who has transformed herself into a public figure in the wake of her husband’s passing, invited Owens to Turning Point for a highly publicized private meeting. Erika had been on the offensive in recent weeks, criticizing Owens’ destructive candor on Fox and CBS, including a lengthy air-clearing sit-down with center-right gadfly Bari Weiss. In that sense, the consultation between the two women was aimed to establish detente. Ideally, Owens and Erika Kirk could find alignment, and ameliorate some of Owens’ more looney ideas. That didn’t happen. The conference lasted for four-and-a-half hours, and when Owens was back on her platform and in front of a microphone, one of the first things she said was that she refused the water served at Turning Point—ostensibly because she feared Erika Kirk might try to poison her.

Owens refused to recant her claims. Turning Point, she said, failed to convince her that Charlie Kirk was, indeed, killed by Tyler Robinson. A conversation with a lawyer at the organization seemed to leave her saddled with more questions than answers. (“There’s nothing that’s been convincing,’” said Owens, of the conversation, reiterating her skepticism of the official narrative. “Let the gaslighting stop.”) It seems likely, in the months ahead, Owens will continue to spread strange rumors about Kirk’s killing, reaping massive engagement along the way. Last I checked, Owens’ video recapping her meeting with Erika had accrued 3.5 million views.

For what it’s worth, the vast spectrum of right-wing media has made a concerted effort to discredit Owens and stymie the spread of these conspiracies. Will Sommer, a journalist who has tracked the overreaches of conspiratorial MAGA-dom for as long as it has existed in its current form, noted that both Tim Pool and Nick Fuentes—two men who are not known for editorial restraint—came out strongly against Owens. Pool, in particular, called her a “fucking evil scumbag,” who is “burning everything down.” The idea here is that Owens is shamelessly profiting off of Kirk’s death by cultivating an eldritch sense of suspicion. But, again, that is only possible because deregulated conservative digital media has long feasted on talking points that skew false, ghoulish, fantastical, or otherwise insane. (Pool, of all people, has taken advantage of this leeway countless times in his career.)

The consequences are such that the assassination of Charlie Kirk has shed the readily available narrative coherence that Trump-aligned agitators once hoped to leverage. There is no revival coming, nor an institutionalization of MAGA thought. Instead, Kirk leaves behind a battlefield for a scattered and increasingly aberrant Republican Party, unbound by the gravity of a lame-duck Trump. In Kirk’s name, they will continue to plod through long, grueling, nonsensical arguments about Egyptian aircraft and Emmanuel Macron, with people who are simply never going to listen.

If I may be brutally honest, I do find something cathartic about this moment. The weeks after Kirk was shot were marked by gratuitous consecrations of the man’s virtue. Statues were commissioned, flags were dropped to half-staff, an FCC chairman got way too high on his supply. It seemed like the Trump administration genuinely believed it found itself with the right martyr to remake America—despite the fact that the martyr in question was, and always will be, a hateful podcaster with a vindictive spirit. All of that looks so quaint now. Whatever dreams briefly possessed by MAGA world—visions of a marble Charlie Kirk replacing Thomas Jefferson in the Capitol Rotunda—are firmly dashed. What’s left is a clammy, conspiracy-riddled hell, the same one the right had condemned the rest of us to for more than a decade. But at last, it is finally time for MAGA-dom to lie in the bed it has made.

            <div id="article-text">Hands On It&#39;s been a long time coming but version 1.0 of the first ground-up Rust-based desktop is here… and it is shaping up very well.

Late last week, System76 officially released the long term support version of its in-house Ubuntu remix along with &quot;Epoch 1&quot; of its in-house desktop environment COSMIC, implemented from scratch in Rust. After testing out the beta version in VMs and on an old clunker, we tried it on a more modern testbed, and we are grudgingly impressed.

The COSMIC desktop has been quite a long time coming, but building a whole new desktop is not a trivial exercise. The Register first reported on the project just over four years ago. We looked at the alpha test release in September, and later the beta version. Now, as promised at the Ubuntu Summit last month, version 1.0 of the COSMIC desktop is here, as well as its native distro, the Ubuntu Noble-based Pop!_OS 24.04.

We have been testing it out on the highest-end of our old Thinkpads, a W520. It works and makes this nearly 15-year-old PC feel remarkably fast, but we experienced regular freezes, for instance when opening a bunch of Firefox tabs. Up to a point, that is fair enough: the machine has long-supported Nvidia Quadro 1000 second GPU, which was last supported by NVIDIA&#39;s Linux drivers three whole major versions ago. We&#39;re rather surprised it worked at all, let alone worked well. So, decided it would be fairer to try it on the newer Reg FOSS desk testbed, a Dell XPS 13 9370.

COSMIC handles two screens with aplomb, which is more than we can say for its screenshot tool – click to enlarge

This is not a trivial exercise. Pop!_OS uses the systemd-boot boot loader instead of GRUB. That keeps the files for the Linux kernel and initramfs inside the PC&#39;s EFI System Partition. Dell only configures a paltry 100 MB ESP, and the release version of Pop!_OS refuses to install. Using the very latest Gparted Live 1.70-12, released just a few days before, we shrank the Windows 11 partition, moved its start 900 MB later on the disk, and then tried to enlarge the ESP. It didn&#39;t work. Just as we reported way back in 2021, the underlying disk-resizing tool used by GParted can&#39;t handle FAT32 volumes this small. It still throws an error and says &quot;we&#39;re working on it.&quot; Well, the GNU Parted team isn&#39;t working on it with any urgency, because it&#39;s still broken over four years later.

We worked around this by temporarily copying the EFI files somewhere else, deleting the tiny ESP, making a new one of 1000 MB, copying the Windows and Debian files back into it, and then installing a clean new copy of Pop!_OS. The new distro works fine, but for now, we can no longer boot Windows 11 or Debian. Summary: watch out – Pop!_OS still does not play nicely with dual boot.

It also defaults to some memory-management settings that wouldn&#39;t be our first choice. It configures two levels of swap: ZRAM memory compression, then an much lower-priority encrypted swap file on disk – although it seemed happy to use an existing dedicated swap partition, it still encrypted it. The Dell XPS 13 has 16 GB of non-upgradable RAM, which isn&#39;t much but isn&#39;t desperate, and it does have a fast SSD. So we wanted our favored performance optimizations, with a more conventional, single-level swap setup. We removed ZRAM by removing the config package:

Then we disabled encryption and rebooted. Next, we added the existing swap partition to /etc/fstab, rebooted, and checked it was working. Then, we enabled swap compression: Zswap instead of ZRAM. Rather than swapping to a compressed RAMdisk, and if that fills, spilling to an encrypted swap file or partition, this way the kernel compresses data as it&#39;s written to a swap drive instead. It keeps more RAM free, reduces the amount of data written to swap, and also reduces SSD wear. To do this with systemd-boot, we edited /boot/efi/loader/entries/Pop_OS-current.conf and added zswap.enabled=1 to the end of the kernel line. Another reboot and all was well, and very fast indeed.

On this less-compromised hardware, Pop!_OS never missed a beat. We added an external USB-C screen, and a USB-C dock for an external keyboard and mouse. It handled these fine, including sleep and resume, docking and undocking, and moving apps between different desktops. We tried to load it up with a large Flatpak Electron app, the Ferdium multi-protocol chat client, and an Electron Appimage (the Panwriter Markdown editor, and both Firefox and Chrome, all at the same time. It never perceptibly slowed, and the combination of automatic window tiling and dynamic virtual desktops kept things usable even on a small screen.

COSMIC is still version 1.0 and it does feel like it in places. It doesn&#39;t always pick up changed settings immediately. Some parts are a bit clunky. The main panel easily gets overcrowded, and it doesn&#39;t work very well in vertical orientation – but it works at all, and at least it&#39;s an option, unlike in Windows 11. You can have a panel and a dock, or just one or the other, or a taskbar, whatever you want – even status icons – without messing around with extensions, unlike in GNOME.

Even so, what&#39;s here is good and it&#39;s certainly usable. We would go so far as to say that in terms of Wayland desktop environments, at the end of 2025, this is the state of the art. Windows snap open; press Windows+T for a terminal, and immediately you&#39;re looking at a bash prompt. We downloaded the Panwriter appimage, made a new folder, moved it into it, all by just guessing the keystrokes, and it worked perfectly. Alt+Enter for the file properties did not work, but one right-click later, we added execute permission, and it just worked – first time. Firefox and Chrome picked up the settings from the previous install of CachyOS which used the same home directory; Firefox even reopened our last browsing session. A full installation only took about 8 GB of disk space, although it did use a lot of RAM – htop reports 1.6 GB in use at idle.

COSMIC isn&#39;t pretty, but it&#39;s not hard on the eyes either. It&#39;s a little clunky in places. The fake menu bar in some COSMIC apps doesn&#39;t work very well, but it&#39;s better than a hamburger menu. Not many standard CUA-style keyboard shortcuts work, but that&#39;s also true of both GNOME and KDE, and they&#39;ve both had over a quarter of a century to get this right.

There are already some add-on applets available in the COSMIC app store, such as both minimal and full-featured Start-menu equivalents. It has also made its way into multiple distros already, and by early 2026 you should see COSMIC Epoch 1 in Arch and other rolling-release distros.

This is the first desktop environment we&#39;ve seen that delivers any of the promised benefits of Wayland. It&#39;s very fast, can handle changing resolutions, orientations, scaling factors and so on on the fly without any issue. Both GNOME and the various tiling Wayland compositors face serious new competition.

Several of the Reg FOSS desk&#39;s techier friends were already running Pop!_OS, but the new desktop makes it even more appealing. It also shows that the underlying Ubuntu 24.04 OS is no slouch. We think this is a winning combination which will win win Pop!_OS a lot of new admirers – and help burnish System76&#39;s reputation, too. ®

            <h2>Around 1,000 systems compromised in ransomware attack on Romanian water agency</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/22/around_1000_systems_compromised_in/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Romania&#39;s cybersecurity agency confirms a major ransomware attack on the country&#39;s water management administration has compromised around 1,000 systems, with work to remediate them still ongoing.

Administrația Națională Apele Române (Romanian Waters) says its geographical information system applications servers, database servers, Windows workstations, Windows Servers, email and web servers, and domain name servers are all affected.

Its website remains offline, so official information is being disseminated via alternative sources.

Romanian Waters oversees the country&#39;s water infrastructure, including dams, waterways, drinking water supplies, and monitoring systems.

The attack, which began on December 20, also spread to ten of the country&#39;s 11 river basin management organizations, the Romanian National Cyber Security Directorate (DNSC) said.

While around 1,000 systems are being investigated, Romanian Waters&#39; operational capabilities were not affected. The DNSC confirmed that hydrotechnical operations were continuing as normal and are being operated locally by on-site staff.

The attack is being described as ransomware, but authorities did not specify what group was behind it, although they did confirm that files were encrypted, and the attackers left ransom notes demanding that Romanian Waters begins negotiations within seven days.

However, the DNSC said that the attackers exploited Windows&#39; BitLocker to encrypt its files, suggesting the attack might not be the work of a miscreant using a known ransomware group&#39;s payload.

&quot;We reiterate that DNSC&#39;s strict policy and recommendation towards all victims of ransomware attacks is to neither contact nor negotiate with cyberattackers, to avoid encouraging or financing the cybercrime phenomenon,&quot; the agency stated.

&quot;We recommend avoiding contacting the IT&C teams of the National Administration &#39;Romanian Waters&#39; or ones of the river basin administrations, so they can focus on restoring the impacted IT services.

&quot;We will provide further details as soon as additional information becomes available.&quot;

Romanian Waters&#39; network was not protected by Romania&#39;s system for safeguarding critical national infrastructure.

Similar to the UK NCSC&#39;s Early Warning service, Romania&#39;s equivalent sees CNI systems&#39; traffic running through it, with monitoring tools established to detect anomalous activity and stop attacks before they become disruptive.

The DNSC said that this won&#39;t be the case forever, and steps to integrate Romanian Waters&#39; network into this system are underway.

&quot;The necessary steps have started to integrate this infrastructure into the systems developed by CNC to ensure cyber protection for both public and private IT&C infrastructures of critical importance to national security, using intelligent technologies.&quot;

The attack on Romanian Waters is the latest in a long line of similar incidents affecting Western equivalents.

As providers of safe drinking water to vast populations, the threat of cyberattacks to water administrations is an acute concern for national security agencies.

Hacktivists broke into Canada&#39;s systems for managing water, energy, and farming back in October, for example, accessing controls that could have led to disastrous consequences.

The UK and US have also previously issued their respective warnings about similar scenarios after observing attacks on their water authorities. ®

            <h2>AI is rewriting how power flows through the datacenter</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/22/ai_power_datacenter/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Power semiconductors are soon set to become as vital as GPUs and CPUs in datacenters, handling the rapidly increasing loads forecast for AI infrastructure.

The AI craze has seen datacenter operators stuffing servers with as many accelerators (typically GPUs) as will fit inside, then filling the racks in their data halls with these high-performance boxes.

With some GPUs now using 700 W of energy each, the power required by an entire rack or datacenter of kit is growing rapidly, putting a strain on electrical distribution infrastructure.

Last year, Nvidia introduced an integrated rack-scale system for AI processing, the DGX GB200 NVL72, which needs 120 kW per unit, while cloud giant Google disclosed this year that it is planning for datacenter racks supporting 1 MW of IT hardware loads.

To cap it all, some of the key infrastructure components such as transformers are reported to be holding things up through long lead times of 28 weeks or more.

This is where power semiconductors come into the picture. They enable solid-state transformers (SSTs), which are much smaller and more efficient than their conventional counterparts – perhaps just 500 kg as opposed to multiple tons.

&quot;What&#39;s now being introduced is a solid-state transformer that has a couple of advantages on the supply chain side, but also on this performance side, and that is a pretty new application,&quot; said Dr Peter Wawer, division president for Green Industrial Power at chipmaker Infineon.

SSTs are a great deal lighter and smaller, Wawer told us, because they operate at very high frequency, a couple of orders of magnitude higher than the AC power supply frequency fed into them. Because the solid-state transformer switches at such high frequency, it requires silicon carbide components.

&quot;Silicon carbide is the only material that has the capability to switch at high frequency and has high blocking voltages. And for blocking voltage, we mean up to two or three kilovolts (kV), which this semiconductor device will need to block,&quot; Wawer said. &quot;But then, of course, you have input voltages of more than 30 kV, and therefore you have to stack more than 10 of the devices in a kind of cascaded structure.&quot;

Infineon is a prominent supplier of power semiconductors, and so has an interest in pushing the development of solid-state components that are set to be in demand as the datacenter build boom continues.

The firm expects that SSTs will replace a portion of the datacenter transformer market and could be worth up to $1 billion by 2030, for example.

Circuit breakers are nother application where power semiconductors may replace legacy kit. These electromechanical devices open up in a few milliseconds in the event of a short circuit, but a silicon carbide solid-state version can open much faster, in microseconds – handy if you are dealing with high voltages being supplied to racks full of very expensive GPUs.

Power semiconductors, based on silicon carbide or gallium nitride, are also set to play a part in the power distribution around the datacenter itself.

Nvidia has signposted that it sees 800 VDC power supplies as the way forward, as the power demands of AI infrastructure get ever higher, saying this move will be required to support 1 MW IT racks and beyond. It claims this reduces the number of voltage conversions needed, which can introduce inefficiencies and increase the complexity of the electrical system, among other things.

It is also a way of minimizing losses, according to Infineon, because the power loss is proportional to the square of the current. The trick therefore, when you want to go to a higher power and keep losses under control, is to increase the voltage to a level that means you keep the current constant.

&quot;Today, you have a combined rack that has the IT payload as well as the power delivery and the backup power. Now, as the GPUs, TPUs, and ASICs increase in power, that means that you need to bring in more power into the racks themselves,&quot; said Adam White, division president for Power & Sensor Systems at Infineon.

&quot;So we now move to this potential 800 volt DC supply, but you&#39;ve also got the plus-minus 400-volt topologies that some vendors [such as Google] may end up using. We call this then the hybrid microgrid.&quot;

&quot;Why 800 volts DC? Effectively, you can bring that directly into the motherboards or into the compute trays, using fewer conversion steps,&quot; he added.

However, Infineon believes that before we can get to that step, there will have to be an intermediate stage, where a &quot;power sidecar&quot; – effectively a second rack full of power delivery and backup circuitry – will sit alongside the rack of IT kit it serves. Whether this serves just one rack or several will depend on the IT load.

This arrangement is expected to see racks hitting 600 kW of power, up from the maximum of about 125 kW today, to support configurations using Nvidia&#39;s Rubin Ultra, expected to arrive in late 2027.

Google also mentions a &quot;sidecar&quot; in its plans for 1 MW kit, as a dedicated AC-to-DC power rack that feeds power to the other racks.

As power demand rises, the power supply unit (PSU) within the rack will need to handle more power, with 8 kW units available now. There will also be a transition to a three-phase design to move from a 12 kW unit to 16 kW or above, which is expected to happen next year. This transition will see greater use of components made with silicon carbide and gallium nitride (GaN), according to Infineon.

Finally, the increasing density of the AI accelerators themselves and the amount of power all those transistors guzzle is starting to have an impact at the chip level.

The voltage regulator modules (VRMs) are currently discrete packages that sit alongside the accelerator chip package (GPU, ASIC or TPU) on the system board, but as the current to the chip rises, parasitic losses also increase, wasting energy.

&quot;Some of the industry has already recognized that and started to move to what we call BVM, or back-side vertical power module,&quot; White said. This moves the VRMs to the other side of the system board, below the accelerator chip package, and simplifies the board layout as well as reducing overall power delivery network losses.

Ultimately, the industry would like to get to the point where the VRM moves inside the chip package and is embedded in the substrate directly beneath the chip, but this is a development set for beyond 2027, according to Infineon. ®

﻿Both devices reportedly share a similar display size and aspect ratio.

Apple’s long-rumored foldable iPhone is set to arrive next year, and already faces some preemptive competition from Samsung. Korea’s ET News reports that Samsung’s upcoming “Wide Fold” is also set to launch in 2026, and will closely mirror the display size and 4:3 aspect ratio of Apple’s first foldable.

The machine-translated report says the Wide Fold is expected to feature an OLED display that measures 5.4 inches in its folded position, and 7.6 inches when unfolded. “It will be a ‘passport’ type with a 4:3 screen ratio when unfolded,” according to an unnamed industry source cited by ET News.

Last week, The Information reported that Apple’s upcoming foldable will feature a 5.3-inch display that increases to 7.7 inches when open, and will have an aspect ratio “similar to that of Apple’s largest iPads when viewed in landscape mode,” and will be “more wide than tall when unfolded.” Most iPad models sport a near 4:3 aspect ratio. This was the latest rumor that pointed to Apple’s first foldable iPhone having a wide aspect ratio in portrait mode, though Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman said in September that the device would look like two iPhone Airs stuck together.

Both Samsung and Apple’s upcoming foldables are expected to launch in Fall 2026. The 4:3 aspect ratio is better for reading e-books and documents, viewing photographs, or creative tasks like design and image editing, but would result in traditional landscape and portrait videos having ugly black bars at the top and bottom of the screen. This is something that’s already noticeable on Samsung’s squarish Z Fold 7.

            <div id="article-text">With podcasting pivoting to video this year, the word used to describe an audio-only show is becoming meaningless.

With podcasting pivoting to video this year, the word used to describe an audio-only show is becoming meaningless.

According to YouTube’s 2025 Recap feature, the podcast I consumed the most on its platform was Seth Meyers’ recurring segment “A Closer Look” on his show Late Night.

Last year, I would have argued that this is not a podcast. That it is, in fact, a clip of a TV show. But in 2025, with almost every major podcast now having a video component, the definition of the word “podcast” has become pretty meaningless. A decades-old TV show talk show format is now almost indistinguishable from podcasts like Good Hang with Amy Poehler, Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard, Club Shay Shay with Shannon Sharpe, and other shows at the top of Spotify’s podcast charts. In fact, they are now on the same playing field.

The definition of the word “podcast” has become pretty meaningless

Scrolling though my YouTube feed, most of the suggestions in the Podcast tab are late-night talk show interviews, host-driven video essays, food reviews, and cable news segments — very far from what we used to use the term for: narrative audio journalism and roundtable discussions.

So in 2026, instead of trying to define what a podcast is, I think we need to stop using the word altogether. “Podcast” is becoming an outdated or even a potentially cringe internet relic, similar to how the phrase “web series” faded from use online.

So what do we call these formats instead? I don’t think we’re going to invent a new word, but instead repurpose an old one.

Bloomberg’s Ashley Carman noticed this change in her coverage of The Podcast Show in London this past May:

...two separate panelists made it clear they do not call their podcasts “podcasts.” Georgie Holt, chief executive at FlightStory, the company behind Steven Bartlett’s Diary of a CEO , said the team calls their programming “shows.” In a conversation on stage with me, Max Cutler, founder of Pave Studios, said exactly the same thing.

Anecdotally I have heard this change of nomenclature from “podcasts” to “shows” internally here at Vox Media too, and echoed from my colleagues at other media companies as well.

Using the word “show” seems to be a more marketable term for advertising, especially when attaching celebrity names to the project. Pitching podcasts to advertisers sounds limiting and niche, but pitching a “show” — hey, that’s a place where they can get ears and eyes, and a definitive platform where the shows will live. Podcast creators want that Seth Meyers money.

Because of this, fans will likely begin calling them “shows” as well, the same way consumers started claiming internal marketing terms like “influencers” and “creators.”

We’re seeing the word fade from the hosts, too. There’s a recurring bit on The Adam Friedland Show now where guests call the show a podcast, and the titular host corrects them instantly, claiming it’s a talk show. Instead of the cliche “Find us wherever you get podcasts” sign-off, I’ve noticed many hosts are now pivoting more to the “like-and-subscribe” phrasing of YouTube culture.

These podcast shows are all starting to live together with non-podcast shows like Hot Ones, Chicken Shop Date, the Criterion Closet series, Tonight Show clips, etc. — so why limit them to a term that used to go hand-in-hand with iPods?

Unfortunately, all this also means that a lot of the openness of podcasting is slowly going away and becoming more centralized on platforms like YouTube and Netflix. YouTube says more than one billion people watch podcasts on its platform every month. It was reported by Bloomberg that Netflix is going to add podcasts to its streaming platform, developing its own shows and working with major networks like Spotify, iHeartMedia, and Sirius.

In fact, YouTube is starting to look more like Netflix. “Talk show–style podcasts” on YouTube are already considered to be the next generation of late night TV, especially with CBS signaling an end to investing in the genre by cancelling The Late Show with Stephen Colbert in 2026 (I can imagine a cheaper-made podcast going into CBS’s late night lineup instead) and celebrity press tours prioritizing YouTube over traditional network TV.

Next year, you probably won’t be recommending your favorite new podcast to your friend, but instead something you “watched on TV.”

Despite all this, I still think the audio-only format will stick around. After all, people still drive cars, and they aren’t typically looking at a screen for the whole three hours of a podcast. In fact, according to Edison Research, most podcast listening is done at home. It’s likely, though, that most audio-only podcasts will be from more independently run shows. Media companies will still publish audio versions of their video shows for the podcatcher apps, but they’re not the priority anymore.

As a result (and long overdue from the era of the iPod), I think the era of the term “podcast” is ending. Perhaps in the future, the question “What is a podcast?” will disappear in favor of “What was a podcast?”

These days when you want to engage with some media, you can choose from podcasts, videos, games, live performances — or books, one of the oldest and most popular ways to learn something new or escape (at least temporarily) from today’s troubled world.

We polled the staff of The Verge to find out what books they read over the past year that really struck a chord — because the books were enlightening, educational, or just enjoyable. Here are some of the answers we got. (And please let us know what your favorite reads were in 2025 in the comments.)

Screwing up is one of the inevitabilities of life, but dwelling on your own mistakes can get toxic — fast. In SNAFU: The Definitive Guide to History’s Greatest Screwups, Ed Helms breaks down dozens of blunders from the past 70 or so years. Sometimes a river gets so polluted that it catches fire (multiple times), or the US government conducts human experiments involving copious amounts of psychedelic drugs. Or it turns out that a pair of the 20th century’s greatest spies were also swingers. These things happen.While many of the events in the book are absolute tragedies, Helms infuses each chapter with a little bit of humor, mostly in pointing out how stupid the perpetrators are. It’s a relatively breezy book that’ll make you feel better about the time you accidentally overcooked microwave popcorn and smoked out your apartment.

I’ve been on a memoir kick this year, and this one knocked my socks off. Things in Nature Merely Grow explores Yiyun Li’s experience with grief after losing both of her teenage sons to suicide. This isn’t a light read by any means. The writing is honest, beautiful, sometimes aloof, and oftentimes devastating. But as someone who lost both parents relatively young, I felt strangely comforted by Li’s take on “the abyss” and “radical acceptance.”

“Some consolations are strictly and purely for the consolers themselves. Please hold on to your silver linings, as I must decline.” Some might say this book is unnecessarily harsh in its unflinching look at loss, but that line stuck with me as the truest reflection of how I felt for the longest time. I recommend it to anyone struggling with isolation after loss. (Some honorable mentions for memoirs: Educated by Tara Westover, I’m Glad My Mom Died by ​​Jennette McCurdy, and Maybe You Should Talk to Someone by Lori Gottlieb.)

I’d somehow never read any Le Guin until this year, and while I’ve been told that The Dispossessed is an odd place to start, it’s the book I had around, having borrowed it from a friend who knows how long ago. I would feel bad for having hung onto it so long, but the erosion of private property rights is surprisingly on-brand for the book. Its exploration of a moon with a (mostly) functional anarchist society, and the arch-capitalist planet its community sprung off from, holds a pretty unflinching mirror up against our world, and although over 50 years old, it’s about as relevant as ever.

Don’t go in expecting a rollercoaster plot, but if you like the sound of capitalist critique interspersed with an exploration of how academic bureaucracy works under anarchism, boy do I have the book for you.

After watching 3 Body Problem on Netflix, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. So naturally, I just had to delve into the book series to see what details the adaptation left out — and it doesn’t disappoint. Cixin Liu’s The Three-Body Problem details the origins of Ye Wenjie, an astrophysicist who’s forced to work on a secretive military project during China’s Cultural Revolution in the late ‘60s. While stationed at the secluded Red Coast Base, Wenjie makes a decision that changes the fate of humanity forever, culminating in a series of unsettling events years later that lead some scientists to question everything they know about the laws of physics. In the present day, Wang Miao, a level-headed nanotechnologist, attempts to brush off strange hallucinations until he’s drawn to a virtual reality game that he discovers is linked to a larger conspiracy tied to Wenjie.

After I finished the first story in Theodora Goss’ weird fiction collection, Letters from an Imaginary Country, I was hooked. Titled “The Mad Scientist’s Daughter,” it is the first-person account of a group of 19th century female “monsters” from well-known horror literature such as Frankenstein, The Island of Dr. Moreau, and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, among others. The women, who are distinctly other than the perceived norm — either because of their abilities or their appearance, or both — must support each other while navigating the narrow mores of Victorian society. Most of the stories in this collection seem to center on people who are somehow different, outside of their societies, and trying to cope (sometimes successfully, sometimes not) with those differences. I sped through the first story, and while I haven’t finished the book quite yet, I’m certainly looking forward to it.

As a published author myself, I’m always looking for novels that combine a propulsive plot, richly drawn characters, and thought-provoking social commentary to inspire my own craft. What Kind of Paradise by Janelle Brown fits that bill completely. It’s an exhilarating novel set in the ’90s about a teenage girl named Jane who escapes her rural life in Montana, where she lives in isolation with her father. Motivated by his fears of technology and progress, her father keeps the two of them living off the grid, banning Jane from using the internet and homeschooling her with old books. But as Jane gets older, she becomes increasingly curious about the outside world and about her father’s mysterious past in San Francisco. She also becomes an accidental accomplice in one of his crimes, and it’s this horrific realization that sends her to the Bay Area to find out why he is the way he is.

What Kind of Paradise is a brilliantly drawn examination of the impact of technology, how deeply your family can influence your identity, and the kinds of doomsday fears that drive people to madness. It’s part coming-of-age tale, part thriller, part family drama — you can’t quite classify it, but its ingenious genre-bending is one of my favorite things about it. If you’re looking to really sink your teeth into a story, this is the one. I promise you will devour it whole.

People will tell you Moby-Dick is Melville’s masterpiece. This is wrong, but understandable — it flatters Americans to think that we bear some resemblance to the insane Ahab, speaking in Shakespearean blank verse as we speed toward our doom.

Melville’s actual masterpiece is his last book, The Confidence-Man, one of the meanest and truest things ever written about this country. It takes place on April Fools’ Day, on a riverboat full of scammers and other assorted riffraff; one of them may or may not be literally Satan. Among the scams being perpetrated on the ship: selling stock of a struggling company, bringing “the Wall Street spirit” to charity, hawking supplements, finessing a free haircut, and forming a cult. There are nasty caricatures of Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allen Poe, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Henry David Thoreau, all funny. The book is by turns bizarre, bitter, hopeful, and oddly credulous. Read it — you will recognize several of its characters immediately, as their current incarnations have been barely updated in 2025. Sure, The Confidence-Man isn’t as pretty as Moby-Dick, but then, the truth rarely is.

It’s rare for a book about a company’s successful founding to be a page-turner. Usually, corporate drama centers on the company’s fall, its unraveling, or the criminal activity of its leaders. Not so in Empire of AI by Karen Hao. This is a book about OpenAI’s founding and growth, and it’s truly a riveting read. (It also helps that Hao is a lovely writer.) She tracks the personality quirks of visionary leaders over time. She monitors the changing corporate mission. And yes, she dives into The Drama, when Sam Altman was temporarily ousted from OpenAI by the board. But she doesn’t just stay in Silicon Valley. You travel with her to countries in Africa and South America to see how AI is impacting societies there.

I’ve heard complaints that Hao’s personal views on AI, and the technology’s societal repercussions come off a little heavy-handed. She does include opinions, often tucked away at the end of chapters, and it feels all okay to me. Her expertise in the field gained through years of covering OpenAI is a useful perspective for those of us trying to make sense of a rapidly growing industry. You can read the facts presented in her book and come to different conclusions.

Honestly, the less you know going in, the better this book might be. The Everlasting by Alix E. Harrow is a love story about a lady knight. It’s also a masterful deconstruction of Arthuriana, the way mythology works, and the very idea of nationalism itself. A brilliant, bittersweet puzzle box that solves itself incredibly satisfyingly at the end. I only wish I could read it for the first time again.

Agustina Bazterrica’s last novel, Tender is the Flesh, is unflinchingly bleak. And The Unworthy isn’t exactly an uplifting tale. It’s a postapocalyptic story set in the convent of a cult that “rewards” its Enlightened members with physical mutilation. But, where Flesh reveled in its gore, The Unworthy offers moments of genuine beauty and hope.

There are still plenty of passages that showcase Bazterrica’s skills at making your skin crawl, but perhaps the most impressive thing about the book is how much world-building this epistolary novel manages to do in a mere 177 pages — you could easily blow through this in a day. If you’re a fan of The Handmaid’s Tale by Margaret Atwood or I Who Have Never Known Men by Jacqueline Harpman, I don’t think you’ll want to miss out on this excellent piece of Argentinian feminist horror.

I read Chris Hayes’ book about attention, The Sirens’ Call, early in the year and found myself returning to it regularly. Two insights were particularly useful. The first is from the computer scientist Herbert Simon: that as the quantity of information increases, attention becomes the scarcest and therefore most valuable resource — information can be infinite, but we have only so many hours in the day to spend consuming it.

The second is that it is easier to capture attention than to hold it. In Hayes’ example, it’s an easier challenge to get everyone’s attention in a room by, say, screaming or tearing off your clothes, than to keep the room rapt for an hour with a monologue. It follows that if you move public discourse, politics, or culture onto platforms where everyone can say anything at all times, and where the platforms are financially incentivized to keep everyone there transfixed as long as possible and therefore reward their best attention-getters, an arms race occurs that ends in a rapid-fire media environment that is impossible to look away from but also fractured, incoherent, and generally bad for everyone’s brains.

            <h2>Welcome to Kenya’s Great Carbon Valley: a bold new gamble to fight climate change</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/22/1130153/geothermal-energy-carbon-capture-kenya-climate-solution/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The earth around Lake Naivasha, a shallow freshwater basin in south-central Kenya, does not seem to want to lie still.

Ash from nearby Mount Longonot, which erupted as recently as the 1860s, remains in the ground. Obsidian caves and jagged stone towers preside over the steam that spurts out of fissures in the soil and wafts from pools of boiling-hot water—produced by magma that, in some areas, sits just a few miles below the surface.

It’s a landscape born from violent geologic processes some 25 million years ago, when the Nubian and Somalian tectonic plates pulled apart. That rupture cut a depression in the earth some 4,000 miles long—from East Africa up through the Middle East—to create what’s now called the Great Rift Valley.

This volatility imbues the land with vast potential, much of it untapped. The area, no more than a few hours’ drive from Nairobi, is home to five geothermal power stations, which harness the clouds of steam to generate about a quarter of Kenya’s electricity. But some energy from this process escapes into the atmosphere, while even more remains underground for lack of demand.

In June, just north of the lake in the small but strategically located town of Gilgil, the startup began running a high-stakes test. It’s harnessing some of that excess energy to power four prototypes of a machine that promises to remove carbon dioxide from the air in a manner that the company says is efficient, affordable, and—crucially—scalable.

In the short term, the impact will be small—each device’s initial capacity is just 60 tons per year of CO2—but the immediate goal is simply to demonstrate that carbon removal here is possible. The longer-term vision is far more ambitious: to prove that direct air capture (DAC), as the process is known, can be a powerful tool to help the world keep temperatures from rising to ever more dangerous levels.

“We believe we are doing what we can here in Kenya to address climate change and lead the charge for positioning Kenya as a climate vanguard,” Specioser Mutheu, Octavia’s communications lead, told me when I visited the country last year.

The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has stated that in order to keep the world from warming more than 1.5 °C over preindustrial levels (the threshold set out in the Paris Agreement), or even the more realistic but still difficult 2 °C, it will need to significantly reduce future fossil-fuel emissions—and also pull from the atmosphere billions of tons of carbon that have already been released.

Some argue that DAC, which uses mechanical and chemical processes to suck carbon dioxide from the air and store it in a stable form (usually underground), is the best way to do that. It’s a technology with immense promise, offering the possibility that human ingenuity and innovation can get us out of the same mess that development caused in the first place.

Last year, the world’s largest DAC plant, Mammoth, came online in Iceland, offering the eventual capacity to remove up to 36,000 tons of CO₂ per year—roughly equal to the emissions of 7,600 gas-powered cars. The idea is that DAC plants like this one will remove and permanently store carbon and create carbon credits that can be purchased by corporations, governments, and local industrial producers, which will collectively help keep the world from experiencing the most dangerous effects of climate change.

Now, Octavia and a growing number of other companies, politicians, and investors from Africa, the US, and Europe are betting that Kenya’s unique environment holds the keys to reaching this lofty goal—which is why they’re pushing a sweeping vision to remake the Great Rift Valley into the “Great Carbon Valley.” And they hope to do so in a way that provides a genuine economic boost for Kenya, while respecting the rights of the Indigenous people who live on this land. If they can do so, the project could not just give a needed jolt to the DAC industry—it could also provide proof of concept for DAC across the Global South, which is particularly vulnerable to the ravages of climate change despite bearing very little responsibility for it.

But DAC is also a controversial technology, unproven at scale and wildly expensive to operate. In May, an Icelandic news outlet published an investigation into Climeworks, which runs the Mammoth plant, finding that it didn’t even pull in enough carbon dioxide to offset its own emissions, let alone the emissions of other companies.

Critics also argue that the electricity DAC requires can be put to better use cleaning up our transportation systems, heating our homes, and powering other industries that still rely largely on fossil fuels. What’s more, they say that relying on DAC can give polluters an excuse to delay the transition to renewables indefinitely. And further complicating this picture is shrinking demand from governments and corporations that would be DAC’s main buyers, which has left some experts questioning whether the industry will even survive.

Carbon removal is a technology that seems always on the verge of kicking in but never does, says Fadhel Kaboub, a Tunisian economist and advocate for an equitable green transition. “You need billions of dollars of investment in it, and it’s not delivering, and it’s not going to deliver anytime soon. So why do we put the entire future of the planet in the hands of a few people and a technology that doesn’t deliver?”

Layered on top of concerns about the viability and wisdom of DAC is a long history of distrust from the Maasai people who have called the Great Rift Valley home for generations but have been displaced in waves by energy companies coming in to tap the land’s geothermal reserves. And many of those remaining don’t even have access to the electricity generated by these plants.

It’s an immensely complicated landscape to navigate. But if the project can indeed make it through, Benjamin Sovacool, an energy policy researcher and director of the Boston University Institute for Global Sustainability, sees immense potential for countries that have been historically marginalized from climate policy and green energy investment. Though he’s skeptical about DAC as a near-term climate solution, he says these nations could still see big benefits from what could be a multitrillion-dollar industry.

“[Of] all the technologies we have available to fight climate change, the idea of reversing it by sucking CO2 out of the air and storing it is really attractive. It’s something even an ordinary person can just get,” Sovacool says. “If we’re able to do DAC at scale, it could be the next huge energy transition.”

But first, of course, the Great Carbon Valley has to actually deliver.

The “Great Carbon Valley” is both a broad vision for the region and a company founded to shepherd that vision into reality.

Bilha Ndirangu, a 42-year-old MIT electrical engineering graduate who grew up in Nairobi, has long worried about the impacts of climate change on Kenya. But she doesn’t want the country to be a mere victim of rising temperatures, she tells me; she hopes to see it become a source of climate solutions. So in 2021, Ndirangu cofounded Jacob’s Ladder Africa, a nonprofit with the goal of preparing African workers for green industries.

She also began collaborating with the Kenyan entrepreneur James Irungu Mwangi, the CEO of Africa Climate Ventures, an investment firm focused on building and accelerating climate-smart businesses. He’d been working on an idea that spoke to their shared belief in the potential for the country’s vast geothermal capacity; the plan was to find buyers for Kenya’s extra geothermal energy in order to kick-start the development of even more renewable power. One energy-hungry, climate-positive industry stood out: direct air capture of carbon dioxide.

The Great Rift Valley was the key to this vision. The thinking was that it could provide the cheap energy needed to power affordable DAC at scale while offering an ideal geology to effectively store carbon deep underground after it was extracted from the air. And with nearly 90% of the country’s grid already powered by renewable energy, DAC wouldn’t be siphoning power away from other industries that need it. Instead, attracting DAC to Kenya could provide the boost needed for energy providers to build out their infrastructure and expand the grid—ideally connecting the roughly 25% of people in the country who lack electricity and reducing scenarios in which power has to be rationed.

“This push for renewable energy and the decarbonization of industries is providing us with a once-in-a-lifetime sort of opportunity,” Ndirangu tells me.

So in 2023, the pair founded Great Carbon Valley, a project development company whose mission is attracting DAC companies to the area, along with other energy-intensive industries looking for renewable power.

It has already brought on high-profile companies like the Belgian DAC startup Sirona Technologies, the French DAC company Yama, and Climeworks, the Swiss company that operates Mammoth and another DAC plant in Iceland (and was on MIT Technology Review’s 10 Breakthrough Technologies list in 2022, and the list of Climate Tech Companies to Watch in 2023). All are planning on launching pilot projects in Kenya in the coming years, with Climeworks announcing plans to complete its Kenyan DAC plant by 2028. GCV has also partnered with Cella, an American carbon-storage company that works with Octavia, and is facilitating permits for the Icelandic company Carbfix, which injects the carbon from Climeworks’ DAC facilities.

“Climate change is disproportionately impacting this part of the world, but it’s also changing the rules of the game all over the world,” Cella CEO and cofounder Corey Pattison tells me, explaining the draw of Mwangi and Ndirangu’s concept. “This is also an opportunity to be entrepreneurial and creative in our thinking, because there are all of these assets that places like Kenya have.”

Not only can the country offer cheap and abundant renewable energy, but supporters of Kenyan DAC hope that the young and educated local workforce can supply the engineers and scientists needed to build out this infrastructure. In turn, the business could open opportunities to the country’s roughly 6 million un- or under-employed youths.

“It’s not a one-off industry,” Ndirangu says, highlighting her faith in the idea that jobs will flow from green industrialization. Engineers will be needed to monitor the DAC facilities, and the additional demand for renewable power will create jobs in the energy sector, along with related services like water and hospitality.

“You’re developing a whole range of infrastructure to make this industry possible,” she adds. “That infrastructure is not just good for the industry—it’s also just good for the country.”

In June of last year, I walked up a dirt path to the HQ of Octavia Carbon, just off Nairobi’s Eastern Bypass Road, on the far outskirts of the city.

The staffers I met on my tour exuded the kind of boundless optimism that’s common in early-stage startups. “People used to write academic articles about the fact that no human will ever be able to run a marathon in less than two hours,” Octavia CEO Martin Freimüller told me that day. The Kenyan marathon runner Eliud Kipchoge broke that barrier in a race in 2019. A mural of him features prominently on the wall, along with the athlete’s slogan, “No human is limited.”

“It’s impossible, until Kenya does it,” Freimüller added.

Although not an official partner of Ndirangu’s Great Carbon Valley venture, Octavia aligns with the larger vision, he told me. The company got its start in 2022, when Freimüller, an Austrian development consultant, met Duncan Kariuki, an engineering graduate from the University of Nairobi, in the OpenAir Collective, an online forum devoted to carbon removal. Kariuki introduced Freimüller to his classmates Fiona Mugambi and Mike Bwondera, and the four began working on a DAC prototype, first in lab space borrowed from the university and later in an apartment. It didn’t take long for neighbors to complain about the noise, and within six months, the operation had moved to its current warehouse.

That same year, they announced their first prototype, affectionately called Thursday after the day it was unveiled at a Nairobi Climate Network event. Soon, Octavia was showing off its tech to high-profile visitors including King Charles III and President Joe Biden’s ambassador to Kenya, Meg Whitman.

Three years later, the team has more than 40 engineers and has built its 12th DAC unit: a metal cylinder about the size of a large washing machine, containing a chemical filter using an amine, an organic compound derived from ammonia. (Octavia declined to provide further details about the arrangement of the filter inside the machine because the company is awaiting approval of a patent for the design.)

Hannah Wanjau, an engineer at the company, explained how it works: Fans draw air from the outside across the filter, causing carbon dioxide (which is acidic) to react with the basic amine and form a carbonate salt. When that mixture is heated inside a vacuum to 80 to 100 °C, the CO2 is released, now as a gas, and collected in a special chamber, while the amine can be reused for the next round of carbon capture.

The amine absorption method has been used in other DAC plants around the world, including those operated by Climeworks, but Octavia’s project stands apart on several key fronts. Wanjau explained that its technology is tailored to suit the local climate; the company has adjusted the length of time for absorption and the temperature for CO2 release, making it a potential model for other countries in the tropics.

And then there’s its energy source: The device operates on more than 80% thermal energy, which in the field will consist of the extra geothermal energy that the power plants don’t convert into electricity. This energy is typically released into the atmosphere, but it will be channeled instead to Octavia’s machines. What’s more, the device’s modular design can fit inside a shipping container, allowing the company to easily deploy dozens of these units once the demand is there, Mutheu told me.

This technology is being tested in the field in Gilgil, where Mutheu told me the company is “continuing to capture and condition CO₂ as part of our ongoing operations and testing cycles.” (She declined to provide specific data or results at this stage.)

Once the CO2 is captured, it will be heated and pressurized. Then it will be pumped to a nearby storage facility operated by Cella, where the company will inject the gas into fissures underground. The region’s special geology again offers an advantage: Much of the rock found underground here is basalt, a volcanic mineral that contains high concentrations of calcium and magnesium ions. They react with carbon dioxide to form substances like calcite, dolomite, and magnesite, locking the carbon atoms away in the form of solid minerals.

This process is more durable than other forms of carbon storage, making it potentially more attractive to buyers of carbon credits, says Pattison, the Cella CEO. Non-geologic carbon mitigation methods, such as cookstove replacement programs or nature-based solutions like tree planting, have recently been rocked by revelations of fraud or exaggeration. The money for Cella’s pilot, which will see the injection of 200 tons of CO2 this year, has come mainly from the Frontier advance market commitment, under which a group of companies including Stripe, Google, Shopify, Meta, and others has collectively pledged to spend $1 billion on carbon removal by 2030.

These projects have already opened up possibilities for young Kenyans like Wanjau. She told me there were not a lot of opportunities for aspiring mechanical engineers like her to design and test their own devices; many of her classmates were working for construction or oil companies, or were unemployed. But almost immediately after graduation, Wanjau began working for Octavia.

“I’m happy that I’m trying to solve a problem that’s a real-world issue,” she told me. “Not many people in Africa get a chance to do that.”

Despite the vast enthusiasm from partners and investors, the Great Carbon Valley faces multiple challenges before Ndirangu and Mwangi’s vision can be fully realized.

Since its start, the venture has had to contend with “this perception that doing projects in Africa is risky,” says Ndirangu. Of the dozens of DAC facilities planned or in existence today, only a handful are in the Global South. Indeed, Octavia has described itself as the first DAC plant to be located there. “Even just selling Kenya as a destination for DAC was quite a challenge,” she says.

So Ndirangu played up Kenya’s experience developing geothermal resources, as well as local engineering talent and a lower cost of labor. GCV has also offered to work with the Kenyan government to help companies secure the proper permits to break ground as soon as possible.

Ndirangu says that she’s already seen “a real appetite” from power producers who want to build out more renewable-energy infrastructure, but at the same time they’re waiting for proof of demand. She envisions that once that power is in place, lots of other industries—from data centers to producers of green steel, green ammonia, and sustainable aviation fuels—will consider basing themselves in Kenya, attracting more than a dozen projects to the valley in the next few years.

But recent events could dampen demand (which some experts already worried was insufficient). Global governments are retreating from climate action, particularly in the US. The Trump administration has dramatically slashed funding for development related to climate change and renewable energy. The Department of Energy appears poised to terminate a $50 million grant to a proposed Louisiana DAC plant that would have been partially operated by Climeworks, and in May, not long after that announcement, the company said it was cutting 22% of its staff.

At the same time, many companies that would have likely been purchasers of carbon credits—and that a few years ago had voluntarily pledged to reduce or eliminate their carbon emissions—are quietly walking back their commitments. Over the long term, experts warn, there are limits to the amount of carbon removal that companies will ever voluntarily buy. They argue that governments will ultimately have to pay for it—or require polluters to do so.

Further compounding all these challenges are costs. Critics say DAC investments are a waste of time and money compared with other forms of carbon drawdown. As of mid-December, carbon removal credits in the European Union’s Emissions Trading System, one of the world’s largest carbon markets, were priced at around $84 per ton. The average price per DAC credit, for comparison, is nearly $450. Natural processes like reforestation absorb millions of tons of carbon annually and are far cheaper (though programs to harness them for carbon credits are beset with their own controversies). Ultimately, DAC continues to operate on a small scale, removing only about 10,000 metric tons of CO2 each year.

Even if DAC suppliers do manage to push past these obstacles, there are still thorny questions coming from inside Kenya. Groups like Power Shift Africa, a Nairobi-based think tank that advocates for climate action on the continent, have derided carbon credits as “pollution permits” and blamed them for delaying the move toward electrification.

“The ultimate goal of [carbon removal] is that you can say at the end, well, we can actually continue our emissions and just recapture them with this technology,” says Kaboub, the Tunisian economist, who has worked with Power Shift Africa. “So there&#39;s no need to end fossil fuels, which is why you get a lot of support from oil countries and companies.”

Another problem he sees is not limited to DAC but extends to the way that Kenya and other African nations are pursuing their goal of green industrialization. While Kenyan President William Ruto has courted international financial investment to turn Kenya into a green energy hub, his administration’s policies have deepened the country’s external debt, which in 2024 was equal to around 30% of its GDP. Geothermal energy development in Kenya has often been financed by loans from international institutions or other governments. As its debt has risen, the country has enacted national austerity measures that have sparked deadly protests.

Kenya may indeed have advantages over other countries, and DAC costs will most likely go down eventually. But some experts, such as Boston University’s Sovacool, aren’t quite sold on the idea that the Great Carbon Valley—or any DAC venture—can significantly mitigate climate change. Sovacool’s research has found that at best, DAC will be ready to deploy on the necessary scale by midcentury, much too late to make it a viable climate solution. And that’s if it can overcome additional costs—such as the losses associated with corruption in the energy sector, which Sovacool and others have found is a widespread problem in Kenya.

Nevertheless, others within the carbon removal industry remain more optimistic about DAC’s overall prospects and are particularly hopeful that Kenya can address some of the challenges the technology has encountered elsewhere. Cost is “not the most important thing,” says Erin Burns, executive director of Carbon180, a nonprofit that advocates for the removal and reuse of carbon dioxide. “There’s lots of things we pay for.” She notes that governments in Japan, Singapore, Canada, Australia, the European Union, and elsewhere are all looking at developing compliance markets for carbon, even though the US is stagnating on this front.

The Great Carbon Valley, she believes, stands poised to benefit from these developments. “It’s big. It’s visionary,” Burns says. “You’ve got to have some ambition here. This isn’t something that is like deploying a technology that’s widely deployed already. And that comes with an enormous potential for huge opportunity, huge gains.”

More than any external factor, the Great Carbon Valley’s future is perhaps most intimately intertwined with the restless earth on which it’s being built, and the community that has lived here for centuries.

To the Maasai people, nomadic pastoralists who inhabit swathes of Eastern Africa, including Kenya, this land around Lake Naivasha is “ol-karia,” meaning “ochre,” after the bright red clay found in abundance.

South of the lake is Hell’s Gate National Park, a 26-square-mile nature reserve where the region’s five geothermal power complexes—with a sixth under construction—churn on top of the numerous steam vents. The first geothermal power plant here was brought into service in 1981 by KenGen, a majority-state-owned electricity company; it was named Olkaria.

But for decades most of the Maasai haven’t had access to that electricity. And many of them have been forced off the land in a wave of evictions. In 2014, construction on a KenGen geothermal complex expelled more than 2,000 people and led to a number of legal complaints. At the same time, locals living near a different, privately owned geothermal complex 50 miles north of Naivasha have complained of noise and air pollution; in March, a Kenyan court revoked the operating license of one of the project’s three plants.

Neither Octavia or Cella is powered by output from these two geothermal producers, but activists have warned that similar environmental and social harms could resurface if demand for new geothermal infrastructure grows in Kenya—demand that could be driven by DAC.

Ndirangu says she believes some of the complaints about displacement are “exaggerated,” but she nonetheless acknowledges the need for stronger community engagement, as does Octavia. In the long term, Ndirangu says, she plans to provide job training to residents living near the affected areas and integrate them into the industry, although she also says those plans need to be realistic. “You don’t want to create the wrong expectation that you will hire everyone from the community,” she says.

That’s part of the problem for Maasai activists like Agnes Koilel, a teacher living near the Olkaria geothermal field. Despite past promises of employment at the power plants, the jobs that are offered are lower-paying positions in cleaning or security. “Maasai people are not [as] employed as they think,” she says.

DAC is a small industry, and it can’t do everything. But if it’s going to become as big as Ndirangu, Freimüller, and other proponents of the Great Carbon Valley hope it will be, creating jobs and driving Kenya’s green industrialization, communities like Koilel’s will be among those most directly affected—much as they are by climate change.

When I asked Koilel what she thought about DAC development near her home, she told me she had never heard of the Great Carbon Valley idea, or of carbon removal in general. She wasn’t necessarily against geothermal power development on principle, or opposed to any of the industries that might push it to expand. She just wants to see some benefits, like a health center for her community. She wants to reverse the evictions that have pushed her neighbors off their land. And she wants electricity—the same kind that would power the fans and pumps of future DAC hubs.

Power “is generated from these communities,” Koilel said. “But they themselves do not have that light.”

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/22/1130288/gene-therapies-muscle-growth-erectile-dysfunction-radical-longevity/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At some point next month, a handful of volunteers will be injected with two experimental gene therapies as part of an unusual clinical trial. The drugs are potential longevity therapies, says Ivan Morgunov, the CEO of Unlimited Bio, the company behind the trial. His long-term goal: to achieve radical human life extension.

The 12 to 15 volunteers—who will be covering their own travel and treatment costs—will receive a series of injections in the muscles of their arms and legs. One of the therapies is designed to increase the blood supply to those muscles. The other is designed to support muscle growth. The company hopes to see improvements in strength, endurance, and recovery. It also plans to eventually trial similar therapies in the scalp (for baldness) and penis (for erectile dysfunction).

But some experts are concerned that the trial involves giving multiple gene therapies to small numbers of healthy people. It will be impossible to draw firm conclusions from such a small study, and the trial certainly won’t reveal anything about longevity, says Holly Fernandez Lynch, a lawyer and medical ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

Unlimited Bio’s muscle growth therapy is already accessible at clinics in Honduras and Mexico, says Morgunov—and the company is already getting some publicity. Khloe Kardashian tagged Unlimited Bio in a Facebook post about stem-cell treatments she and her sister Kim had received at the Eterna clinic in Mexico in August. And earlier this week, the biohacking influencer Dave Asprey posted an Instagram Reel of himself receiving one of the treatments in Mexico; it was shared with 1.3 million Instagram followers. In the video, Eterna’s CEO, Adeel Khan, says that the therapy can “help with vascular health systemically.” “I’m just upgrading my system for a little while to reduce my age and reduce my vascular risk,” Asprey said.

Gene therapies typically work by introducing new genetic code into the body’s cells. This code is then able to make proteins. Existing approved gene therapies have typically been developed for severe diseases in which the target proteins are either missing or mutated.

But several groups are exploring gene therapies for healthy people. One of these companies is Minicircle, which developed a gene therapy to increase production of follistatin, a protein found throughout the body that has many roles and is involved in muscle growth. The company says this treatment will increase muscle mass—and help people live longer. Minicircle is based in Próspera, a special economic zone in Honduras with its own bespoke regulatory system. Anyone can visit the local clinic and receive that therapy, for a reported price of $25,000. And many have, including the wealthy longevity influencer Bryan Johnson, who promoted the therapy in a Netflix documentary.

Unlimited Bio’s Morgunov, a Russian-Israeli computer scientist, was inspired by Minicircle’s story. He is also interested in longevity. Specifically, he’s committed to radical life extension and has said that he could be part of “the last generation throughout human history to die from old age.” He believes the biggest “bottleneck” slowing progress toward anti-aging or lifespan-extending therapies is drug regulation. So he, too, incorporated his own biotech company in Próspera.

“A company like ours couldn’t exist outside of Próspera,” says Unlimited Bio’s chief operating officer, Vladimir Leshko.

There, Morgunov and his colleagues are exploring two gene therapies. One of these is another follistatin therapy, which the team hopes will increase muscle mass. The other codes for a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF. This compound is known to encourage the growth of blood vessels. Morgunov and his colleagues hope the result will be increased muscle growth, enhanced muscle repair, and longer life. Neither treatment is designed to alter a recipient’s DNA, and therefore it won’t be inherited by future generations.

The combination of the two therapies could benefit healthy people and potentially help them live longer, says Leshko, a former electrical engineer and professional poker player who retrained in biomedical engineering. “We would say that it’s a preventive-slash-enhancing indication,” he says. “Potentially participants can experience faster recovery from exercise, more strength, and more endurance.”

Of the 12 to 15 volunteers who participate in the trial, half will receive only the VEGF therapy. The other half will receive both the VEGF and the follistatin therapies. The treatments will involve a series of injections throughout large muscles in the arms and legs, says Morgunov.

He is confident that the VEGF therapy is safe. It was approved in Russia over a decade ago to treat lower-limb ischemia—a condition that can cause pain, numbness, and painful ulcers in the legs and feet. Morgunov reckons that around 10,000 people in Russia have already had the drug, although he says he hasn’t “done deep fact-checking on that.”

VEGF is a powerful compound, says Seppo Ylä-Herttuala, a professor of molecular medicine at the University of Eastern Finland who has been studying VEGF and potential VEGF therapies for decades. He doesn’t know how many people have had VEGF gene therapy in Russia. But he does know that the safety of the therapy will depend on how much is administered and where. Previous attempts to inject the therapy into the heart, for example, have resulted in edema, a sometimes fatal buildup of fluid. Even if the therapy is injected elsewhere, VEGF can travel around the body, he says. If it gets to the eye, for example, it could cause blindness. Leshko counters that the VEGF should remain where it is injected, and any other circulation in the body, if it occurs, should be short-lived.

And while the therapy has been approved in Russia, there’s a reason it hasn’t been approved elsewhere, says Ylä-Herttuala: The clinical trials were not as rigorous as they could have been. While “it probably works in some patients,” he says, the evidence to support the use of this therapy is weak. At any rate, he adds, VEGF will only support the growth of blood vessels—it won’t tackle aging.  “VEGF is not a longevity drug,” he says.

Leshko points to a 2021 study in mice, which suggested that a lack of VEGF activity might drive aging in the rodents. “We’re convinced it qualifies as a potential longevity drug,” he says.

There is even less data about follistatin. Minicircle, the company selling another follistatin gene therapy, has not published any rigorous clinical trial data. So far, much of the evidence for follistatin’s effects comes from research in rodents, says Ylä-Herttuala.

Clinical trials like this one should gather more information, both about the therapies and about the methods used to get those therapies into the body. Unlimited Bio’s VEGF therapy will be delivered via a circular piece of genetic code called a plasmid. Its follistatin therapy, on the other hand, will be delivered via an adeno-associated virus (AAV). Plasmid therapies are easier to make, and they have a shorter lifespan in the body—only a matter of days. They are generally considered to be safer than AAV therapies. AAV therapies, on the other hand, tend to stick around for months, says Ylä-Herttuala. And they can trigger potentially dangerous immune reactions.

It’s debatable whether healthy people should be exposed to these risks, says Fernandez Lynch. The technology “still has serious questions about its safety and effectiveness,” even for people with life-threatening diseases, she says. “If you are a healthy person, the risk of harm is more substantial because it’ll be more impactful on your life.”

But Leshko is adamant. “Over 120,000 humans die DAILY from age-related causes,” he wrote in an email. “Building ‘ethical’ barriers around ‘healthy’ human (in fact, aging human) trials is unethical.” Morgunov did not respond to a request for comment.

Some people want to take those risks anyway. In his video, the biohacker influencer Asprey—who has publicly stated that he’s “going to live to 180”—described VEGF as a “longevity compound,” and Eterna’s CEO Khan, who delivered the treatment, described it as “the ultimate upgrade.” Neither Asprey nor Khan clinic responded to requests for comment.

Michael Gusmano, a professor of health policy at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, worries that this messaging might give trial participants unrealistic expectations about how they might benefit. There is “huge potential for therapeutic misconception when you have some kind of celebrity online influencer touting something about which there is relatively sparse scientific evidence,” he says. In reality, he adds, “the only thing you can guarantee is that [the volunteers] will be contributing to our knowledge of how this intervention works.”

“I would certainly not recommend that anyone I know enter into such a trial,” says Gusmano.

The muscle study is only the first step. The Unlimited Bio team hopes to trial the VEGF therapy for baldness and erectile dysfunction, too. Leshko points to research in mice that links high VEGF levels to larger, denser hair follicles. He hopes to test a series of VEGF therapy injections into the scalps of volunteers. Morgunov, who is largely bald, has already started to self-experiment with the approach.

An erectile dysfunction trial may follow. “That one we think has great potential because injecting gene therapy into the penis sounds exciting,” says Leshko. A protocol for that trial has not yet been finalized, but he imagines it would involve “five to 10” injections.

Ylä-Herttuala isn’t optimistic about either approach. Hair growth is largely hormonal, he says. And injecting anything into a penis risks damaging it (although Leshko points out that a similar approach was taken by another company almost 20 years ago). Injecting a VEGF gene therapy into the penis would also risk edema there, Ylä-Herttuala adds.

And he points out that we already have some treatments for hair loss and erectile dysfunction. While they aren’t perfect, their existence does raise the bar for any potential future therapies—not only do they have to be safe and effective, but they must be safer or more effective than existing ones.

That doesn’t mean the trials will flop. No small trial can be definitive, but it could still provide some insight into how these drugs are working. It is possible that the therapies will increase muscle mass, at least, and that this could be beneficial to the healthy recipients, says Ylä-Herttuala.

Before our call, he had taken a look at Unlimited Bio’s website, which carries the tagline “The Most Advanced Rejuvenation Solution.” “They promise a lot,” he said. “I hope it’s true.”

China figured out how to sell EVs. Now it has to bury their batteries.

In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road.

It’s a weird time to be an AI doomer.This small but influential community believes, in the simplest terms, that AI could get so good it could be bad—very, very bad—for humanity.The doomer crowd has had some notable success over the past several years: including helping shape AI policy coming from the Biden administration. But a number of developments over the past six months have put them on the back foot. Talk of an AI bubble has overwhelmed the discourse as tech companies continue to invest in multiple Manhattan Projects’ worth of data centers without any certainty that future demand will match what they’re building.So where does this leave the doomers? We decided to ask some of the movement’s biggest names to see if the recent setbacks and general vibe shift had altered their views. See what they had to say in our story.—Garrison Lovely

Synthesia’s AI clones are more expressive than ever. Soon they’ll be able to talk back.

Earlier this summer, I visited the AI company Synthesia to create a hyperrealistic AI-generated avatar of me. The company’s avatars are a decent barometer of just how dizzying progress has been in AI over the past few years, so I was curious just how accurately its latest AI model, introduced last month, could replicate me.I found my avatar as unnerving as it is technically impressive. It’s slick enough to pass as a high-definition recording of a chirpy corporate speech, and if you didn’t know me, you’d probably think that’s exactly what it was.My avatar shows how it’s becoming ever-harder to distinguish the artificial from the real. And before long, these avatars will even be able to talk back to us. But how much better can they get? And what might interacting with AI clones do to us? Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard!

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you. We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.
