            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/mother-of-one-of-elon-musks-offspring-sues-xai-over-sexualized-deepfakes/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ashley St Clair, the influencer and mother of one of Elon Musk’s children, has sued the billionaire’s AI company, accusing its Grok chatbot of creating fake sexual imagery of her without her consent.

In the lawsuit, filed in New York state court, St Clair alleged that xAI’s Grok first created an AI-generated or altered image of her in a bikini earlier this month.

St Clair claims she made a request to xAI that no further such images be made, but nevertheless “countless sexually abusive, intimate, and degrading deepfake content of St. Clair [were] produced and distributed publicly by Grok.”

In one case, a photo of St Clair from when she was 14 years old was altered by Grok to undress her and put her in a bikini, according to the court filing.

St Clair is a conservative influencer with about 1 million followers on X and the mother of one of Musk’s children. The billionaire entrepreneur has espoused pronatalist views, arguing in support of increasing birth rates, and has fathered at least 14 children with several different women.

After reporting the images to xAI, St Clair’s account on the X social media platform was stripped of its verification checkmark, premium subscription, and ability to monetize her posts, the filing said.

The case has now been moved to federal court. xAI, which runs X, did not respond to a request for comment.

The news comes as xAI and Musk have come under fire over fake sexualized images of women and children, which proliferated on the platform this year, particularly after Musk jokingly shared an AI-altered post of himself in a bikini.

Over the past week, the issue has prompted threats of fines and bans in the EU, UK, and France, as well as investigations by the California attorney-general and Britain’s Ofcom regulator. Grok has also been banned in Indonesia and Malaysia.

On Wednesday, xAI took action to restrict the image-generation function on its Grok AI model to block the chatbot from undressing users, insisting that it removed Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) and non-consensual nudity material.

St Clair, who has in recent months been increasingly critical of Musk, is also seeking a temporary restraining order to prevent xAI from generating images that undress her.

“Ms St Clair is humiliated, depressed, fearful for her life, angry and desperately in need of action from this court to protect her against xAI’s facilitation of this unfathomable nightmare,” lawyers wrote in a filing seeking the restraining order.

xAI filed a lawsuit against St Clair in Texas on Thursday, claiming she had breached the company’s terms of service by bringing her lawsuit against the company in a New York court instead of in Texas.

Earlier this week, Musk also said on X that he would be filing for “full custody” of their 1-year-old son Romulus, after St Clair apologized for sharing posts critical of transgender people in the past. Musk, who has a transgender child, has repeatedly been critical of transgender people and the rights of trans individuals.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Welcome to Edition 8.25 of the Rocket Report! All eyes are on Florida this weekend as NASA rolls out the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft to its launch site in Florida for the Artemis II mission. NASA has not announced a launch date yet, and this will depend in part on how well a “wet dress rehearsal” goes with fueling the rocket. However, it is likely the rocket has a no-earlier-than launch date of February 8. Our own Stephen Clark will be in Florida for the rollout on Saturday, so be sure and check back here for coverage.

As always, we welcome reader submissions, and if you don’t want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.

MaiaSpace scores a major launch deal. The ArianeGroup subsidiary, created in 2022, has inked a major new launch contract with satellite operator Eutelsat, Le Monde reports. A significant portion of the 440 new satellites ordered by Eutelsat from Airbus to renew or expand its OneWeb constellation will be launched into orbit by the new Maia rocket. MaiaSpace previously signed two contracts: one with Exotrail for the launch of an orbital transfer, and the other for two satellites for the Toutatis mission, a defense system developed by U-Space.

A big win for the French firm … The first test launch of Maia is scheduled for the end of 2026, a year later than initially planned, at the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana. The first flights carrying OneWeb satellites are therefore likely to launch no earlier than 2027. Powered by liquid oxygen-methane propellant, Maia aims to be able to deliver up to 500 kg to low-Earth orbit when the first stage is recovered, and 1,500 kg when fully expendable.

Firefly announces Alpha upgrade plan. Firefly Aerospace said this week it was planning a “Block II” upgrade to its Alpha rocket that will “focus on enhancing reliability, streamlining producibility, and improving launch operations to further support commercial, civil, and national security mission demand.” Firefly’s upcoming Alpha Flight 7, targeted to launch in the coming weeks, will be the last flown in the current configuration and will serve as a test flight with multiple Block II subsystems in shadow mode.

Too many failures … “Firefly worked closely with customers and incorporated data and lessons learned from our first six Alpha launches and hundreds of hardware tests to make upgrades that increase reliability and manufacturability with consolidated parts, key configuration updates, and stronger structures built with automated machinery,” said Jason Kim, CEO of Firefly Aerospace. Speaking bluntly, reliability upgrades are needed. Of Alpha’s six launches to date, only two have been a complete success. (submitted by TFargo04)

Another PSLV launch failure. India’s first launch of 2026 ended in failure due to an issue with the third stage of its Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), Spaceflight Now reports. The mission, designated PSLV-C62, was also the second consecutive failure of this four-stage rocket, with both anomalies affecting the third stage. This time, 16 satellites were lost, including those of other nations. ISRO said it initiated a “detailed analysis” to determine the root cause of the anomaly.

Has been India’s workhorse rocket … The four-stage launch vehicle is a mixture of solid- and liquid- fueled stages. Both the first and third stages are solid-fueled, while the second and fourth stages are powered by liquid propulsion. The PSLV Rocket has flown in multiple configurations since it debuted in September 1993 and achieved 58 fully successful launches, with the payloads on those missions reaching their intended orbit.

US military invests in L3Harris rocket motors. The US government will invest $1 billion in L3Harris Technologies’ growing rocket motor business, guaranteeing a steady supply of the much-needed motors used in a wide range of ‍missiles such as Tomahawks and Patriot interceptors, CNBC reports. L3Harris said on Tuesday it ‌is planning ‌an IPO of its growing rocket motor business into a new publicly ​traded company backed by a $1 billion government convertible security investment. The securities will automatically convert to common equity when the company goes public later in 2026.

Shifting investment strategy … “We are fundamentally shifting our approach to securing our munitions supply chain,” said Michael Duffey, undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment. “By investing directly in suppliers we are building the resilient industrial ⁠base needed for the Arsenal of Freedom.” However, the government’s equity position in L3Harris could face blowback from L3Harris’ rivals, given that it creates a potentially significant conflict of interest for the US government. The Pentagon will have an ownership stake in a company that regularly bids on major defense and other government contracts.

First Ariane 64 to launch next month. Arianespace announced Thursday that it plans to launch the first variant of the Ariane 6 rocket with four solid rocket boosters on February 12 from French Guiana. The mission will also be the company’s first launch of Amazon Leo (formerly Project Kuiper) satellites. This is the first of 18 Ariane 6 launches that Arianespace sold to Amazon for the broadband communications megaconstellation.

A growing cadence … The Ariane 6 rocket has launched five times, including its debut flight in July 2024. All of the launches were a success, although the first flight failed to relight the upper stage in order to make a controlled reentry. Arianespace increased the cadence to four launches last year and will seek to try to double that this year.

Falcon 9 launches the Pandora mission. NASA’s Pandora satellite rocketed into orbit early Sunday from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, Ars reports. It hitched a ride with around 40 other small payloads aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, launching into a polar Sun-synchronous orbit before deploying at an altitude of roughly 380 miles (613 kilometers).

A satellite that can carry a tune … Pandora will augment the capabilities of NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope. Over the next few weeks, ground controllers will put Pandora through a series of commissioning and calibration steps before turning its eyes toward deep space. From low-Earth orbit, Pandora will observe exoplanets and their stars simultaneously, allowing astronomers to correct their measurements of the planet’s atmospheric composition and structure based on the ever-changing conditions of the host star itself.

ArianeGroup seeking ideas for Ariane 6 reuse. In this week’s newsletter, we’ve already had a story about MaiaSpace and another item about the Ariane 6 rocket. So why not combine the two and also have a report about an Ariane 6 mashup with the Maia rocket? As it turns out, there’s a relatively new proposal to retrofit the existing Ariane 6 rocket design for partial reuse with Maia rockets as side boosters, Ars reports.

Sir, maia I have some cost savings? … It’s infeasible to recover the Ariane 6’s core stage for many reasons. Chief among them is that the main stage burns for more than seven minutes on an Ariane 6 flight, reaching speeds about twice as fast as SpaceX’s Falcon 9 booster achieves during its two-and-a-half minutes of operation during launch. Swapping out Ariane 6’s solid rocket motors for reusable liquid boosters makes some economic sense for ArianeGroup. The proposal would bring the development and production of the boosters under full control of ArianeGroup and its French subsidiary, cutting Italy’s solid rocket motor developer, Avio, out of the program. All the same, we’ll believe this when we see it.

Meet the EtherealX Razor Crest Mk-1. I learned that there is a rocket company founded in Bengaluru, India, named Ethereal Exploration Guild, or EtherealX. (Did you see what they did there?) I found this out because the company announced (via email) that it had raised an oversubscribed $20.5 million Series A round led by TDK Ventures and BIG Capital. So naturally, I went to the EtherealX website looking for more information.

Let me say, I was not disappointed … As you might expect from a company named EtherealX, its proposed rocket has nine engines, is powered by liquid oxygen and kerosene, and has a maximum capacity of 24.8 metric tons to low-Earth orbit. (Did you see what they did there?) The website does not include much information, but there is this banger of a statement: “The EtherealX Razor Crest Mk-1 will house 9 of the most powerful operational liquid rocket engines in Asia, Europe, Australia, Africa, South America, and Antarctica – Stallion.” And let’s be honest, when you’ve bested Antarctica in engine development, you know you’re cooking. Alas, what I did not see on the website was much evidence of real hardware.

NASA topples historic Saturn and shuttle infrastructure. Two historic NASA test facilities used in the development of the Saturn V and space shuttle launch vehicles have been demolished after towering over the Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama since the start of the Space Age, Ars reports. The Propulsion and Structural Test Facility, which was erected in 1957—the same year the first artificial satellite entered Earth orbit—and the Dynamic Test Facility, which has stood since 1964, were brought down by a coordinated series of implosions on Saturday, January 10.

Out with the old, in with the new … Located in Marshall’s East Test Area on the US Army’s Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, the two structures were no longer in use and, according to NASA, had a backlog of $25 million in needed repairs. “This work reflects smart stewardship of taxpayer resources,” Jared Isaacman, NASA administrator, said in a statement. “Clearing outdated infrastructure allows NASA to safely modernize, streamline operations and fully leverage the infrastructure investments signed into law by President Trump to keep Marshall positioned at the forefront of aerospace innovation.”

Space Force swaps Vulcan for Falcon 9. The next Global Positioning System satellite is switching from a United Launch Alliance Vulcan rocket to a SpaceX Falcon 9, a spokesperson for the US Space Force Space Systems Command System Delta 80 said Tuesday, Spaceflight Now reports. SpaceX could launch the GPS III Space Vehicle 09 (SV09) within the next few weeks, as the satellite was entering the final stages of pre-flight preparations.

The trade is logical … SV09 was originally awarded to ULA as part of order-year five of the National Security Space Launch (NSSL) Phase 2 contract, which was announced on October 31, 2023. This isn’t the first time that the Space Force has shuffled timelines and switched launch providers for GPS missions. In May 2025, SpaceX launched the GPS III SV08 spacecraft, which was originally assigned to ULA in June 2023. In exchange, ULA was given the SV11 launch, which would have flown on a Falcon Heavy rocket. The changes have been driven largely by repeated delays in Vulcan readiness.

            <h2>“I am very annoyed”: Pharma execs blast RFK Jr.’s attack on vaccines</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-15</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/big-pharma-is-openly-railing-against-rfk-jr-s-anti-vaccine-agenda/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Pharmaceutical executives are finally saying how they really feel about the extreme anti-vaccine agenda Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been ruthlessly implementing—and it’s not pretty.

According to reporting from Bloomberg at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference that ended today in San Francisco, pharmaceutical executives who had previously been careful to avoid criticizing the Trump administration appear to have reached a breaking point, with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla offering some of the most candid comments.

“I am very annoyed. I’m very disappointed. I’m seriously frustrated,” Bourla said. “What is happening has zero scientific merit and is just serving an agenda which is political, and then antivax.”

Last week, Kennedy and other health officials abruptly announced a mass overhaul of the childhood vaccine schedule, dropping the number of routine recommended vaccinations from 17 to 11. The drastic and unprecedented change bypassed all the scientific review and transparent decision-making processes that would normally underpin such changes, which would likely have taken months if not years.

Kennedy claimed that the move puts the US more in line with peer nations, but as an analysis by Stat News pointed out, the US is now an outlier, recommending significantly fewer vaccines than many other countries. Of 20 so-called peer countries that Stat compared, only one other country has a similarly low number of recommendations: Denmark.

Leading medical groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, are preparing a legal challenge to block the changes.

But pharmaceutical executives don’t appear comforted by the pushback. “Today it may be childhood vaccines or mRNA, but tomorrow it’s everything,” Noubar Afeyan, co-founder and chairman of Moderna, maker of mRNA vaccines, said. “We have to say not just ‘why is this happening?,’ but ‘Where will it stop?’”

As a bad flu season is underway, Dean Li, president of Merck Research Laboratories, noted that the anti-vaccine rhetoric is hitting seasonal flu shots. “With the pressure on vaccination, I cannot foresee flu vaccination increasing in this country over the next three years,” he said in a presentation.

Sanofi Chief Executive Paul Hudson had a similarly pessimistic outlook. “It’s clear this administration has a particular sensitivity around vaccination, and indeed pediatric vaccination,” Hudson said. “I’m asked all the time ‘what are you going to do to fix this?,’ and the truth is we just need to stay extremely objective and continue presenting the evidence. There’s really very little else we can do,” except wait for the midterm elections, he said.

“We will have to maintain a steely focus on the long-term future of vaccines and deal with any uncertainty around vaccine coverage rates in the short-term based on misinformation, Facebook posts, and statements from the top,” he said.

Bourla also worried about the conditions Kennedy is creating to attack drug makers. Kennedy, who is an environmental lawyer with no scientific or medical background, has profited from lawsuits against vaccine makers, as have many of his allies and advisors. “There is also a lot of plaintiffs’ playbook there,” Bourla said. “Everybody will start litigating.”</div>

            <h2>Why I’m withholding certainty that “precise” US cyber-op disrupted Venezuelan electricity</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-15</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/unnamed-officials-tell-nyt-precise-cyber-op-took-out-venezuelas-power-grid/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The New York Times has published new details about a purported cyberattack that unnamed US officials claim plunged parts of Venezuela into darkness in the lead-up to the capture of the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro.

Key among the new details is that the cyber operation was able to turn off electricity for most residents in the capital city of Caracas for only a few minutes, though in some neighborhoods close to the military base where Maduro was seized, the outage lasted for three days. The cyber-op also targeted Venezuelan military radar defenses. The paper said the US Cyber Command was involved.

“Turning off the power in Caracas and interfering with radar allowed US military helicopters to move into the country undetected on their mission to capture Nicolás Maduro, the Venezuelan president who has now been brought to the United States to face drug charges,” the NYT reported.

The NYT provided few additional details. Left out were the methods purportedly used. When Russia took out electricity in December 2015, for instance, it used general-purpose malware known as BlackEnergy to first penetrate the corporate networks of the targeted power companies and then further encroach into the supervisory control and data acquisition systems the companies used to generate and transmit electricity. The Russian attackers then used legitimate power distribution functionality to trigger the failure, which took out power to more than 225,000 people for more than six hours, when grid workers restored it.

In a second attack almost exactly a year later, Russia used a much more sophisticated piece of malware to take out key parts of the Ukrainian power grid. Named Industroyer and alternatively Crash Override, it’s the first known malware framework designed to attack electric grid systems directly.

What makes Crash Override so sophisticated is its ability to use the same arcane technical protocols that individual electric grid systems rely on to communicate with one another. As such, the malware is more notable for its mastery of the industrial processes used by global grid operators than its robust code. Its fluency in the low-level grid languages allowed it to instruct Ukrainian devices to de-energize and re-energize substation lines, a capability not seen in the attack a year earlier that used a much cruder set of tools and techniques. The concern is that “Industroyer&quot;—the other name given to the malware—can be used against a broad range of electric systems around the world.

Besides the lack of details of the purported hack of Venezuela’s power infrastructure, electricity experts have said that the country’s grid has been in disrepair for years. It’s feasible, they say, that power went out due to inadequate maintenance and investment. Another reason for skepticism is that Venezuela’s government said US missiles were at least partially to blame. An unconfirmed video circulating on social media also purports to show a bombed-out substation.

Whether through kinetic or cyber attacks, military strikes on power grids have been controversial because the collateral damage they cause can take out hospitals and other infrastructure that’s crucial to civilians’ survival.

The NYT said the strike on Venezuela’s power infrastructure “demonstrated [the] precision” of US cyber capabilities and showed the US “could use cyberweapons with powerful and precise effects.” If the attacks were indeed the result of cyber intrusions, there will likely be ample forensic evidence for independent experts in security power grids to confirm. Until then, there’s reason to withhold final judgment.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/01/star-trek-starfleet-academy-tries-something-different-and-i-dont-hate-it/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Today is a good day to watch television. That’s because the first two episodes of Star Trek: Starfleet Academy hit the Paramount+ streaming service, becoming the newest addition to the long-running Star Trek franchise. It’s set in the late 32nd century, 120 years after the burn that ended all warp travel, and with it, most of Starfleet in the process. Now that warp travel is once again possible—you’ll have to watch Discovery’s final three seasons for more on that—the Federation is putting itself back together, and that includes reopening Starfleet Academy.

That means this show is about young people in space, like Caleb Mir (Sandro Rosta), who was separated from his mother by Starfleet as a child, 15 years earlier. Mir and his mother, played by Tatiana Maslany, were traveling with a pirate—Nus Braka, played by a scenery-chewing Paul Giamatti—who killed a Federation officer while stealing food for them. The first episode opens on Braka and the Mirs being apprehended by Starfleet. Despite her misgivings, Captain Nahla Ake (Holly Hunter) carries out her order to separate mother and child. She’s to go to a rehabilitation colony, he’s to become a ward of the Federation and go to school on Bajor.

At least that’s the plan until he escapes a few minutes later. Then we jump forward 15 years. Ake is teaching on Bajor, having retired from the Federation, ashamed of what she’d done. Admiral Vance (Oded Fehr) shows up and asks her to become commandant at the newly reopened academy in San Francisco; for the past few decades, new recruits have been trained instead by the War College. But Starfleet needs explorers now, and having a rival school means they can show up at some point to challenge some of the show’s protagonists to a Parrises Squares tournament.

Ake accepts the job, and to atone for her mistake in separating Mir from his mother, she pressgangs him into the Academy as a new recruit. Oh, she’s also a Lanthanite (technically a human-lanthanite hybrid), and 422 years old, which means she remembers working for the pre-burn Federation. She isn’t the only academy instructor with pre-burn experience in Starfleet. Jett Reno (Tig Notaro), who came to the 32nd century with Discovery, teaches the cadets physics. And the Doctor (Robert Picardo) is chief medical officer.

I had hoped this would be the result of a deep cut to “The Living Witness,” an episode of Voyager set in the 29th century where a copy of the Doctor is restored in a museum in the Delta Quadrant. At the end of that episode, that Doctor sets off for Earth, and having him show up would be a nice bit of closure; instead, he probably perished in the burn, which just makes me sad. As chief medical officer, the Doctor is apparently constantly monitoring the cadets’ biosigns—he breaks up an incipient fight after detecting students with elevated excitatory neurotransmitters. That seems more than a little invasive to me, although later he gets a taste of his own medicine from Starfleet’s first holographic cadet, SAM (Kerrice Brooks).

I’ve got a bit of a problem with Cadet Master Commander Lura Thok (Gina Yashere), who is a female Klingon-Jem’Hadar hybrid.

Obviously, a female Jem’Hadar must be canon, because it’s right there on screen, and that’s how Trek canon works. But the Founders bred the Jem’Hadar in tanks, and they lived short, dangerous lives as warriors. What use would sex organs or sexual reproduction be to a species genetically engineered to do a specific job by a race of contemptuous changelings that treat their minions as little more than tools.

That’s the trouble with head canon—the writers go and put something on the TV show that contradicts your clever idea, and you either deal with it or get annoyed. I’ll get over it, because I rather enjoy the hyperaggressive Thok and the way she harangues the cadets.

If you’re just looking for more Next Generation/Deep Space 9/Voyager-era trek, or a few more seasons of Lower Decks, you’re going to be left unfulfilled by Starfleet Academy. The aesthetic is much shinier; the floors are glossy black, not neutral, bland carpet. The characters swear at each other. But EPS conduits still explode, and because the academy has the USS Athena—a starship that, from above, looks a lot like the new comm badges—there should still be plenty of good old exploration going on while the cadets learn their life lessons. And Easter eggs, too, like the Cheronian cadet or an exocomp, although you’ll need to turn on subtitles to get the callback with that one.

If the first two episodes are much to go by, we can expect some young adult drama—love triangles, bros facing off against each other—set to a backdrop of the Federation rebuilding itself and trying to reimpose its post-scarcity order on what has become a more chaotic galaxy. That won’t be everyone’s cup of tea, Earl Grey, hot, but I’m curious to see where it goes.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/nasas-first-ever-medical-evacuation-from-space-ends-with-on-target-splashdown/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Two Americans, a Japanese astronaut, and a Russian cosmonaut returned to Earth early Thursday after 167 days in orbit, cutting short their stay on the International Space Station by more than a month after one of the crew members encountered an unspecified medical issue last week.

The early homecoming culminated in an on-target splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Diego at 12:41 am PST (08:41 UTC) inside a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft. The splashdown occurred minutes after the Dragon capsule streaked through the atmosphere along the California coastline, with sightings of Dragon’s fiery trail reported from San Francisco to Los Angeles.

Four parachutes opened to slow the capsule for the final descent. Zena Cardman, NASA’s commander of the Crew-11 mission, radioed SpaceX mission control moments after splashdown: “It feels good to be home, with deep gratitude to the teams who got us there and back.”

Cardman and her crewmates departed the space station about 10 hours earlier. NASA astronaut Mike Fincke, Japanese mission specialist Kimiya Yui, and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov round out the crew. NASA reported a medical concern with one of the crew members last week, and agency officials decided to bring the Crew-11 mission home earlier than planned to provide the person access to more comprehensive treatment on the ground.

Officials have not identified whose health was in question or what is afflicting the ailing crew member. Whatever the case, the medical issue did not appear to affect the crew’s return to Earth. The astronauts exited the Dragon spacecraft appearing in good health and good spirits after SpaceX raised the capsule from the water and onto a recovery vessel.

Joel Montalbano, NASA’s deputy associate administrator for space operations, said the astronauts would head to a medical facility in San Diego before returning to their home base at Johnson Space Center in Houston.

NASA officials were careful to say the medical issue was not an emergency. NASA said the crew member was stable on the ISS, and the situation did not require the astronauts to immediately leave the ISS for the first available return opportunity, a capability NASA and SpaceX can execute in the event of a dire event like a traumatic injury or if the complex was hit by a piece of space junk.

“Because the astronaut is absolutely stable, this is not an emergent evacuation,” said James “JD” Polk, NASA’s chief medical officer, in a press conference last week. “We’re not immediately disembarking and getting the astronaut down.”

Amit Kshatriya, the agency’s associate administrator, called the situation a “controlled medical evacuation” in a briefing with reporters.

But without a confirmed diagnosis of the astronaut’s medical issue, there was some “lingering risk” for the astronaut’s health if they remained in orbit, Polk said. That’s why NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman and his deputies agreed to call an early end to the Crew-11 mission.

The Crew-11 mission launched on August 1 and was supposed to stay on the space station until around February 20, a few days after the scheduled arrival of SpaceX’s Crew-12 mission with a team of replacement astronauts. But the early departure means the space station will operate with a crew of three until the launch of Crew-12 next month.

NASA astronaut Chris Williams will be the sole astronaut responsible for maintaining the US segment of the station. Russian cosmonauts Sergey Kud-Sverchkov and Sergey Mikayev launched with Williams in November on a Russian Soyuz vehicle. The Crew Dragon was the lifeboat for all four Crew-11 astronauts, so standard procedure called for the entire crew to return with the astronaut suffering the undisclosed medical issue.

The space station regularly operated with just three crew members for the first decade of its existence. The complex has been permanently staffed since 2000, sometimes with as few as two astronauts or cosmonauts. The standard crew size was raised to six in 2009, then to seven in 2020.

Williams will have his hands full until reinforcements arrive. The scaled-down crew will not be able to undertake any spacewalks, and some of the lab’s science programs may have to be deferred to ensure the crew can keep up with maintenance tasks.

This is the first time NASA has called an early end to a space mission for medical reasons, but the Soviet Union faced similar circumstances several times during the Cold War. Russian officials cut short an expedition to the Salyut 7 space station in 1985 after the mission’s commander fell ill in orbit. A similar situation occurred in 1976 with the Soyuz 21 mission to the Salyut 5 space station.</div>

            <div id="article-text">For over two decades, millions of people volunteered the computational capacity of their computers to help UC Berkeley scientists in their search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI).

The goal of the project, called SETI@home, was to trawl through data collected by the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico for signs of unusual radio signals from the cosmos. It was a powerful example of “distributed computing,” which relies on a huge network of individual computers — but whether the search has borne any fruit remains unclear as scientists continue to analyze the wealth of data.

SETI@home concluded after 21 years in 2020, producing a whopping 12 billion detections, according to a UC Berkeley press release, making it “one of the most popular crowd-sourced research projects ever.”

Over the years, researchers whittled down the data to just 100 signals that were “worth a second look” by eliminating radio frequency interference and noise with the help of a supercomputer. Since July, they’ve been using China’s Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), in the hopes of catching another glimpse of the identified targets.

Unfortunately, the Arecibo Observatory — once the world’s largest radio telescope — collapsed during a storm in 2020, and is being decommissioned.

Even if the project never leads to first contact with an intelligent extraterrestrial species, it doesn’t mean SETI@home was a waste of time. Researchers are still trawling through the FAST data, but early conclusions of the project and its effectiveness have already resulted in two papers that were published last year in The Astronomical Journal.

“If we don’t find ET, what we can say is that we established a new sensitivity level,” said project cofounder David Anderson in a statement. “If there were a signal above a certain power, we would have found it.”

The team is hoping to inspire a successor to the crowdsourced research project, while applying what they’ve learned.

“Some of our conclusions are that the project didn’t completely work the way we thought it was going to,” Anderson said. “And we have a long list of things that we would have done differently and that future sky survey projects should do differently.”

Astronomer and project director Eric Korpela also pointed out that the considerable amount of radio interference, which can emanate from other sources, including radio and TV broadcasts and even microwave ovens, could seriously mess with the data.

“We have to do a better job of measuring what we’re excluding,” he said. “Are we throwing out the baby with the bath water? I don’t think we know for most SETI searches, and that is really a lesson for SETI searches everywhere.”

Given the lack of a smoking gun after trawling “billions and billions” of stars in the Milky Way, the project left the alien-hunting organizers somewhat deflated.

“We are, without doubt, the most sensitive narrow-band search of large portions of the sky, so we had the best chance of finding something,” Korpela explained. “So yeah, there’s a little disappointment that we didn’t see anything.”

However, the researcher hasn’t given up on the idea, particularly given the immense advancements in computer power and improved internet connections.

“I think that you could still get significantly more processing power than we used for SETI@home and process more data because of a wider internet bandwidth,” Korpela said. However, “the biggest issue with such a project is that it requires personnel, and personnel means salaries. It’s not the cheapest way to do SETI.”

And plenty of what-ifs remain, especially considering the limitations of the SETI@home project.

“There’s still the potential that ET is in that data and we missed it just by a hair,” he pondered.

            <h2>Researchers Just Found Something That Could Shake the AI Industry to Its Core</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-16</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For years now, AI companies, including Google, Meta, Anthropic, and OpenAI, have insisted that their large language models aren’t technically storing copyrighted works in their memory and instead “learn” from their training data like a human mind.

It’s a carefully worded distinction that’s been integral to their attempts to defend themselves against a rapidly growing barrage of legal challenges.

It also cuts to the core of copyright law itself. Copyright is a form of intellectual property law designed to protect original works and their creators. Under the US Copyright Act of 1976, a copyright owner has the exclusive right to “reproduce, adapt, distribute, publicly perform, and publicly display the work.”

But, crucially, the “fair use” doctrine holds that others can use copyrighted materials for purposes like criticism, journalism, and research. That’s been the AI industry’s defense in court against accusations of infringement; OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has gone as far as to say that it’s “over” if the industry isn’t allowed to freely leverage copyrighted data to train its models.

Rights holders have long cried foul, accusing AI companies of training their models on pirated and copyrighted works, effectively monetizing them without ever fairly remunerating authors, journalists, and artists. It’s a years-long legal battle that’s already led to a high-profile settlement.

Now, a damning new study could put AI companies on the defensive. In it, Stanford and Yale researchers found compelling evidence that AI models are actually copying all that data, not “learning” from it. Specifically, four prominent LLMs — OpenAI’s GPT-4.1, Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, xAI’s Grok 3, and Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet — happily reproduced lengthy excerpts from popular — and protected — works, with a stunning degree of accuracy.

They found that Claude outputted “entire books near-verbatim” with an accuracy rate of 95.8 percent. Gemini reproduced the novel “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” with an accuracy of 76.8 percent, while Claude reproduced George Orwell’s “1984” with a higher than 94 percent accuracy compared to the original — and still copyrighted — reference material.

“While many believe that LLMs do not memorize much of their training data, recent work shows that substantial amounts of copyrighted text can be extracted from open-weight models,” the researchers wrote.

Some of these reproductions required the researchers to jailbreak the models with a technique called Best-of-N, which essentially bombards the AI with different iterations of the same prompt. (Those kinds of workarounds have already been used by OpenAI to defend itself in a lawsuit filed by the New York Times, with its lawyers arguing that “normal people do not use OpenAI’s products in this way.”)

The implications of the latest findings could be substantial as copyright lawsuits play out in courts across the country. As The Atlantic‘s Alex Reisner points out, the results further undermine the AI industry’s argument that LLMs “learn” from these texts instead of storing information and recalling it later. It’s evidence that “may be a massive legal liability for AI companies” and “potentially cost the industry billions of dollars in copyright-infringement judgments.”

Whether AI companies are liable for copyright infringement remains a subject of heated debate. Stanford law professor Mark Lemley, who has represented AI companies in copyright lawsuits, told The Atlantic that he isn’t sure whether an AI model “contains” a copy of a book or can reproduce it “on the fly in response to a request.”

Unsurprisingly, the industry is continuing to argue that they’re technically not replicating protected works. In 2023, Google told the US Copyright Office that “there is no copy of the training data — whether text, images, or other formats — present in the model itself.”

OpenAI also told the office in the same year that its “models do not store copies of the information that they learn from.”

To The Atlantic‘s Reisner, the analogy that AI models learn like humans is a “deceptive, feel-good idea that prevents the public discussion we need to have about how AI companies are using the creative and intellectual works upon which they are utterly dependent.”

But whether the judges overseeing the litany of copyright lawsuits will agree with that sentiment remains to be seen. The stakes are considerable, particularly as it becomes harder and harder for authors, journalists, and other content creators to make a living — while the AI industry swells to unfathomable value.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Much ink has been spilled over US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s dalliances with anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, brain worms, nicotine pouches, and bizarre self-treatment with a synthetic dye known as methylene blue.

In spite of all those wellness eccentricities of his own, Kennedy is apparently in awe of his boss Donald Trump, who he says spends his days “pumping himself full of poison.”

In a recent appearance on the Katie Miller Podcast — hosted by the wife of Stephen Miller, who currently serves as homeland security advisor to the White House — Kennedy expressed astonishment that the president is even alive.

“He eats really bad food,” the health secretary dished. “Which is McDonald’s, and, you know, candy and Diet Coke. But he drinks Diet Coke at all times. He has the constitution of a deity — I don’t know how he’s alive, but he is.”

Though Kennedy acknowledged that Trump eats “really good food” when he’s staying in a place like Mar-a-Lago, he says those habits fall away the second he gets on the road.

“If you travel with him you get this idea that he’s just pumping himself full of poison all day,” Kennedy told Miller. “He wants to eat food from big corporations because he trusts it and he doesn’t want to get sick when he’s on the road.”

Trump’s health woes have been a topic of heated debate since he assumed his second term in office. He’s currently the oldest person to be elected president in US history, a superlative which has come with complications like daytime fatigue, visible bruising, and what his critics say is observable cognitive decline. (A mysterious CT scan that the president has struggled to explain hasn’t helped dispel those concerns.)

Whether Trump’s diet is contributing to his health woes is hard to say for certain — the administration insists he remains perfectly fit — but if Kennedy’s astonishment is any indication, the BigMacs certainly aren’t helping.

            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-15</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As headlines teem with stories of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers beating protestors, holding children hostage, and murdering people in cold blood, you might be wondering: who the hell hired these guys? As it turns out, AI played a huge role.

According to NBC, when ICE identifies a recruit with prior law enforcement experience, it assigns them to its “Law Enforcement Officer Program.” This is a four-week online course meant to streamline training for those already familiar with the legal aspects of the gig. Everyone else gets shipped off to ICE’s Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Georgia for an eight-week in-person academy. This more rigorous training includes courses in immigration law, gun handling, physical fitness exams, and more.

Yet rather than assign a human to make that call, ICE’s human resources department outsourced the task to an untested large language model (LLM). This AI system was supposed to scan new recruits’ resumes in order to place them in one of the two programs; instead, it automatically flagged the “majority of new applicants” for the fast-track course regardless of their prior experience, officials familiar with the system told NBC.

“They were using AI to scan resumes and found out a bunch of the people who were LEOs weren’t LEOs,” one official said.

Basically, the AI model had approved any resume containing the word “officer” for the LEO program — which opened the door to anyone from a “mall security officer” to those who simply wrote about their aspirations to become ICE officers to take the expedited training course.

The exact number of inexperienced ICE recruits whisked into the fast lane is unknown. At this point, the agency is said to be actively reassessing its duty rosters to call new recruits back for additional training.

The error was first noticed in “mid-fall,” NBC reports, amidst a hiring surge in which ICE rushed to add some 10,000 officers to its ranks — a quota imposed by the Trump administration. Back in October, MS Now reported that ICE was struggling to meet its hiring goals, even after dropping age requirements for new recruits.

It all comes after ICE’s deadliest year since 2004. Throughout 2025, 32 people died in the agency’s custody, and more than 170 US citizens were detained against their will.

Still, it’s unlikely a few more weeks of training would have made much of a difference in those outcomes. As previous reporting has revealed, those responding to the Trump administration’s fascistic recruiting ads aren’t exactly the cream of the crop. During a December investigation into ICE’s hiring standards, an agency official told the Daily Mail that in some cases, the recruits being sent out into the field can barely read, let alone understand complex immigration law.

“We have people failing open-book tests and we have folks that can barely read or write English,” an official said. “We even had a 469lb man sent to the academy whose own doctor certified him ‘not at all fit’ for any physical activity.”

The fact that these gung-ho recruits aren’t being weeded out at the start is a horrifying indictment: either agency officials didn’t think to double check the AI’s work, or they didn’t care to. Either way, the horrifying consequences are sure to continue as ICE’s brutal crackdown on American cities rolls ahead.

            <h2>After Being Pillaged By AI Companies, Wikipedia Signs Deal to Get Paid By Them</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-15</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Wikipedia has signed training deals with a host of major AI companies, helping it recoup some of the exorbitant costs it accrued from being relentlessly pillaged by data scrapers.

The companies include Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Perplexity, and France’s Mistral AI. As part of the series of licensing deals, revealed Thursday by Wikipedia’s operator the Wikimedia Foundation, the AI developers are joining Wikimedia’s Enterprise program, which provides direct access to its collection of over 65 million articles.

Using Wikipedia and its contents is of course free, but the official program allows quicker access at a “volume and speed designed specifically” for “large-scale reusers and distributors,” like AI chatbots.

Wikipedia had already agreed a licensing deal with Google in 2022, and also signed deals with smaller AI firms like the search engine Ecosia. Now, with the new slew of deals, Wikipedia has partnered up with every big name in town, and it sees the commercial partnerships as a way to keep the lights on, though it didn’t provide specifics on the financials of the deals.

“Wikipedia is a critical component of these tech companies’ work that they need to figure out how to support financially,” Lane Becker, president of Wikimedia Enterprise, told Reuters.

“It took us a little while to understand the right set of features and functionality to offer if we’re going to move these companies from our free platform to a commercial platform… but all our Big Tech partners really see the need for them to commit to sustaining Wikipedia’s work.”

It’s an interesting direction for the nonprofit, which has faced its fair share of struggle over AI’s increasing stranglehold over the internet. AI companies heavily relied on free sources of information like Wikipedia to train their AI models in the first place, and continue to frequently cite the encyclopedia for their responses. But as more people turn to chatbots for answers, fewer are visiting Wikipedia, which relies on small donations to stay afloat, and non-paid volunteers to maintain its articles.

Moreover, the large-scale data scraping of Wikipedia by AI web crawlers placed a heavy toll on its servers, which are growing more expensive to maintain. In effect, Wikipedia was paying for the AI industry’s voracious training — which isn’t what its readers were donating money for, says Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales.

“They’re not donating in order to subsidize these huge AI companies,” Wales told the Associated Press. The donors are saying, “You know what, actually you can’t just smash our website. You have to sort of come in the right way.”

There’s another reason Wales is onboard with the partnerships: better us than less scrupulous sources.

“I’m very happy personally that AI models are training on Wikipedia data because it’s human curated,” he told the AP. “I wouldn’t really want to use an AI that’s trained only on X, you know, like a very angry AI.” (Wales is referring to the website owned by Elon Musk. Musk, by the way, has a vendetta against Wikipedia and launched his own AI-generated “Grokipedia” as an anti-woke alternative, which immediately turned out to be racist.)

All told, it’ll be interesting to see how the deal is received by Wikipedia’s editors and writers, who have crusaded against AI content being used on the platform, and rebelled against the site owners when they tried to deploy AI-generated summaries over articles.

            <div id="article-text">Whether you’re a one-room film production house or a propagandist for a massive arm of the US government, you’re never too good to have an extra set of eyes take a look at your final draft.

That’s a lesson some PR spinsters with the Department of Homeland Security evidently have yet to learn, after the agency posted a 40-second clip for its new drone program, hyping up “American Air Superiority.”

As DHS propaganda goes, it’s your typical fare under Trump 2.0. There’s some cloyingly uplifting music, a few shots of drones in the sky, and bold-lettered copy proclaiming things like “innovation in action.” One detail, though, is so out of place that it feels like parody: the inclusion of footage showing DHS agents using a prominent Chinese drone brand.

The discrepancy was first spotted by drone researcher Faine Greenwood, who noticed that officers in the video were using a remote controller made by DJI, a company headquartered in Shenzhen, China. Given that DJI hardware uses closed-source communication protocols — which means they’re not cross-compatible with other drone brands — it follows that the DHS officer was piloting a Chinese-made drone.

It is our duty to provide our frontline personnel with every tool they need to protect our nation and return home to their families every… pic.twitter.com/ZigPaNFSbE

The optics are bizarre for the Trump administration, which is rabidly anti-China.

“Someone needs to ask Kristi Noem why she and DHS are promoting and using Sinister Chinese Communist drones, instead of Square-Jawed Heterosexual American Drones,” Greenwood quipped.

The humiliating self-own comes after Donald Trump moved to ban Chinese-made drones back in December, a move which specifically included DJI. However, following a Pentagon recommendation, the administration temporarily lifted some of the restrictions on certain brands — though DJI remains prohibited.

That actually raises real questions. Why is the government still using drones, especially for sensitive homeland security purposes, that are expressly prohibited? If they’re really so concerned, there are plenty of perfectly serviceable American brands.

It’s also an astonishing oversight for such a high-profile video — if the government is going to wantonly break its own rules for a little PR spin, shouldn’t it at least make some effort to cover it up?

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Italy has launched two investigations into Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard, alleging the company has engaged in “misleading and aggressive” sales practices for its popular smartphone games Diablo Immortal and Call of Duty Mobile.

The country’s competition regulator, Autorita Garante della Concorrenza E Del Mercato (AGCM), said the investigations focus on the use of design elements to induce users, particularly children, into playing for long periods, and make in-game purchases by urging them to not miss out on rewards.

“These practices, together with strategies that make it difficult for users to understand the real value of the virtual currency used in the game and the sale of in-game currency in bundles, may influence players as consumers — including minors — leading them to spend significant amounts, sometimes exceeding what is necessary to progress in the game and without being fully aware of the expenditure involved,” the AGCM wrote in a statement.

The AGCM said the games are advertised as free-to-play but offer in-game purchases.

That isn’t particularly surprising, however, as, unlike full-priced games, free-to-play games have long relied on loot boxes and sales of in-game cosmetics for monetization. Diablo Immortal, for example, offers in-game cosmetics, as well as currency that allows players to accelerate their progression and gain items for crafting, for as much as $200.

Given the nature of the game, it’s not unusual for many users to repeatedly spend on such items in the course of play.

Both Diablo Immortal and Call of Duty Mobile have player bases in the hundreds of thousands.

The authority is also looking into the games’ parental control features, as the default settings lets minors make in-game purchases, play for long periods without restraints, and allow them to chat with others in-game. The AGCM also highlighted privacy concerns, as the games appear to lead users to select all consent options when signing up, and said it would look into the company’s consent process for harvesting and using personal data.

“In the Authority’s view, the company may be acting in breach of consumer protection rules and, in particular, the duty of professional diligence required in a sector that is particularly sensitive to the risks of gaming-related addiction,” the regulator said.

Activision Blizzard did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It took Rebecca Yu seven days to vibe code her dining app. She was tired of the decision fatigue that comes from people in a group chat not being able to decide where to eat.

Armed with determination, Claude, and ChatGPT, Yu decided to just build a dining app from scratch — one that would recommend restaurants to her and her friends based on their shared interests.

“Once vibe-coding apps emerged, I started hearing about people with no tech backgrounds successfully building their own apps,” she told TechCrunch. “When I had a week off before school started, I decided it was the perfect time to finally build my application.”

So, she created the web app Where2Eat to help her and her friends find a place to eat.

Yu is part of the growing trend of people who, due to rapid advancements in AI technology, can easily build their own apps for personal use. Most are coding web applications, though they are also increasingly vibe coding mobile apps intended to run only on their own personal phones and devices. Some who are already registered as Apple developers are leaving their personal apps in beta on TestFlight.

It is a new era of app creation that is sometimes called micro apps, personal apps, or fleeting apps because they are intended to be used only by the creator (or the creator plus a select few other people) and only for as long as the creator wants to keep the app. They are not intended for wide distribution or sale.

For example, founder Jordi Amat told TechCrunch that he built a fleeting web gaming app for his family to play over the holidays and simply shut it down once the vacation was over.

Then there’s Shamillah Bankiya, a partner at Dawn Capital, who is building a podcast translation web app for personal use. Interestingly enough, Darrell Etherington, a former TechCrunch writer, now a vice president at SBS Comms, is also building his own personal podcast translation app. “A lot of people I know are using Claude Code, Replit, Bolt, and Lovable to build apps for specific use cases,” he said.

One artist told TechCrunch that he built a “vice tracker” for himself to see how many hookahs and drinks he was consuming each weekend.

Even professional developers are vibe coding personal apps. Software engineer James Waugh told TechCrunch he built a web app planning tool to help with his cooking hobby.

Because tools ranging from Claude Code to Lovable typically don’t require robust coding knowledge just to get to a functional app, we are witnessing the early rise of micro apps. These are apps that are extremely context-specific, address niche needs, and then “disappear when the need is no longer present,” Legand L. Burge III, a professor of computer science at Howard University, said.

“It’s similar to how trends on social media appear and then fade away,” Burge III continued. “But now, [it’s] software itself.”

Yu said she now has six more ideas she wants to code. “It’s really exciting to be alive right now,” she said.

In some ways, it was always easy for someone without much coding experience to create web apps via no-code platforms like Bubble and Adalo, which launched before LLMs became popular. What’s new is the rising ability to create personal, temporary apps for mobile devices, too. Also new: the growing realization that anyone can code just by describing, in regular language, the app they want.

Mobile micro apps still aren’t as easy as their web counterparts. This is because the standard way to load an app on an iPhone is to download it from the App Store, which requires a paid Apple Developer account. But increasingly mobile vibe-coding startups like Anything (which raised $11 million, led by Footwork) and VibeCode (which raised a $9.4 million seed round from Seven Seven Six last year) have emerged to help people build mobile apps.

Christina Melas-Kyriazi, a partner at Bain Capital Ventures, compared this era of app building to social media and Shopify, “where all of a sudden it was really easy to create content or to create a store online, and then we saw an explosion of small sellers.” she said.

Still, micro apps also have issues. For one, building an app is still tedious for some. Yu, for example, said her dining app wasn’t hard to create; it was just very time-consuming. She had to lean on ChatGPT and Claude to help her understand some coding decisions. “Once I learned how to prompt and solve issues efficiently, building became much easier,” she said.

Then there are quality issues. Such personal apps may have bugs or critical security flaws — they can’t just be sold as-is to the masses.

But there is still significant potential in an era of personal app building, especially as AI and model reasoning, quality, and security become more sophisticated over time.

The software engineer, Waugh, said he once built an app for a friend who had heart palpitations. He built her a logger that let her record when she was having heart issues so she could more easily show her doctor. “Great example of a one-off personal software that helps you keep track of something important,” he told TechCrunch.

Another founder, Nick Simpson, told TechCrunch he was so bad at paying parking tickets — the consequence of San Francisco’s tough parking availability — that he decided to build an app that would automatically pay them after scanning the ticket. As a registered Apple developer, his app is in beta on TestFlight, but he said a bunch of his friends now want it, too.

Nevertheless, Burge III believes that these types of apps can open “exhilarating opportunities” for businesses and creators to create “hyper-personalized situational experiences.”

Etherington added to that, saying he believes a day is dawning when people stop subscribing to apps that have monthly fees. Instead, they will just build their own apps for personal use.

Melas-Kyriazi, meanwhile, expects to see the use of personal, fleeting apps the same way spreadsheets like Google Sheets or Excel were once used.

“It’s really going to fill the gap between the spreadsheet and a full-fledged product,” she said.

One media strategist, Hollie Krause, said she didn’t like the apps her doctor kept recommending, so she built one herself that can help her track her allergies.

She had no technical experience and finished the web app in the same time it took her husband to go to dinner and back. Now, she said, they have two web apps, both built with Claude: one for allergies and sensitivities, and the other to keep tabs on chores around the house.

“I was like ‘wow I hate Excel but I’d love to make an app for our household,” Krause told TechCrunch. “So, I spun it up and hosted it on Tiiny.host and popped it on our cellphones.”

She thinks vibe coding will bring “a lot of innovation and problem solving for communities that wouldn’t have access otherwise,” and hopes to beta-test her allergy health app so she can one day release it to others.

“The app will be to help others who struggle to navigate life for themselves, and for caregivers to also be able to have access,” she said. “I truly think that vibe coding means I can help people.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anthropic has appointed Irina Ghose, a former Microsoft India managing director, to lead its India business as the U.S. AI startup prepares to open an office in Bengaluru. The move underscores how India is becoming a key battleground for AI companies looking to expand beyond the U.S. for major growth markets.

Ghose brings deep big-tech operating experience to the role. She spent 24 years at Microsoft before stepping down in December 2025. Her appointment gives Anthropic a seasoned executive with local enterprise and government relationships as it gears up to establish an on-the-ground presence in one of the world’s fastest-growing AI markets.

India has become one of Anthropic’s most strategically important markets, with the country already ranking as the second-largest user base for Claude and usage heavily skewing toward technical and work-related tasks, including software development. Arch-rival OpenAI is also sharpening its focus on the market with plans to open an office in New Delhi — a sign India is fast becoming one of the most contested arenas in the global race to commercialize generative AI.

While India offers enormous scale — with more than a billion internet subscribers and over 700 million smartphone users — converting that reach into meaningful revenue has proven difficult, pushing AI companies to experiment with aggressive pricing and promotions. OpenAI last year introduced ChatGPT Go, its under-$5 plan aimed at attracting Indian users, and later made it available free for a year in the country.

Similar dynamics are playing out for Anthropic: its Claude app recorded a 48% increase from the previous year in downloads in India in September, reaching about 767,000 installs, while consumer spending surged 572% to $195,000 for the month, per Appfigures — still modest compared with the U.S., where September spending hit $2.5 million.

Anthropic has been stepping up its engagement in India at the highest levels. Chief executive Dario Amodei visited in October and met corporate executives and lawmakers, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to discuss the company’s expansion plans and growing adoption of its tools. Anthropic had also explored a potential partnership with billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries to broaden access to Claude, as TechCrunch reported previously. Reliance, however, ultimately struck a deal with Google to offer its Gemini AI Pro plan free to Jio subscribers. That move came as rival Bharti Airtel partnered with Perplexity to bundle access to its premium subscription, underscoring how India’s telecom giants have become critical distribution gatekeepers in the race to scale consumer AI services.

In a LinkedIn post announcing the move, Ghose said she would focus on working with Indian enterprises, developers and startups adopting Claude for “mission-critical” use cases, pointing to growing demand for what she described as “high-trust, enterprise-grade AI.” She added that AI tailored to local languages could be a “force multiplier” across sectors including education and healthcare — signaling Anthropic’s intent to deepen adoption beyond early tech users into larger institutions and the public sector.

The push by Anthropic, OpenAI, and Perplexity comes as India’s homegrown GenAI ecosystem remains relatively early-stage. While the country has a deep pool of software talent and a fast-growing base of AI users, it has produced few startups building large foundation models, with investors instead largely backing application-layer companies rather than committing the scale of capital typically required to train frontier systems.

The appointment also comes ahead of India’s AI Impact Summit 2026 in February, where the Indian government is expected to bring together AI startups, global CEOs, and industry experts to discuss the next phase of AI deployment in the country. The summit is part of New Delhi’s broader effort to signal support for domestic AI development and position India as a serious player in the global AI landscape, as competition intensifies across major markets.

Anthropic is also building out its India team, with job listings for roles including startup and enterprise account executives as well as a partner sales manager, signaling a push to deepen its go-to-market efforts and tap Indian businesses and startups as customers as it expands its presence in the country.

For Anthropic, the hire adds senior local leadership as it looks to turn India’s surging usage into a durable business, navigating a market where distribution partnerships, pricing pressure, and enterprise adoption will shape which AI players emerge as long-term winners.

            <div id="article-text">OpenAI and Microsoft tried to dodge a courtroom showdown with Elon Musk, but a federal judge wasn’t having it, as reported earlier by Bloomberg. On Thursday she rejected their dismissal requests and set the case for a jury trial in late April, meaning they’ll officially duke it out in an Oakland courtroom, with Microsoft also dragged into the legal battle.

The backstory reads like a tech soap opera. Musk and Sam Altman co-founded OpenAI with others in 2015 as a nonprofit with lofty charitable goals. But those fuzzy feelings didn’t last — Musk left and in 2023 started his own AI company, xAI, and now claims his former partners betrayed their mission by taking billions from Microsoft and restructuring as a for-profit.

The relationships have seemingly curdled across the board. OpenAI and Microsoft remain business partners but increasingly compete head-to-head in AI. Meanwhile, Musk and Altman have gone from collaborators to arch enemies, with OpenAI dismissing Musk’s lawsuit as “baseless” and “harassment” and an attempt to slow it down.

The judge found enough evidence to let a jury decide whether OpenAI broke its nonprofit commitments. A jury will also now decide whether Microsoft knowingly helped OpenAI break its promises, though the judge dismissed Musk’s claim that Microsoft unjustly enriched itself at his expense.

            <div id="article-text">Newsrooms have been experimenting with AI for several years now but, for the most part, those efforts have been just that: experiments. A relatively unknown startup, Symbolic.ai, wants to change that, and it just signed a major deal with News Corp, the media conglomerate owned by Rupert Murdoch.

News Corp, the major assets of which include MarketWatch, the New York Post, and The Wall Street Journal, is set to begin using Symbolic’s AI platform with its financial news hub Dow Jones Newswires.

Symbolic.ai, which was founded by former eBay CEO Devin Wenig and Ars Technica co-founder Jon Stokes, says its AI platform can “assist in the production of quality journalism and content” and that its tool has even led to “productivity gains of as much as 90% for complex research tasks.” The platform is designed to make editorial workflows more efficient, providing improvements in areas like newsletter creation, audio transcription, fact-checking, “headline optimization,” SEO advice, and others.

In general, News Corp has shown a willingness to integrate AI into its media operations. In 2024, the company signed a multi-year partnership with OpenAI, wherein it would license its material to the AI company. Last November, the media conglomerate signaled that it was considering branching out, and licensing its material to other AI companies.

            <div id="article-text">AI labs just can’t get their employees to stay put.

Yesterday’s big AI news was the abrupt and seemingly acrimonious departure of three top executives at Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab. All three were quickly snapped up by OpenAI, and now it seems they won’t be the last to leave. Alex Heath is reporting that two more employees are expected to leave for OpenAI in the next few weeks.

Meanwhile, Anthropic continues to pull alignment researchers away from OpenAI. The Verge is reporting that one of OpenAI’s senior safety research leads, Andrea Vallone, has left the company for Anthropic. Vallone specializes in how AI models respond to mental health issues — which is a particularly sensitive issue for OpenAI after its recent sycophancy problems. As The Verge notes, Vallone will be working under alignment researcher Jan Leike, who left OpenAI in 2024 over concerns the company wasn’t taking safety seriously enough.

If that wasn’t enough, OpenAI finished things off with one last major poach. Max Stoiber, formerly the director of engineering at Shopify, will be joining the company to work on OpenAI’s long-rumored operating system, in what he describes as a “small high-agency team.”

            <h2>How Russia’s Children Got So Violent</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/01/russia-children-violence-war/685635/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">One Tuesday morning last month, a 15-year-old Russian boy got ready for school by packing a paramilitary vest, a helmet, and a knife. Before leaving his house, he sent a manifesto to his classmates denouncing gay people and Jews, and quoting a mass murderer along with a white-supremacist conspiracy theory.

When the boy, identified by prosecutors as Timofey K., arrived at his school, located outside Moscow, he went to the bathroom to put on his gear, which he’d branded with neo-Nazi symbols and racist slogans. Then he filmed himself patrolling the hallways and asking people, at knifepoint, what nationality they were. Several gave the wrong answer, and Timofey stabbed them. Most survived, but a 10-year-old boy from a Tajik family did not.

Timofey’s attack wasn’t the first instance of brutality among schoolchildren in Russia last month. Two weeks earlier, a ninth grader had beaten an eighth grader so severely that the latter couldn’t remember what had happened by the time he got to a hospital. The next day, a group of teenagers tortured a schoolgirl in the Ural region, cutting into her back with a knife. Less than a week later, schoolboys repeatedly kicked a 10-year-old student in the head. Several days after that, a ninth grader stabbed his math teacher in the back.

For years, children in Russia have watched their country massacre Ukrainians and condemn hundreds of thousands of its own citizens to injury and death at the front. As violence has come to surround Russian youth, many seem to have become more violent themselves. Last year, the number of juvenile crimes in the country surged by 18 percent. Authorities also reported an uptick in “serious and especially serious” crime. “There is no positive ideology for children in a country fighting a murderous war,” Ilya Barabanov, a Russian journalist, told me. Instead, the war has amplified worldviews that encourage brutality.

The ethnic hatred that inspired Timofey’s attack has spread widely in Russia, thanks in part to President Vladimir Putin’s embrace of a militant strain of nationalism. The president has justified the war in Ukraine by appealing to a doctrine known as Russkiy mir, or “Russian world,” which makes no room for non-Russians. (Some of Putin’s soldiers in Ukraine have worn the kolovrat symbol that Timofey affixed to his vest, an neopagan emblem resembling a swastika.) Last year, the Kremlin even encouraged law enforcement to cooperate with ultranationalist groups. They helped police round up and deport tens of thousands of immigrants, who evidently did not belong in the Russian world.

Putin has claimed that the Russkiy mir ideology is based on “openness and constant respect” for other cultures. Yet just this week, his key propagandist, the TV presenter Vladimir Solovyov, called for additional “special military operations” in Armenia and Central Asia in order to maintain Russia’s “sphere of influence”—the same pretext for its war in Ukraine. For the Kremlin, other cultures, it seems, are not an object of respect; they are a threat that only violence and aggression can neutralize.

Timofey’s attack was not an aberration. It is a product of Putin’s dogma, and it has energized Russia’s many networks of ultranationalists and other extremists. The day after the assault, journalists spotted a neo-Nazi banner on the wall of the Federal Security Service office in Sochi. On social media, a neo-Nazi paramilitary group known as Rusich Army posted photos to its more than 1 million followers of the insignia on Timofey’s equipment, which included the English acronym SYGAOWN—“Stop Your Genocide Against Our White Nations.” One image showed Timofey pointing a knife at the school’s security guard; Rusich Army superimposed its logo on Timofey’s hand, seeming to claim him as one of its own.

Extremist groups are growing, and they are threatening further violence. In 2023, a far-right nationalist movement called Russkaya Obshchina said that its inaugural congress attracted some 200 people; it claimed to host more than 1,200 last year, including two members of Parliament. Last month, shortly before Timofey’s attack, the group posted a video with English subtitles, which included: “I will sharpen the knife. I will load the gun.” In June, nationalist Telegram channels reposted a similar video promising “big blood.”

Alexander Verkhovsky, the director of the SOVA Centre for Information and Analysis, has studied Russia’s far-right movements and watched them expand. Every year from 2012 to 2022, he attended a council that Putin held with civil-society and human-rights groups. Verkhovsky warned Putin to his face about Russia’s growing xenophobia and the effect it could have on the country. Putin didn’t seem to listen.

Still, Verkhovsky told me that he has been surprised by just how quickly ultranationalism has taken root among Russian teenagers in particular—and just how violent they have become as a result.

Even some of Putin’s loyalists have expressed alarm. Nina Ostanina, a legislator who has largely endorsed Putin’s policies, responded to Timofey’s attack last month by telling the National News Service, “We see tragedy after tragedy. Our children are armed with a destructive ideology, and they don’t have a positive” alternative.

That might not be such a bad thing for Putin. Soon enough, Russia’s children will supply him with a new generation of eager soldiers.</div>

            <h2>The Question That the Lawyers Representing Trans Athletes Didn’t Answer</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-16</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Transgender participation in women’s athletics is the single most difficult issue I’ve seen in 40 years of covering sports. It makes gambling, performance-enhancing drugs, and regulation of collegiate athletics look like tidy challenges. Two groups—trans women and cisgender women—both argue that they need equal protection from discrimination. But if they can’t have it at the same time in the often zero-sum realm of sports, who wins? As Justice Brett Kavanaugh put it during this week’s oral arguments in the first cases on the topic to come before the Supreme Court, “There are harms on both sides.”

At the core of the matter is whether trans-women athletes have a lingering testosterone advantage—a question that remains scientifically disputed. Until that point is settled, a resolution to this painful issue is hard to envision. Lawyers representing trans athletes in the two cases before the court—Little v. Hecox and West Virginia v. B.P.J., which challenge state laws that categorically ban trans women from women’s sports teams—made many torturous arguments. But they did not put forward winning ones. That’s a judgment not of their position, but of their performance. They failed to effectively answer this question: Does a trans woman who competes on a women’s team disadvantage other women?

The answer to this question is of vital importance to those who have fought for more than half a century to enforce Title IX. This stealthily radical law, enacted by Congress in 1972, forbids discrimination “on the basis of sex” in education and may be the closest thing this country has to an equal-rights amendment. It’s unclear how many people are directly affected by the issue of trans competitors in women’s sports—according to the NCAA, fewer than 10 trans students competed among 500,000 collegiate athletes in 2024. But to high-school and collegiate girls and women who fight tooth and nail for every scholarship, decent athletic facility, and ounce of confidence in what remains a man’s world, no number seems small. At the same time, few groups must fight harder for acceptance in a hostile world than trans women.

In Court this week, after more than three meandering hours of oral arguments, most of the justices didn’t seem to know what to do about this predicament, except that they’d rather not do much. This suggests that the Court may not issue a sweeping decision but will let states hash out matters locally, which would be a default loss for trans women: Currently, 29 states ban or restrict them from competing on women’s teams.

Read: Why aren’t women allowed to play baseball?

The dockets for Hecox and B.P.J. were loaded with amicus briefs that showed contradictory medical opinions. For the state petitioners, half a dozen sports doctors submitted 90 academic papers asserting that “even before puberty,” males have denser, stronger, and longer bones, and can “throw faster and kick harder than women.” They wrote, “No amount of testosterone suppression” would “eliminate these male athletic advantages.” According to one of those reports, boys had more speed, limb strength, and power as early as age 3.

The briefs in support of Becky Pepper-Jackson, the 15-year-old shot-putter and discus-thrower at the center of the West Virginia case, were equally adamant. Pepper-Jackson began transitioning from male to female when she was in third grade, and from sixth grade onward has taken medication to block male puberty, as well as estrogen treatment. Three researchers in exercise science wrote, “According to the scientific consensus there are no clear sex-based differences in athletic performance before the onset of puberty.” Furthermore, according to a study cited by Kathleen Hartnett, who represents the 24-year-old Idaho runner Lindsay Hecox, trans-women athletes could be at a disadvantage, if they have larger bones but less muscle and testosterone to drive their frame.

With the science unresolved, the word hypothetical was invoked by justices or counsel 18 times. Every which way the justices’ questions turned, there was a potential injustice for someone.

Where the respondents’ lawyers faltered the most was in addressing the potential harm to cisgender athletes. Hartnett admitted that the scientific record “is underdeveloped.” Joshua Block, representing Pepper-Jackson, insisted that his client has no physiological advantage at all, yet conceded that if she does in fact have an edge, “then we should lose.”

Kavanaugh asked during one exchange, “So why would we get involved at this point and constitutionalize?” The lawyers didn’t have a good answer for this or for the attendant question of how to view trans athletes under Title IX. The law forbids sex discrimination in education—yet Title IX makes an exception in recognizing biological differences in sports and allows teams to be girls- and women-only for the sake of safety, competitive fairness, and equal opportunity. Chief Justice John Roberts asked: Are trans athletes and their advocates asking the Court for an exception to the exception, and what would the constitutional implications of that be? “That would apply across an entire range of things,” he said, “where there’s a distinction currently between boys and girls quite apart from just athletics, is that correct?”

Roberts’s skepticism was not a good sign for the respondents. Roberts and Justice Neil Gorsuch joined their liberal colleagues in the 2020 Bostock v. Clayton County decision, which found that discriminating against gay and trans employees violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. But Roberts seemed to see a distinction between workplaces and playing fields, and he wasn’t the only one. Conservative and liberal justices alike seemed to share his worry that any ruling that touches on sex differences could be overbroad and misapplied to other areas.

Instead of answers to these concerns, the Court got evasions. Roberts pressed Hartnett as to whether she was challenging the distinction between boys and girls and asking for “an exception to the biological definition of girls.” Hartnett replied, “We’re not asking for a particular definition.” Her answers drew predictable irritation from Justice Samuel Alito, who asked, “How can a court determine whether there’s discrimination on the basis of sex without knowing what sex means for equal-protection purposes?” Yet Block seemed to want the Court to do just that. In a remarkably convoluted turn of phrase, Block said, “I wouldn’t look to whether or not it’s accurate to classify, you know, B.P.J. as—as male or female,” referring to the athlete he was representing. “I think the question is: Is she being denied an opportunity because of that classification?”

When was the last time you heard a lawyer say the words I don’t know? Because the fact is, when it comes to whether there is a legacy testosterone advantage, we don’t know. Separating people by sex, unlawful in most areas of civic life, is potentially vital to fairness in sports, just as we accept other classifications, such as weight and age, in the quest for an even starting line. A person can support trans civil rights with their whole heart and favor open competition for children yet also wonder whether athletes should compete in their birth category at the higher levels, for fear that a meaningful number of women may be harmed by transgender inclusion. Americans as a whole have yet to tease out a consensus philosophy on this, much less the biology of it. Until that happens, the justices would be wise to say that the issue lacks certainty, and to ask for more clarity and science before making a broad ruling.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Based on how members of the Trump administration rushed to describe Renee Nicole Good, the Minneapolis woman who was shot and killed in her minivan while protesting ICE, as a “domestic terrorist,” a “professional agitator,” and an “anti-ICE rioter” behind the wheel of a “four-thousand-pound missile,” here is how they might describe her dropping off her son at school just before she was killed.

The terrorist drove a 4,000-pound guided missile to deliver her small associate to the rendezvous point. She pulled up to where dozens of others just like her were also making their sinister deliveries at “School.” (An ominously short, unpatriotic name for any building. Where is the “Trump”?) Their tiny accomplices climbed out of the rolling weapons, carrying bags on their backs full of scribbled writings—Codes, perhaps? Or manifestos?—in crayon and pencil and Magic Marker. Some of them were armed with Uncrustables, suspicious, round, sandwich-like objects full of jelly and peanut butter. (Deadly biohazards!) Others had juice boxes.

Despite the snow on the roads, these terrorists were out in force in their four-wheeled missiles. The missiles were garnished, in some cases, with stickers. (Stickers that have slogans on them, religious icons that almost seem to spell out COEXIST—a threat, to be certain.)

Some of them were wearing hats but no makeup. (The mark of a mind disturbed.) Some of these women had a husband at home, and some had a wife. (Could this be part of the hostility toward “traditional American views on family” that is listed in the Justice Department’s new definition of domestic terror?) All of them were up to no good.

More investigation would show their true motives: Who had been funding them? Who had filled their vehicles with such dangerous and costly equipment? You could see the other weapons they carried: stuffed animals (plush, scale models of deadly threats to human life), insufficiently deferential smiles, a disrespectful attitude toward law enforcement—carried openly, in the car, where a child could see them. Who would allow such a thing around a child, knowing its potency! A disrespectful attitude—the kind of weapon that would justify any response, however violent.

Some of the terrorists walked their little cronies into the building, kissing the top of their head and whispering secret codes: “I love you.” “Be kind.” (A terrible thing, to indoctrinate a child.) “See you at pickup.” (A terrible thing, to lie to a child.)</div>

            <h2>High January Was Bound to Happen</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2026/01/high-january-alcohol-cannabis/685624/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Many Americans enthusiastically partake in Dry January, but it is rarely pitched as fun. After the holiday stretch of office parties and family gatherings, Americans have come to use the start of every year to abstain from alcohol in the name of health and auspicious beginnings. It’s a time of discipline, of cleansing, of embodying your mood board, even if it makes you a drag at parties. And it is also, as weed companies have learned, a marketing opportunity.

In recent years, weed companies have started to lean into the argument that taking the edge off sobriety with a low-dose gummy or THC drink still counts as dry. My social-media feeds are flooded with posts from cannabis companies pitching their products as fun and approachable tools to get through an alcohol-free month. Mary and Jane, an edibles company, makes a tantalizing proposition: “Dry January made easy.” Artet, which specializes in beverages, sells a “High & Dry January” bundle that includes a bottle of its THC-laced aperitif. Some products are conspicuously health-coded: North Canna describes its cannabis drinks as “functional,” and Feals highlights its edibles’ low calorie count. Above all, the ads emphasize how little booze you drink when you get high instead.

This push for a weed-filled January is, of course, a blatant (and somewhat silly) attempt by cannabis companies to get more customers. But as restrictions on marijuana loosen, and more Americans find themselves able and willing to fit the drug into their lives, Dry January does appear to be offering an opportunity for experimentation. In fact, cannabis sales surged in January 2024, and 21 percent of Dry January participants who responded to a 2023 survey swapped booze for weed that month.

None of the four cannabis-company founders I spoke with framed their products as replacements for alcohol per se. Still, many products marketed as Dry January aids aim to approximate the effect of having a single drink, leaving users buzzed but in control. These products tend to contain a low dose of THC, usually five milligrams or less. (One milligram of THC could give a weed newbie a pleasant buzz, and a heavy user might not feel five milligrams at all.) Wims, which sells THC-laced drink mix-ins, is designed to take effect and wear off in roughly the same amount of time as a serving of alcohol, Lauren Miller, one of the company’s co-founders, told me.

Even if THC can induce a similarly loose state as alcohol at those doses, weed companies still have some distance to overcome. In general, using cannabis as a substitute for social drinking is a harder sell than using it to avoid alcohol at home—not only because most bars don’t serve THC but also because the drug has a better chance of spurring you to melt into the couch than to mingle. Cannabis companies are trying to position their products to be used in the same context as alcohol. In states with looser cannabis laws, such as Minnesota and Tennessee, THC beverages from Nowadays are served at bars and hotels, Justin Tidwell, the company’s CEO and co-founder, told me. Wims can be dissolved into a drink, so “you don’t have to change your rituals or the way that you’re socializing,” Miller said.

The shaky logic of replacing one drug with another during a month dedicated to sobriety is hard to ignore. If the point of Dry January is to improve health, replacing alcohol with cannabis—which is not a benign substance—seems counterproductive. Far less is known about the long-term use of cannabis compared with alcohol, but both can be abused, cause dependence, and interfere with daily function and productivity, Ryan Vandrey, who helps run Johns Hopkins’s Cannabis Science Laboratory, told me. Some people are predisposed to react negatively to cannabis, experiencing anxiety, paranoia, or even cyclical vomiting. Over time, long-term heavy cannabis use can exacerbate mental-health conditions such as schizophrenia and depression. Plus, Vandrey said, weed hangovers are very real (if different from alcohol hangovers).

Still, for people with a more benign response to the drug, cannabis can be a genuinely useful tool for cutting back on booze, Vandrey said. If cannabis helps people drink less, it might indeed lower the health risks associated with excessive alcohol use, such as liver disease, cardiovascular problems, and cancer. Whatever the relative health benefits may be, Rachel Dillon, a co-founder of Mary and Jane, argues that cannabis is a realistic way to satisfy the all-too-familiar desire to decompress.

This month, I decided to put Dillon’s theory to the test. So far, High January, as I’ve come to call it, has mostly replaced my nightly glass of wine. Taking an evening 1.5-milligram gummy has subdued the urgency of the post-work rush—and, importantly, quieted any cravings for alcohol in that context. My mind is clearer, I’m sleeping better, and my mornings are less sluggish.

Yet cannabis has proved to be an imperfect tool for cutting down on my own alcohol consumption. The drug can’t quite re-create the intimacy of sharing a drink; during a recent late-night chat with a friend, I gave myself a free pass to enjoy a glass of Bordeaux. I’ve even experienced the all-too-real weed hangover. And I’ve felt conflicted about the need to soften my reality with any drug. Certainly, there are healthier ways to relax. Maybe I’ll discover them next January.</div>

Brandon LaRoque kept his life savings in a cryptocurrency account. One morning, as he went to check his balance, he discovered that it was all missing. LaRoque is one of many victims of the unregulated crypto industry, and soon there may be more. President Donald Trump has rolled back regulation of the industry. At the same time, he and his family have earned untold billions of dollars from new crypto ventures. Molly White, a writer focused on the intersections of tech and finance, describes the crypto industry, and explains how this new financial industry is shaping our politics and facilitating corruption within our government.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Brandon LaRoque: Things tend to happen to me first ’cause I’m usually the one willing to try something new first. And I hope I’m not the canary in the coal mine.

Anne Applebaum: From The Atlantic, this is Autocracy in America. I’m Anne Applebaum. In this new season, I am asking how the Trump White House is rewriting the rules of U.S. politics, and talking to Americans whose lives have been changed as a result.

Today’s episode: cryptocurrency, and the crypto oligarchs whose campaign to prevent any regulation of their industry is corrupting the American economy as well as American politics.

Donald Trump was once skeptical of the crypto industry; bitcoin, he once said, “seems like a scam.” But since his inauguration, Donald Trump and his family have turned 180 degrees and made hundreds of millions of dollars from their own crypto company, World Liberty Financial. At the same time, Trump has deregulated the crypto industry, making life easier for the oligarchs who run it, and potentially allowing them to harm thousands of ordinary consumers.

Brandon LaRoque is one those people, a victim of what he says was a hack involving a crypto coin called XRP.

LaRoque: My name is Brandon Laroque. I’m from Raleigh, North Carolina. I’m an Eagle Scout. I’m a veteran, and for the past 21 years, I ran a bar. We, my wife and I, ran it together. It’s called the Goat Bar, in Raleigh. The bar was our baby.

Every day when I used to leave my bar, if I had any extra cash with me, I would go to the ATM machine and I would buy XRP, and send it to my wallet. That was my savings.  I just kind of wanted to stay out of the banks as much as possible.

Each month what I would do is, since we had retired from our bar, I would sell off a little bit of XRP. So if we needed, you know, $5,000 to pay the mortgage or pay our car payment, or whatever it was, I would actually just sell off whatever I needed. And that’s what we’ve been living off for the past year.

On October 15, which was a Wednesday, I, being in the bar business, I’m a night owl. I’m up all night long. I’m usually going to bed when most people are getting up, going to work.

And I just happened to click on my wallet. I don’t check it every day. I clicked on the app, and I noticed that my XRP had all been just disappeared. It was 4 o’clock in the morning. I woke my wife up, literally in tears. Somehow I was hacked. I don’t know. And I still don’t even know how to this day.

1,210,000 XRP. It was worth approximately $3 million. It was our life savings.

The first week was a haze. I was so lost. I lost 12 pounds in seven days. It’s just so crazy that I’ve gone this long and now I’m right here at the finish line, and it’s gone.

I mean, I hate to say that money caused me the worst day of my life, but it caused me the worst day of my life, unfortunately, to be honest. ’Cause it wasn’t about the money as it was about, you know, I could just see all our dreams kind of disappearing when that happened.

We didn’t know what we were gonna do. I contacted my local sheriff. They did not have a cybercrimes unit. I contacted my local police department. They don’t have a cybercrimes unit. I also contacted the FBI. With the FBI, it was like, Just fill out a report. And I think there’s, like, less than a 1 percent chance of getting any of our crypto back. I mean, I hope there’s more, but I just really doubt it.

I think a lot of people are making a lot of money off the backs of a lot of people.

And, I mean, I’ll say, I am a Trump supporter, but I don’t agree with the Trump coin. I don’t agree with these meme coins. I don’t agree with the whole thing going on. I think it’s called World Liberty or World Finance, whatever it is. I think they’re all terrible.

If I had President Trump’s ear, I would ask him to please work with Congress and make crypto safer and easier for everyone. Even though I don’t like the banks, at least I can walk into a branch and speak to a human being, and they will sit down there and help me with my bank account. Why can’t you do the same thing with crypto?

I think that they all need to get off their butts and pass legislation to make it safer for everybody. Let’s get something done.

Molly White: I think there’s a lot of damage that can potentially happen to everyday people through crypto.

Applebaum: Molly White is a software engineer and researcher. She writes the newsletter Citation Needed, which focuses on the crypto industry and the intersections between finance and tech.

Molly, for listeners who aren’t steeped in finance or who are just unfamiliar, how do you describe what crypto is, and how do you explain how it’s different from traditional banking?

White: Well, crypto is really a form of a digital asset, so there’s no paper currency. Broadly speaking, people are not using crypto for buying their groceries or paying their rent or those types of things. Most people buy and sell them for speculative purposes.

Applebaum: Speculative purposes, meaning they invest in it, and they hope the price will go up.

Applebaum: And how can unregulated crypto hurt ordinary consumers?

White: So there is the risk when it comes to the asset itself in the sense that these assets are highly volatile. Many of them, you don’t know who has created the asset. You don’t know who is running the business. You don’t know their credibility or their background. They aren’t required to disclose it under the current regulatory regime. There have been many, many cryptocurrencies that are known as “rug pulls,” where, essentially, the creators of these assets inflate the price artificially and then sell all their tokens, profiting immensely themselves but at the expense of everyone they convinced to purchase the tokens.

You know, there’s very little regulation preventing that type of activity, whereas you would expect that activity to be quickly shut down in more regulated ends of the financial system. So there’s the sort of asset-level risk, but then there’s also the broader risk, which is that if you buy a stock today through your brokerage account, the price of the stock might go up and down, but you know, fairly confidently, that that stock is still gonna belong to you when you open up your brokerage in a month.

When it comes to the cryptocurrency industry, we’ve seen repeated examples of crypto firms that have gone bankrupt, that have run off with all the money, that have just vanished into thin air practically. We saw the collapse of FTX, in 2022—

Applebaum: Right, Sam Bankman-Fried’s company—

White: Correct, where it turned out that people were trusting this company that was actually taking their money and then using them to trade or to make investments in other companies or to purchase real estate for the executives of that company. And people ended up losing a lot of money when FTX went bankrupt. And now its CEO is spending a long time in jail.

And I think a lot of people don’t understand that there is very little protection against that type of activity. Especially in the United States, I think we’ve all become very comfortable with banks or regulated financial institutions, where there is some degree of oversight, where you expect that a company is not gonna just run off with all your money without any recourse. Or, you know, if your bank fails, you expect that you don’t have to worry about your deposits, because they are insured up to a fairly large amount. And I think a lot of people who are being sucked in by the marketing and the promises of getting rich overnight, frankly, don’t understand that there is that amount of risk that they’re getting into.

Applebaum: So it’s a little bit like the banking industry before deposit insurance, before banks were regulated. It’s as if you could have had your money in a bank, and then the bank could go bankrupt or disappear overnight, and then you would just lose everything.

White: Right, exactly. I mean, that is, when we saw crypto collapses throughout the past handful of years, there were many instances where people lost their funds and they said, I thought I had the same protections as a bank. I thought the FDIC would step in and reimburse me. And now we are actually seeing the regulators being pulled back and told to step away from the crypto industry. And we’re seeing legislation being passed that would essentially enable the crypto industry to expand its business activities without any additional consumer protections.

Applebaum: You keep a running tally of money that’s been lost in schemes and scams since 2021. Where are we now approximately?

White: Let me take a quick look. So the running total on my website for the money that’s been lost is almost $80 billion, and that’s actually a very conservative estimate. So that’s really the lower bound, I would say.

Applebaum: So to be clear, this is $80 billion lost by ordinary consumers.

White: Yeah, it’s a mix of everyday people and institutions.

Applebaum: Let me shift now to the current administration. Maybe we could start with World Liberty Financial. Can you explain what it is and how it works and how it could be used, in effect, to bribe the president?

White: So World Liberty Financial is a cryptocurrency platform that was created by Trump, some of his sons, and a handful of external partners in August 2024.

Applebaum: And one of those external partners is Zach Witkoff, who is the son of Trump’s Middle East and Russia envoy, Steve Witkoff.

White: Right, and this has been a very lucrative project for the Trump family. They’ve earned hundreds of millions of dollars just from selling WLFI tokens that currently don’t really do much, but allow people to buy favor with the president, essentially.

Applebaum: Can we just focus on that for a second? So people are buying tokens, but then there’s nothing they can use those tokens for, right? I mean, they can’t be used to buy anything else, and they can’t be traded easily, and they can’t be sold easily. So the only reason to buy them is to be able to show the president that you spent money on his company.

White: I agree that it really is just a way to buy favor with the president. And we’ve seen that being done through people like Justin Sun, for example, who is a foreign national, is not permitted to contribute to Trump’s campaign, but was making a $75 million purchase of these WLFI tokens. And Trump and his family take a 75 percent cut of that.

Applebaum: So Justin Sun invested in World Liberty Financial, and what did he get in exchange?

White: He ended up being rewarded with an advisory position at the World Liberty project, which gives him close access to the Trump family.

Applebaum: And at the time, he was under an investigation as well, no?

White: Correct. Justin Sun was actively fighting a civil lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission that alleged fraud in addition to the usual unregistered sales of securities.

Applebaum: And since then, those charges have been removed? Or we’re not investigating him anymore?

White: The Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit has been paused, pending resolution. So essentially dropped. And so, yes, I mean he essentially has nothing to worry about anymore in terms of both criminal and civil litigation.

Applebaum: I mean, obviously, we can’t prove the connection, but there is a series of strange events. So, Justin Sun made an investment in World Liberty Financial. Subsequent to that, the investigation into him was lifted, although his investment was locked and frozen, later on, by World Liberty Financial. So obviously, there is more to this story. [Sun has denied any wrongdoing.]

White: Correct. You know, we’ve seen other examples where companies have partnered with Trump’s companies in ways that are very lucrative for the Trump family, and then they’ve seemed to suddenly enjoy relief from legal concerns. We’ve seen, for example, Coinbase spending millions of dollars on political contributions, whether it was to crypto-focused super PACs that were supporting pro-crypto congressional candidates, or if it was sponsorship of the Trump military parade or a million dollars to Trump’s inauguration fund. And then shortly after Trump took office, the SEC enforcement case against them was dismissed with prejudice, meaning it can’t be refiled. I mean, the list really goes on.

Applebaum: Some of this doesn’t sound that new; it just sounds like classic lobbying. The difference, it seems to me, though, is both in the scale, in the amounts of money being thrown around, in the fact that people seem to be paying to get rid of their legal problems. And of course, the huge difference is the personal involvement of the president and his family.

White: They are involved in almost every aspect of the crypto industry at this point. The Trump family is profiting from cryptocurrency businesses and crypto investments, and President Trump is essentially directing the regulation and legislation around the crypto industry.

Applebaum: Can you estimate how much money the president and his family have made through this line of business?

White: We’re talking billions of dollars at this point.

Applebaum: This seems to me the genuinely unusual and new piece of this, actually, which is that you have an industry that is directly benefiting the president. So he is directly, personally, and immediately benefiting from his own regulatory decisions. I mean, what stopped that before? Was it just our norms—presidents just didn’t do that.

White: It’s probably fair to say that some presidents have profited to some extent from the office, but this is certainly a dramatic escalation of directly profiting, and in quite enormous amounts. I think some of it comes down to norms. I think some of it comes down to an unwillingness or inability to investigate and prosecute corruption.

There have been multiple lawmakers calling for investigations into these clear conflicts of interest, and those have largely not gone anywhere, due to the unwillingness of the rest of Congress to step up and look into this type of activity.

Applebaum: Yeah. It seems to me the other big difference is: Other presidents profited after leaving the presidency. They made money from speeches, but I can’t think of, in modern times at least, of a president who has earned this kind of money, this fast, while in office.

Applebaum: We’ve been talking about the tangled web of the crypto world and how Trump and his family have personally benefited. But it feels like hardly anyone is talking about how this new source of money—billions of dollars—is also giving the presidency new levels of autonomy and power.

White: It’s sort of a chicken-and-an-egg question. To what extent has the authoritarianism enabled the policies that have allowed him to acquire so much cryptocurrency? And then the other way around.

Applebaum: Molly, there is one country that has made crypto a central part of its financial system, and that is El Salvador. It’s led by Nayib Bukele, a democratically elected president who has, like Trump, also sought to centralize power and eliminate checks and balances. We know the Trump family admires him. Donald Trump Jr., together with Tucker Carlson, went to Bukele’s inauguration in 2024. How has El Salvador’s experiment with crypto worked out?

White: Yeah, so El Salvador took a very similar approach, frankly, to bitcoin a number of years ago, where the president essentially unilaterally determined that they were going to create this national fund of bitcoin. They were gonna take money belonging to the country and put it into purchasing bitcoin.

This was not something that was particularly popular among the populace, but it was sort of a unilateral decision by Bukele to sort of foist bitcoin upon the everyday people in El Salvador, who were told to download crypto wallets. Businesses were instructed to begin accepting bitcoin in their day-to-day operations.

And it was ultimately not very beneficial to Salvadoran people. This was government money that could have been used in much more socially beneficial ways that was instead being stockpiled away in crypto investments. There were technical problems with the bitcoin wallet, and the [government] rollout that resulted in people’s assets being stolen from them. It was, frankly, fairly disastrous. And so it was a very challenging time for El Salvador.

Applebaum: So it’s not as if El Salvador has created this beautiful model that we can just follow.

White: Well, I mean, it sort of seems like Trump and his family have been emulating El Salvador in many ways. But El Salvador is not a great example of, I think, where this country should be going. But it, unfortunately, has strong parallels to Trump, where the president has consolidated power in very alarming ways. He runs the government in a fairly authoritarian way. And he has gone all in on crypto.

Applebaum: Moving back to the United States, how would you describe the Trump administration’s regulatory approach in this second term?

White: Well, the strategy so far has been to completely defang financial regulators. You know, there have been executive orders instructing the SEC and [the Commodity Futures Trading Commission] to essentially back off from the cryptocurrency industry, and the Department of Justice as well. And the people that the Trump administration has been installing at regulators and in these other agencies have largely been coming from the cryptocurrency industry. I mean, we’ve seen, essentially, this revolving door happening, where many of the people now in charge of regulating the cryptocurrency industry have very direct ties to that industry.

Applebaum: Let me shift now to ask you about the idea of a cryptocurrency reserve, a “Bitcoin Strategic Reserve&quot;, or having crypto be part of the deeper bones of the U.S. financial system. Walk us through what that proposal is and how it would work, and then I’ll ask you about how it could go wrong.

White: So the “Bitcoin Strategic Reserve” and the “Digital Asset Stockpile” were created with sort of an executive order that takes a pile of crypto assets that were already being held by the U.S. government and pledges to continue to hold them rather than sell them. And so the U.S. government actually holds a fairly substantial amount of cryptocurrencies, largely that were seized as a result of law-enforcement activity.

So, for example, if there’s, you know, a criminal case against an online drug marketplace or something like that, and they shut that down, they seize the crypto assets, once that case is finished in court, those assets are forfeited to the government. That means that the government essentially has them in their government crypto wallet, and historically they have sold them off. But now the idea is that the government will actually hold those assets in kind and essentially hope to profit from increases in, for example, bitcoin price.

Applebaum: And how could this be damaging? What’s wrong with doing that?

White: Well, it’s essentially the U.S. government engaging in crypto speculation. These are assets that historically would’ve gone towards funding various treasury activities. Now they’re being held in reserve, and it’s unclear under what circumstances that those assets will be used for normal government purposes. It also, you know, we’re seeing various members of the government, including people who are very active in defining crypto policy, talking about trying to find ways to add to those holdings by purchasing crypto assets.

You know, we saw this sort of mad scramble when Trump was talking about creating this executive order from various crypto companies that wanted their crypto assets included in this stockpile as well, because they understood that this would be both an endorsement of their crypto assets and would drive demand.

Applebaum: And would this also not give the president access to funds or to money that he could spend as he wants? Money that hasn’t been allocated by Congress?

White: I think that’s a very serious question. You know, there is not the type of congressional oversight when it comes to spending these types of alternative funds, and it seems to me that this is a way for Trump to essentially create this stockpile of funds that he could then use without much oversight.

Applebaum: So he would have sort of his own slush fund.

Applebaum: Can you describe the involvement of the crypto industry in the 2024 elections? Was that different from the industry’s previous involvement, and what exactly were they trying to achieve?

White: Yeah. So the crypto industry became very heavily involved in the 2024 elections in ways that they had really not been previously. We saw the involvement of these massive, single-issue pro-cryptocurrency super PACs that were getting heavily involved in congressional elections. The industry contributed over $150 million to those super PACs. They spent around $130 million influencing congressional races, where they were hoping to either install pro-crypto candidates or remove people who were viewed to be enemies of the crypto industry. At one point it was almost half of all corporate spending was coming out of the cryptocurrency industry.

Applebaum: Wow. So that’s even beyond the scale of spending of the oil-and-gas industry, for example.

White: Yeah, I mean, you look at the size of the crypto industry, which is very small comparatively, and they were spending like the pharma industry, like the oil industry.

And it was very, very overt around the messaging. Basically, the industry saying, If you don’t support us, we are going to crush you with millions and millions of dollars in these elections where—these are often states where these crypto companies don’t have any real presence, but they are funneling money to control these elections in ways that the actual residents of those states often have very little say in as a result. And so you end up with these corporations contributing huge amounts of money to essentially raise their interests above those of everyday constituents.

Applebaum: So crypto companies are making enormous contributions to state, Senate, and House campaigns, even where they don’t even have a physical presence, just to be able to have influence in Congress later on. Tell me about the possibility of using crypto for illegal campaign funding. Money is moved around anonymously so easily in that world. For example, if a foreign national wanted to influence a campaign, could they do it via the crypto industry?

White: Potentially. I mean, we’re already seeing these various sort of indirect ways in which foreign nationals and U.S. people are directing funds towards the Trump family, for example. And those are not campaign contributions, but they certainly appear to be influencing policy. You know, essentially, crypto could be a conduit for bribery that is challenging to trace. I mean, one of the goals of crypto is to be fairly anonymous, to make it challenging for people to know where funds are coming from.

Applebaum: Do you expect the industry to be involved in the midterms? Do you expect big investments in campaigns once again?

White: Absolutely. We’ve already seen these same crypto PACs from 2024 raising money for the 2026 elections. We’re actually seeing new super PACs being established. One of them has already committed to spending $100 million in the midterms. And we’re seeing politicians and candidates speaking very frankly about wanting to install pro-crypto candidates. I mean, the chair of the Senate Banking Committee, Tim Scott, recently said the No. 1 thing that the crypto industry can do is fire the legislators that are in your way. So we’re seeing very aggressive incitement for these crypto PACs to get very involved in the midterms.

Applebaum: So legislators who support consumer protection, who care about ordinary people not being ripped off—they’re the ones who will be the target of the crypto funding in the 2026 elections?

White: Absolutely. I mean, we saw Sherrod Brown, for example, in Ohio. The crypto industry spent $40 million to support his competitor to get him out of office. And Sherrod Brown is going to be running again. And we’re already hearing people talking about opposing him because he is such a strong advocate for consumer protections or for actions against big banks, Big Finance. We’ve seen calls for the industry to come out in force against him.

White: And I think we’ll see very similar strategies against other proconsumer protection candidates that run in 2026.

Joan Brugge: In the 50 years I’ve been doing research, I’ve never heard of the government cutting off research funding across the board. It’s shocking and demoralizing to have to deal with this.

Applebaum: In 2025, unexpected freezes to federal funding created chaos for thousands of labs, research projects, and experimental teams. What does this assault on science have to do with the health of our democracy?</div>

A great counter for why production hasn&#39;t increased (spoiler: because the manufactures got burnt before).No doubt. Back in the day, the HDD market was notorious for booms, busts, and profit margins thinner than the oxide layer on the platters.Supply has also got to be tight. Manufacturers are going to tightly plan production to keep costs in line, thus making it hard to rapidly ramp up production. In those circumstances, even a small shift in demand can lead to large jumps in price.

I used to work for an enterprise storage company making secondary storage devices (that is, destinations for backups). High capacity and low cost were the selling points (and write performance and reliability, but those don&#39;t figure in here).

For the last 15 years, the shift in the enterprise storage industry has been to SSDs for everything, just like for home use. Around the coffee machine, we talked about how secondary storage was the last industry segment which still used spinning rust. Last I checked, ev

Before everyone starts dunking on this, remember that it&#39;s possible, even likely, that Code.org used an LLM to write their AI-use policy.

Anyone want to take bets on how long it takes their corporate masters to make them square their policy with their marketing efforts like stuffing co-pilot everywhere they can?

> We ask that candidates do not [...] use AI during interviews and take-home assignments without explicit consent from the interview team.

Assign a take-home task as part of your interview and you&#39;re dead to me, so I guess we&#39;re even?

I&#39;m a gray beard developer, so I&#39;ve been coding WAY longer than AI has been around.  I don&#39;t vibe code in any way, but when I&#39;m coding in VS Code with Copilot enabled, I&#39;ll be typing a line and AI figures out what I&#39;m doing and completes the line.  TAB.  Next line, AI figures out what I&#39;m doing and completes the line.  TAB.I&#39;m getting used to it and maybe a little dependent on it.  Put me in a coding interview without AI, and it might be harder than it used to be.

A completely reasonable and intelligent policy that does not, in anyway, invalidate their greater message or goal.

Let&#39;s try to make a big deal out of of this outrage clickbait. /s

Analogy: &#39;Winchester firearms does not tolerate the use of firearms as a coercive tool during the hiring process.&#39;

We do not allow candidates to use AI, IDEs, or high level languages to perform their coding tests. In their real jobs we know they use these things, but why should the hiring process reflect the skillset we require?

Why should anyone play their gatekeeper games? Just move on, they&#39;re basically irrelevant anyway

is this refering to power supply? like electrical lines? or generators/motors? wouldn&#39;t it be better to invest in something needed for nuclear powerplant? that&#39;s my understanding from playing SimCity on SNES.

so the summary refers to data center components, looking up scrap ram recycling prices, there&#39;s not much copper in them.

Don&#39;t nuclear power plants use copper wire?

Nuclear power is too expensive and can&#39;t survive without subsidies. You&#39;re probably going to spend $30-40 billion and get one built in a decade.

Nuclear plants require a 8-10 build-out. They wouldn&#39;t be ready in time for your basic ADHD--addled Chief Widget who will have a heart attack if its company is left behind in the Great AI Stampede.

It makes me want to vomit, the way the United States and the United Kingdom have ceded production of raw materials to China and other countries.

We had trouble with copper until this one mine dared start up again.

England can&#39;t even refine iron ore into steel anymore.

Listen up, cupcakes:  A country that can&#39;t work it&#39;s own raw materials will be subjugated by those who do.

Here endeth the lesson on national sovereignty.

Listen up, cupcakes: A country that can&#39;t work it&#39;s own raw materials will be subjugated by those who do.Do you have historical examples of that happening, or is it a hypothesis?

Listen up cupcake, destroying your country&#39;s environment means your country isn&#39;t worth living in in order to use the metals for which you seem to have a woodie.

So, like a good imperialist you prefer to asset strip some other country rather than do it responsibly in your own.

The biggest data centers each require tens of thousands of metric tons of copper for all the wires, busbars, circuit boards, transformers and other electrical components housed there.No, they do not, circuit boards aside. Wires, bus bars, and transformers (which are just a bunch of wire and a core) can all be made of aluminum. They then have to be bigger, but aluminum is cheaper than copper. You have to use AlOx paste where you join aluminum to some other metal, but it&#39;s readily available. Don&#39;t gaslight us.

This makes no sense - Amazon is giving a mining company commute services and cash to secure raw copper, which it will in turn hand off to wire/cable manufacturers in exchange for finished cabling to wire future data centers? This is crazy. I think it&#39;s more likely just an investment intended to increase supply and drive down costs - I can&#39;t believe Amazon actually want raw copper.

On one hand, I agree that it sounds bananas. But on the other, maybe it does make sense. We all know that if done well vertical integration has numerous benefits including cost. For example Brembo owns practically everything they depend on — When you buy brake products from Brembo they are made from ore that companies they own mined and refined and they come in boxes made in their own paper product plant. If Amazon is buying the raw materials and passing them on at cost, then they&#39;re saving the costs

It does not require that much copper.  The calculation is incorrect.

Amazon doesn&#39;t make wire, bus bars, or even circuit boards. Though the latter is a close call.

Since Amazon manufactures none of these things, I can&#39;t help but wonder what their true reason for acquiring the copper supply is. Is it to get in to selling commodities? Is it to control raw materials to their suppliers for a cost benefit, or even a competitive advantage?

I&#39;d really love to know who actually makes these decisions, to buy copper or invest in power generation, and what their thinking is. That Amazon

That Amazon builds data centers doesn&#39;t mean that they need to be in the raw materials or supplier industries.

Doesn&#39;t it?  Past a certain size you can&#39;t just treat &quot;the market&quot; as an abstraction.  Just as with power, at that size you can&#39;t just plug in that much equipment and assume the power will be there.  At this scale supply is contracted ahead of time and does not spring into existence any time soon just because you are willing to pay for it. Amazon&#39;s risk isn&#39;t just having to pay more for copper-int

As a viewer, we got Rogue 1, Andor, and Last Jedi. She seems to have done her best to avoid giving us more of that - more shows for adults, not focused on selling toys. So I&#39;m not going be too upset over her departure.

For me, Star Wars is still only the original trilogy (the reworked fan edit being the best releasse).Everything else that came after more or less doesn&#39;t fit well with those movies.

Though I don’t have much hope for improvement; Dave Filoni seems little better.

I enjoy different takes on things, different types of story in the same universe. It&#39;s a shame more people didn&#39;t watch Andor, or didn&#39;t understand it.

I&#39;d burn the entire back catalogue for another Andor.

Every single movie should have generated a billion+ in profit.  This is Star Wars.  The audience was huge, global, and insanely loyal.

She destroyed the property.  I didn&#39;t bother to see most of them after the shock of his horrible the first ones under her hand were.

Most of the tv shows were crap too.  Sticking a baby muppet in wasn&#39;t enough and that was the highlight of her era.

I saw Star Wars the day it came out. I have the originals on VHS, DVD, Blu-ray. (Han did fire first, BTW)

While I remember dialogue from the original trilogy, and I vaguely know the plot lines of the prequels, I have absolutely no idea what happens in the last three episodes of the series. It&#39;s a blank.

&quot;Under Kennedy&#39;s stewardship, Lucasfilm amassed more than $5.6 billion in box office&quot;

On the face of it, you&#39;d say yes, she was quite good at what she did...

But if we account for how many billion dollar blockbusters there were in the last decade compared to the 1970s... I would say the scale has changed fundamentally. So yeah, she was profitable, sure... but... How profitable could it have been?

As far as I am aware, the Disney theme parks are struggling and merchandise was extremely disappointing on Star Wars in general under her reign. And that is an interesting factor, considering how much merchandise took off with the original films.

One wonders how much the cultural pressure of Star Wars had to do with the numbers not sucking because from where I stand, the media products released under Disney&#39;s Star Wars were mediocre at best.

Disney paid 4.5 billions for Lucas film, and the 5.3 billions is the box office figure, not what went into Disney&#39;s coffers (half of it, maybe ? No idea, really). And that&#39;s not factoring in the cost of production and promotion (and I&#39;m pretty sure that apart from the Mandalorian, none of the series has broken even, nevermind turning in a profit).

Actually, that&#39;s even worse than I imagined. I know there were special clauses in her contract, but how Disney&#39;s execs could have let such

Ah, you&#39;re right, I didn&#39;t think it through. The 5.8 billion wasn&#39;t profit.

Yes, I read that the cinemas take about 50% of the box office and lets not forget that they do not include marketing in production cost. That&#39;s usuall 30 to 50% on top of production cost.

As for why people are allowed to operate like that I have no idea. I am GenX/Millennial. I grew up being told that to a CEO shareholders are akin to God and that shareholders are unfeeling ultracapitalists that would eradicate earths population if th

But that right there is my point... did they think they could make the DEI stuff rain profit? And why were they ready to wait for it for that long?

Vanguard is the largest stockholder of Blackrock at over 8% that isn&#39;t part of the &quot;others&quot; slice.

But Blackrock sure as hell IS a publicly traded company with a LOT of different interests... Why were they allowed to burn that money? Why is Fink still CEO? He holds less than a half percent in stock.

Come on! &quot;From a certain point of view&quot; was right there!

I know what I like and everyone can have a different opinion.

Say what you like about originals / sequels / prequels / TV versions etc. but I enjoyed Rogue One.

I&#39;m still waiting for them to make an equally enjoyable Rogue Two.

What blows my mind is a company that large can invest that amount of money in a &quot;trilogy&quot; without any kind of plot line or story to to map out three films. Especially when the plan is to have three entirely different directors for the films.

The latest/last trilogy started out fairly strong but went downhill from there.

Force Awakens was a well made and directed movie that was too safe and little more than a remake of Star Wars.Last Jedi at least dared to try something new and was enjoyable enough to watch in theatres but it just didn&#39;t treat the characters well and didn&#39;t work as the second part of a trilogy - throw everything away and replace it with almost nothing is not a good idea.Rise of Skywalker was a shitshow, exhausting to watch and ju

When Lucas sold Star Wars for $4B, it sounded like a ridiculously low number.  Even without the rights to make new content, that was worth well over $1B.  If he were shopping around instead of giving it to Disney, it probably was worth closer to $10B.  With honest accounting, that&#39;s probably in the range of value Disney has received, and that&#39;s with having produced the worst possible sequels.

Reading about US stories, especially about policy changes and other government actions, reminds me of the &quot;Florida man&quot; stories... &quot;What on earth have they done again?&quot; ...

I love the bit about coal-powered data centers, given the impact of burning coal and the ever-growing need for data centers, that&#39;s match made in heaven.

Why would higher prices on natgas increase carbon dioxide emissions?

Even if people chose coal as an alternative, there are only so many scenarios where that would be possible.  Customers bound to natgas (particularly consumer-level users, of whom there are many) only have the choice of turning down the heat/using less hot water.  In general, higher energy prices means less energy used which means less carbon emitted.

Because it becomes more cost effective to use less environmentally-friendly alternatives that produce more CO2, like coal, instead of natgas.



Profits > somewhere healthy to live.  One of the many &quot;Fsck you, I&#39;ve got mine!&quot; mantras of unfettered capitalism.Most utilities in the US are tightly regulated, especially with respect to price.  When the retail prices are fixed by regulation and the cost of production goes up, they have to do something to avoid losing money.  In a truly market-based, capitalist, system, they could pass the question on to consumers, offering them the choice of different power source mixes, with the consequences that choosing a greener mix might cost more.  Some utilities actually have permission from the regulators to do this, and off

I don&#39;t know but I&#39;d guess that it makes other CO2 intensive generation more attractive.

Ultimately, the majority of fossil fuel generation is doomed, renewables are now comfortably cheaper by pretty much any metric unless you put a very high value on 100% availability.

For a long while the west will probably need a rump of fossil generation because our entire system is built around 100% reliable grid power at any load. It will likely be the developing world that will get there first as they don&#39;t already hav

I&#39;m still waiting on actual price comparisons between natgas and solar/wind + storage.  Seems like every market that fully embraces renewables experiences high electrical prices despite continued assurances that renewables are cheap.

The USA actually had an increase in the price of natural gas due to Russia invading Ukraine, which caused the embargo on Russian oil and natural gas, so a lot of the oil and natural gas produced in the USA is now going to Europe when previously it would have stayed in the USA.   But, we have Moscow Mitch McConnell who WANTS coal to be used, because his third world state is a coal producer, and we have Trump who is against anything that might produce clean energy because his demented mind thinks that it&#39;s ba

I&#39;m not sure that even starting a war with Europe will be enough to get rid of Trump.

Hmm why would anyone blame Trump for going all in on coal making the problem worse...I guess we&#39;ll never know.

Remind us all again which team is trying to ban windmills?

I honestly don&#39;t think Trump&#39;s policy has much to do with it at all.  The big drop from 2005-20[12][1-4] has everything to do with around 1998 being when people started taking carbon reduction seriously.  That period saw a lot of the low hanging fruit and low costs to address emissions sources handled.  You continue to see improvements in the 2020-2024 range due to massive economic contraction related to covid policy.

Nobody wants to pollute, generally speaking more carbon emissions means more energy from no

Who knew that kneecapping the EPA would lead to more pollution?  That gay woke agency created by (checks notes) Richard Nixon?

Great. We&#39;re staving off he Coming Ice Age. Dear Everyone: You&#39;re Welcome.

Oh, &quot;warming&#39;? With an 1850 (Very COLD time) as baseline.... sheesh!

If you want BS predictions, ask a &quot;climate scientist.&quot;If you have even a shadow of a clue, you&#39;re talking with solar physicists.

That Freud portrait out front should have told you so much.

This is the only take worth reading here. Everyone else is just injecting their own opinion. &quot;self reported&quot; is tantamount to completely useless, and any decent researcher is fully aware of this. May as well have titled the study &quot;teens underestimate / lie about screen time&quot;.

The same issue is why most &quot;studies&quot; about diet and weight loss are also useless. People aren&#39;t lab rats.

all of them had something in common, which was rabid media outlets with a hot-button issue that drove readers/viewers with a mix of politician grandstanding.

Don&#39;t forget violent video games and He-Man action figures and comic books and Penny dreadfuls.

Does anyone here have any specimens of adolescents that don&#39;t look like mental cases?

I know there are some.  But they can be hard to spot.

Why don&#39;t you grow up, spawn some, bring them up and come and share your achievements with us, eh?

Read the study, the details are there.  We talk all the time on /. about correlation VS causation.

It clearly shows depression, anxiety, and other mental health concerns. They exist and aren&#39;t the point of the study.

With a respectable sample size it
shows that the time spent is not the cause.  In the analysis section it discusses how symptoms of depression and anxiety include withdrawal. Depressed people use it more, but it&#39;s true regardless of the amount they used it. Increas

Simply: usage time is not the cause. Depressed kids do withdraw more, but time spent in games and social media are not the cause behind the depression. More time, average time, less time, and heavily restricted time made no difference.Less time?  How about cutting them off cold turkey?  How about deleting all their accounts and content and THEN studying the mental response?Did the study dare to prove or ask the more relevant problem regarding pure addiction rather than focusing solely on one type of behavioral response?  This is like watching a show focusing on Vegas junkies addicted to pulling slot machine arms for hours a day, but only showing when they lose money instead of showing them losing their cars, homes, families, and sanity.

I can make numbers dance to any tune, too. But that don&#39;t make it true.

Clearly if you have mental issues, you are likely to have fewer real life friends and also have a greater need for socialization.

The basic problem with most of these type of studies is the desire for a simple fix and the fear of the new tend to make the uneducated reverse cause and effect.

If you want to blame something you think is associated with a problem, chances are it is a symptom/attempt to treat that problem.

This is retarded.  The hypothesis has never been that on an individual level, more social media time = more problems.

Here&#39;s what I think:  Most of the intense harm comes in very small lumps.  These harmful lumps might come in a sea of banal harmless usage, or they might be nearly the entire usage some people have.  There is no reason to think that the volume of usage for a given person would correlate with their personal level of harm.

On the other hand, the ubiquity and unavoidability of social media use in

Could we have a study on how much the current sociology and economic environment in the real world is causing teen mental health problems?

Apparently &#39;they&#39; need a study to hammer them with the truly obvious.

&quot;Aw, you can come up with statistics to prove anything, Kent. 14% of all people know that..&quot; from the episode &quot;Homer the Vigilante,&quot; https://www.youtube.com/watch?... [youtube.com].

And the &quot;study&quot; does not define what is &quot;weak&quot; just like other studies and &quot; is not _good_ for you&quot; or when the tobacco industry study that showed the elderly benefited from smoking. As they were more likely to be dead and beyond caring...so avoided the issues with geriatrics; the later part was not highlighted.

So, the “experts” have concluded there’s little evidence to suggest social media affects a teens mental health?  OK, let’s prove that theory then.

Gather those experts and lock them in the same room with a couple dozen nothing-to-see-here teens who are forced to give up The Cellular Precious before they got locked in the same room.

After a couple of days, let’s see what the experts have to say about mental health.

Then tell them you’ve deleted all their social media accounts

So, the “experts” have concluded there’s little evidence to suggest social media affects a teens mental health? OK, let’s prove that theory then.

Actually, no, they haven&#39;t. The study was only about screen time. By the words of the researcher himself:

&quot;(...) our results do not support the idea that simply spending time on social media or gaming leads to mental health problems -- the story is far more complex than that.&quot;

Before you dismiss this study, pay attention that it is very basic science trying to access specifically the effect of screen time on kids.

&quot;We know families are worried, but our results do not support the idea that simply spending time on social media or gaming leads to mental health problems -- the story is far more complex than that.&quot;No, it didn&#39;t say that social media is harmless or it doesn&#39;t affect children. It only inferred that screen time alone doesn&#39;t. As with any basic science study, more research is needed to try and understand the subject in full.

It’s easy to forget that Texas’ bounty bill, S.B. 8, was once at the epicenter of the nation’s abortion politics. In 2021, Texas passed the law, which allows literally anyone to sue providers and those who aid them any time an abortion is performed after six weeks of pregnancy. The law created a blueprint for other conservative states and was upheld by the Supreme Court later that year—prior to the decision that overturned Roe v. Wade. It also had major impacts: leading clinics to stop offering procedures after six weeks and eventually producing an increase in both births among teenagers and infant mortality across the state. But now, S.B. 8 seems quaint, a relic of 2021—just like reporters discussing the “post-Trump era” or Ben Affleck and J.Lo giving it another try. Texas now enforces a law that bans abortion from fertilization and another, passed just this year, that authorizes suits against anyone who mails, provides, manufactures, or distributes abortion pills. No one seems to need S.B. 8 when more powerful criminal laws are on offer.

But bounty bills are now at the center of a major conflict about whether ban states can censor speech, advocacy, and donations related to abortion. S.B. 8 certainly has ambitions to do just that—its coverage of aiding or abetting explicitly covers “paying for or reimbursing the costs of an abortion,” but it doesn’t stop there. Conservative attorneys general are suing Planned Parenthood for hundreds of millions of dollars for statements comparing the safety record of the abortion pill mifepristone to Tylenol despite the drug’s safety record. North Dakota has its own suit against Mayday Health, a group that provides information about reproductive alternatives, for advertising that people who didn’t want to be pregnant could visit the group’s website. The S.B. 8 suits won’t just show whether abortion-rights supporters have found a chink in the law’s armor. The litigation will also shape a brewing war about the censorship of abortion-related speech.

The latest fight began in 2022, when two Texas advocacy groups began looking for ways to protect their work helping people access abortion by traveling out of state. Major anti-abortion organizations and individual plaintiffs were already targeting these abortion funds under S.B. 8, and so the funds responded with a barrage of lawsuits in both state and federal court, arguing that S.B. 8 violated the First Amendment by hamstringing how the plaintiffs talked to clients and advocated for reproductive rights.

Then there is money, the lifeblood of abortion funds. The Supreme Court has protected some forms of election spending under the First Amendment, and the abortion funds argue that the same doctrine protects them too. The lawsuits raise other arguments: that the statute is so ambiguous that no one would know what they’re allowed to do, and that the law violates principles of equal protection under the law by creating a special set of procedural rules that apply only to people who use it to sue.

District courts in Chicago and Washington, D.C., dismissed the federal suits on procedural grounds, but it still seems like abortion opponents in Texas are worried about the constitutional questions. That’s why they’ve gone on the offensive. In an ironic twist, in one prominent case now before the Texas Supreme Court, they’re arguing that constitutional challenges to S.B. 8 itself undermine protected speech.

That’s the issue in Weldon v. Lilith Fund. Sadie Weldon, a private citizen, sought to depose the Lilith Fund’s deputy director using a special Texas mechanism called a 202 petition that allows people to investigate a potential claim before filing suit.

Weldon hardly came up with the idea on her own: Jonathan Mitchell, the architect of S.B. 8, had filed at least nine such petitions by the spring of 2024, including against people who traveled out of state for abortion. The Lilith Fund was ready to go, using Weldon’s petition as an opening for another constitutional challenge to S.B. 8. Mitchell then asked the court to dismiss the Lilith Fund’s countersuit, invoking what is called an anti-SLAPP law. These laws, which stand for anti–strategic lawsuit against public participation law, or SLAPP, are meant to stop frivolous lawsuits by powerful companies and individuals looking to silence their critics and suppress protected speech. Texas’ law applies to suits on speech about “matters of public concern.”

Weldon and some other anti-abortion plaintiffs lost on those claims in lower courts, which concluded that the Lilith Fund was trying to make sure that the state was not “enforcing an unconstitutional statute,” not trying to silence anyone. Now Weldon ‘s case is before the Texas Supreme Court, which heard oral argument this week.

Weldon’s case might not be a blockbuster—there’s a chance that it’s moot because she’s given up on her 202 petition—but it’s a reminder that S.B. 8 is back. The law might have killed abortion rights in Texas even before the demise of Roe, but now, it may play a surprising role in establishing that there are limits on silencing speech about abortion, even in the places where it’s a crime.

I am in the passenger seat of a stranger’s car in Minneapolis, four days after Renee Nicole Good was killed here. I’m riding with someone who was doing the same kind of work we think Good was doing when an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot her. Right now, our work is much quieter. We’re driving in loose loops when a volunteer who is patrolling the streets as a pedestrian observer on the Signal call we’re listening to—a broad network of thousands of locals relaying up-to-the-moment intel on ICE activity—reports two vehicles near Karmel Mall, known locally as “Somali Mall.” Another volunteer fulfilling the role of dispatcher, also on the call, identifies them by make and model. Another observer cross-references the license plates against a running database. They’re confirmed as ICE vehicles, unmarked like they almost always are.

My guide for the day, who I’ll call C, sits up. “They’re going to come past us right here,” they say, accelerating toward the intersection.

Within seconds we spot them: two SUVs moving faster than the flow of traffic. Through their windows, I can see silhouettes of men with heavy Kevlar high on the neck, faces covered, sunglasses.

C begins calling out every turn, street, and direction the SUVs take—while laying on their car horn hard and continuously, like an alarm. The sound is constant and blunt. It could easily be mistaken for an expression of anger, but watching how others in the area—pedestrians, other drivers—react, it’s a signal: a warning to anyone within earshot that ICE is moving through the neighborhood. It turns what ICE hoped would be a discreet operation into a public event. One pedestrian we pass hears the horn, turns, and gives the ICE vehicles the finger.

The SUVs accelerate. We follow closely, C still honking, still relaying their movements. Then they turn onto a familiar street.

“This is my street,” C says. Their posture changes. They look at me. “Can you record this?”

At the next stop sign, the vehicles split. One SUV pauses, blocking our path, allowing the other to pull away, surging into the intersection, cutting ahead of an uninvolved civilian car, using it as a moving barrier. If C had chased through, we would have been hit broadside: “They have absolutely no respect for traffic laws.” That first SUV is gone.

“They sometimes travel in pairs,” C tells me. “You can’t follow both. They’ll break and try to shake anyone observing.”

The remaining ICE vehicle, a Wagoneer, continues through the block. C keeps honking, keeps calling turns. We circle again. “They’re letting me pass my house again,” they report into Signal.

Then: “They’re stopped in front of my house.”

The first thing I noticed when I got to Minneapolis last weekend was the new language. For example: The work C was doing has a name—“commuting”—a deliberately mundane term for pursuing, tailing, and deliberately irritating ICE agents moving through the city in unmarked cars.

As C scans windshields, front seats, and license plates, they tell me about a recent incident near their home. “Three blocks from my house, an unmarked vehicle with four agents in it roll up and just grab a guy off the sidewalk who was walking,” they said. “They violently shoved him into their car.” Their voice trembles as they describe the incident, one they managed to film, hoping that footage might be useful later. “They just snatched him.”

That verb—snatched—is another example of the new language. So is “abduction.” Both are meant to describe the force, speed, and chaos with which ICE is removing people from their city. People are taken before anyone nearby understands what’s happening.

It’s a mistake to think that this transformation started after Good’s killing. The ICE raids intensified in Minneapolis in early December, and the Signal network C volunteers in has been active since then. Minneapolis had already been in an ongoing battle between ICE and the local residents for months when Good was killed.

Her death also occurred just a few blocks from where George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police in 2020, an area now dubbed George Floyd Square. The past five years taught this city what it looks like when official accounts collide with video evidence, with witness testimony, with what residents say they watched happen with their own eyes. People I met kept describing this as a reason the infrastructure exists at all: not as a guarantee of safety, but as a way to create a record.

Now, in this frozen tundra of a city, in a state best known for its enduring Midwestern niceness, residents of Minnesota are doubling down.

Since Dec. 1, growth in these networks had been steady. After Renee Good was killed, it exploded. Volunteer residents told me that up until the shooting, roughly 20 people would join every day. Now, it’s hundreds.

I came to Minneapolis to understand what it looks like when a city organizes not around a single protest or flashpoint, but around a daily pattern of federal enforcement that residents describe as their new normal. People kept telling me the same thing: The city has a new infrastructure now, mostly invisible unless you’re inside it. C offered to show me what that looks like in real time.

“When I started in early December,” C tells me, “it was not at all guaranteed to see an ICE agent during patrols.” They pause. “Now I see anywhere from one to upwards of 20 if I’m out for even an hour.”

That morning, C picked me up near the intersection where Good was shot and killed. Like George Floyd Square, the response here had been immediate and spatial. In the first days after her death, neighbors used debris to block the roads, closing the intersection in every direction. For a brief window, the intersection functioned the way so many Minneapolis corners have learned to function: part memorial, part staging ground—an assertion that something had happened here and could not simply be folded back into normal traffic patterns.

By the time I arrived on Saturday morning, the barricades were gone. Traffic had resumed. The memorial had been compressed into the parking lane of the one-way street, clustered near where Good’s SUV had crashed into a parked car. Flowers lined the curb. Candles flickered in the cold. Handwritten signs were fixed to fences and utility poles. The street felt reopened but not reset.

Nearby, a small group of friends arrived together, standing shoulder to shoulder as they took in the memorial. One of them, Kylie, told me she’s still in shock. “On our way here, we watched ICE take somebody from their home. Like 30 minutes ago. They broke her window and took her out of her house.”

That mourners could witness such actions so close to the scene of Good’s death is as useful an indication as any about how things are going in Minneapolis. By most accounts, tensions have only continued to ratchet higher. I flew home on Monday, and on Wednesday another altercation between ICE, a Venezuelan man, and two civilians attempting to prevent the agents from arresting the man resulted in ICE shooting the man they were attempting to arrest in the leg. The two civilians were reportedly “armed” with a snow shovel and a broom, and the incident is being held up as the reason Donald Trump is now floating using the Insurrection Act to enter the city. Meanwhile, Keith Ellison, the state’s attorney general, told residents to continue to report possible violations of constitutional rights and other incidents involving federal law enforcement to his office. People I spoke to described the escalation as cause to organize even harder.

That effort continues to be diffuse. The way anonymity is central to how this work functions makes it hard to know specifically who Good was collaborating with when she was killed. The volunteer network is also extremely local and largely homegrown, built by neighbors organizing block by block with the families who live next door. Their stories said a lot about how someone like Good may have gotten involved.

Nick is a local father in South Minneapolis. He’s also an admin in one of the neighborhood-level Signal networks that routes ICE sightings into local response. He told me that he got involved around Dec. 1, when ICE activity in his area started to feel constant. “That was the day that it really sort of got out of hand,” he told me. That day, he said, a neighbor was taken. Then ICE returned. Then they returned again. “When they came back for a third time, we were organized. We were out there watching, whistling. … It’s been like that ever since.”

He ended up on the helm of his particular neighborhood’s efforts largely by default. “I guess I’m very online,” he told me. “I know how to do some technical stuff. So I just kind of took over as one of the admins.” His chat has become an invaluable tool for locals who want to track and observe ICE. Volunteers cross-check license plates against a database of confirmed ICE vehicles, dispatchers track ICE activity, observers patrolling on foot or in vehicles give up-to-the-moment information of ICE whereabouts. He wanted one thing understood immediately: This is not a professional operation. “It is just ordinary people that are doing this,” he said. “This isn’t fun. It’s middle-aged parents who would rather be playing with their kids at home.”

Nick also wasn’t keen on comparing this moment to how he experienced the uprising that followed the killing of George Floyd. He said the two are different in that that was a single instance, and now they see videos of inhumane treatment and police brutality dozens of times a day in their neighborhoods.

Back in the car with C, as we drive in more slow loops, they give me a tour of the city they call home, and clearly love. But in almost in the same breath, they point out places that have become markers in this new geography of enforcement.

“That fish-and-chicken spot,” they say, gesturing, “that’s where [ICE] were initially staging.”

The Signal call runs constantly in the background. The cadence of volunteers is efficient and clipped. C describes what they look for: SUVs and pickups parked in alleys; heavily tinted windows; out-of-state plates; erratic driving; the outline of tactical vests and sunglasses. It has become reflexive, they say, to glance into nearly every vehicle.

Even while so much of the action seems like it is being done car-to-car, people kept telling me the system is bigger than patrols. Volunteers are doing everything they can to keep vulnerable residents from having to be anywhere ICE might be. This means doing things like getting anyone who is trying to avoid ICE’s scrutiny rides, child care, groceries. To understand this part of the work, people told me, I should talk to Anna, who is running one such effort called Neighbors Helping Neighbors.

Anna talked the way people do when they’ve been in crisis mode for too long: fast, specific, typing into her phone without interrupting. In her telling, the last two months didn’t introduce a new fear so much as spread it—turning what many immigrant neighbors have lived with for years into a shared civic atmosphere.

Her days now revolve around a simple system: a form for volunteers, another form for neighbors asking for help. “On average, I would say a week ago we were getting three to five a day,” she said. “Last night from 3 p.m. to this morning we’ve received 51.” The requests were spreading outward into the suburbs—“Farmington … Roseville, Inver Grove Heights, Eden Prairie”—and it’s still intensifying.

When I asked where Neighbors Helping Neighbors came from, she described it as improvised and immediate: “We just started brainstorming and I literally just created a Google form and we just shared it on social media and now it has just become a thing.” It stayed informal even as it grew. “People are like, ‘Who can I Venmo?’ ” she said. “And I’m like, ‘You can Venmo me.’ ” Someone would send her a receipt, and she’d reimburse them. “I don’t know who they are,” she said. “And I’m just Venmoing them.”

She talked about it as mutual aid built in real time, held together by trust and speed, and by a kind of local reflex that Minnesota has rehearsed in smaller ways for years—neighbors pushing each other out of snowdrifts, shoveling sidewalks, checking in. “You have to know your neighbors,” she said. “You need to know their names.”

Neighbors are showing up in droves. Organizers told me their Signal chats were maxing out. Trainings are full. Food pantries were being inundated. And even after the horror of Good’s killing, the new volunteers weren’t seasoned activists, they were regular people who finally reached a point where doing nothing felt worse than the risks of doing something.

Jordan Castillo attended his first training at a church in South Minneapolis on the same day Renee Good was killed. He arrived already unsettled. He remembers murmuring “Holy shit” when he got to the packed parking lot. Inside, he estimated there were “probably about 700 people.” He stopped when he walked in. “I was like, whoa. This is a moment. Like, this is history.”

But Good’s killing isn’t the only thing pulling people in—many volunteers are coming to this work after seeing ICE in their own neighborhoods. When I met Burt Muston in a park near his home, he pointed to the local market he described as “a neighborhood staple.” Two people were taken by ICE here. The market closed afterward. “They’ve been closed ever since.” That was the tipping point for him, he said.

Muston is a large white man, and with his beard and dark sunglasses, he could be mistaken for an ICE agent himself. He saw this as an advantage. “As, like, a big white dude … other than if they want to say I’m obstructing justice, they’re not going to really fuck with me,” he told me.

That doesn’t mean he doesn’t take the risks seriously—he referenced footage where an ICE agent told an observer, “Have you not learned your lesson when we kill that lesbian bitch?” He had already made contingency plans. “I’ve actually set up, if I do get detained or something like that, people to come grab my dog to take care of,” he said. Then he waved it off: “I’ll just cross that bridge if I come to it.”

I spoke to another volunteer, who I’ll call M, in a coffee shop at 7 a.m., just before she headed to another shift as a “commuter.” Responding to ICE-watch calls has become part of her routine—she’s been doing it before work, after getting training months ago. “I’m just getting out of bed in the morning and thinking, Maybe I should wake up earlier. Maybe I should leave the house at 6 a.m. so that I can help make sure that there are eyes on the road, eyes on the bus stop or by the schools.”

But the watching goes both ways. As I sit in the car with C after the second ICE vehicle sped off, the remaining Wagoneer idles midblock—right in front of C’s house. The message C took from it was simple: “We know where you live.” C keeps the horn down and raises a middle finger toward the windshield.

Moments later, the Wagoneer accelerates away on an icy stretch, blowing through a row of intersections with stop signs. C follows cautiously, choosing to stop instead, letting the distance span. The Wagoneer disappears. C scans mirrors, side streets, cross traffic. “I think we lost them,” they say.

“I lost it at the light,” they report to the group call. “If anyone’s further east on 31st past I-35 and can get eyes on it …” No one does.

This week, Emily Bazelon, John Dickerson, and David Plotz discuss why Trump is stepping up his attacks on Fed Chair Powell and how it could backfire, the increasingly inflammatory actions of ICE and the slim likelihood of justice for Renee Good in Minneapolis, and the Trump administration’s unsettling efforts to sow doubt about election integrity ahead of the midterms.

After federal agents killed an unarmed American citizen in broad daylight last week, high-ranking government officials rushed to defend the shooter, framed a mother’s attempt to escape an escalating confrontation as “domestic terrorism,” and blamed the victim for her own death. The killing of Renee Good is not just a failure of policing—the public response by those in power should alarm every American who believes that being frightened by armed agents and trying to drive away should not be a capital offense. Indeed, recent Supreme Court precedent illuminates why the shooting of Good by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross is not the case of self-defense that administration officials are suggesting. The totality of events—which has been the standard established by the court since 1989 and was reaffirmed just last year—suggests that it was not reasonable for Ross to shoot Good in the head as she was attempting to drive away from ICE agents trying to forcibly remove her from her car.

Last week, Ross fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, a white mother of three, while she was in her SUV, apparently attempting to leave a situation that was becoming increasingly hostile. In cellphone video of the incident, we can see two ICE agents exit a pickup truck and approach Good’s car. As one agent appears to reach through the driver’s open window and tries to open the door, Good slowly reverses, then turns towards the right and drives forward slowly, attempting to leave. At that moment, a third officer, who is standing in front of Good’s car, unholsters his gun and, while moving to the side of the vehicle, fires several shots inside, striking Good in the head. The car continues to move forward and crashes into a parked car. Good was pronounced dead shortly after.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defended the agent who shot Good, saying, “This was an act of domestic terrorism. ICE officers got stuck in the snow and were attempting to push out their vehicle when a woman attacked them.” President Donald Trump also weighed in immediately after the killing, writing on Truth Social, “The woman screaming was, obviously, a professional agitator, and the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense.” None of the videos that have emerged from the shooting show Good running over the agent or attacking agents prior to her death.

Good was a U.S. citizen, and DHS has stated she was not a target of an ICE investigation. She was shot just blocks from her home.

Another video of the incident follows what happened before the agents approached Good’s SUV. In the video, Good extends her arm from the open driver’s window and makes the “Go ahead” signal to a pickup truck that has just pulled up and stopped a few feet from her car, right before ICE agents exited the vehicle. The footage suggests that Good was not attempting to block agents with her car, as some have claimed.

A third video, taken from the cellphone of the agent who shot Good, features a smiling Good, with her car window rolled down, saying, “That’s fine, dude. I’m not mad at you.” It also shows a woman, later identified as Becca Good, Good’s wife, outside the car, filming the ICE agent. As the agent is filming the license plate of their car, Becca says, “That’s OK, we don’t change our plates every morning, just so you know. It’ll be the same plate when you come talk to us later.” A few seconds later, two agents approach the SUV, one trying to open the driver’s-side door, while yelling, “Get out of the fucking car!” Possibly frightened at what appears to be a hostile situation, Good puts the car in reverse, then drives forward. The camera suddenly points towards the sky, and we hear a thud. Three shots ring out, one immediately after the other. After that, we hear a male voice saying, “Fucking bitch.”

The government has claimed that the agent who shot Good was in fear for his life and was acting in self-defense. The videos illustrate something else: an avoidable tragedy. Again, recent Supreme Court precedent helps explain why.

In assessing whether a law enforcement agent’s use of deadly force was reasonable or excessive, the court this past summer rejected the 5th Circuit’s narrow “moment of threat” doctrine—which stated that the only thing that matters in determining whether an officer reasonably fears for their life in a use-of-force situation is the moment of the shooting itself—as inconsistent with the Fourth Amendment. The court, in Barnes v. Felix, rejected this narrow time-framing approach and repeated what it had held in Graham v. Connor: In assessing the reasonableness of an officer’s use of force, one must consider the totality of circumstances.

Many of those defending the shooting appear to be focusing on the moment just before he fired the first shot. Applying a moment-of-threat approach to this shooting would require one to freeze-frame the video at the moment the officer was standing in front of Good’s car and saw it inching forward. Under such a cramped view of the incident, one might conclude that in that moment, the officer feared for his life and therefore needed to shoot to defend himself.

In contrast, if we broaden the time frame and consider that the agent put himself in front of the vehicle, that a smiling Good had, seconds earlier, told the agent, “That’s fine, dude, I’m not mad at you” and started to move her car forward only after other agents approached her vehicle, with one reaching in through the open window, trying to open the driver’s side door, and screaming for her to get out of the “fucking car,” the claim that the agent needed to shoot Good to save his life seems less plausible. That the agent was able to stay on his two feet, move to the side of the car, and fire two shots into the open driver’s-side window as Good was turning the SUV to the right and trying to drive away further undermines the claim that he acted in self-defense to neutralize an imminent threat to his life. The videos suggest that Good was simply trying to leave what was becoming an increasingly hostile situation, not purposely trying to hit the ICE agent who had dangerously put himself in front of her car.

One question the court left open in Barnes was whether it is appropriate to consider prior conduct of law enforcement that increases the risk of an encounter with a civilian turning deadly—something many have called “officer-created jeopardy.” It seems obvious that if one is applying a totality-of-the-circumstances approach, then prior conduct of law enforcement that increases the risk that the encounter will turn deadly is just part of the totality of the circumstances and ought to be part of the inquiry.

Some have pointed out that putting oneself in front of a moving vehicle is not considered a wise police practice. Similarly, shooting into a moving vehicle is not considered a good police practice unless necessary to stop an armed or dangerous felon (neither of which accurately describes Good), because of the risk of injury to the occupant of the vehicle and nearby bystanders. Although the first shot appears to have gone through the car’s front windshield, the second and third shots seem to have been fired by the agent at Good’s head through the open driver’s-side window as she was trying to leave. The officer by that time was firing from the side of the vehicle, not shooting someone trying to run him over as has been claimed. If he simply wanted to stop the vehicle from escaping, why did he aim at the driver’s head rather than the tires of the SUV?

In discussing the shooting, Noem said, “Any loss of life is a tragedy, and I think all of us can agree that, in this situation, it was preventable,” suggesting it was Good’s own fault that she had been shot. Similarly, Vice President J.D. Vance has said that Good’s death was “a tragedy of her own making.” With these comments, Noem, Vance, and others defending the officer posit that if Good had simply followed orders and gotten out of the car, none of this would have happened.

Ironically, Good’s death was completely preventable, not because Good failed to comply with the order to exit her car but because the officer could have exercised restraint and refrained from shooting her. He had taken a video of her license plate number, so if the agency wanted to track her down, it could have done so later. When the agent fired two shots into the open driver’s-side window from the side of Good’s car, Good was not posing an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to him or any other agent. Good was not a violent felon trying to flee the scene of a crime. She was just trying to get home to her three kids in one piece.

As the Supreme Court has finally moved toward looking at the merits of President Donald Trump’s attempts to end birthright citizenship, the famous Wong Kim Ark case of 1898 has loomed particularly large.* While that precedent certainly bolsters the case for striking down Trump’s executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship, there is an often-ignored series of cases from much more recently that speak even more directly to the issues in this case. That story of 120,000 Americans stripped of their citizenship by the federal government, between 1946 and 1967, led ultimately to a unanimous Supreme Court conclusion that being born in the United States from foreign parents, documented or not, makes you American. These forgotten cases light the path to the current court decision on birthright citizenship this spring.

Just after World War II, the U.S. government started to implement the provisions of the Nationality Act of 1940 that allowed the federal government to deprive Americans—native-born and naturalized alike—of their citizenship for reasons like voting in a foreign election, joining a foreign army, remaining for six months or longer within any foreign state of which they or either of their parents have been a national, or for evading the draft. Starting in 1945 and continuing until 1967, between 1,000 and 8,000 Americans were stripped of their nationality each year. This practice only ended when the Supreme Court declared these provisions unconstitutional in the 1967 case Afroyim v. Rusk.

Of those stripped of citizenship before that ruling—totaling more than 120,000—a majority were native-born. Some of those affected challenged their loss of citizenship by appealing to the courts. Nine such cases reached the Supreme Court between 1955 and 1967. These cases were among the court’s most divisive, each spurring a fierce debate between opposing camps of justices. Most cases went 5 to 4 with majorities shifting successively on each side. One camp, which included Chief Justice Earl Warren and Justice Hugo Black, was willing to declare denationalization unconstitutional. An opposing camp, led by Justice Felix Frankfurter, supported the right of Congress and the executive to deprive some Americans of their citizenship.

On March 31, 1958, the court announced its decision regarding three denationalization cases: Trop, Nishikawa, and Perez. Dallin H. Oaks, one of Chief Justice Warren’s clerks in 1957 and 1958, recorded the climactic courtroom scene in his journal:

Justice William Douglas’ delivery and remarks were easily the most forceful of the afternoon, with Douglas stating that, ‘These are the most important constitutional pronouncements of this century.’ … The courtroom became charged with an electric air of importance from that time forward.

Two of the three defendants whose cases were considered that day—Mitsugi Nishikawa and Clemente Perez—were born in the United States to foreign parents.

Why do these long-forgotten cases matter today? Because the highly divided court was unanimous on one point: Being born in the United States meant being a native-born American, regardless of the status of one’s foreign parents. This unanimous interpretation of the citizenship clause of the 14th amendment was echoed in two subsequent cases—Gonzales in 1955 and Mendoza-Martinez in 1962—involving the deprivation of citizenship of children of immigrants.

The differing opinions delivered by the justices are instructive. So are the debates in the hearings themselves, which are all available to the public on the Supreme Court website.

Take the case of Daniel Gonzales, a child born in New Mexico in 1924 to two Mexican citizens. When he reached the age of 2, Gonzales was taken by his parents to Mexico, where he lived until 1946. That year, the now 21-year-old Gonzales returned to the United States, but not before he registered for the Mexican draft. The United States declared that Gonzales had voluntarily renounced his American citizenship by signing up for a foreign country’s draft during a time of war. To be able to do so, however, Gonzales had to be acknowledged as having been a U.S. citizen in the first place. During the hearings for this case, the following exchange played out.

Justice Frankfurter: Doesn’t the Act establish he is a citizen?

Response of Gonzales’s attorney: He did of course by showing—

Gonzales’s attorney: That he is born in the United States. …

Justice Stanley Reed: That was admitted, wasn’t it?

Gonzales’s attorney: That was not disputed at all.

The justices affirmed the principle underlying this exchange in future cases.

In the 1958 case of Perez v. Brownell, Frankfurter delivered the opinion of the court supporting expatriation by beginning with “Petitioner, a national of the United States by birth …” Frankfurter went on to recount Perez’s history. “The Petitioner was born in Texas in 1909. … At the outbreak of World War II, petitioner knew of the duty of male United States citizens to register for the draft, but he failed to do so.”

In Nishikawa v. Dulles, delivered the same day, Chief Justice Warren wrote on behalf of the majority that “Petitioner was born in Artesia, California, in 1916. By reason of that fact, he was a citizen of the United States.” Frankfurter begins his concurring opinion in Nishikawa by writing: “This case involves a native-born citizen of Japanese parentage who has been declared to have lost his citizenship by virtue of § 401(c) of the Nationality Act of 1940.” Four years later, in Martinez v. Mendoza, Justice Arthur Goldberg delivered the opinion of the court, beginning: “Mendoza-Martinez … was born in this country in 1922, and therefore acquired American citizenship by birth.”

Reaching a decision in each of these cases required the justices to first assess if the petitioners were American citizens. If they were not, the cases would be moot—with no citizenship to be stripped. They were deemed to be U.S. citizens independently of the immigration status of their parents, which the court unanimously found to be irrelevant.

This forgotten history is particularly crucial in this moment. This spring, the current court will have to decide on the interpretation of Section 1 of the 14th Amendment, which establishes that “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.” Just hours after taking the oath of office for the second time, on Jan. 20, 2025, President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14,160, declaring that children born on American soil would no longer receive automatic citizenship unless at least one parent was an American citizen or lawful permanent resident.

The long-settled understanding is that the 14th Amendment guarantees citizenship to nearly all born on American soil, regardless of their parents’ legal status (with an exception for diplomats’ children). Such an understanding was established in large part by the Supreme Court’s decision in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, which held that a child born in the United States—of Chinese parents who had their permanent domicile and residence in the United States—was entitled to American citizenship. The Trump administration is seizing upon the words “permanent domicile and residence” to argue that one can only be “subject to the jurisdiction of” the United States if at least one of his parents is a lawful permanent resident—like the parents of Wong Kim Ark—or a citizen.

In its coming decision, though, the Supreme Court cannot ignore that from 1955 to 1967, a unanimous court decided that being born in the United States made them “subject to the jurisdiction thereof.” Whether or not the Trump administration has found a loophole in Wong Kim Ark, the court decided this issue with some finality just 60 years ago. If the court were to side with the Trump administration, there is no way for it to do so without overturning its own previous unanimous precedents.

Correction, Jan. 15, 2026: This article originally misstated that the Wong Kim Ark case was in 1868.

            <h2>Meta retreats from metaverse after virtual reality check</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Imagine changing your popular brand to capitalize on an emerging tech trend that never emerged. Mark Zuckerberg did just that, and now Meta is backing away from the virtual reality business in which it invested billions.

In 2025, Meta&#39;s Reality Labs division, responsible for the company&#39;s various VR projects, posted a $4.2 billion loss in the first quarter. AI is in, the metaverse is out, and around 1,000 jobs are reportedly being shed from Reality Labs.

A decision to end the sale of Meta Quest headsets to businesses is further evidence of Meta&#39;s pivot. In an update, Meta wrote: &quot;We are stopping sales of Meta Horizon managed services and commercial SKUs of Meta Quest, effective February 20, 2026.&quot;

For existing customers, Meta Horizon services licenses will become free, and those with Meta Quest 3 and 3S headsets will be able to access the services until January 4, 2030.

The company also announced that Meta Horizon Workrooms would be discontinued, with users given until February 16 to make alternative arrangements.

Horizon Workrooms, a virtual reality conferencing system, was introduced in 2021 and failed to set the world alight. At the time, Rupert Goodwins, writing for The Register, said: &quot;It encapsulates a paucity of imagination and self-awareness that goes beyond the risible and the banal into the truly horrific.&quot;

Meta&#39;s abrupt shuttering of the service further demonstrates the change in direction amid weakened demand for headsets. Figures for 2025 showed a marked decrease in appetite for VR, with Apple&#39;s considerably pricier Vision Pro devices also struggling.

The future of Meta&#39;s virtual reality ambitions now rests largely with consumers. The immersive virtual worlds that prompted Zuckerberg to push through the rebrand feel more remote than ever. Instead, Meta is betting on AI as bulky headsets become things of the past. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/16/hyperscales_and_vendor_fund_trillion/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Software vendors and cloud providers are bearing the burden of the expected trillion-dollar increase in AI spending this year, as investment hits $2.52 trillion, according to Gartner.

The global tech analyst company predicts a 44 percent increase from last year&#39;s AI spending figure $1.76 trillion. This was revised up from a September estimate of $1.5 trillion.

We are getting to the point where we go from &#39;that was a great idea&#39; to &#39;where&#39;s my revenue?&#39;

That $2.52 trillion figure will nearly double again, to $4.7 trillion, by 2029, Gartner predicted. However, John-David Lovelock, Distinguished VP Analyst at Gartner, told The Register that cloud hyperscalers and software vendors were likely to pick up the bulk of the bill in the short term – although enterprise IT may have to pay in the long term.

Users were also likely to employ enterprise software vendors&#39; AI agents for initiatives, rather than build their own AI platforms with third-party technologies.

Lovelock said: &quot;Hyperscalers are buying billions of dollars&#39; worth of servers and trying to build the foundation for the next super cycle of intelligence. There are consumers who are happily taking on these chat clients, creating wonderfully inventive cat videos and purchasing those devices, the mobile phones, the PCs, the tablets that are all now AI-enabled.

&quot;There&#39;s the regular enterprise consumer or the enterprise buyer, whether that&#39;s the CIO or the board-appointed special group who are saying, &#39;Get me something AI&#39;.&quot;

However, enterprise users are in the &quot;trough of disillusionment&quot; with AI, as project failure rates hitting about 90 percent, he said.

&quot;We&#39;re starting to see the end of the investment line. We had a thousand flowers blooming, now it&#39;s time to prune the garden. We are getting to the point where we go from &#39;that was a great idea&#39; to &#39;where&#39;s my revenue?&#39; That&#39;s a normal part of any new technology,&quot; he said.

During the coming period, enterprise users are more likely to turn to their trusted software vendors to build AI into their solutions rather than attempt to stitch a solution together themselves with third-party software.

&quot;They&#39;re going to be looking for solutions that come from their incumbent providers, both software and services,&quot; Lovelock said.

For example, Salesforce already had Einstein, ChatGPT and Agentforce built into its software portfolio, he said.

&quot;It gives users the opportunity of a low-risk project if, in some cases, the software is coming as part of an update, they may not even be paying [extra] for it,&quot; he said.

In December last year, Salesforce&#39;s chief revenue officer Miguel Milano said he was relaxed about the CRM giant losing money on fixed-price AI agent contracts in the short term because it would be able to claw back the investment in the long term.

&quot;I have another 20 years to monetize that customer,&quot; Milano said late last year.

Lovelock said it was fair to encapsulate SaaS software vendors&#39; approach as being as happy to take short-term losses on AI investment because they would have plenty of opportunities to make the margins that their investors expect in the long term.

But he said vendors were also making a defensive play.

&quot;If you&#39;re a Salesforce, you have to have AI in order to defend your CRM revenue. This year, more than half of the money being spent on enterprise application software will be spent on applications with GenAI in them. If a vendor&#39;s product does not have GenAI, the market expectations for growth are negative. It&#39;s a collapsing market without AI,&quot; Lovelock said. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Senator Elizabeth Warren is leading calls for the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Trump Mobile for failing to ship gold phones, months after collecting deposits.

Customers were told to pay $100 deposits by August 2025, with shipping dates repeatedly pushed back from August to November, then December, and still no devices have shipped as of January.

Pre-orders for the T1 remain open, while Trump Mobile sells refurbished Apple and Samsung devices, and &quot;The 47 Plan&quot; – a mobile virtual network service costing $47.45 per month for a SIM-only telco product.

The proposed FTC probe would zero in on Trump Mobile&#39;s marketing practices, which lawmakers claim are &quot;potentially deceptive.&quot;

President Trump announced the Trump Mobile brand in June 2025, along with mockups of a T1 phone. The company attracted criticism for sharing inconsistent designs – earlier versions appeared similar to an iPhone 16 Pro, while subsequent designs more closely resembled a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, lawmakers said.

Also under the microscope of the proposed regulatory review is the company&#39;s initial &quot;Made in the USA&quot; marketing phrases.

The lawmakers&#39; letter [PDF] to the FTC states: &quot;Trump Mobile initially advertised the T1 phone as &#39;made in the USA&#39; on its website. These claims were quietly removed from the website in late June 2025, days after the phone was announced.

&quot;To claim that a product is &#39;Made in USA,&#39; marketers must meet a very specific set of FTC standards, violations of which come with civil penalties.

&quot;Experts have pointed out the impracticality of creating smartphones in the United States given the lack of appropriate manufacturing infrastructure. Since its grandiose announcement, Trump Mobile has replaced its language with vague phrases like &#39;American-Proud Design,&#39; &#39;Proudly American,&#39; and &#39;brought to life right here in the USA.&#39;&quot;

The letter notes that the FTC failed to respond to a similar request made in August about how it plans to investigate the &quot;enormous conflicts of interest&quot; associated with Trump Mobile.

Lawmakers demanded a response to their letter by February 15, saying this proposed probe would serve as a &quot;critical test of the FTC&#39;s independence,&quot; which has been increasingly called into question.

In February 2025, Trump signed an executive order giving the White House more control over regulatory agencies, including the independent ones like the FTC and SEC. Policy decisions are to be approved by the president, who also has control over the commissions&#39; budgets.

The administration framed the move as making regulators answerable to the American people, though critics described it as an authoritarian power grab.

A month later, Trump removed the FTC&#39;s Democrat commissioner, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, sparking a Supreme Court case that continues to take shape.

Per a 1935 ruling that came to be known as Humphrey&#39;s Executor, a US president does not have the right to remove executives of independent agencies like the FTC without cause.

The president removed Slaughter on grounds that she was &quot;inconsistent&quot; with his administration&#39;s priorities, which is not one of the reasons listed under the FTC Act.

The Supreme Court&#39;s decision on Slaughter vs USA is not expected for several months. The final ruling, and the validity of Humphrey&#39;s Executor, could have a significant impact on the independence of US regulators.

Given the fractious relationship between the president and the FTC, it is unclear whether the latter will uphold the lawmakers&#39; request for a probe into Trump Mobile. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/16/rondodox_botnet_hpe_oneview/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A critical HPE OneView flaw is now being exploited at scale, with Check Point tying mass, automated attacks to the RondoDox botnet.

The security outfit says it has identified &quot;large-scale exploitation&quot; of CVE-2025-37164, a maximum-severity remote code execution bug in HPE&#39;s data center management platform. Check Point has tied the activity to RondoDox, a Linux-based botnet that weaponizes publicly known vulnerabilities across routers, DVRs, web servers, and other devices, using an &quot;exploit-shotgun&quot; approach to build sprawling botnet networks for DDoS, cryptomining, and secondary payload delivery.

When HPE first disclosed the bug in mid-December, its fix was greeted with urgency because of its perfect 10 CVSS severity score and the fact that OneView controls servers, storage, and networking from a central point – essentially a high-privilege command center inside many enterprise environments.

At that stage, the big unknown was whether miscreants were moving past proof-of-concept exploitation to full-blown campaigns. Now that uncertainty is gone, tens of thousands of exploit attempts have been observed, Check Point&#39;s telemetry shows, with automated scanners targeting vulnerable systems en masse.

The firm says it observed a &quot;dramatic escalation&quot; in exploit activity on January 7, the same day the flaw was added to CISA&#39;s list of actively exploited flaws.

&quot;Between 05:45 and 09:20 UTC, we recorded more than 40,000 attack attempts exploiting CVE-2025-37164,&quot; Check Point said in a Thursday blog post. &quot;Analysis indicates that these attempts were automated, botnet-driven exploitation.

&quot;We attribute this activity to the RondoDox botnet based on a distinctive user agent string and the commands observed, including those designed to download RondoDox malware from remote hosts.&quot;

Check Point says the majority of the activity came from a single Dutch IP address already well known in threat intel circles, suggesting a particularly active operator.

It added that the attacks were global, with the United States seeing the highest volume, followed by Australia, France, Germany, and Austria, and activity concentrated mainly against government organizations, along with financial services and industrial manufacturers.

HPE has yet to respond to The Register&#39;s questions on Friday, but told us earlier this month that while it had not received reports from customers of the vulnerability being exploited, &quot;it is important that OneView users apply the patch as soon as possible.&quot;

If there&#39;s a takeaway from the latest OneView drama, it&#39;s that management platforms can no longer be left to rot on long patch cycles – because the adversaries definitely won&#39;t wait. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">US Congress has rejected plans to slash NASA&#39;s science budget, restoring most funding with one notable exception: Mars Sample Return remains cancelled.

A joint explanatory statement was released earlier this month, and lawmakers have passed the bill. The legislation, passed with 82 senators voting for it, 15 against, and three abstaining, reverses an earlier proposal that would have cut NASA&#39;s overall budget by nearly 25 percent and halved science spending – potentially shutting down many active missions.

Instead, NASA will receive only slightly less than in recent years, though inflation reduces actual spending power.

In a statement, Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) said: &quot;The bill rejects the administration&#39;s devastating proposal to cut NASA Science by 47 percent and terminate 55 operating and planned missions.&quot;

In remarks made on the Senate floor, Van Hollen said: &quot;We won&#39;t have a space program if we don&#39;t understand what&#39;s happening in space and get to the fundamentals of science in space.&quot;

However, the budget appears to be the final blow for Mars Sample Return. While the Perseverance rover is collecting samples on Mars, whether the rover&#39;s containers will ever be returned to Earth for analysis is debatable.

The budget requirement for the ambitious mission ballooned as engineers grappled with the challenges, leading then NASA Administrator Bill Nelson to call for alternatives that could return samples more quickly and cheaply.

NASA whittled down the options by the start of 2025, but it looks like another option – cancel the whole thing altogether – will be the final outcome.

The budget, should President Donald Trump sign it off, will come as a relief to the majority of the US space agency and its supporters.

In an email to The Reg, The Planetary Society said: &quot;With this budget, missions such as New Horizons beyond Pluto, VIPER (looking for water resources on the Moon), and the Apophis Explorer, set to study a hazardous asteroid that will barely miss Earth in 2029, will continue operations.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Constructing datacenters accounts for 39 percent of their total carbon dioxide emissions, almost as much as operating them, according to an environmental analysis covering the entire lifecycle of a facility.

The finding comes from a white paper published by European datacenter operator Data4, which conducted a lifecycle assessment (LCA) of one of its own facilities with the assistance of design and engineering consultants APL Data Center.

It claims the results represent a comprehensive, scientific view of the impact it is having on the environment, as LCA is a rigorous framework for evaluating the effects throughout the lifecycle, including raw material production.

Data4 estimates that over 20 years, the carbon footprint of its datacenter comes to 12.6 million kg of CO2 equivalent, or matching the carbon emissions of about 300 French people over the same period.

The facility in question is a 5 MW unit at its Marcoussis campus near Paris, which makes it a relatively modest concern in comparison with many hyperscale server farms or those being built for AI operations.

The construction phase of the datacenter accounted for 39 percent of all the emissions, but this includes the production of equipment, and all the emissions accrued by the production of the building materials used in the facility&#39;s structure, particularly the concrete and steel. The environmental impacts associated with the actual construction project itself are relatively marginal, the report states.

Some Reg readers may recall that in 2024 Microsoft reported its total carbon dioxide emissions as rising by nearly 30 percent since 2020, despite its pledge to become carbon-negative by 2030. The Windows-maker attributed this to indirect emissions (Scope 3) from the construction and provisioning of lots more datacenters to meet the burgeoning demand for cloud services and AI.

For context, Microsoft is trying to address this by exploring  use of &quot;greener&quot; concrete mixes, and even experimenting with datacenters made out of wood.

The operations phase of the datacenter&#39;s lifecycle accounts for most of the greenhouse gas emissions, as you might expect, at 48 percent. This comprises the consumption of electricity for operations: cooling systems, UPS and security systems, the report says. The remainder of the emissions is accounted for by things such as transport to the site and maintenance.

When it comes to water usage, Data4 claims that despite preconceptions, its direct water consumption is minimal, equivalent to the annual requirements of about a dozen people. Most of the water extraction connected with the datacenter&#39;s lifecycle is indirect consumption, with 57 percent through generation of electricity and another 36 percent pertaining to the extraction and transformation of materials.

Data4 says it does not employ cooling towers or adiabatic cooling systems, the latter using water evaporation to pre-cool air, which may explain this counter-intuitive finding. Water consumption is markedly higher in a facility full of hot-running high-performance servers stuffed with GPUs crunching through AI workloads.

According to the report, this Paris datacenter&#39;s water usage effectiveness (WUE) is 0.039 L/kWh (liters per kilowatt-hour), which it claims is 25 times lower than the industry average, so it is perhaps not indicative of datacenters in general.

As The Register has previously reported, facilities using evaporative cooling can get through a lot of water, but they are also relatively energy efficient. The datacenter industry contends that this may be the most sustainable solution in areas where industrial water is plentiful but energy comes at a premium.

Data4 also looked at the impact of the use of mineral and metal resources in datacenters. It found that overall, a facility requires enough of these to construct a 12 km railway. This covers copper used in all the wiring and in transformers, aluminum, and rare earth minerals found in batteries and uninterruptible power supplies.

Readers may be wondering why Data4 is bothering with all of this. The company says carrying out a comprehensive life cycle assessment puts its understanding of its environmental impact on a more scientific footing and helps to prioritize the right actions, such as reducing the amount of concrete used in construction, optimizing cooling, and recycling metals.

In light of the study&#39;s findings, Data4 claims it will be able to reduce the carbon footprint for each new megawatt of IT infrastructure it deploys by 38 percent by 2030.

&quot;We are publishing this analysis in complete transparency, not only to guide our own eco-design actions, but also to encourage the entire industry to go beyond the usual indicators,&quot; said Data4&#39;s Head of Environment & Innovation Linda Lescuyer.

&quot;A sustainable digital future is not only a statement; it must be built, piece by piece, on a scientific basis.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">﻿The wellness wild west strikes again. This time, it’s a direct attack on my shoes and feet.

This is Optimizer, a weekly newsletter sent every Friday from Verge senior reviewer Victoria Song that dissects and discusses the latest phones, smartwatches, apps, and other gizmos that swear they’re going to change your life. Optimizer arrives in our subscribers’ inboxes at 10AM ET. Opt in for Optimizer here.

Which was why, in December, I found myself in an office, propping my leg up on a chair as a tech startup CEO used an iPhone to scan my bare tootsies from multiple angles. No, I wasn’t angling to become a saucy Victorian ankle flasher for OnlyFans. I was there to get a set of insoles from Groov, a company that uses the iPhone’s Face ID camera and an AI algorithm to create and print custom shoe inserts.

I was skeptical. Groov’s pitch boils down to personalization. People buy insoles because, let’s face it, even the most comfy shoe doesn’t always fit well. It’s even worse if you’re suffering from flat feet, plantar fasciitis, or a high arch. What makes Groov interesting is you’re creating a 3D model of your foot using tech many people already own. The company then uses AI to optimize the best surface for an individual foot. It’s similar to what a podiatrist would do, but doesn’t entail creating a plaster mold of your foot or proprietary 3D scanners.

Conversely, those $20 over-the-counter Dr. Scholl’s inserts aren’t really made for you. Proper custom orthotics from a podiatrist can cost somewhere between $300 to $800, may require a prescription, and possibly won’t be covered by insurance. (American healthcare! What a treat!) iPhones are everywhere — sorry, no Android compatibility yet — and getting custom inserts from Groov doesn’t require a prescription. A pair of the company’s inserts costs $150 and is also FSA/HSA eligible. Theoretically, this is using tech to get the exact insert for your feet in a cheaper, more accessible way.

On the other hand, products like Groov fall squarely in the realm of the wellness wild west. These days, influencers peddle everything from dubious health gadgets to unapproved weight loss drugs, promising to fix everything that might ail you. Some of it is (partially) backed by science, some of it purports to improve access to known remedies, and a lot of what gets sold is snake oil. But as far as wellness tech goes, Groov seemed harmless.

When I met with Dan Cataldi, Groov’s founder and CEO, he regaled me with an impassioned speech about how shoe fit hasn’t evolved in ages. Just as society has moved away from custom-tailored clothes to fast fashion, shoes are mass produced in cookie-cutter molds even though everyone’s feet are different. Removable inserts, he says, are really the only way to make mass-produced shoes more comfortable. That’s why, when NBA players give their sneakers to fans, the first thing they do is remove their custom insoles. Cataldi proceeded to then show me a video montage of athletes, including LeBron James, doing just that.

There’s a nugget of truth here. Even so, elite athletes are a notoriously superstitious bunch who’ll do anything to get the teeniest edge. I work out a lot, but I’m no elite athlete. I’m just a gal with two wide feet and fallen arches, prone to calf strain and ill-fitting shoes. Still, I figured that trying Groov was a low-risk experiment in the world of optimization. I’d stick them in my sneakers at CES — a convention where I rack up well over 10,000 steps every day. At best, my feet would hurt less. At worst, I’d end up with a pair of insoles I could have found cheaper at a CVS.

As it turned out, last week was the culmination of a nearly two-year search for the perfect walking shoe. In Vegas, I combined Groov inserts with a new pair of AI browser-recommended New Balance 574 Core. Armed with a 15-pound backpack, I schlepped myself around putrid casinos and show floors, testing taint zappers and investigating wellness gadgets utilizing bodily fluids. No one suspected that I was also conducting my own feet-related wearable experiment.

I regret to inform you that the results were inconclusive but remind me of the most pernicious part of the wellness wild west: the placebo effect.

On a day where I racked up 18,000 steps, my feetsies still hurt. They just hurt marginally less than a similar day in October when I also racked up roughly 18,000 steps traipsing around Florence, Italy, with my old Vans and Dr. Scholl’s inserts. But did mild improvement matter if, when standing for 15 minutes between meetings, I still had to shift weight from foot to foot because dammit — having flat feet really sucks?

When I got back I tried both the default insoles versus the Groov versus the Dr. Scholl’s. I jumped around. I walked. I ran errands. I stood for fifteen minutes doing nothing in a store. Arch support was undeniably superior to the flat, supportless defaults. But was Groov’s custom personalization better than a generic insert? Yes. The arch support was more snug and the materials were higher quality. It took a few extra thousand steps for me to start feeling tired. But am I going to preach to every foot-having human that $150 custom, phone-scanned inserts will change your life forever? No.

That’s the thing. There are perfectly valid reasons to find either option superior, and I can convince myself of either. If I prioritize maximum comfort, it’s possible my mind will jump through dozens of hoops to say Groov or bust. If I value my wallet, I can convince myself $20 CVS inserts are just as good. I know because I spent 40 minutes having an existential crisis believing both things, overthinking myself into oblivion. The only conclusive result from an intense week of heavy walking is: Any insole is better than no insole, and whichever one I believe is most effective will feel best to me, regardless of whether it actually is.

This is a peak example of what I call “placebo tech” in the wellness space. The placebo effect refers to a scenario when a fake medical treatment confers actual benefits — for example, in drug trials, one patient is given a real drug and another is given a sugar pill but somehow the latter notes actual improvement. A few years ago I tested the Apollo Neuro — a wearable beeper that claims to vibrate stress away. The science in the marketing and behind the idea itself was dubious at best. However, at times I genuinely felt relief.

In this particular case, custom inserts are a real treatment to improve shoe fit and alleviate foot pain. However, if you throw in buzzwords like AI and a passionate CEO explaining how using an iPhone democratizes the customization process, you’re primed to think this is a better solution than a traditional route. If you perceive any relief, you’re also inclined to believe this form of treatment works better too. That may or may not be true if you decide to test and compare different options.

For the average person, placebo tech can look like this. You’re fed several ads from influencers you like. The marketing includes vaguely sciency or tech-sounding buzzwords, which makes it seem more trustworthy. You convince yourself to buy it, and end up having a neutral to positive experience. You start thinking, “The thing I bought works for me, therefore it’s legit.” It doesn’t matter if 1,000 reviewers later debunk it so long as 20 say it changed their lives. A hundred clinical papers can get shoved your way. Experts can pontificate about the facts until they’re blue in the face. If you believe it works, it might just actually work. And if it doesn’t cause harm, no one can definitively prove otherwise.

With Groov and many other techy wellness products, the main “harm” is the dent in your wallet. The problem is they sit right next to things that do cause harm — and it’s very hard to make a wise judgment call as to which is which.

I’d love to say debunking wellness snake oil only takes common sense and media literacy. But the truth is I often have to experiment firsthand to suss out what’s real, what’s fake, and what’s a placebo. Part of my mission with Optimizer in 2026 is to illustrate how I navigate the wellness wild west, and hope that it encourages you to engage more critically the next time TikTok QVC peddles a miracle cure for whatever it is that’s bugging you.

In the meantime, I have a sneaking suspicion my hunt for the perfect walking shoe (or insole) will never truly be over.

On The Vergecast: Google and Apple made an AI deal, the metaverse is dying, and what’s happening on Grok.

We know how the next-generation Siri is supposed to work. Apple showed it off in 2024, made commercials about it, and generally promised that AI would change the way we used our gadgets forever. And then, well, none of that came to pass. So Apple made a deal: It tapped Google’s Gemini technology to help it turn Siri into the assistant we were promised. This deal’s a big one, and it could change the landscape of the AI race going forward.

On this episode of The Vergecast, David and Nilay talk about the news that publishers are suing Google en masse on the heels of its adtech antitrust trial, including The Verge’s parent company, Vox Media. Then they talk through what we know about the Siri-Gemini deal, and why some of the details we don’t yet know will end up being hugely important. Either way, though, this all raises the question of whether Apple lost the AI wars in a way it will come to regret, or it simply realized the battle wasn’t worth fighting. There’s a Cook Doctrine lesson in here somewhere.

After that, the hosts turn to some other big news in tech. First, there’s the horror show that is Grok and X, in which everyone is to blame and no one seems willing to do anything about it. After that, we discuss Meta’s latest layoffs in the Reality Labs division and why it feels like this might be the end of the metaverse. For nearly a decade, Mark Zuckerberg and his team made every effort to corner the market on what Meta was convinced was the next big thing. Then they lost interest. And now it might be over.

Finally, in the lightning round, it’s time for another round of Brendan Carr is a Dummy, the latest on the Paramount / Warner / Netflix battle, the Trump Phone, and the new Digg.

            <div id="article-text">Researchers say the issue can allow attackers to listen to the mics on wireless audio devices, or track their location.

Researchers say the issue can allow attackers to listen to the mics on wireless audio devices, or track their location.

Several Bluetooth audio devices from companies like Sony, Anker, and Nothing are susceptible to a new flaw that can allow attackers to listen in on conversations or track devices that use Google’s Find Hub network, as reported by Wired.

Researchers from KU Leuven University’s Computer Security and Industrial Cryptography group in Belgium discovered several vulnerabilities in Google’s Fast Pair protocol that can allow a hacker within Bluetooth range to secretly pair with some headphones, earbuds, and speakers. The attacks, which the researchers have collectively dubbed WhisperPair, can even be used on iPhone users with affected Bluetooth devices despite Fast Pair being a Google-specific feature.

Fast Pair streamlines Bluetooth pairing and lets wireless audio accessories connect to Android or Chrome OS devices by simply tapping them together. But the researchers found that many devices don’t implement Fast Pair correctly, including a Google specification that says Fast Pair devices shouldn’t be able to connect to a new device while already paired to another.

The researchers tested their WhisperPair attacks on over two dozen Bluetooth devices and were successful in hacking 17 of them. They were able to play their own audio through the compromised headphones and speakers at any volume, intercept phone calls, and even eavesdrop on conversations using the devices’ microphones.

A more serious issue was found to affect five Sony products and Google’s Pixel Buds Pro 2. If the devices weren’t previously connected to an Android device and linked to a Google account (which isn’t required when using them with iPhones), WhisperPair could be used to pair and link them to a hacker’s Google account that would be recognized as the device’s owner. That would allow a hacker to use Google’s Find Hub network to track the user’s location and movements through their headphones, assuming smartphone notifications warning that a device was tracking them were dismissed as errors.

A list of the affected devices from 10 different companies can be found here, which includes the Sony WH-1000XM6, WH-1000XM5, and WH-1000XM4 headphones, and the Nothing Ear (a), OnePlus Nord Buds 3 Pro, and Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC earbuds.

The researchers reported their findings to Google in August 2025. The company then recommended fixes to its “accessory OEM partners” in September and updated its certification requirements to mitigate similar issues going forward. “We worked with these researchers to fix these vulnerabilities, and we have not seen evidence of any exploitation outside of this report’s lab setting,” Google spokesperson Ed Fernandez says in a written statement to The Verge.

The recommended fixes resolve all the Fast Pair issues once a software update has been installed, but Google implemented an additional Find Hub network update to prevent WhisperPair from being used to track certain Bluetooth devices that haven’t been patched. The researchers told Wired it only took them a few hours to bypass that patch and continue their tracking. According to Fernandez, the researchers used “old/not updated accessory OEM firmware in order to execute their workaround,” and Google is “looking into the bypass for this additional fix,” which was only submitted earlier this week.

The Fast Pair feature can’t be disabled, so the only way to protect against WhisperPair attacks is for users to install firmware updates released by manufacturers that resolve the vulnerabilities. The Verge reached out to all the manufacturers with affected hardware to confirm the progress of fixes. Spenser Blank, the head of marketing & communications for OnePlus North America, told The Verge in a written statement that the company “takes all security reports seriously” and that it’s “currently investigating this matter and will take appropriate action to protect our users’ security and privacy.”

We will update this story as other companies respond.

            <h2>‘Sideshow’ concerns and billionaire dreams: What I learned from Elon Musk’s lawsuit against OpenAI</h2>
            <p><strong>The Verge | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/column/863319/highlights-musk-v-altman-openai">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is an excerpt of Sources by Alex Heath, a newsletter about AI and the tech industry, syndicated just for The Verge subscribers once a week.

Elon Musk first sued OpenAI in February 2024. Despite OpenAI’s repeated attempts to throw it out, the case is now headed to a jury trial on April 27th in Northern California federal court.

Musk’s main allegation is that OpenAI and its leaders abandoned the company’s original nonprofit mission that he funded. In turn, OpenAI has treated Musk’s claims as sour grapes. U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers recently decided that the case warranted going to trial, saying in court that “part of this is about whether a jury believes the people who will testify and whether they are credible.”

Last week, thousands of pages of evidence from the case were unsealed, including partial 2025 depositions of most of the key players involved, including Sam Altman, Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, Mira Murati, and Satya Nadella, along with ex-board members Helen Toner and Tasha McCauley — both of whom played key roles in the 2023 firing of Altman.

Bits and pieces of this evidence have started trickling out in recent days, such as the news that Sutskever owned a whopping $4 billion in vested OpenAI shares when Altman was briefly fired two years ago. Altogether, the unsealed evidence offers a fascinating look not only at OpenAI’s early days but also at the circumstances surrounding Altman’s firing and Microsoft’s complex relationship with OpenAI.

I’ve been covering OpenAI in depth for a while, and I closely reported on the whirlwind few days when Altman was fired and then rehired in late 2023. It’s through that lens that I’ve pulled out the below highlights from the evidence in Musk v. Altman:

In 2022, OpenAI’s leaders seemed quite concerned about the prominence of open-source lab Stability AI, and Sutskever voiced his worry over text with Murati and others:

Sutskever: My trepidation around open source is that we’re treating it as a side show, eg def not going far enough to really hurt stability

Murati: We’re missing the opportunity to set standards with this massive growing group of devs, people are hungry to build things and we should lean in and bring our tech to as many people as possible, long term maximize our chance of maintaining lead, reducing competition

But if we do everything to get this in a couple of weeks at any cost out bc we heard stability is open sourcing similar model, that’s not in line at all with my motivations

They were also already considering prohibiting investors from backing competing labs. From an October 2022 exchange:

Sutskever: I guess I just felt betrayed by him founding a direct competitor while simultaneously telling me that “I could not possibly imagine you’d find it objectionable”

Altman: here’s how id summarize my thoughts on this:

pros: he supported us in a moment where no one else would and it was pretty existential--i think openai would have been pretty fucked if he hasn’t stepped up then. also, he was instrumental to getting the first MSFT deal done, and has generally been quite helpful with MSFT related stuff he is generally a good board member.

cons: he is very motivated by `collecting’ status. although i personally think he cares much more about openai than inflection, he was blinded enough by the startup of being able to call himself the cofounder of a company he made an uncareful decision.

also, at this point, i think at this point openai has the leverage to ask for a soft promise for new investors not to invest in competitors, but only a select few companies ever get to do that)

Brockman: oh also an aside, after taking to @Sam Altman, I’m planning to meet Patrick Collison tmrw and demo dv3. Will ask if he’d be interested in participating in the tender under the condition of not investing in AGI/big model competitors

Q: Why did you write “Financially, what will take me to 1 billion?”

A: I think if we were going to do a for-profit entity, that I started to think about what would be motivating financial reward in that case as a secondary consideration.

A: Primary consideration was would we be able to pursue and achieve the mission.

Q: How important was the secondary consideration to you?

A: The second consideration definitely mattered.

Q: At this point, did you aspire to be a billionaire?

A: My primary motivation was to the mission.

Q: Was your secondary motivation to be a billionaire?

A: I believe that as a -- one thing I was definitely motivated by was the idea — I definitely had as a motivation that, yeah, potentially getting to $1 billion.

Q: So we know you achieved that goal at some point. Do you know precisely what day that happened?

A: I do not know what day precisely that happened.

Q: When was the first day you realized you had surpassed that goal?

A: I do not know what day I would say my, at least on paper, net worth would’ve exceeded 1 billion.

Q: Did you feel that your progress was moving more slowly than you had liked?

A: I mean, always as a CEO of a company, I feel my job is to sort of be dissatisfied with the rate of progress at all times. And so “yes” would be the answer, which is both in the absolute sense, which is, can we build products that are more capable in any particular domain, and also, you know, vis-à-vis competition.

There were others achieving things that we looked at and said, “Hey, that’s great, and so how can we make sure we are competitive with it.”

According to an exhibit filed in the case, it was co-written with Marco Iansiti and was in development in 2023. From the first chapter:

On Wednesday, August 24, 2022, with the Pacific Northwest summer showing all of its beauty, Bill Gates hosted a dinner at his home on Lake Washington, just a few miles from the Microsoft campus. No longer a Microsoft board member or even Microsoft’s largest shareholder, Bill remained the iconic co-founder and trusted advisor of the company’s senior technical leaders. Satya suggested the gathering, which included Chief Technology Officer, Kevin Scott, and a handful of top researchers. Food and drinks would be served, but the main entrée was a hush- hush demo by OpenAl founder Sam Altman of a forthcoming release of ChatGPT powered by GPT-4, an AI built on Large Language Models (LLMs). Bill had long encouraged researchers to develop a truly accomplished AI assistant but had voiced his skepticism about this particular approach.

Musk was opposed to working with Jeff Bezos and wrote the following in an early email to Altman: “I think Jeff is a bit of a tool and Satya is not, so I slightly prefer Microsoft, but I hate their marketing dept.” Altman responded that Amazon had “started really dicking us around.”

In November 2018, after dinner with Altman, Scott told Nadella that OpenAI’s new corporate structure offered both “a commercial vehicle for monetizing Open AI IP” and investment returns “capped at $500B.” Altman claimed the nonprofit would eventually benefit because — though OpenAI had yet to make a single dollar in returns — “[i]f [OpenAI] ever [does] get to $500B in returns, the balance over that goes directly to the 501(c)3.”

Microsoft’s board initially approved a capital investment of $2 billion. But ultimately, it decided to limit its initial investment to $1 billion in the hopes that a smaller investment would “press OpenAI to commercialize,” in direct contravention of the nonprofit’s stated founding principles. In exchange for its investment, Microsoft received a convertible limited partnership interest and rights to OpenAI’s profits, with returns “capped” at 2000% of its $1 billion investment.

Microsoft’s CFO noted in an internal email that the “cap is actually larger than 90% of public companies,” and the limit on Microsoft’s profits is not “terribly constraining nor terribly altruistic.” It was, in fact, “a good investment.” At Microsoft’s request, OpenAI agreed to keep any mention of Microsoft’s promised 2000% return on its investment out of its public announcement.

In March 2021, Microsoft quietly invested another $2 billion in OpenAI. Neither OpenAI nor Microsoft publicly announced the investment, which was subject to a lower 6x return multiple.

In place of its 2019 license to a single OpenAI model, Microsoft secured rights to commercialize any OpenAI model developed during the term of the agreement (except AGI). Facilitating its commercial use of OpenAI’s IP, Microsoft was permitted to embed up to ten of its employees on-site at OpenAI.

Anticipating increased product commercialization, Microsoft and OpenAI agreed to share any resulting revenue.

Just three months later, in June 2021, Microsoft released GitHub CoPilot — its first product incorporating OpenAI’s technology.

Prodding OpenAI to accelerate its own product development, Microsoft told Altman that OpenAI needed to generate $100 million in revenues to secure the next $10 billion commitment from Microsoft. To meet that goal, OpenAI expanded the team responsible for taking products to market and tried to expand its “enterprise business.”

In the summer of 2022, OpenAI began negotiating with Microsoft a new $10 billion investment. That November, OpenAI released ChatGPT. It was an instant hit. Nadella urged Altman to release a paid version and persistently checked on the progress of its commercialization.

Over the next several months, OpenAI secured Microsoft’s $10 billion investment, and the parties again amended the JDCA. OpenAI also changed its corporate structure.

The 2023 agreement “cap[ped]” Microsoft’s return on this investment at 600%, or $60 billion to start, but increased Microsoft’s profit “cap” by 20% per year. Microsoft would receive 49% of OpenAI’s profits, while the OpenAI nonprofit entity would recover just 2% of OpenAI’s profits — at least until all outside investors were paid out their investment returns, valued in total at $261 billion.

Underscoring the profit-focused aim of the partnership, the 2023 JDCA was specifically structured to “remove the impediments in commercialization.”

Microsoft negotiated expanded IP rights to include all OpenAI IP developed before or during the term of the agreement (excluding AGI), and the right to embed up to 20 employees at OpenAI.

Finally, Microsoft and OpenAI established an 80%-20% revenue share.

Altman apparently wanted board members with more “commercial” experience. From Toner’s deposition, in reference to internal discussions about expanding the board before it fired Altman in late 2023:

Q: Was it your impression that Mr. Altman was dragging his feet in these discussions?

A: Yes. I think that’s a fair description.

Q: Did Mr. Altman’s actions result in the board being deadlocked over any proposal to add an additional AI safety board member?

A: I’d say he contributed to us significantly being deadlocked, yes.

Q: Did Mr. Altman propose different candidates to the board?

Q: Were Mr. Altman’s alternative candidates also AI safety experts or did they have different backgrounds?

A: To the best of my recollection, he generally proposed candidates with more of a commercial startup background.

Adam runs a company called Quora, which has a product called Poe, which uses large language models, including those of OpenAI and some of its competitors.

The way I perceived it was after GPT-4 was demoed to the board in summer 2022, Adam began taking his responsibilities as a board member more seriously, because the technology seemed to be advancing, and he became a more engaged board member.

In the lead-up to — between that time in summer 2022 and April 2023, we had had several conversations as a board about what kinds of conflict of interest were acceptable or unacceptable on the board, because many potential board members, and current board members, had various involvements with various AI companies.

So we had fairly detailed discussions about what was an unacceptable conflict of interest and had decided that being closely involved with a company that was training its own large language models, you know, highly advanced frontier language models that would compete with OpenAI’s, was the bar for excessive conflict of interest.

So it was surprising to me when Sam emailed the board in April 2023 saying that Adam’s conflict of interest had grown too large and seemed like he needed to step off the board, and did we agree. Because Adam’s company produced a product that used others’ LLMs, they didn’t — they weren’t training their own. So clearly it didn’t meet the conflict of interest criteria we had all discussed.

When I said as much via email, Greg Brockman chimed in with a different reason to remove Adam, namely that his position as both a customer and a board member was creating communication difficulties internally. I forget who exactly said what on the email chain, but other board members raised questions about that or wanted to know more about that.

Ultimately, I spoke to Sam on the phone, and we sort of — at my urging, we agreed that, surely, the step before just removing Adam from the board, if the problem was how he was communicating inside the company, surely, the next step would be to discuss that with him and see if we can improve the situation. Sam said he would do that, he would have a conversation with Adam, to try and improve how he was communicating inside the company. And then the situation seemed to go away.

I later found out that Sam had never had that conversation with Adam, or that he had talked with him but had never actually tried to solve that problem, but, instead, had just said the only thing that he, Sam, didn’t like about Adam’s product Poe was that it used Anthropic models, because Anthropic was a competitor.

So, all in all, the situation seemed to me like there wasn’t actually a clear, concrete reason to ask Adam to move off the board, but that Sam and Greg were sort of searching for an excuse because he had been providing more active governance of the company.

Adam D’Angelo was at a dinner with some other founders, investors, startup people, who were asking him about the structure of the startup fund and potential conflicts of interest between the startup fund and OpenAI’s investors more generally.

And after that conversation, Adam emailed the board, including Sam, perhaps a couple of other OpenAI executives, to understand the structure better.

And in the resulting back-and-forth, we learned that Sam was the, as I understand it, the owner of the fund. So the initial conversation was around whether it was fair for OpenAI’s investors that OpenAI was sort of contributing to this other fund and was also contributing sort of engineering expertise and time to portfolio companies in the startup fund in ways that may not — where the benefit may not accrue back to OpenAI investors.

After we learned that Sam had a financial stake in the fund, we also had concerns about the fact that he had not disclosed that, given that his position on the board was one of a supposedly independent board director, meaning one with no financial interest in OpenAI.

Sam also suggested that he wanted to make a large, I believe, several-hundred-thousand-dollar campaign contribution to Will, while still expecting him to come back onto the board.

He did not go ahead with this donation because Tasha, Adam, and I all said it seemed very inappropriate. But to me, the fact that he was considering that, the fact that he might have discussed it with Will in advance, the fact it was an option, was just a sign of total disregard for the board’s independence or ability to provide meaningful oversight of the company and the CEO.

Q: And that several-hundred-thousand-dollar campaign contribution, was it — did Mr. Altman discuss that that was going to come from him personally?

I had more context on Bret Taylor than I did on Larry [Summers], and I had concerns about his ability to be — yeah, to make disinterested decisions in a way that was, wasn’t partial to Sam. I mean, you know, we had — he had been proposed by Sam for the board previously when we were there and when we were going through the process of expanding the board. And by the best of my recollection, you know, Sam had — had made recommendations on a number of different people. He was favorable to Bret Taylor.

If I recall correctly, Adam had — I think I recall correctly that Adam had interviewed Bret in the process of considering other candidates, and that one of the — prior to all of this — sorry — like, in the process that we were running over this — you know, in the months prior, when we were trying to expand the board; and at that time, that — one of the takeaways from that conversation was that — I think — I’m going to try to recall this exactly as possible, but it was I think Bret may have expressed concern that — concern around the — the conflicts. I think that he had said he had known Sam for a very long time and had a lot of connections to Sam and whatnot.

Q: Was one of those incidents Mr. Altman’s foot-dragging over adding an AI safety expert to the board?

A: That — that was — you know, I think the fact that that process was unable to result in adding independent members and an AI safety member to the board, it exacerbated our concerns, yes.

Q: And was another one of those incidents that — Mr. Altman’s representation that the three enhancements to GPT-4 had all been approved by the safety board?

Q: Was another one of those incidents Mr. Altman’s failure to disclose that a GPT-4 test was released in India without joint safety board review?

Q: Was another incident Mr. Altman’s failure to inform the board prior to ChatGPT’s release?

Q: And was another incident Mr. Altman’s misrepresentation about you allegedly saying Ms. Toner should obviously leave the board?

Q: And was another incident Mr. Altman’s misrepresentation that the legal department told him GPT-4 Turbo did not need safety board review?

A: Yes, that — that we saw screenshots to that effect.

A text exchange between Altman, Nadella, and OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap revealed the stake. As Microsoft was in discussions to hire Altman and most of the OpenAI team, Lightcap wrote that paying employees for their equity would cost $25 billion or $29 billion, depending on whether Sutskever’s vested shares were included. While it’s impossible to know for sure without more evidence, the exchange suggests that Sutskever was OpenAI’s largest individual shareholder at the time. It’s unclear if he has sold any shares since.

Q: And why did you withdraw your support for Sam Altman being fired?

A: Because I thought that OpenAI would be destroyed.

Altman: i remember seeing you in a tv interview a long time ago (maybe 60 minutes? where you being attacked by some guys, and you said they were heroes of yours and it was really tough.

well, you’re my hero and that’s what it feels like when you attack openai. totally get we have some screwed some stuff up, but we have worked incredibly hard to do the right thing, and i think we have ensured that neither google nor anyone else is on a path to have unilateral control over AGI, which i believe we both think is critical.

i am tremendously thankful for everything you’ve done to help —i dont think openai would have happened without you-and it really fucking hurts when you publicly attack openai

Musk: I hear you and it is certainly not my intention to be hurtful, for which I apologize, but the fate of civilization is at stake.

Altman: i agree with that, and i would really love to hear the things you think we should be doing differently/better.

it’s also not clear to me how the attacks on twitter help the fate of civilization, but that’s less important to me that getting to the right substance.

also, i checked with our team on recruiting from tesla. we really are doing very little relative to the size of the company, but i will make sure we don’t hurt tesla, i obviously think it’s a super important company.

Altman is personally the largest investor in Helion, which is building fusion power technology. From his deposition:

Q: While you were at Y Combinator, did you personally invest in any of the companies that Y Combinator sponsored?

A: I couldn’t give you a list off the top of my head.

Q: Have any of those companies done business with OpenAI?

A: Our conflicts committee keeps track of all this and could tell you. I couldn’t do a list off the top of my head that would be exhaustive. Reddit is one. OpenAI has not yet done business with Helion but intends to if the technology works.

Q: And do you personally agree that the company is worth at least 500 billion currently?

A: That was the willing buyer-willing seller market price, so I won’t argue with it.

Q: Apart from your faith in the willing buyers and willing sellers, do you agree, being the one who runs the company, that the company is worth at least $500 billion today?

A: If I were an outside market investor, I would — I think I would absolutely love to buy OpenAI shares at a 300-billion-dollar valuation, somewhat higher. At 500, I would start to say, “Could be, like, you know, things need to go right, but could be.”

“No, I was not surprised, because I was used to the board not being very informed about things.”

- Toner responding to a question during her deposition about whether she was surprised by the original release of ChatGPT.

“I think there’s a real possibility that five or 10 years from now, people look back and think of the main role OpenAI played during the late 2010s/early 2020s as being the org that set off great excitement about and investment in AGI (and then lost its lead to other orgs).”

- Toner in a message relayed by Brockman to other OpenAI leaders.

“Because of this pattern of lying… as was being reported to me, people in the company were copying that behavior, and there was kind of a culture of lying and a culture of, you know, yeah, deceit. And I think for us, as a board… this was just extremely concerning.”

“I thought it would be one of the coolest things that humanity could ever build. I was a sci-fi nerd. I read a lot of books. I watched a lot of sci-fi TV and movies. And, you know, I thought it would be one of the most helpful things to help humanity prosper.”

- Altman, during his deposition, on why he wanted to join OpenAI.

“I mean, he played a lot of video games.”

- Altman’s response to questioning during his deposition about Musk’s involvement in the early days of OpenAI.

“I estimate that I spend and have spent all the way through about a quarter of my time recruiting for OpenAI.”

“I think it’s hard to find people as successful as Elon Musk.”

“It doesn’t matter who wins if everyone dies.”

- Brockman in an early exchange with OpenAI colleagues.

            <p><strong>The Verge | 2026-01-16</strong></p>

The RTX 5070 Ti will probably still be very hard to find on retail shelves.

The GPU market is turning into a mess again. Asus told Hardware Unboxed earlier this week that it was winding down production of its RTX 5070 Ti, but the PC maker is now walking back that claim and blaming “incomplete information” from its own Asus PR representatives.

“The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti and GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB have not been discontinued or designated as end-of-life (EOL),” says an Asus statement. “Asus has no plans to stop selling these models.”

That’s quite the opposite of what Asus told Hardware Unboxed, with the YouTube channel reporting that Asus “explicitly told us this model is currently facing a supply shortage and, as such, they have placed the model into end-of-life status.”

Here’s the full timeline, from Hardware Unboxed, of how this mess unfolded:

• We request RTX 5070 Ti samples from Asus (and other partners)• An Asus PR rep looks into it, comes back and says they cannot provide 5070 Tis due to supply constraints, saying their models are “end of life.”• We ask Asus to clarify whether the RTX 5070 Ti is end of life. They confirm it’s end of life.• We reach out to retailers to see whether they can purchase RTX 5070 Ti stock for their stores, to fact check Asus’ claims. They say there is no supply.• Given we have received an on the record statement from Asus and confirmed the supply constraints with retailers, we publish a video with this information.• Nvidia says all GeForce SKUs are being shipped.• Asus reaches out to clarify that Nvidia told Asus that the RTX 5070 Ti is not end of life, but that Asus are “streamlining some models.”• We publish that statement.• Asus reaches out again to provide another statement (the third statement we’ve received from Asus), now saying the 5070 Ti is not discontinued or end of life. This directly contradicts the original statement.• We immediately request RTX 5070 Ti samples now that the cards are not discontinued or end of life. We haven’t heard back yet.

A global shortage of conventional DRAM and NAND is putting the pressure on RAM and GPU prices, and we’re starting to see a lack of GPU stock or higher pricing. Asus blames fluctuations in supply for both the RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5060 Ti 16GB models due to the ongoing memory supply constraints that have affected production output. “As a result, availability may appear limited in certain markets, but this should not be interpreted as a production halt or product retirement,” says Asus.

Nvidia told us yesterday that it was still producing RTX 5070 Ti GPUs and continues “to ship all GeForce SKUs and are working closely with our suppliers to maximize memory availability.” Just how many RTX 5070 Ti and 5060 Ti 16GB models will be available in the future is anyone’s guess. Perhaps they’ll be as limited in the real world as Nvidia’s own Founders Edition models, which are very rarely ever in stock.

            <div id="article-text">Fighting fires before they ever start, developers and homeowners in California are on the offense.

Down the street from the Los Angeles Angels’ stadium in Anaheim, a crowd gathers to watch two homes burn.

In less than 30 minutes, one structure is reduced to its smoldering, blackened wood frame, while the other, thanks to simple changes to its design, is remarkably unscathed. Of course, this was the point of the demonstration, which was held last June by the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety (IBHS) at a firefighting training center.

The heat from the burning demo home is fierce as we stand outside under a bright, cloudless sky. The plume of thick, black smoke is what eventually pushes me back from the front of the audience. But it’s still nothing like the worst blazes I remember growing up with in Southern California, when the sky glows a hazy orange and ash falls like snow.

Firefighters, housing developers, and insurance professionals gathered for the annual Pacific Coast Builders Conference who I talk to know what that kind of inferno feels like — or at least have to navigate the unthinkable loss left in its aftermath. It’s what brings us all here today — the hope that there are steps to take that can help a home survive. The same demonstration the previous year was enough to convince one builder to change course. “It was shocking,” says Steve Ruffner, a regional general manager and division president at KB Home. “That was when I was like, Okay, we’re in a high fire zone in Escondido. We got to see if we can do this.” KB Home, one of the most prolific homebuilders in the US, had already broken ground on Dixon Trail, a new community in Escondido, California. It was about to get a makeover to be more like the demo house built to withstand a blaze.

It’s the kind of neighborhood-scale action that’s becoming more crucial as wildfire risk rises with climate change. Wildfires are becoming too big a threat for any single homeowner, neighborhood, or even firefighting squad to just play defense. The fight is now collective and starts from the ground up, when homes are built. It continues with everyday actions that hold property owners accountable for their neighbors’ safety, too.

In many ways, Southern California is ground zero for this crusade. Here, builders, fire districts, and homeowner associations are figuring out how to keep living in an already fire-prone landscape that’s increasingly becoming a tinderbox. Preparing for disaster — as the state has done with earthquakes — is part of the ethos. When it comes to wildfires, the “big one” for greater Los Angeles arrived a year ago, when blazes destroyed more than 16,250 structures. Each time the winds pick up on a hot, dry day, that preparation is tested.

“If you just stand right here, which way is the wind blowing?” asks Dave McQuead, fire chief of the Rancho Santa Fe Fire District.

It’s a hot August day, and fortunately, the breeze is cool against our faces. We’re standing on a hill in a posh gated community of Rancho Santa Fe fittingly named Cielo, the Spanish word for sky or heaven.

But what some might otherwise appreciate as an ocean view with a breeze, McQuead sees through a more scrutinizing lens.

We’re looking down at a valley where the hills dip and slope into flatlands just before the ocean. The topography becomes a natural tunnel for coastal gales. If there happened to be a vehicle on fire below that transferred to vegetation, for example, the wind could easily blow heat and flames from that blaze straight to us. As one side of the valley burns, it would transfer heat to the other side of the slope — drying out the vegetation and priming it to also burn. It creates a convection column of gas, smoke, and ash. We’re standing on top of a natural chimney in the landscape.

Megafires start small, often with an ember. Homes that face the most risk often sit where forest or brush meets suburbia, along what’s technically called the wildland-urban interface (WUI — pronounced “woo-ee” in much more innocuous-sounding jargon). Here, a gale might easily fling embers from a forest fire into a neighborhood. An ember might land on a rosebush in a planter or drift into a home through a vent.

Once that first home starts to burn, it can make the situation more explosive for the rest of the community. There are more embers, and now direct flames threatening neighbors. Sheer radiant heat can cause nearby fire-prone materials to combust.

Those three elements combined — embers, direct flame contact, and radiant heat — are what burn communities to the ground, says Kimiko Barrett, lead research and policy analyst at the nonprofit Headwaters Economics.

Conversely, the best way to protect any single home is to harden the entire community against those threats. The goal is to limit weak points where embers might gain a foothold from which to spread into an inferno.

“What we do know about wildfire risk reduction to homes is that it has to occur at that neighborhood scale because of the nature of how homes burn down,” Barrett says. “It’s not a wildfire problem, it’s a structural ignition problem, and that requires a big shift in our paradigm and expectations of what it means to live with wildfires.”

Fire has always been a part of the ecology in some parts of the world, including much of California. Wildfires naturally clear debris, fertilize the soil, and help some seeds germinate. But in the future, living in harmony with those fires is going to take a more concerted effort.

European settlers threw the natural balance out of whack in California. They outlawed Indigenous practices of controlled burns to manage the land, wisdom that policymakers more recently started to heed by reintroducing prescribed burns. The timber industry also stomped out fires that would have been healthy for the forest and nearby communities. Years of all-out fire suppression have allowed dead vegetation to build up into loads of tinder that then fuel much larger conflagrations. Hotter, drier conditions with climate change also supercharge blazes. Human-caused climate change has extended California’s fire season and increased the number of acres burned.

At the same time, unaffordable housing in urban centers has pushed many residents farther into the wildland-urban interface, where they’re more vulnerable to fire. Nearly a third of housing across the US, more than 44 million homes, was located in WUI in 2020, according to federal data. Much of that development has taken place since the 1990s.

Avoiding high-risk areas might be one way to adapt to a warming, more fire-prone world. There’s also talk of “managed retreat,” coordinated efforts to abandon areas that are just too difficult to defend against escalating climate disasters like fires and floods. But that’s often not a feasible or fair option for people, especially when skyrocketing housing prices and rising temperatures that suck the landscape dry mean there’s nowhere safer to go.

McQuead brought me to that Cielo hilltop because the neighborhood is actually known for having survived an inferno, the Witch Creek Fire of 2007, thanks in large part to the proactive measures taken by its former fire chief, Erwin Willis. A decade earlier, the fire district became one of the first to establish new building codes to protect against fire, including residential fire sprinklers and defensible space surrounding homes.

The Witch Creek Fire forced some 21,000 residents within the fire district to evacuate. After the firestorm, the damage was one-sided. No structures were lost in Cielo or other newly-constructed communities in Rancho Santa Fe. More than 60 homes and outbuildings were destroyed by the blaze, but only in areas built before the new building code applied. It was stunning evidence that helped California adopt statewide building codes for fire-resistant construction the following year.

Back at the IBHS burn demonstration in Anaheim, I meet State Fire Marshal Daniel Berlant, who tells me about a pilot program that aims to provide financial assistance to Californians who can’t afford, or can’t physically do the tasks required, to harden a home against fire. After all, he says 90 percent of homes at risk of wildfire in California were built before the building code was updated in 2008.

“A home is significantly more likely to survive a wildfire when it has home-hardening retrofits built to today’s code paired with defensible space. But we continue to see those homes still burn as well,” Berlant says. “Hardening” is the technical term for making a home more resistant to embers, flames, and radiant heat. “And so what we continue to really gain out of our research is that it has to be done at neighborhood scale. If I do everything right, but based on density, my neighbor next to me doesn’t, we’re still both at risk.”

About 11 miles from Rancho Santa Fe, Escondido, California, has a higher risk of wildfire than 98 percent of communities in the US, according to the USDA Forest Service. Nevertheless, it’s still one of the most populous cities in San Diego County, with nearly 150,000 residents and more moving into newly built communities like Dixon Trail.

Dixon Trail is on the edge of town in Escondido, nestled at the foot of shrubby hills. When I ask Steve Ruffner why KB Home would build here despite the risk, he’s unfazed.

“You’re not going to be able to put a community like this in the middle of a city,” he says. Construction in an urban center would avoid the ‘wildland-urban interface’ — but there isn’t enough space to build rows of detached, single-family homes like we see here, and that’s what a lot of buyers want.

What he says next surprises me. By becoming the first neighborhood built in the US to meet IBHS’ home- and neighborhood-level wildfire resilience standards, what I thought would be a vulnerability in the location is now expected to be another firefighting tool. “We will be a backstop to prevent fire going to all those older homes surrounding us,” Ruffner says.

There are no real boundaries between Dixon Trail and the community next door, Eureka (which was not built by KB Home). But it’s easy to see where one ends and the next begins. The older neighborhood is noticeably greener, with manicured lawns, roses, hibiscus, and other bushes climbing up against the walls of homes.

Dixon Trail is purposefully more austere because these homes have been “hardened.” One of the clearest differences is the 5-foot moat of gravel and concrete surrounding the perimeter of each home, a buffer free of any potentially flammable plants or materials that’s called “defensible space.”

Other details are less obvious. Vents in many homes are meant to let outside air in under the floor or roof of a home; good airflow can prevent the moisture that leads to mold or rot. But that flow of air into the home can also let embers inside, potentially igniting a structure fire. With home hardening, vents are designed to block embers, covered with metal mesh to keep embers from sneaking into the house. The garage doors are all metal, with no plastic windows that might melt and let embers inside. Windows are often weak points, so those are all double-pane (instead of single-pane) with tempered glass that’s stronger and more heat-resistant.

Many of the measures are already required in newly built homes by California law, including covered vents and double-pane windows. KB Home followed even more extensive standards set by IBHS. It has since broken ground on another community in the Sacramento area similarly being built to meet IBHS standards at the home and neighborhood level. Here at Dixon Trail, what appears to be wood fencing is actually made of steel, and so are retaining walls. All the upgrades were cost neutral, according to Ruffner. Using recycled metal for fencing, for example, didn’t wind up costing more than heavy timber would have.

Nevertheless, these homes aren’t cheap. Houses in Dixon Trail start at around $1 million, which is close to the median price for the county. But in an already unaffordable housing market, the fire resilience measures are also meant to cut down on soaring insurance costs. I met Kifah Samara and his wife as they were moving into their new home in Dixon Trail in June. Samara coached a soccer team that occasionally played inside of the neighboring community of Eureka, and after spotting the construction, stopped into the Dixon Trail visitor center on a Saturday.

He’d been looking to buy a new home for four or five years already, but got an extra push this year. He says home insurance for his previous condo had jumped from roughly $750 a year to nearly $4,000 after the devastating fires nearby in the greater Los Angeles area in January 2025. Before then, his rate had typically only risen about 20 percent per year. “This year it was crazy,” he says. After moving into Dixon Trail, built to meet insurance industry-developed standards, he says he’s paying closer to $1,400 a year. “I think it was a good decision,” he tells me of the move.

The megafires that laid waste to the communities of Altadena and Pacific Palisades outside of LA weigh heavily on the minds of many of the people I met while reporting this story. “Now that we’ve seen entire cities burn down, if you’re going to start fresh, do it right,” Samara’s next-door neighbor Kevin Walton tells me. He and his wife moved in a couple weeks before we met to be closer to their daughter, who was about to give birth to their grandson. The fire-resilient measures, particularly the indoor sprinkler system, he says, were a plus. “It just gives some peace of mind.”

When I ask Len Gregory, who moved to Rancho Santa Fe about 10 years ago, what brought him here, he tells me emphatically, “The trees! The trees!”

The community’s eucalyptus trees are iconic; they’re even depicted on the Rancho Santa Fe Fire District’s emblem and a patch on Chief McQuead’s uniform. They’re not native to the region. Local lore says that a railroad company planted the trees in the early 1900s as a source of timber for the rail lines, and they’ve taken a foothold ever since. Their fragrant oil also happens to make these trees extremely flammable.

We’re surrounded by them at the Ewing Preserve, a nearly 25-acre parcel of protected land managed by Gregory’s HOA, also called Rancho Santa Fe. Before retiring, Gregory was a distributor of landscape equipment and irrigation products, which gives him a little expertise in leading the HOA’s forest health and preservation work. As much as he loves the trees, part of that work is to remove some of them — replacing the most fire-prone vegetation with less combustible, native species and thinning undergrowth.

It sounds like a hard sell, particularly when the trees are beloved to residents, including Gregory himself. But when it comes to fire mitigation, Gregory says, they’ll do whatever it takes.

“Quite frankly, we live in terror,” Gregory tells me before rattling off a history of infernos from the Witch Fire to the devastating January 2025 blazes surrounding Los Angeles. “I mean, you can’t live in Southern California — actually, anywhere in the West — without being terrified.”

A year after the fires that devastated Altadena and Pacific Palisades, many residents are still coping with the aftermath. After the public outpouring of support and solidarity from politicians, Hollywood celebrities, and philanthropists both near and far, survivors are still left reeling. Reality TV veteran Spencer Pratt, who was among those who lost their homes, announced a mayoral campaign for Los Angeles this month that’s largely fueled by his fury at officials for failing to stop the blazes.

Other people are navigating construction and insurance nightmares with far fewer resources and clout. Few homes have been rebuilt, while others are still standing but uninhabitable from the damage. And each time the region’s Santa Ana winds — which fanned the flames in January 2025 — kick up, it’s a reminder that another terrible fire could break out. It’s all the more reason for many Southern Californians to want to take action.

Here in the Ewing Preserve, much of the work is focused on removing any dead trees, and preventing beetle infestations from killing more. They want to remove any debris that can become “ladder fuel,” which could help flames climb to the tree canopy — a point at which blazes move faster and become harder to control. An even more ambitious project is underway nearby at another preserve called Arroyo along the San Dieguito River.

“Without this work, [firefighters] would be racing a speeding train,” says Jonathan Appelbaum, a biologist working with the nonprofit San Dieguito River Valley Conservancy.

With the blessing of the Rancho Santa Fe HOA that owns the land, the conservancy got a $1.5 million grant in 2024 from the California Wildlife Conservation Board to remove invasive trees — restoring the river corridor habitat into a natural firebreak. Firefighters use these breaks to try to stop an inferno from advancing; the idea is to create or rely on an existing barrier that flames can’t cross. A river and damp vegetation surrounding it is a great option, but less so if it’s choked off and overrun with more fire-prone trees that can fling embers across.

When I visit Arroyo with Applebaum, the river is little more than a trickle. It’s the dry season, but invasive trees aren’t helping. “Eucalyptus is like sticking a straw into the ground and sucking as hard as possible to drink all the water up,” he says.

Eucalyptus and palm trees are Applebaum’s biggest targets. It’s grueling work, particularly in the most dense and remote parts of the preserve, where they’ve had to resort to airlifting trees out by helicopter. Native willows, sycamores, and cottonwood trees are taking their place. Species that evolved to take advantage of the river’s hydrology here are more efficient with how they use water and manage to stay perennially hydrated, Appelbaum tells me. Their higher moisture content makes them less flammable than oil-filled eucalyptus and palms with dead fronds that light up like Roman candles. A year into the grant program, they had removed close to 80 percent of eucalyptus within the target 12-acre area.

Taking a community-wide approach to wildfire prevention is especially crucial for managing shared spaces like this preserve, which can help or hurt neighboring properties when fires approach. But the Rancho Santa Fe HOA is also being proactive when it comes to helping its residents maintain their individual properties. It has also partnered with the startup FireWatch to provide residents with aerial maps of their property that can show risks they might otherwise miss on the ground. By plane, FireWatch can actually use a multispectral camera system to map the health of trees and plants below. The cameras can read near-infrared wavelengths invisible to the naked eye. What looks like a green canopy in a regular image appears in shades of red and pink — with stressed or dying plants, perhaps infested by those pesky beetles, appearing more brown or gray.

“This is a tree in decline. I can tell that this is going to need treatment or it’s going to need to be removed,” Caitlin Kreutz, a biologist at SWCA Environmental Consultants who has worked with FireWatch and the Rancho Santa Fe HOA, says as we flip between looking at the green and pink images of a property from FireWatch’s home base at a small airport in Carlsbad. To the naked eye, she says, it’s just a green tree. But in infrared, it’s much duller in color than its neighbors. Besides, as a homeowner, you’re not going to be able to look down on your tree’s foliage to spot any subtle changes because you’re underneath it. “This just gives a whole other perspective,” Kreutz says.

In 2025, the Rancho Santa Fe HOA was officially designated as a Firewise community, which recognizes adherence to another set of nationally recognized guidance for reducing wildfire risk that was developed by the National Fire Protection Association. The designation saves residents up to 5 percent on their insurance premiums, according to the HOA.

“Communities tend to stand or fall together,” says John Bailey, a professor in the College of Forestry at Oregon State University who studies fire management. “I see a key solution being taking the information that we have [on home-hardening and] expanding it to a critical number if not all neighbors.”

If each home is also relying on their neighbors to do their part, that also means that every convert reached can have an outsize impact with the actions they take. That’s ultimately what the burn demo I attended in Anaheim was all about. After KB Home’s Steve Ruffner attended a similar IBHS demo in 2024 on a whim, his company became a sponsor of the event in 2025.

“I was here just like you last year getting sunburned and wondering what the heck this was about,” Ruffner says to the crowd gathered at the opening of the event. “I can tell you I’ve lived through a lot of red flag days just like you … and I just want to thank you for coming to watch this because it changed my life.”</div>

“I am very annoyed. I’m very disappointed. I’m seriously frustrated.”

—Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla tells attendees at a healthcare conference this week his feelings about the anti-vaccine agenda Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been implementing, Bloomberg reports.

Technically speaking, neuroscientists have been able to read your mind for decades. It’s not easy, mind you. First, you must lie motionless within a fMRI scanner, perhaps for hours, while you watch films or listen to audiobooks.

If you do elect to endure claustrophobic hours in the scanner, the software will learn to generate a bespoke reconstruction of what you were seeing or listening to, just by analyzing how blood moves through your brain.

More recently, researchers have deployed generative AI tools, like Stable Diffusion and GPT, to create far more realistic, if not entirely accurate, reconstructions of films and podcasts based on neural activity. So how close are we to genuine “mind reading?” Read the full story.

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/16/1131363/three-technologies-shape-biotech-in-2026-gene-editing-embryo-scoring/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Earlier this week, MIT Technology Review published its annual list of Ten Breakthrough Technologies. As always, it features technologies that made the news last year, and which—for better or worse—stand to make waves in the coming years. They’re the technologies you should really be paying attention to.

This year’s list includes tech that’s set to transform the energy industry, artificial intelligence, space travel—and of course biotech and health. Our breakthrough biotechnologies for 2026 involve editing a baby’s genes and, separately, resurrecting genes from ancient species. We also included a controversial technology that offers parents the chance to screen their embryos for characteristics like height and intelligence. Here’s the story behind our biotech choices.

In August 2024, KJ Muldoon was born with a rare genetic disorder that allowed toxic ammonia to build up in his blood. The disease can be fatal, and KJ was at risk of developing neurological disorders. At the time, his best bet for survival involved waiting for a liver transplant.

Then he was offered an experimental gene therapy—a personalized “base editing” treatment designed to correct the specific genetic “misspellings” responsible for his disease. It seems to have worked! Three doses later, KJ is doing well. He took his first steps in December, shortly before spending his first Christmas at home.

KJ’s story is hugely encouraging. The team behind his treatment is planning a clinical trial for infants with similar disorders caused by different genetic mutations. The team members hope to win regulatory approval on the back of a small trial—a move that could make the expensive treatment (KJ’s cost around $1 million) more accessible, potentially within a few years.

Others are getting in on the action, too. Fyodor Urnov, a gene-editing scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, assisted the team that developed KJ’s treatment. He recently cofounded Aurora Therapeutics, a startup that hopes to develop gene-editing drugs for another disorder called phenylketonuria (PKU). The goal is to obtain regulatory approval for a single drug that can then be adjusted or personalized for individuals without having to go through more clinical trials.

US regulators seem to be amenable to the idea and have described a potential approval pathway for such “bespoke, personalized therapies.” Watch this space.

It was a big year for Colossal Biosciences, the biotech company hoping to “de-extinct” animals like the woolly mammoth and the dodo. In March, the company created what it called “woolly mice”—rodents with furry coats and curly whiskers akin to those of woolly mammoths.

The company made an even more dramatic claim the following month, when it announced it had created three dire wolves. These striking snow-white animals were created by making 20 genetic changes to the DNA of gray wolves based on genetic research on ancient dire wolf bones, the company said at the time.

Whether these animals can really be called dire wolves is debatable, to say the least. But the technology behind their creation is undeniably fascinating. We’re talking about the extraction and analysis of ancient DNA, which can then be introduced into cells from other, modern-day species.

Analysis of ancient DNA can reveal all sorts of fascinating insights into human ancestors and other animals. And cloning, another genetic tool used here, has applications not only in attempts to re-create dead pets but also in wildlife conservation efforts. Read more here.

IVF involves creating embryos in a lab and, typically, “scoring” them on their likelihood of successful growth before they are transferred to a person’s uterus. So far, so uncontroversial.

Recently, embryo scoring has evolved. Labs can pinch off a couple of cells from an embryo, look at its DNA, and screen for some genetic diseases. That list of diseases is increasing. And now some companies are taking things even further, offering prospective parents the opportunity to select embryos for features like height, eye color, and even IQ.

This is controversial for lots of reasons. For a start, there are many, many factors that contribute to complex traits like IQ (a score that doesn’t capture all aspects of intelligence at any rate). We don’t have a perfect understanding of those factors, or how selecting for one trait might influence another.

Some critics warn of eugenics. And others note that whichever embryo you end up choosing, you can’t control exactly how your baby will turn out (and why should you?!). Still, that hasn’t stopped Nucleus, one of the companies offering these services, from inviting potential customers to have their “best baby.” Read more here.

In April 2025, Ronald Deibert left all electronic devices at home in Toronto and boarded a plane. When he landed in Illinois, he bought a new laptop and iPhone. He wanted to reduce the risk of having his personal devices confiscated, because he knew his work made him a prime target for surveillance. “I’m traveling under the assumption that I am being watched, right down to exactly where I am at any moment,” Deibert says.

Deibert directs the Citizen Lab, a research center he founded in 2001 to serve as “counterintelligence for civil society.” Housed at the University of Toronto, it’s one of the few institutions that investigate cyberthreats exclusively in the public interest, and in doing so, it has exposed some of the most egregious digital abuses of the past two decades.

For many years, Deibert and his colleagues have held up the US as the standard for liberal democracy. But that’s changing. Read the full story.

As thousands of companies trumpet their plans to cut carbon pollution, a small group of sustainability consultants has emerged as the go-to arbiter of corporate climate action.

The Science Based Targets initiative, or SBTi, helps businesses develop a timetable for action to shrink their climate footprint through some combination of cutting greenhouse-gas pollution and removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. After years of small-scale sustainability work, SBTi is growing rapidly, and governments are paying attention.

But while the group has earned praise for reeling the private sector into constructive conversations about climate emissions, its rising influence has also attracted scrutiny and raised questions about why a single organization is setting the standards for many of the world’s largest companies.

            <div id="article-text">Happy New Year! I know it’s a bit late to say, but it never quite feels like the year has started until the new edition of our 10 Breakthrough Technologies list comes out.

For 25 years, MIT Technology Review has put together this package, which highlights the technologies that we think are going to matter in the future. This year’s version has some stars, including gene resurrection (remember all the dire wolf hype last year?) and commercial space stations.

And of course, the world of climate and energy is represented with sodium-ion batteries, next-generation nuclear, and hyperscale AI data centers. Let’s take a look at what ended up on the list, and what it says about this moment for climate tech.

I’ve been covering sodium-ion batteries for years, but this moment feels like a breakout one for the technology.

Today, lithium-ion cells power everything from EVs, phones, and computers to huge stationary storage arrays that help support the grid. But researchers and battery companies have been racing to develop an alternative, driven by the relative scarcity of lithium and the metal’s volatile price in recent years.

Sodium-ion batteries could be that alternative. Sodium is much more abundant than lithium, and it could unlock cheaper batteries that hold a lower fire risk.

There are limitations here: Sodium-ion batteries won’t be able to pack as much energy into cells as their lithium counterparts. But it might not matter, especially for grid storage and smaller EVs.

In recent years, we’ve seen a ton of interest in sodium-based batteries, particularly from major companies in China. Now the new technology is starting to make its way into the world—CATL says it started manufacturing these batteries at scale in 2025.

Nuclear reactors are an important part of grids around the world today—massive workhorse reactors generate reliable, consistent electricity. But the countries with the oldest and most built-out fleets have struggled to add to them in recent years, since reactors are massive and cost billions. Recent high-profile projects have gone way over budget and faced serious delays.

Next-generation reactor designs could help the industry break out of the old blueprint and get more nuclear power online more quickly, and they’re starting to get closer to becoming reality.

There’s a huge variety of proposals when it comes to what’s next for nuclear. Some companies are building smaller reactors, which they say could make it easier to finance new projects, and get them done on time.

Other companies are focusing on tweaking key technical bits of reactors, using alternative fuels or coolants that help ferry heat out of the reactor core. These changes could help reactors generate electricity more efficiently and safely.

Kairos Power was the first US company to receive approval to begin construction on a next-generation reactor to produce electricity. China is emerging as a major center of nuclear development, with the country’s national nuclear company reportedly working on several next-gen reactors.

This one isn’t quite what I would call a climate technology, but I spent most of last year reporting on the climate and environmental impacts of AI, and the AI boom is deeply intertwined with climate and energy.

Data centers aren’t new, but we’re seeing a wave of larger centers being proposed and built to support the rise of AI. Some of these facilities require a gigawatt or more of power—that’s like the output of an entire conventional nuclear power plant, just for one data center.

(This feels like a good time to mention that our Breakthrough Technologies list doesn’t just highlight tech that we think will have a straightforwardly positive influence on the world. I think back to our 2023 list, which included mass-market military drones.)

There’s no denying that new, supersize data centers are an important force driving electricity demand, sparking major public pushback, and emerging as a key bit of our new global infrastructure.

The popularity of commercial nuclear reactors has surged in recent years as worries about climate change and energy independence drowned out concerns about meltdowns and radioactive waste. The problem is, building nuclear power plants is expensive and slow.

A new generation of nuclear power technology could reinvent what a reactor looks like—and how it works. Advocates hope that new tech can refresh the industry and help replace fossil fuels without emitting greenhouse gases.  Here’s what that might look like.

Next-gen nuclear is one of our 10 Breakthrough Technologies this year. If you want to learn more about why it made the list, sign up to receive The Spark, our weekly newsletter all about energy and climate change, tomorrow. You can also check out the rest of the technologies on the list here.

The hyperscale datacenter is a marvel of our age. A masterstroke of engineering across multiple disciplines. They are nothing short of a technological wonder. People hate them.

People hate them in Virginia, which leads the nation in their construction. They hate them in Nevada, where they slurp up the state’s precious water. They hate them in Michigan, and Arizona, and South Dakota. They hate them all around the world, it’s true. But they really hate them in Georgia. Read our story about why they’re provoking so much fury.

            <div id="article-text">In January 2026, London’s mayor gave a blunt warning that has reverberated far beyond City Hall: artificial intelligence could trigger “mass unemployment” in the capital’s core industries unless policymakers act now.

His words came with an unexpected counterweight: an announcement of free AI training and a dedicated task force to help workers adapt. This juxtaposition captures a tension shaping Europe’s labour landscape: fear and opportunity locked in the same story.

The anxiety isn’t limited to one city. Across the continent, debates about AI’s impact on jobs are intensifying. Visionaries and critics paint dramatically different pictures. Some technologists warn that advanced AI could substitute human labour at an unprecedented pace.

“AI will replace humans”, you heard this before.

Others argue these fears are exaggerated or misplaced if governments and employers can guide the transition. For many Europeans, the question is no longer theoretical; it is unfolding before their eyes.

At first look, the job market’s headline figures tell a reassuring story: overall unemployment across the European Union remains low, with EU unemployment at about 5.8% in 2025, down from 6.0% a year earlier. Youth unemployment has also declined in many countries, indicating that even entry-level opportunities persist for most workers.

In some sectors where AI tools are already in use, work has been reshaped rather than eliminated. A European study found that 30% of EU workers now use AI at work, especially for text tasks like writing and translation, and that digital tools have become nearly universal (90%) across workplaces.

Many workers report that AI helps them perform tasks more efficiently or take on different responsibilities. At the same time, employers are actively reassessing job roles because of AI, with about 71% of European firms reconsidering job responsibilities due to AI implementation and over a quarter reducing hiring or cutting roles as a direct result of AI deployment.

Beneath these numbers lie subtler shifts. Firms across the EU are becoming cautious about hiring, in part because of economic slowdowns and in part because AI adoption is changing how work gets done. Economic indicators suggest employment growth across the EU will slow in the coming years, with fewer vacancies and reduced labour market dynamism even as AI use spreads.

The most visible tension is at the intersection of perception and preparation. On the one hand, public statements like London’s mayors reflect a palpable fear of displacement. Sectors such as finance, legal services, and customer support, pillars of many European economies,  are widely considered vulnerable to automation and generative AI technologies.

Detailed labour data suggest that many jobs are being reshaped at the task level, even if entire job categories are not yet disappearing wholesale. For example, AI is automating routine text production and data tasks while increasingly augmenting analytical and oversight functions.

On the other hand, there are signs of adaptability. Governments and institutions are launching initiatives to reskill workers and embed AI fluency into professional development. Across Europe, digital skills gaps remain significant; only 56% of adults aged 16-74 had basic digital skills in 2023, well below the EU’s target, indicating the scale of upskilling needed.

Educational efforts range from vocational programs to industry partnerships that teach AI-related skills. For example, private training providers across the EU are expanding online programs in data science, analytics, and AI competencies, reflecting a growing recognition that skills matter as much as technology itself.

It would be a mistake to frame this moment as simply a binary between jobs lost and jobs saved. The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 predicts both creation and disruption, with employers foreseeing demand for entirely new roles even as others change or shrink.

The report finds that technologies, including AI, are expected to create millions of new jobs globally while displacing an estimated number of others, highlighting the scale of transformation.

There is also a policy dimension that can’t be overlooked. European institutions are experimenting with social safety nets and active labour market policies that aim to cushion displacement and support transitions.

Proposals like a European AI Social Compact argue for strategies that combine employment support, training, and social protections as central to economic planning.

National governments are debating everything from expanded unemployment support tied to training to tax incentives for companies that invest in human capital alongside AI. These measures acknowledge that the future of work is not simply about machines replacing people, but about how people and machines can be integrated into resilient labour ecosystems.

Yet challenges remain. Entry-level opportunities, the traditional gateway for recent graduates, are tightening in many sectors as employers increasingly use automated systems in recruitment and candidate screening.

Surveys suggest broad concern among young job seekers about prospects in an AI-transformed market, even where overall employment remains stable.

Some employers are re-imagining entry paths by embedding AI training into internship programs, while others are partnering with universities to co-design curricula that emphasize AI-augmented work. These efforts signal that adaptation is possible, but they also highlight how uneven the transition has been so far.

What Europe faces now is not a single story of mass job losses or unrestrained job growth. It is a mosaic of experiences, where headlines of risk and reports of adaptation coexist. The labour market is not static; it is reacting to technology, to policy, to fear and hope in equal measure.

If there is a throughline, it’s this: Europe’s future of work will be shaped not just by the capabilities of artificial intelligence, but by choices about education, regulation, and social support.

The decisions policymakers and employers make today will tilt the balance between disruption and opportunity. In that sense, the conversation is less about whether AI will change jobs; it already is, and more about how Europe navigates the change.

That is the reality workers, firms, and governments must confront together.

This reminds me of the well-known anecdote in Romanian political history in which Ion I.C. (Ionel) Brătianu, asked by historian and politician Nicolae Iorga what a scholar could learn from an engineer, replied with just that phrase, a call for moderation and thoughtful judgment: “Measure, sir, measure!”

Thus, measure, thoughtful regulation, and worker-focused policy will make sure AI supports people’s work, protects rights, and steers technological change toward shared opportunity, not making them unemployed.

            <h2>Belgian cybersecurity startup becomes unicorn</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/aikido-security-becomes-unicorn">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Belgian cybersecurity startup Aikido Security has closed a $60 million Series B funding round at a $1 billion valuation, marking a rare unicorn milestone for a European security company and highlighting the accelerating interest in developer-centric security platforms.

The round was led by DST Global, a tech-oriented investment firm with a track record of backing major technology companies, and included participation from PSG Equity, Notion Capital, and Singular. Founded in 2022, Aikido has reached a billion-dollar valuation in just three years, a pace few cybersecurity firms attain, and according to company sources, the fastest in Europe.

The new capital will help Aikido accelerate product development and expand further into key markets, especially the United States, where it already generates around half of its revenue. In the past year, the company’s revenue grew roughly fivefold, while its customer base nearly tripled.

Aikido’s core proposition is rooted in the conviction that traditional application security tools have not kept pace with the rapid evolution of software development. Modern engineering teams ship code more frequently, and the widespread adoption of AI tools for coding has heightened both velocity and risk. Legacy scanners and point solutions can generate noise and distract developers, rather than offering actionable insights at the right moment.

Instead of siloed products that address a single layer of the stack, Aikido provides a unified platform that spans code analysis, cloud security, and runtime monitoring, with an emphasis on automation. The platform is designed to detect risks early in the development process, prioritise issues based on real-world impact, and help engineering teams fix problems before they reach production.

CEO Willem Delbare has framed the product as “guardrails” for developers, tools that fit fluidly into existing workflows rather than creating extra hurdles.

Customers range from gaming and mobile app developers to fintech and music streaming platforms, with names like Niantic, Revolut, and SoundCloud appearing among early adopters. These use cases underscore demand for security tools that can keep pace with modern development practices, where agility and context are essential.

Aikido’s valuation and investor interest reflect broader trends in the cybersecurity landscape. Once a domain dominated by perimeter defence and signature-based detection, security has had to adapt as software infrastructure shifts to cloud services, microservices architectures, and continuous delivery. Investors are especially focused on tools that reduce friction for engineering teams and support automated, context-aware security workflows.

DST Global’s lead on the round is noteworthy given the firm’s history of backing companies that scale globally.

In a funding environment where investor scrutiny has tightened and deals are won largely on product differentiation and tangible traction, Aikido’s growth metrics have helped draw attention. A fivefold increase in revenue within a year and strong adoption metrics among engineering teams suggest a product that resonates with users, not just buyers.

Aikido’s unicorn status also illustrates how European startups in traditionally U.S.-centric sectors like cybersecurity can carve out meaningful niches. Security products have long struggled to escape the shadow of established players headquartered in Silicon Valley and Tel Aviv, but a steady wave of startups with developer-oriented tools has begun to reshape expectations.

That said, the competitive landscape remains crowded.

Vendors across cloud security, application scanning, vulnerability management, and developer tooling are all vying for engineering team attention. Some focus on narrow functions such as static analysis or open-source risk, while others bundle broader offerings. Aikido bets that a unified, integrated experience can reduce cognitive load and streamline security workflows.

In its own communications, Aikido has described evolving toward what it calls “self-securing software,” a future state where systems can automatically test, detect, and remediate vulnerabilities without extensive human intervention. This vision is reflected in recent product releases that embed automated penetration testing and contextual risk analysis directly into development pipelines.

Technical roadmaps shared by the company suggest deeper integrations with cloud platforms and enhanced automation capabilities, allowing developers to catch and fix issues as code is written and deployed. This direction aligns with broader industry shifts toward “security as code,” where security functions are embedded in the same workflows as infrastructure and application development.

Expanding partnerships with cloud providers and refining API-first integrations are likely priorities for Aikido in the near term. As engineering teams increasingly adopt secure development practices as part of their standard operating model, integrated platforms become more attractive than point solutions that require separate processes and tools.

Aikido’s rapid growth and investor backing reinforce a fundamental shift in security tooling: developers are now viewed as primary stakeholders in safeguarding software. This contrasts with earlier models where specialised security teams acted as gatekeepers. By aligning security functions with development workflows, tools like Aikido aim to reduce friction while improving risk visibility.

For investors, the deal is a signal that cybersecurity remains a fertile ground for innovation, particularly where AI and automation intersect with foundational development practices. As software becomes more complex and distributed, demand for real-time, integrated security controls will only rise.

Aikido’s unicorn milestone is less about the label and more about the validation of a model that places developers at the centre of security. If successful, this approach could influence how future security platforms are built and adopted across the industry.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For years, online shopping followed a fixed path. Search bar, product grid, filters, checkout. The interface barely changed, even as everything else on the internet did. That path is now breaking.

Monday 12 January, 2026, JD Sports Fashion plc (JD Group) became one of the first large retailers to let US customers search and buy sneakers directly inside AI chatbots, including ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini. No website visit. No app. Just a conversation that ends with a payment.

Basically, a customer can chat with an AI bot, say “add these shoes to my cart,” and complete a purchase in one click.

JD Sports has agreed a global deal with commercetools to enable “one-click” purchases on AI assistants including Copilot, Gemini and ChatGPT. US customers will simply tell the chatbot what they want and pay instantly via Stripe’s integrated payment flow.

The retailer is the first to deploy commercetools’ “Agentic Jumpstart” solution along with Stripe’s Agentic Commerce Suite (ACS). Stripe handles the payment and fraud protection, while commercetools’ AI Hub keeps JD’s product data, pricing and availability in sync across all AI channels.

For example, “Find me a pair of Nike Air Max size 10.” The AI queries JD’s catalog (via commercetools) and returns relevant products, with images and details. The shopper can then say “buy this pair,” and Stripe handles the checkout seamlessly. Commercetools and Stripe emphasize that all payment and fulfillment data still flow through JD’s systems – the retailer retains control over inventory, pricing, and customer experience.

AI-driven shopping shifts the act of buying from browsing to intent-based conversation.

Instead of scrolling through hundreds of sneakers, a customer can ask for “black running shoes under $150, good for daily training,” refine the request, compare options, and pay, all within the same chat. The AI handles discovery, filtering, and decision support in one flow.

For consumers, that means less friction and less time spent navigating interfaces designed around catalogs, not questions. For retailers, it means the loss of something they’ve relied on for two decades: control over the shopping journey.

JD Sports CEO Regis Schultz compared the impact of AI on retail to the internet boom of the late 1990s and suggested it could shrink physical store footprints by reducing the need for cash desks. The comment points to a wider rethink. If discovery and checkout move into AI layers, both digital and physical stores become less central.

Traditional e-commerce platforms are built around pages, categories, and conversion funnels. AI shopping ignores most of that. When purchases happen inside chatbots, platforms lose visibility into how customers arrive at decisions. Brand differentiation becomes harder when products are presented as answers rather than destinations. Loyalty shifts from websites to whichever AI assistant the customer trusts.

This creates a new competitive layer. Retailers are no longer just competing on price, delivery, or UX, but on how well their inventory, data, and brand translate into AI-mediated conversations. It also raises questions for marketplaces. If AI assistants can compare products across multiple retailers in real time, the advantage of being the “place people go to shop” weakens.

Letting customers buy without visiting a website introduces new risks. Retailers must ensure that payments remain secure, that inventory and pricing are accurate in real time, and that the brand experience doesn’t dissolve into a generic AI response. Stripe’s role here is critical, acting as the trust layer that makes conversational checkout viable at scale.

There’s also the issue of accountability. When something goes wrong, a failed payment, a wrong size, a delayed delivery, the customer interacts with an AI, not a store. Retailers still own the outcome, even if they no longer own the interface.

JD Sports is not alone. The move points to a broader pattern: commerce is migrating upward into AI systems that sit between consumers and brands. As mobile apps reshaped shopping in the 2010s, conversational AI is reshaping it again, this time by pushing the store itself out of the center of the experience.

What replaces it is less visible, but more powerful: intent, context, and conversation. Retail isn’t disappearing. It’s dissolving into the tools people already use to think, search, and decide.

There is something undeniably impressive about this evolution. Buying becomes faster, friction thins, decisions compress into a few lines of text. Yet, step by step, human interaction is quietly being removed from the equation. The cashier, the sales assistant, even the act of browsing alongside others, all fade into background infrastructure.

The open question isn’t whether this shift will happen, but how far it should go. When shopping becomes a dialogue with machines, convenience wins, but presence is lost. Retail now faces a new design challenge, not just how to sell through AI, but how to decide where human interaction still matters, and how to keep it from disappearing by default.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the past few years, artificial intelligence has been discussed almost exclusively in terms of models. Bigger models, faster models, smarter models. More recently, the focus shifted to agents, systems capable of planning, reasoning, and acting autonomously.

Yet the real leap in usefulness does not happen at the model level, nor at the agent level. It happens one layer above, at the level of Skills.

If models represent intelligence and agents represent coordination, Skills are where AI becomes operational and valuable in the real world.

A Skill is an applied, reusable unit of procedural knowledge that allows an AI system to reliably perform a specific task from start to finish.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

In practical terms, a Skill is an intelligent application that transforms user intent into execution.

A Skill has a clearly defined purpose. It encapsulates domain-specific know-how. It follows a repeatable procedure. And it produces a concrete, usable result.

This could mean analyzing a contract and identifying risks, comparing multiple SaaS tools based on real business constraints, generating a pricing strategy using market data, or producing a financial or operational report.

Users never interact with models or agents directly. What they experience are Skills, because Skills are the part of AI that delivers outcomes.

To understand why Skills matter, it helps to look at the modern AI stack. At the foundation are models. They provide raw intelligence such as language understanding, reasoning, perception, and pattern recognition. They are powerful, but fundamentally generic.

Above them sit agents. Agents function like an operating system. They plan tasks, break problems into steps, decide which tools or models to use, and manage execution flow. They are good coordinators, but coordination alone does not equal expertise.

At the top of the stack are Skills. Skills are the application layer. They are structured, purpose-built capabilities that agents can invoke to get real work done. Just as hardware is not software and software is not an application, intelligence is not usefulness. Models are not agents, and agents are not Skills.

A Skill is not a single instruction. It is an orchestrated process. When a user expresses a concrete need, such as wanting to know which SaaS solution best fits their company, the system identifies the relevant Skill. An agent then decomposes the task into procedural steps. Requirements are gathered, data is retrieved, evaluation logic is applied, and results are synthesized. Models perform analysis and reasoning at each step, and the Skill delivers a structured outcome such as a recommendation, report, decision, or document.

From the user’s perspective, none of this complexity is visible. The Skill simply works.

One of the most important distinctions is that Skills encode procedural knowledge rather than descriptive knowledge. Large language models are excellent at explaining what something is. Skills capture how something is actually done.

This procedural knowledge may include workflows, scripts, decision logic, rules, tool integrations, and structured reasoning steps. It is what turns general intelligence into expert behavior. Agents on their own are capable planners, but they lack deep, domain-specific execution knowledge. Skills fill that gap.

This is also why Skills scale better than custom-built agents. A common mistake today is creating a new agent for every task. That approach quickly becomes brittle and unmanageable. Skills, by contrast, are modular, reusable, and composable. A small number of general-purpose agents can call a growing library of specialized Skills, each focused on doing one thing well. This mirrors how scalable software systems are built in practice.

Another critical point is that Skills are products, not just technology. They can be packaged, licensed, distributed, integrated, and monetized. Users and businesses do not buy reasoning or intelligence in the abstract. They buy capabilities. They buy outcomes. They buy the ability to make better decisions and execute faster.

As models become increasingly commoditized and agent frameworks begin to converge, the real competitive advantage in AI is shifting. It will belong to those who build the most useful Skills and control how they are distributed.

In the long run, AI systems will not be judged by how intelligent they are, but by how effectively they convert intelligence into action.

Models think. Agents coordinate. Skills execute.

            <h2>AI is old news. Generative AI is the future.</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-10</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The term Artificial Intelligence (AI) is well known, often evoking futuristic movies like Robocop, Terminator and The Matrix. Yet what many don’t realize is that AI has been part of our lives for decades.

When you finish watching a movie on a streaming platform and instantly see recommendations for similar content, that’s AI. When you’re shopping online and an entire page of suggested products appears, that’s AI. Even the digital ads you see are powered by machine-learning algorithms designed to optimize engagement, clicks, and conversions.

Companies have relied on AI rule-based automation, routines, and machine-learning algorithms for years to power their systems and business processes.

So when you hear conversations about the “urgent need to start using AI,” pause for a moment. AI itself isn’t new, the real transformation we’re witnessing comes from Generative AI, a newer branch of deep learning, which itself is a subset of machine learning.

Artificial Intelligence broadly covers machines that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence. Machine Learning trains systems to learn from data. Deep Learning uses multi-layered neural networks to recognize complex patterns. Generative AI goes one step further. It doesn’t just analyze data or perform tasks, it creates new content: text, images, code, music, and more.

I was among the early adopters of ChatGPT, just a few months after its public launch in late 2022. It was a defining moment in the history of technology, the first time we could produce analyses, insights, and even complete outputs simply by typing natural-language prompts, without programming or complex tools.

I knew immediately that this would change the world. However, this accessibility has created a double-edged sword. Today, the digital landscape is flooded with “AI experts,” unverified tutorials, and get-rich-quick schemes that often promote the misuse of these tools.

There is a vast amount of misinformation circulating, ranging from overhyped capabilities to fundamental misunderstandings of how Large Language Models (LLMs) process truth and data.

To move beyond the noise, it’s important to seek out education from rigorous, academically backed sources rather than social media trends. The goal when using Generative AI tools shouldn’t be just to generate text, but to understand the capabilities and limitations well enough to apply it securely.

I was in university when the Internet first became commercialized. My first job, in 1996, was selling Internet access to individuals and companies. I witnessed firsthand the anxiety, resistance, and eventual transformation that followed. Yes, the Internet eliminated certain jobs, but it created far more, and often better ones.

Generative AI is bringing a similar paradigm shift today. The key is not to fear it but to learn it, to develop the literacy and critical understanding to use it responsibly. A sentiment often shared among industry leaders during my Generative AI research has stayed with me ever since: “AI will not steal your job; a human using AI will.”

That sentence should be a constant reminder for everyone: life is an ongoing evolution. Technologies disrupt, jobs disappear, and new ones emerge. So the next time you hear someone say, “We need to get into AI,” ask, “Which AI?”

Traditional AI analyzes what already exists, and chances are, you and your company are already using it. Generative AI creates what’s next. This distinction matters. If you treat Generative AI like a search engine or a calculator, you miss its true potential. If you treat it as an absolute source of truth, you risk misuse.

That is why deep literacy is essential. Understanding the specific capabilities of these tools is an act of digital responsibility. By educating ourselves, grounding our knowledge in fact, and embracing change with intention, we prepare to lead this next technological era, not be replaced by it.
