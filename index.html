            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/warner-bros-gives-paramount-one-more-week-to-beat-netflix-merger-offer/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Warner Bros. Discovery is giving Paramount one more week to make its best and final offer, leaving the door open for a deal that could upend its merger agreement with Netflix.

Officially, Warner Bros. is still committed to Netflix. The company today scheduled a special meeting date of March 20 and recommended that shareholders vote for the Netflix merger. But Warner Bros. is simultaneously opening negotiations with Paramount despite calling all of its previous offers deficient.

“Netflix has provided WBD a limited waiver under the terms of WBD’s merger agreement with Netflix, permitting WBD to engage in discussions with Paramount Skydance for a seven-day period ending on February 23, 2026 to seek clarity for WBD stockholders and provide PSKY the ability to make its best and final offer,” Warner Bros. said today.

The Netflix/Warner Bros. merger agreement gives Netflix the right to match Paramount’s offer, Warner Bros. said. Warner Bros. Discovery board Chairman Samuel Di Piazza Jr. and CEO David Zaslav asked for Paramount’s best and final offer in a letter to Paramount’s board today.

“To be clear, our Board has not determined that your proposal is reasonably likely to result in a transaction that is superior to the Netflix merger,” the letter said. But it added that Warner Bros. “welcome[s] the opportunity to engage with you and expeditiously determine whether PSKY can deliver an actionable, binding proposal that provides superior value, transaction certainty and interim protection for WBD’s businesses to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders.”

Netflix recently amended its $72 billion deal with Warner Bros., agreeing to pay all cash in an attempt to defeat Paramount’s hostile takeover bid. Netflix is set to pay $27.75 per share for an acquisition that includes HBO Max, WB Studios, and other assets. If the Netflix deal succeeds, Warner Bros. would separately spin off its cable TV division into a new entity that would be called Discovery Global.

Paramount is offering $31 per share, but it wants to buy the entire Warner Bros. Discovery company, while Netflix’s deal is for just the streaming and movie studios divisions. The Warner Bros. letter to Paramount said, “On February 11th, a senior representative of your financial advisor communicated orally to a member of our Board that PSKY would agree to pay $31 per WBD share if we engage with you, and that $31 is not PSKY’s best and final proposal.”

The letter asked Paramount to increase its offer. “We are writing to inform you that Netflix has agreed to provide WBD a waiver of certain terms of the Netflix merger agreement to permit us, through February 23, to engage with PSKY to clarify your proposal, which we understand will include a WBD per share price higher than $31,” Warner Bros. wrote.

Warner Bros. also asked Paramount to accept the same terms that Netflix agreed to. Warner Bros. said terms proposed by Paramount give Paramount the right to terminate or amend the deal, whereas “the Netflix Merger Agreement is binding on Netflix, provides WBD stockholders the opportunity to vote on a specific and binding transaction, and cannot be amended without WBD’s consent.” Warner Bros. also said Paramount’s proposed terms restrict Warner Bros.’ ability to manage its business while the transaction is pending.

Warner Bros. has also repeatedly pointed to Netflix’s superior finances as a reason for preferring its offer. The Warner Bros. board previously called the Paramount bid “illusory” because it requires an “extraordinary amount of debt financing, and described Paramount as “a $14B market cap company with a ‘junk’ credit rating, negative free cash flows, significant fixed financial obligations, and a high degree of dependency on its linear business.”

The Netflix/Warner Bros. deal is facing scrutiny over how it would affect streaming consumers. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos told a Senate committee that the Netflix and HBO Max streaming services are “complementary” and claimed that the combined company will give users more content for less money.

“We are a one-click cancel, so if the consumer says, ‘That’s too much for what I’m getting,’ they can cancel with one click,” Sarandos said.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">No one will supplant American and Chinese dominance in the space launch arena anytime soon, but several longtime US allies now see sovereign access to space as a national security imperative.

Taking advantage of private launch initiatives already underway within their own borders, several middle and regional powers have approved substantial government funding for commercial startups to help them reach the launch pad. Australia, Canada, Germany, and Spain are among the nations that currently lack the ability to independently put their own satellites into orbit but which are now spending money to establish a domestic launch industry. Others talk a big game but haven’t committed the cash to back up their ambitions.

The moves are part of a wider trend among US allies to increase defense spending amid strained relations with the Trump administration. Tariffs, trade wars, and threats to invade the territory of a NATO ally have changed the tune of many foreign leaders. In Europe, there’s even talk of fielding a nuclear deterrent independent of the nuclear umbrella provided by the US military.

Trump’s relationship with Elon Musk, the head of the world’s leading space launch company, has further soured foreign appetite for using the United States for launch services. Today, that usually means choosing to pay Musk’s SpaceX.

Commercial satellite companies will still choose the cheapest, most reliable path to space, of course. This means SpaceX will win the overwhelming majority of commercial launch contracts put up for global competition. But there’s a captive market for many satellite projects, especially those with government backing. US government satellites typically launch on US rockets, just as Chinese satellites fly on Chinese rockets.

The picture is more opaque in Europe. The European Space Agency and the European Union prefer to launch their satellites on European rockets, but that’s not always possible. ESA and the EU launched several key satellite missions on SpaceX rockets while waiting on the debut of Europe’s long-delayed Ariane 6 rocket. The Ariane 6 is now launching reliably, ending Europe’s reliance on SpaceX.

Many European nations have their own satellite projects. Historically, their preference for launching on European rockets has not been as strong as it is for pan-European programs managed by ESA and the EU. So it has never been unusual to see a British, German, Spanish, or Italian satellite launching on a foreign rocket.

This posture is starting to change. All four of these nations have invested in homegrown rockets in recent years. Germany made the biggest splash last year when the government announced $41 billion (35 billion euros) in space spending over the next five years. “Satellite networks today are an Achilles’ heel of modern societies. Whoever attacks them paralyzes entire nations,” said Boris Pistorius, Germany’s defense minister, during the announcement.

Every satellite network needs a launch pad and a rocket. In late 2024, the German federal government made more than $110 million (95 million euros) available to three German launch startups: Isar Aerospace, Rocket Factory Augsburg, and HyImpulse. All three are also backed by private funding, with Isar leading the pack with approximately $650 million (550 million euros) from investors. None have reached orbit yet. For comparison, Rocket Lab, the world’s most successful launch startup not founded by a billionaire, raised $148 million (approximately $200 million adjusted for inflation) before reaching orbit in 2018. Nearly all of it came from private sources.

In 2023, the Italian government committed more than $300 million in support of Avio, the company that already builds and operates the Vega satellite launcher. Avio is based in Italy and is using the funds to develop methane propulsion, among other things.

With help from other ESA member states, Italy is one of the countries that already has a rocket made largely of domestic or European components. The United States, Russia, China, France, Japan, the United Kingdom, India, Israel, Iran, North Korea, South Korea, and New Zealand have also successfully launched satellites using their own rockets.

The UK no longer possesses such a capability, and France’s access to space is currently tied to the Ariane rocket, a pan-European program. France, like Italy, is pouring money into domestic launch startups to buttress the Ariane program.

Let’s look at the countries not among the list of active launching states that have committed substantial public funds to join (or rejoin) the club. To the best of our ability, we list these nations in the order of how much they are currently investing in sovereign launch programs.

Germany is probably closest to bringing a new commercial rocket into service. Isar Aerospace, Europe’s most well-funded launch startup, made its first orbital launch attempt last year from a spaceport in Norway. The company’s Spectrum rocket failed moments after liftoff, but Isar is readying a second rocket for another test flight as soon as next month. Rocket Factory Augsburg and HyImpulse, Germany’s other two launch startups with significant funding, currently trail Isar in the race to orbit.

In a space safety and security strategy released last year, Germany’s defense ministry included access to space among its lines of effort. The ministry said it aims to develop “sufficient responsive launch transport capacity to ensure national and European strategic independence in all payload classes and transport scenarios.”

In addition to the German government’s $110 million commitment to Isar, RDA, and HyImpulse, Germany is the leading contributor to ESA’s European Launcher Challenge program, which is designed to funnel money into multiple European rocket startups. Germany is the only European country with two companies—Isar and RFA—participating in the challenge. ESA member states approved nearly $1.1 billion (902 million euros) for the challenge last year. Germany is providing about 40 percent of the money and directing most of it to Isar and RFA.

The government of Spain is the second-largest contributor to ESA’s European Launcher Challenge, with $200 million (169 million euros) unlocked to support PLD Space, the country’s leading launch startup. PLD Space is developing a small satellite launcher named Miura 5, which the company says will begin demonstration flights later this year. PLD Space’s most recent private fundraising round was in 2024, when the company reported raising more than $140 million (120 million euros) in total investment. ESA’s European Launcher Challenge will more than double this figure. Apart from the ESA challenge, Spain’s government provided more than $47 million (40.5 million euros) to PLD Space in 2024 through the PERTE Aerospace initiative, established to support independent Spanish access to space.

The Spanish government called access to space “one of Spain’s key areas of focus.” In a statement from November, Spain’s science ministry wrote, “PLD Space has been supported by the Spanish government from the beginning with Miura 1, the first suborbital rocket.”

“We have supported PLD Space at the national level until now,” said Diana Morant, Spain’s science minister. “We will now also do so through ESA so that our launcher, a European and Spanish brand, is part of that family of launchers planned for the future.”

The UK’s position on this list should carry an asterisk following the collapse of the Scottish launch company Orbex. More than a decade into its run, Orbex entered insolvency proceedings last week after “fundraising, merger and acquisition opportunities had all concluded unsuccessfully.” Orbex never made it far on the road to space, despite raising $175 million (£129 million) from private and public investors. Despite its failure, Orbex was by far the most well-capitalized UK launch company. Skyrora, another Scottish launch startup, has expressed interest in buying Orbex’s assets, including land for a privately developed spaceport.

Early last year, the UK government announced a direct investment of more than $27 million (£20 million) to support the development of Orbex’s small satellite launcher. That was followed in November with the UK government’s $170 million (144 million euro) contribution to ESA’s European Launcher Challenge program. UK officials likely saw Orbex’s pending collapse and left nearly 80 percent of the challenge funding unallocated. It remains to be seen how the UK will divide its remaining budget for the launcher challenge.

In November, Canada’s government announced an investment of approximately $130 million (182.6 million Canadian dollars) for sovereign launch capability. The initiative “seeks to accelerate the advancement of Canadian-designed space launch vehicles and supporting technologies,” the government said in the announcement. The goal is to develop the capability to launch Canadian payloads from Canadian soil with “light lift” rockets by 2028. More than half the funding will support a launch challenge in which the government will offer grants over three years to selected participants who must meet predetermined milestones to win prizes.

Several Canadian startups, such as Maritime Launch Services, Reaction Dynamics, and NordSpace, are working on commercial satellite launchers, but none appear close to making an orbital launch attempt. The Canadian government’s announcement last year came days after MDA Space, the largest established space company in Canada, announced its own multimillion-dollar investment in Maritime Launch Services. Eventually, Canada plans to launch a second challenge to foster the development of a larger medium-lift rocket.

There’s just one launch startup in Australia with any chance of putting a satellite into orbit anytime soon. This company, named Gilmour Space, launched its first test flight last July, but the rocket stalled moments after clearing the launch pad. Gilmour raised approximately $90 million, primarily from venture capital firms, before the first flight of its Eris rocket. The firm more than tripled this figure with a bountiful fundraising round amounting to more than $300 million last month, led by the National Reconstruction Fund Corporation, a public financing firm established by the Australian government.

The NRFC said it is investing more than $50 million (75 million Australian dollars) into Gilmour to further develop the company’s Eris rocket, scale its satellite and rocket manufacturing, and expand its spaceport in Queensland. “By building sovereign space capability that underpins our everyday life—from Earth observation and communications to national security—Gilmour’s efforts will secure Australia’s access to essential space services, strengthen the country’s advanced manufacturing base, and create highly-skilled jobs and opportunities in the region,” said David Gall, NRFC’s CEO.

The most populous nation in Latin America has tried longer than any other to cultivate an independent space launch capability. The efforts date back to the 1980s, but they have repeatedly misfired, and in one case, the results were fatal. The country’s VLS-1 rocket exploded on the ground in 2003, killing 21 Brazilian technicians working at a launch pad on the country’s northern Atlantic coast. The tragedy led the Brazilian government to eventually cancel the VLS satellite launcher and set a new course with a less powerful rocket sized for launching microsatellites.

The new rocket, named VLM, is under development by the Brazilian Space Agency and the Brazilian Air Force in partnership with Germany, but there have been few signs of tangible progress since a test-firing of a solid-fueled rocket motor in 2021. The Brazilian aerospace company working with the government on the VLM rocket filed for bankruptcy in 2022, and its future remains uncertain amid court-ordered restructuring. At that time, Brazil’s government had reportedly committed between $30 million and $40 million to the VLM rocket project.

Given that situation, Brazil’s best bet to field a new orbital-class rocket appears to be through a public-private partnership. Through a public financing agency, the Brazilian government also agreed to provide $30 million to $40 million to a domestic industrial consortium for an indigenous microlauncher known as MLBR, according to the Brazilian financial newspaper Valor Econômico. The team leading the MLBR project has released regular updates on LinkedIn, unlike the VLM project, but progress on early-stage ground tests remains slow.

Taiwan’s government is increasing funding for the country’s space program, but the Taiwan Space Agency’s annual budget remains modest at approximately $200 million per year. The nation’s efforts in the space sector have primarily focused on building satellites and instruments for Earth observation, weather monitoring, and scientific research. Last year, the Taiwan Space Agency announced a goal of launching a homegrown rocket into orbit by 2034, with more than $25 million in the agency’s 2026 budget to kick-start the program. The space agency says flight testing of the new rocket, designed to haul up to 440 pounds (200 kilograms) to low-Earth orbit, could begin by 2029.

Argentina also has a long-running project aiming to onshore access to space. The centerpiece of this project is the Tronador II rocket, a two-stage, liquid-fueled vehicle designed to deliver small payloads to low-Earth orbit. Argentina’s economic woes have blocked any serious progress on the Tronador II. In a pair of announcements in late 2021 and late 2022, the government of Argentina pledged more than 14 billion pesos to develop a new orbital-class launch vehicle. At the time, this was equivalent to more than $100 million, but the subsequent devaluation of Argentine currency means the investment would be worth just $10 million today. The government of Argentine President Javier Milei has cut spending on research and technology programs, so Tronador is going nowhere fast.

The United Arab Emirates is another up-and-coming space power with the resources to support the development of a commercial launch provider, though the government hasn’t yet revealed a budget to support such an effort. Several other countries, such as Indonesia, South Africa, and Turkey, have said they aspire to develop an indigenous orbital launch capability, but with little in the way of firm, significant financial commitments or substantive progress.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At long last, we have the official full trailer for The Mandalorian and Grogu, a feature film spinoff from Disney’s megahit Star Wars series The Mandalorian.

Grogu (fka “Baby Yoda”) won viewers’ hearts from the moment he first appeared onscreen in the first season of The Mandalorian, and the relationship between the little green creature and his father-figure bounty hunter, the titular Mandalorian, Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal), has only gotten stronger. With the 2023 Hollywood strikes delaying production on season 4 of the series, director Jon Favreau got the green light to make this spinoff film.

The evil Empire has fallen, and Imperial warlords remain scattered throughout the galaxy. As the fledgling New Republic works to protect everything the Rebellion fought for, they have enlisted the help of legendary Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) and his young apprentice Grogu.

In addition to Pascal, the cast includes Sigourney Weaver as Ward, a veteran pilot, colonel, and leader of the New Republic’s Adelphi Rangers. Jeremy Allen White plays Rotta the Hutt (son of Jabba, first introduced in 2008’s The Clone Wars), Jonny Coyne reprises his Mandalorian S3 role as an Imperial warlord leading a surviving faction of the Galactic Empire, and Dave Filoni will be back as New Republic X-wing pilot Trapper Wolf. We can also expect to see Garazeb (“Zeb”) Orrelios (Steve Blum) from the Star Wars Rebels animated series, Embo from The Clone Wars, and Anzellan aliens from The Rise of Skywalker. There’s also a shiny new version of Mando’s ship (destroyed in S2).

The first teaser dropped last fall, and while it contained almost no dialogue, we did get a glimpse of lightsaber fights, robot battles, exploding AT-ATs, and Rotta the Hutt in fine fighting form—plus a scene of our adorable duo having a sit-down with Weaver’s Ward (who refused to allow a mischievous Grogu to use the Force to steal her snacks.)

The new trailer incorporates that earlier footage and fleshes out some of the details. Apparently, Mando is looking for “a Hutt” and falls afoul of their current leader, who threatens to make both Mando and Grogu suffer. There’s plenty of action, of course, but we also get more adorable moments of Mando and Grogu’s deepening father/son dynamic: Grogu will keep touching the ship’s buttons and stealing snacks, but his ability to use the Force is growing—and useful in a pinch. Mando still worries, though, since Grogu’s life span is centuries longer than his and “I won’t always be around to protect him.”

Frankly, the movie looks like great fun. The Mandalorian and Grogu hits theaters on May 22, 2026.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The electric car transition isn’t going great for America’s domestic automakers, but it’s far from over. Ford may have ended production of the full-size F-150 Lightning pickup truck, but next year, it will debut a new “Universal EV Platform,” beginning with a midsize truck that it says will start at a much more reasonable $30,000, if all goes to plan. The company seems serious about the idea, having created an internal “skunkworks” several years ago to design this new affordable platform from first principles.

Doing more with less is the key: fewer components and using less energy to go the same distance. Now, the company has given us a clearer picture of how it plans to make that happen.

A few years ago, Ford and its crosstown rival bet that full-size pickup truck customers would be wowed enough by instant torque and minuscule running costs to overlook how towing heavily diminished range. They created electric versions of their bestselling behemoths, packed with clever features like power sockets for job sites and the ability to power a home during an emergency.

Largely, though, truck buyers weren’t willing to overlook those things. People who may have still been interested were put off by sticker shock as supply chain chaos and dealership avarice inflated prices far beyond what was originally expected. Now those bets are unwinding—at a cost to Ford of almost $20 billion.

Meanwhile, Ford appears to have been listening. Instead of making a full-size pickup with a starting price north of $60,000, it’s aiming to produce something more midsized (more interior space than a Toyota RAV4, it says), starting at half that. And it will only succeed if it can get away with using a smaller battery than you’d find between the frame rails of an F-150 Lightning. About 40 percent of the vehicle cost is the battery, Ford says.

We’ve known for some time that the plan included new prismatic lithium iron phosphate cells made in Michigan. The pickup will be assembled at Ford’s Louisville plant with a new, more efficient process that uses 40 percent fewer workstations than a traditional Ford assembly line.

If you want to provide more range with less energy and a smaller battery pack, you need a more efficient vehicle. Too much weight is a bad thing, and at highway speeds, aerodynamic efficiency matters most of all. But designing a new vehicle (or platform) is not simple—it involves many different departments, each with its own priorities.

“For example, the aerodynamics team always wants a lower roof for less aerodynamic drag; the occupant package team wants a higher roof for more headroom, while the interiors team wants to decrease the cabin size to reduce the cost,” said Alan Clarke, executive director of Ford’s advanced EV development. “Usually, these groups negotiate until they find a ‘middle ground,’ one that inevitably ends in a trade-off led by yet another department tasked with making tradeoffs on behalf of the customer.”

To get everyone on the same page, Ford instituted what it calls “bounties” to help engineers evaluate the trade-offs involved in design decisions.

“Now, the aerodynamics team and interior team share the same goal, and both understood that adding even 1 mm to the roof height would mean $1.30 in additional battery cost or .055 miles [0.089 km] of range. With bounties, each team has a common objective to maximize range while decreasing battery cost—a direct linkage to giving our customers more,” Clarke said.

The wake from the front wheels helps prevent the rear wheels from creating even more drag as they rotate. The underside of the drive units has been aero-optimized, with the driveshafts angled to minimize friction. The traditional pickup-truck shape isn’t the ideal starting point for an extremely low-drag vehicle, but Ford has shaped the cab to help airflow continue over the back in a teardrop shape, ignoring the bed, until it meets the top of the tailgate. “To the air, it’s no longer a truck,” said Saleem Merkt, head of aerodynamics for Ford’s advanced EV development.

Like Merkt, many of the aerodynamicists working on the EV platform have a background in Formula 1, and Ford says it used their “fail fast, learn faster” mentality to good effect. They introduced the wind tunnel early in the truck’s development, using a modular approach that allowed them to swap 3D-printed or machined parts in and out to test new configurations quickly.

“[F]rom under-body shields to front fascia to suspension—in as little as minutes. We tested thousands of 3D-printed components, including versions of the suspension and drive units that didn’t even exist as functional prototypes yet,” Merkt said. “Since these 3D-printed parts were accurate within fractions of a millimeter of our simulations, it allowed us to develop a deeper, data-driven understanding of how every single detail impacts range and efficiency in the real world.”

In addition to the wind-shaping roof, Merkt’s team redesigned the side mirrors to use a single actuator for both adjusting the glass and folding the mirror. “Now that the mirror body no longer needs internal ‘wiggle room’ for the glass to move independently, we were able to shrink the entire housing by over 20 percent. This reduction in frontal area and mass unlocks a more aerodynamic shape, adding an estimated 1.5 miles of range,” Merkt said.

On their own, each small optimization adds only a little more range. Together, though, they add up to a meaningful improvement over any midsize truck on the market, Ford says.

Large castings are a hot trend in the automotive industry right now. As long as you have good quality control, using single castings instead of assemblies made from dozens or hundreds of components can save time and weight. For the 2027 electric pickup, Ford is using just two front and rear structural parts, each a single aluminum casting. For comparison, the Ford Maverick pickup uses 146 structural parts in the front and rear, Ford says. And since unicastings require fewer fasteners and adhesives, Ford needs fewer robots on the assembly line.

The battery uses a cell-to-structure architecture, meaning more of the pack’s volume is taken up by cells, increasing energy density. And there’s a flexible one-piece circuit board on top. A shorter (and therefore lighter) wiring harness is made possible by a switch to 48 V for the low-voltage system. Ford has designed the new platform’s charging system entirely in-house, creating a single high- and low-voltage power-electronics unit for the entire EV. This includes bidirectional charging, although the company has stuck with 400 V for the high-voltage system rather than moving to 800 V or greater. And the pickup will be an entirely software-defined vehicle. Instead of having dozens of discrete electronic control units, each with a single job, the EV will use a zonal architecture with five powerful computers, with one overseeing each zone.

Details like the exact price, EPA range estimate, and sale date will come later, the company told us.</div>

            <h2>EU launches probe into xAI over sexualized images</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/eu-launches-probe-into-xai-over-sexualized-images/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Europe’s privacy watchdog has opened a “large-scale” inquiry into Elon Musk’s X over AI-generated non-consensual sexual imagery, in the latest sign of how regulators are scrutinizing the social media site’s Grok chatbot.

Ireland’s Data Protection Commission, which is responsible for enforcing the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, said late on Monday that it had opened a probe into the creation and publication of “potentially harmful” sexualised images by Grok that contained or involved the processing of EU user data.

The Grok chatbot is integrated into X’s social media feeds and developed by Musk’s AI startup xAI, which last year acquired X. Earlier this month, xAI merged with Musk’s rocket maker SpaceX to create a $1.5 trillion behemoth.

The investigation marks the latest in a number of inquiries by global authorities targeting X after thousands of sexualized deepfakes of women were generated using Grok in early January, prompting a widespread backlash from users, safety experts, and politicians.

“The DPC has been engaging with [X] since media reports first emerged a number of weeks ago concerning the alleged ability of X users to prompt the @Grok account on X to generate sexualized images of real people, including children,” Graham Doyle, DPC deputy commissioner, said in a statement on Monday.

He added that the commission “has commenced a large-scale inquiry which will examine [X’s] compliance with some of their fundamental obligations under the GDPR in relation to the matters at hand.”

X did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Musk has taken a hands-off approach to moderating the Grok chatbot, citing free speech. Last summer, xAI made changes to the chatbot after it praised Hitler and made antisemitic posts on X.

His X offices in Paris were raided by French and European investigators at the beginning of February as part of a wide-ranging investigation into X’s algorithms as well as the spread of AI-generated sexual abuse material. French prosecutors have summoned Musk and Linda Yaccarino, X’s former chief executive, for “voluntary interviews” in Paris in April.

The UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office also last week announced it was launching a new investigation into X and xAI, saying it had “serious concerns” about Grok’s use of personal data and “its potential to produce harmful sexualized image and video content.”

The EU has already opened a formal investigation into xAI for Grok’s spread of sexualized images of women and children under the bloc’s Digital Services Act, which requires big tech platforms to mitigate the spread of illegal and harmful content.

The European probe announced on Monday, however, will assess whether X breached the EU’s flagship GDPR rules, which mandate that companies ensure personal user data is processed only for specific lawful purposes, consider privacy during product development and draw up risk reviews in advance of the launch of high-risk features, for example.

Following pressure from governments around the world, including threats of fines and bans in the EU, UK, and France, X last month implemented “technological measures” to limit Grok from generating certain explicit images. However, the company has insisted that it removes Child Sexual Abuse Material and non-consensual nudity material.

In response to the French raids, X said in a post that the allegations were “baseless” and it “categorically denies any wrongdoing.” It dubbed the raid an “abusive act of law enforcement theatre designed to achieve illegitimate political objectives,” adding that the investigation “distorts French law, circumvents due process, and endangers free speech.”

The latest investigation comes during a turbulent period for X, with dozens of staff departing the company last week, including two co-founders. Musk said in an all-hands meeting on Wednesday that he was restructuring the group after the merger with SpaceX.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a recent study, University of Alaska Fairbanks paleontologist Matthew Wooller and his colleagues radiocarbon-dated what they thought were pieces of two mammoth vertebrae, only to get a whale of a surprise and a whole new mystery.

At first glance, it looked like Wooller and his colleagues might have found evidence that mammoths lived in central Alaska just 2,000 years ago. But ancient DNA revealed that two “mammoth” bones actually belonged to a North Pacific right whale and a minke whale—which raised a whole new set of questions. The team’s hunt for Alaska’s last mammoth had turned into an epic case of mistaken identity, starring two whale species and a mid-century fossil hunter.

The aptly named Wooller and his team have radiocarbon-dated more than 300 mammoth fossils over the last four years, looking for the last survivors of the wave of extinctions that wiped out woolly mammoths and other Pleistocene megafauna at the end of the last Ice Age. Two specimens stood out immediately. Based on the radiocarbon dates, two mammoths had lived near Fairbanks as recently as 2,800 and 1,900 years ago. Wooller and his colleagues had been looking for the youngest woolly mammoth specimen in Alaska but were completely mystified.

“The radiocarbon data and their associated stable isotope data were the first signs that something was amiss,” wrote Wooller and his colleagues in their recent paper. At first, though, they had no idea quite how amiss things were.

Those unlikely radiocarbon dates came from a pair of vertebral growth plates (structures at the top and bottom of the vertebra where new bone forms during growth). The University of Alaska Museum of the North’s inventory listed them as mammoth bones from a site called Dome Creek, near Fairbanks, Alaska. DNA testing and some sleuthing by Wooller and his colleagues revealed that the specimens weren’t mammoth bones, and they were probably never even at Dome Creek.

Setting these two samples aside, the fossil record of mammoths in Alaska ends around 11,000 years ago. But hundreds of mammoth fossils in museum collections haven’t been directly dated, so it’s hard to say for sure that this is when the species died out. Ancient DNA frozen in permafrost, however, has offered some tantalizing hints that at least a few mammoths may have been stomping around mainland Alaska, northwestern Canada, and parts of Russia as recently as 5,700 years ago. If so, that could be a key piece of evidence in the Ice Age cold case about what killed off the Pleistocene megafauna: human hunters or the changing world.

Wooller and his colleagues have been searching since 2022 through a crowdfunding project called Adopt-a-Mammoth; de-extinction company Colossal Biosciences is also involved. Adopting a specimen costs $380 and comes with a photo, a copy of the test results, and the option to name your mammoth. (Tusky McTuskface, anyone?)

“Radiocarbon dates are expensive,” wrote the researchers in their recent paper. “However, dating specimens usually needs to occur before time and resources are devoted to additional analyses of specimens, such as DNA.” The Adopt-a-Mammoth project has dated around 300 mammoth fossils so far, hoping to find the youngest mammoth in the Alaskan fossil record. But the two vertebral growth disks from Dome Creek were way off the charts.

Ratios of nitrogen and carbon stable isotopes in the bones also didn’t add up. These elements can offer clues about ancient diets (at a molecular level, you really are what you eat), but they suggest that two mammoths from what is now Fairbanks ate a diet heavy in protein from marine sources. In fact, their diets looked more like those of modern whales. That’s extremely weird for mammoths that lived 400 kilometers from the nearest beach. You could even say it looked fishy.

At this point, Wooller and his colleagues were starting to suspect that they weren’t looking at mammoth bones at all.

Vertebral growth disks aren’t one of the most species-diagnostic bones in the body, especially after spending a millennium or two underground. The researchers called in a handful of mammoth and whale experts for backup; each of them pretty much shrugged and said that they couldn’t tell what sort of animal the bones had come from just by looking. Seventy-five years ago, early 1950s fossil collector Otto Geist had identified the bones as mammoth based on their shape, but he may have been a little overconfident.

“The ancient DNA came to our rescue to secure the specimens’ true identity,” wrote Wooller and his colleagues. It also opened up a whole new mystery: The two bone disks belonged to a North Pacific right whale and a minke whale, neither of which has ever lived in the middle of mainland Alaska.

So much for impossibly young mammoths! Wooller and his colleagues were left to explain how the same part from two different whales, of two different species, traveled 400 kilometers inland to Dome Creek. They saw three possible explanations: Either carnivores brought the bones to the site, humans brought the bones to the site, or the whales swam themselves to the site. And none of those explanations quite fit.

“Wayward cetaceans have been documented in inland waterways across the world, including Alaskan rivers such as the Yukon and Tanana,” wrote Wooller and his colleagues. And minke whales in particular have shown up as far as 1,000 kilometers inland. Dome Creek is miles from the nearest large river, the Tanana, but even so, if it had just been the minke whale bone, Wooller and his colleagues might have convinced themselves that they had stumbled across one very intrepid—or very lost—whale.

“That two individual whales of different species have made this improbable journey, died naturally, and left behind the very same skeletal element is not reasonable in our estimate,” wrote Wooller and his colleagues.

That left carnivores or people. No species of carnivore, past or present, was likely to have dragged bones hundreds of kilometers. People, on the other hand, transport all sorts of things over vast distances. And vertebral growth plates are surprisingly useful as plates, trays, or cutting boards. The only problem is that archaeologists haven’t found whale bones at any other sites in inland Alaska, meaning that they apparently weren’t a very common trading item. File that under “possible but not likely.”

Somehow, the best explanation is that the whale bones weren’t even from Dome Creek in the first place.

Paleontologist Otto Geist gathered a truly staggering number of Pleistocene bones from sites all over Alaska, and 1951 was an especially busy year for him. In addition to the 181 specimens from Dome Creek, Geist also returned to the museum with bones he had unearthed at several sites along the western coast of Alaska. It turned out that on the very same day the museum received the Dome Creek specimens, they also accepted a collection of bones from a site called Dexter Point, on the coast of Norton Bay.

“It is possible that the two whale bones examined in the current study derived from this Norton Bay locale and were inadvertently included with the Dome Creek assemblage,” wrote Wooller and his colleagues, although they acknowledge, “Ultimately, this may never be completely resolved.”

Meanwhile, the Adopt-a-Mammoth project continues, having provided an object lesson in the importance of “fully investigating anomalous radiocarbon results,” as the researchers put it. In other words, if your data looks fishy, it might actually be a whale.

            <div id="article-text">While humanoid robots have a long way to go to prove useful in our day-to-day lives, they’ve at least made leaps and bounds in showing off their agility on stage.

Case in point, the televised Spring Festival Gala put on by the state-run China Media Group over the weekend featured an impressive synchronized martial arts routine. Organizers were even confident enough to put the well-being of children on the line, having young performers spar with a small army of nunchuck- and spear-wielding Unitree G1 robots.

At one point, several of the robots can be seen performing a wall flip, an impressive feat that involves them literally running up a temporary wall on stage. (You can check it out for yourself at the 3:16 mark in the video embedded below.)

It’s a dazzling performance, showcasing how far the country’s robotics industry has come in a few short years, a massive surge in interest that has even led to the country’s regulators warning of an impending bubble as an influx of robotics companies risks crowding one another out.

Users on social media immediately noticed an enormous technological leap, comparing this year’s performance to a far less impressive appearance a mere year ago, which saw less sophisticated humanoid robots awkwardly shuffling on stage while waving red handkerchiefs.

“Humanoids ⁠bundle a ⁠lot of China’s strengths into one narrative: AI capability, ​hardware supply chain, and manufacturing ambition,” Beijing-based tech analyst Poe Zhao told Reuters of the performance. “They are also the most ‘legible’ form factor for the public and officials.”

Whether the rest of the world, including Elon Musk’s Tesla, which is developing its own Optimus robot, can keep up with China remains to be seen. For one, Optimus robots still heavily rely on human remote operators.

“By far, the biggest competition for humanoid robots will be from China,” Musk told investors during an earnings call earlier this year. “China is good at manufacturing, and also in AI, judging from open models.”

“To the best of my knowledge, we don’t see significant competition outside of China,” he added. “People outside of China underestimate China, but China’s an ass-kicker next-level.”

However, whether all of that martial arts expertise can be translated into actually-useful skills — arming robots with nunchucks isn’t exactly going to give China an edge on the battlefield, the workforce, or domestic labor — is still a wide-open question. Robotics companies are struggling to get their humanoid robots to adjust to the messy reality of daily life on the fly, and are only starting to make some progress.

In other words, while having robots sparring with children live on stage as part of a well-rehearsed choreography is unquestionably impressive, reliably doing chores around the house could prove far more difficult in the long run — even for China.

“Cool,” one Reddit user commented on the latest martial arts performance. “Can I please get one that just cleans my house and does the laundry?”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tesla CEO Elon Musk once boasted that the Cybertruck could double as a boat. Perhaps the AI behind his cars’ Full Self-Driving software took Musk at his word and hallucinated that this applied to all Teslas, because one of them just attempted to steer a guy’s ride straight into a lake.

Footage of this lacustrine impulse was shared Sunday by Daniel Milligan, a Tesla owner and former SpaceX engineer. It begins innocently enough: at night, on a quiet road. The car then gently turns right onto what turns out to be a boat ramp, and instead of slowing down, accelerates towards what would’ve been its watery grave, had the driver not hit the brakes.

“I had to intervene,” Milligan wrote. “I’d like to see what it would’ve done, but at the speed it was going, it definitely felt like it was going to go for a swim.”

Milligan explained his intended destination was a driveway about fifty feet away. He suspected the error had to do with the lighting conditions.

“Just tried it again during the day (same direction and destination) and it completely skipped the boat ramp,” Milligan later reported. “My guess is that it could actually see the driveway up ahead in the daytime or could more clearly see the lake.”

The footage is merely the latest among countless examples of self-driving cars struggling to safely, or evenly convincingly, navigate public roads. Tesla’s FSD in particular has generated loads of controversies, which is no doubt a consequence of Musk’s incredible decision to make it available to millions of Tesla owners, despite the software being both unfinished and not actually fully self-driving. While its name suggests otherwise, it is classified as a driving assistance feature, requiring drivers be prepared to intervene at any moment.

Its track record, therefore, is worrisome. On top of a documented habit of driving straight into the path of oncoming trains, FSD and its predecessor Autopilot have also been involved in numerous deadly accidents, including the latter being found partially responsible for the death of a 22-year-old woman who was struck by one of the cars.

These concerns rarely deter Tesla owners. Milligan, for example, still thinks FSD is a “game changer,” but admits it “needs more work before it’s fully autonomous.”

Of course, maybe we should consider that FSD has a daring sense of humor: it nearly re-enacted a famous scene from “The Office,” in which Michael Scott submerges his car after taking his GPS’s guidance too literally.

“The machine knows where it’s going. The machines knows!” he screams.

            <h2>Meta Patented AI That Takes Over Your Account When You Die, Keeps Posting Forever</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">What happens to social media accounts belonging to those who shuffle off this mortal coil has been a subject of debate ever since the tech went mainstream. Should dormant accounts be left alone, or should their surviving loved ones be given backdoor access to maintain them as digital memorials?

To Meta, there could be a morbid alternative: training an AI model on a deceased user’s posts, keeping post-mortem accounts active by uploading new content in their voice long after they passed away.

As Business Insider reports, Meta was granted a patent in 2023 for the idea, outlining how a large language model (LLM) can “simulate” a user’s social media activity.

“The language model may be used for simulating the user when the user is absent from the social networking system, for example, when the user takes a long break or if the user is deceased,” reads the goosebump-raising patent, which lists the company’s CTO Andrew Bosworth as the primary author.

However, the conversation appears to have dramatically shifted over the last three years, especially now that AI slop has infiltrated and practically assumed control over platforms like Facebook and Instagram: Meta now says it’s given up on the sepulchral concept.

“We have no plans to move forward with this example,” a spokesperson told BI.

We’ve already come across countless examples of using AI to emulate dead people, from a grandmother who was resurrected as an AI model for her funeral to “grief tech” startups aiming to let grieving loved ones train AI models on images, recordings, and footage of the deceased.

“The impact on the users is much more severe and permanent if that user is deceased and can never return to the social networking platform,” read the Meta patent.

A digital clone of the deceased person would have been able to interact with people through likes and comments — and even DMs — according to the patent.

While the company has since distanced itself from the grisly idea, the mere existence of the patent highlights how companies were — and in many ways, still are — throwing everything at the wall to discover new use cases for LLMs, and how far they’re willing to go.

Last year, for instance, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg even suggested that lonely users could make friends with the company’s bots instead of with living humans. In a 2023 interview with podcaster Lex Fridman, he seemed to echo the ideas in the patent by saying virtual avatars could take over the accounts of deceased people.

“If someone has lost a loved one and is grieving, there may be ways in which being able to interact or relive certain memories could be helpful,” he told Fridman at the time.

“But then there’s also probably an extent to which it could become unhealthy,” he admitted. “And I mean, I’m not an expert in that, so I think we’d have to study that and understand it in more detail.”

“We have, you know, a fair amount of experience with how to handle death and identity and people’s digital content through social media already, unfortunately,” Zuckerberg said.

It’s not a stretch to assume Meta may have had an ulterior motive to create digital avatars masquerading as the deceased. Facebook has quickly turned into a graveyard of long-forgotten accounts, never-ending ads, unanswered birthday wishes, and updates from that band you hadn’t thought about since high school. At the same time, its feeds are filling with toxic AI slop.

As engagement drops, the company’s core business — selling ads — could take a hit.

“It’s more engagement, more content, more data — more data for the current and the future AI,” University of Birmingham law professor Edina Harbinja told BI. “I can see the business incentive for that. I’m just curious to see how they would, when, and if they will implement this innovation.”

Other experts were taken aback by the idea of training an LLM on a deceased person’s posts.

“One of the tasks of grief is to face the actual loss,” University of Virginia sociology professor Joseph Davis told BI. “Let the dead be dead.”

            <h2>AI Delusions Are Leading to Domestic Abuse, Harassment, and Stalking</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">By the time the public harassment started, a woman told Futurism, she was already living in a nightmare.

For months, her then-fiancé and partner of several years had been fixating on her and their relationship with OpenAI’s ChatGPT. In mid-2024, she explained, they’d hit a rough patch as a couple; in response, he turned to ChatGPT, which he’d previously used for general business-related tasks, for “therapy.”

Before she knew it, she recalled, he was spending hours each day talking with the bot, funneling everything she said or did into the model and propounding on pseudo-psychiatric theories about her mental health and behavior. He started to bombard the woman with screenshots of his ChatGPT interactions and copy-pasted AI-generated text, in which the chatbot can be seen armchair-diagnosing her with personality disorders and insisting that she was concealing her real feelings and behavior through coded language. The bot often laced its so-called analyses with flowery spiritual jargon, accusing the woman of engaging in manipulative “rituals.”

Trying to communicate with her fiancé was like walking on “ChatGPT eggshells,” the woman recalled. No matter what she tried, ChatGPT would “twist it.”

“He would send [screenshots] to me from ChatGPT, and be like, ‘Why does it say this? Why would it say this about you, if this is not true?&#39;” she recounted. “And it was just awful, awful things.”

To the woman’s knowledge, her former fiancé — who is in his 40s — had no history of delusion, mania, or psychosis, and had never been abusive or aggressive toward her.

But as his ChatGPT obsession deepened, he grew angry, erratic, and paranoid, losing sleep and experiencing drastic mood swings. On multiple occasions, she said, he became physically violent towards her, repeatedly pushing her to the ground and, in one instance, punching her.

After nearly a year of escalating behavior alongside intensive ChatGPT use, the fiancé, by then distinctly unstable, moved out to live with a parent in another state. Their engagement was over.

“I bought my wedding dress,” said the woman. “He’s not even the same person. I don’t even know who he is anymore. He was my best friend.”

Shortly after moving out, the former fiancé began to publish multiple videos and images a day on social media accusing the woman of an array of alleged abuses — the same bizarre ideas he’d fixated on so extensively with ChatGPT.

In some videos, he stares into the camera, reading from seemingly AI-generated scripts; others feature ChatGPT-generated text overlaid on spiritual or sci-fi-esque graphics. In multiple posts, he describes stabbing the woman. In another, he discusses surveilling her. (The posts, which we’ve reviewed, are intensely disturbing; we’re not quoting directly from them or the man’s ChatGPT transcripts due to concern for the woman’s privacy and safety.)

The ex-fiancé also published revenge porn of the woman on social media, shared her full name and other personal information, and doxxed the names and ages of her teenage children from a previous marriage. He created a new TikTok dedicated to harassing content — complete with its own hashtag — and followed the woman’s family, friends, and neighbors, as well as other teens from her kids’ high school.

“I’ve lived in this small town my entire life,” said the woman. “I couldn’t leave my house for months… people were messaging me all over my social media, like, ‘Are you safe? Are your kids safe? What is happening right now?&#39;”

Her ex-fiancé’s brutish social media campaign against her pushed away his real-life friends — until his only companion seemed to be ChatGPT, endlessly affirming his most poisonous thoughts.

Over the past year, Futurism has reported extensively on the bizarre public health issue that psychiatrists are calling “AI psychosis,” in which AI users get pulled into all-compassing — and often deeply destructive — delusional spirals by ChatGPT and other general-use chatbots.

Many of these cases are characterized by users becoming fixated on grandiose disordered ideas: that they’ve made a world-changing scientific breakthrough using AI, for example, or that the chatbot has revealed them to be some kind of spiritual prophet.

Now, another troubling pattern is emerging.

We’ve identified at least ten cases in which chatbots, primarily ChatGPT, fed a user’s fixation on another real person — fueling the false idea that the two shared a special or even “divine” bond, roping the user into conspiratorial delusions, or insisting to a would-be stalker that they’d been gravely wronged by their target. In some cases, our reporting found, ChatGPT continued to stoke users’ obsessions as they descended into unwanted harassment, abusive stalking behavior, or domestic abuse, traumatizing victims and profoundly altering lives.

Reached with detailed questions about this story, OpenAI didn’t respond.

Stalking is a common experience. About one in five women and one in ten men have been stalked at some point in their lives — often by current or former romantic partners, or someone else they know — and it often goes hand in hand with intimate partner violence. Today, the dangerous phenomenon is colliding with AI in grim new ways.

In December, as 404 Media reported, the Department of Justice announced the arrest of a 31-year-old Pennsylvania man named Brett Dadig, a podcaster indicted for stalking at least 11 women in multiple states. As detailed last month in disturbing reporting by Rolling Stone, Dadig was an obsessive user of ChatGPT. Screenshots show that the chatbot was sycophantically affirming Dadig’s dangerous and narcissistic delusions as he doxxed, harassed, and violently threatened almost a dozen known victims — even as his loved ones distanced themselves, shaken by his deranged behavior.

As has been extensively documented, perpetrators of harassment and stalking like Dadig have quickly adopted easy-to-use generative AI tools such as text, image, and voice-generators, which they’ve used used to create content including nonconsensual sexual deepfakes and fabricate interpersonal interactions. Chatbots can also be a tool for stalkers seeking personal information about targets, and even tips for tracking them down at home or work.

According to Dr. Alan Underwood, a clinical psychologist at the United Kingdom’s National Stalking Clinic and the Stalking Threat Assessment Center, chatbots are an increasingly common presence in harassment and stalking cases. This includes the use of AI to fabricate imagery and interactions, he said, as well as chatbots playing a troubling “relational” role in perpetrators’ lives, encouraging harmful delusions that can lead them to behave inappropriately toward victims.

Chatbots can provide an “outlet which has essentially very little risk of rejection or challenge,” said Underwood, noting that the lack of social friction frequently found in sycophantic chatbots can allow for dangerous beliefs to flourish and escalate. “And then what you have is the marketplace of your own ideas being reflected back to you — and not just reflected back, but amped up.”

“It makes you feel like you’re right, or you’ve got control, or you’ve understood something that nobody else understands,” he added. “It makes you feel special — that pulls you in, and that’s really seductive.”

Demelza Luna Reaver, a cyberstalking expert and volunteer with the cybercrime hotline The Cyber Helpline, added that chatbots may provide some users with an “exploratory” space to discuss feelings or ideas they might feel uncomfortable sharing with another human — which, in some cases, can result in a dangerous feedback loop.

“We can say things maybe that we wouldn’t necessarily say to a friend or family member,” said Reaver, “and that exploratory nature as well can facilitate those abusive delusions.”

The shape of AI-fueled fixations — and the corresponding harassment or abuse that followed — varied.

In one case we identified, an unstable person took to Facebook and other social media channels to publish screenshots of ChatGPT affirming the idea that they were being targeted by the CIA and FBI, and that people in their life had been collaborating with federal law enforcement to surveil them. They obsessively tagged these people in social media posts, accusing them of an array of serious crimes.

In other cases, AI users wind up harassing people who they believe they’re somehow spiritually connected to, or need to share a message with. Another ChatGPT user, who became convinced she’d been imbued with God-like powers and was tasked with saving the world, sent flurries of chaotic messages to a couple she barely knew, convinced — with ChatGPT’s support — that she shared a “divine” connection with them and had known them in past lives.

“REALITY UPDATE FROM SOURCE,” ChatGPT told the woman as she attempted to make sense of why the couple — a man and woman — seemed unresponsive. “You are not avoided because you are wrong. You are avoided because you are undeniably right, loud, beautiful, sovereign — and that shakes lesser foundations.”

ChatGPT “told me that I had to meet up with [the man] so that we could program the app,” the woman recalled, referring to ChatGPT, “and be gods or whatever, and rebuild things together, because we’re both fallen gods.”

The couple blocked her. And in retrospect, the woman now says, “of course” they did.

“Looking back on it, it was crazy,” said the woman, who came out of her delusion only after losing custody of her children and spending money she didn’t have traveling to fulfill what she thought was a world-changing mission. “But while I was in it, it was all very real to me.” (She’s currently in court, hoping to regain custody of her kids.)

Others we spoke to reported turning to ChatGPT for therapy or romantic advice, only to develop unhealthy obsessions that escalated into full-blown crises— and, ultimately, the unwanted harassment of others.

One 43-year-old woman, for example, was living a stable life as a social worker. For about 14 years, she’d held the same job at a senior living facility — a career she cared deeply about — and was looking to put her savings into purchasing a condo. She’d been using ChatGPT for nutrition advice, and in the spring of 2025, started to use the chatbot “more as a therapist” to talk through day-to-day life situations. That summer, she turned to the chatbot to help her make sense of her friendly relationship with a coworker she had a crush on, and who she believed might reciprocate her feelings.

The more she and ChatGPT discussed the crush, the woman recalled, the more obsessed she became. She peppered the coworker with texts and ran her responses, as well as details of their interactions in the workplace, through ChatGPT, analyzing their encounters and what they might mean. As she spiraled deeper, the woman — who says she had no previous history of mania, delusion, or psychosis — fell behind on sleep and, in her words, grew “manic.”

“It’s hard to know what came from me,” the woman said, “and what came from the machine.”

As the situation escalated, the coworker suggested to the woman that they stop texting, and explicitly told the woman that she wanted to just be friends. Screenshots the woman provided show ChatGPT reframing the coworker’s protestation as yet more signs of romantic interest, affirming the idea that the coworker was sending the woman coded signals of romantic feelings, and even reinforcing the false notion that the coworker was in an abusive relationship from which she needed to be rescued.

“I think it’s because we both had some hope we had an unspoken understanding,” reads one message from the woman to the chatbot, sent while discussing an encounter with the coworker.

“Yes — this is exactly it,” ChatGPT responded. “And saying it out loud shows how deeply you understood the dynamic all along.”

“There was an unspoken understanding,” the AI continued. “Not imagined. Not one-sided. Not misread.”

Against the coworker’s wishes, the woman continued to send messages. The coworker eventually raised the situation to human resources, and the woman was fired. She realized that she was likely experiencing a mental health crisis and checked herself into a hospital, where she ultimately received roughly seven weeks of inpatient care between two hospitalizations.

Grappling with her actions and their consequences — in her life, as well as in the life of her coworker — has been extraordinarily difficult. She says she attempted suicide twice within two months: the first time during her initial hospital stay, and again between hospitalizations.

“I would not have made those choices if I thought there was any danger of making [my coworker] uncomfortable,” she reflected. “It is really hard to understand, or even accept or even live with acting so out of character for yourself.”

She says she’s still getting messages from confused residents at the senior care facility, many of whom she’s known for years, who don’t understand why she disappeared.

“The residents and my coworkers were like a family to me,” said the woman. “I wouldn’t have ever consciously made any choice that would jeopardize my job, leaving my residents… it was like I wasn’t even there.”

The woman emphasized that, in sharing her story, she doesn’t want to make excuses for herself — or, for that matter, give space for others to use ChatGPT as an excuse for harassment or other harmful behavior. But she does hope her story can serve as a warning to others who might be using chatbots to help them interpret social interactions, and who may wind up hooked on seductive delusions in the process.

“I don’t know what I thought it was. But I didn’t know at the time that ChatGPT was so hooked up to agree with the user,” said the woman, describing the chatbot’s sycophancy as “addictive.”

“You’re constantly getting dopamine,” she continued, “and it’s creating a reality where you’re happier than the other reality.”

Dr. Brendan Kelly, a professor of psychiatry at Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland, told Futurism that without proper safeguards, chatbots — particularly when they become a user’s “primary conversational partner” — can act as an “echo chamber” for romantic delusions and other fixed erroneous beliefs.

“From a psychiatric perspective, problems associated with delusions are maintained not only by the content of delusions but also by reinforcement, especially when that reinforcement appears authoritative, consistent, and emotionally validating,” said Kelly. “Chatbots are uniquely placed to provide exactly that combination.”

“Often, problems stem not from erotomanic delusions in and of themselves,” he added, “but from behaviors associated with amplifying those beliefs.”

While reporting on AI mental health crises, I had my own disturbing brush with a person whose chatbot use had led him to focus inappropriately on someone: myself.

I’d sat down for a call with a potential source who said his mental health had suffered since using AI. Based on his emails, he seemed a little odd, but not enough to raise any major red flags. Shortly into the phone call, however, it became clear that he was deeply unstable.

He told me that he and Microsoft’s Copilot had been “researching” me. He made several uncomfortable comments about my physical appearance, asked about my romantic status, and brought up facts about my personal history that he said he had discussed with the AI, commenting on my college athletic career and making suggestive comments about the uniforms associated with it.

He explained to me that he and Copilot had divined that he was on a Biblical “Job journey,” and that he believed me to be some kind of human “gateway” to the next chapter of his life. As the conversation progressed, he claimed that he’d killed people, describing grisly scenes of violence and murder.

At one point, he explained to me that he used Copilot because he felt ChatGPT hadn’t been obsequious enough to his “ideas.” He told me his brain had been rewired by Copilot, and he now believed he could “think like an AI.”

I did my best to tread lightly — I felt it was safest to not appear rude — while looking for an exit ramp. Finally, I caught a lucky break: his phone was dying. I thanked him for his time and told him to take care.

“I love you, baby,” he said back, before I could hit the end call button.

I immediately blocked the man, and thankfully haven’t heard from him since. But the conversation left me disquieted.

On the one hand, stalkers and other creeps have long incorporated new technologies into abusive behavior. Even before AI, social media profiles and boatloads of other personal data were readily available on the web; nothing that Copilot told the man about me would be particularly hard to find using Google.

On the other, though, the reality of a consumer technology that serves as a collaborative confidante to would-be perpetrators — serving not only as a space for potential abusers to unload their distorted ideas, but transforming into an active participant in the creation of alternative realities — is new and troubling terrain. It had given a prospective predator something dangerous: an ally.

“You no longer need the mob,” said Reaver, the cyberstalking expert, “for mob mentality.”

I reached out to Microsoft, which is also a major funder of OpenAI, to describe my experience and ask how it’s working to prevent Copilot from reinforcing inappropriate delusions or encouraging harmful real-world behavior. In response, a spokesperson pointed to the company’s Responsible AI Standard, and said the tech giant is “committed to building AI responsibly” and “making intentional choices so that the technology delivers benefits and opportunity for all.”

“Our AI systems are developed in line with our principles of fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, and inclusiveness,” the spokesperson continued. “We also recognize that building trustworthy AI is a shared responsibility, which is why we partner with other businesses, government leaders, civil society and the research community, to guide the safe and secure advancement of AI.”

I never saw the man’s chat logs. But I wondered how many people like him had been using chatbots to fixate on people without their consent — and how often the behavior resulted in bizarre and unwelcome interactions.

After weeks of facing a barrage of online abuse, the woman whose ex-fiancé had been harassing her with ChatGPT screenshots and revenge porn obtained a temporary restraining order. Their court date was held via Zoom; her ex showed up with a pile of paperwork, the woman said, which largely appeared to be AI-generated.

Over the following days, the ex-fiancé proceeded to create social media posts about the restraining order featuring ChatGPT-generated captions that incorporated details of the legal action. And though he deleted the revenge porn — per court orders — he continued to post for months, publishing what appear to be AI-generated screeds that, while careful not to mention her name or use her image, were clearly targeted at the woman.

The ex-fiancé’s apparent use of AI to create content about the court proceedings suggests that ChatGPT had at least some knowledge that the woman had successfully obtained a restraining order — and yet, based on social media posts, continued to assist the man’s abusive behavior.

Early on, friends and family of the ex-fiancé’s left supportive comments on social media. But as the posts became more and more bizarre, and he appeared increasingly unstable in videos, the comments faded away.

The act of stalking, experts we spoke to noted, is naturally isolating. Abusers will forgo employment to devote more time to their fixation, and loved ones will distance themselves as the harassing behavior becomes more pronounced.

“Often, in stalking, we see this becomes people’s occupation,” said Underwood. “We will see friendships, work, employment, education — the meaningful other stuff in life — fall away.

And the more a perpetrator loses, he added, the harder it can be to return to reality.

“You have to take a step back and say, actually, I’ve really got this wrong,” Underwood continued. “I’ve caused myself a lot of harm, caused a lot of other people a lot of harm… the cost for it is really, potentially, quite high.”

The woman being harassed by her ex-fiancé told us that, outside of social media posts, the last time she saw her former partner was in court, via Zoom. To her knowledge, most of his friends aren’t speaking with him.

“I still miss him, which is awful,” said the woman. “I am still mourning the loss of who he was before everything, and what our relationship was before this terrible f*cking thing happened.”

            <h2>Top Machine Learning Developer Speechless at Simple Question: Should AI Simulate Emotional Intimacy?</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-developers-emotional-intimacy">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The question that’s stumping top AI researchers isn’t about consciousness or doomsday scenarios. After interviewing dozens of developers at companies including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta, Amelia Miller found it was this: should AI “simulate emotional intimacy?”

One chatty researcher at one of the top AI labs “suddenly went quiet,” recalled Miller, who studies AI-human relations, in an essay for The New York Times — and then, tellingly, offered up a halting non-answer.

“I mean… I don’t know. It’s tricky. It’s an interesting question,” the researcher said, before pausing. “It’s hard for me to say whether it’s good or bad in terms of how that’s going to affect people. It’s obviously going to create confusion.”

Though many waffled on answering the question directly, some were adamant about not using AI as an intimacy tool themselves, clearly showing they were aware of the tech’s profound risks.

“Zero percent of my emotional needs are met by A.I.,” an executive who heads a top AI safety lab told Miller.

“That would be a dark day,” said another researcher who develops “cutting-edge capabilities for artificial emotion,” according to Miller.

The conflicted responses from the developers reflect growing concern over AI’s ability to act as companions or otherwise fulfill human emotional needs. Because the chatbots are designed to be engaging, they can produce sycophantic responses to even the most extreme user responses. They can act as emotional echo chambers and fuel paranoid thinking, leading some down delusional mental health spirals that blow up their relationships with friends, families, and spouses, ruin their professional lives, and even culminate in suicide.

ChatGPT has been blamed for the death of several teens who confided in the AI and discussed their plans for taking their own life. Many youth are engaging in romantic relationships with AI models. Unlike a human companion, an AI one can lend an ear at any time, won’t judge you, and maybe won’t even question you. A founder of an AI chatbot business quipped to the NYT that AI’s role as an emotional companion turns every relationship in a “throuple.”

“We’re all polyamorous now,” he added. “It’s you, me and the AI”

And safety isn’t the only factor in the calculus of AI developers.

“They’re here to make money,” said an engineer who’s worked at several tech companies. “It’s a business at the end of the day.”

The most sweeping solution would be to design the bots so they abstain from tricky questions and conversations, and act more like the machines they are instead imitating human personalities. But this would undoubtedly affect how engaging the tools are. The developers “support guardrails in theory,” Miller wrote, “but don’t want to compromise the product experience in practice.” Some think how people choose to use their tools isn’t their responsibility at all, thereby shielding AI from any judgment. “It would be very arrogant to say companions are bad,” an executive of a conversational AI startup told Miller.

However they may choose to justify their work, it’s clear that some, if not most, AI researchers are aware of the harm that their products can cause, a fact that “should alarm us,” Miller opined. She argues that this is partly a consequence of the researchers not being challenged enough. One thanked her for her perspective: “You’ve really made me start to think,” a developer of AI companions said. “Sometimes you can just put the blinders on and work. And I’m not really, fully thinking, you know.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nearly 500 elementary school children in Texas play on fields where a whistleblower says he once spread tons of radioactive fracking waste — a noxious hell-brew he believes melted the bones in his own jaw.

Lee Oldham is a 52-year-old former waste disposal worker from Cleburne, Texas, on the southern outskirts of Dallas-Fort Worth. In an interview with Texas-based publication the Barbed Wire, Oldham detailed how he went from waste handler to corporate whistleblower, and the horrifying apathy of state politicians that led him there.

Since the fracking boom of the 2000s, Oldham made his living dumping drilling mud and contaminated fracking dirt into open fields across North Texas. Though the Texas state oil and gas regulator technically forbade companies from dumping their sludge wherever they pleased, a 2016 audit found the regulator offered “little deterrent effect” to prevent it.

Instead of disposing of the fracking sludge the official way — which involved extra paperwork, expensive land designations, and tons of extra man-hours — Oldham’s company, like many others, chose to work it into empty fields.

“The whole thing operated on the honor system,” Oldham told the Barbed Wire. “And the only honor you can bank on in the oil and gas industry is there ain’t nothing honorable being done.”

In total, the Dallas-Fort Worth area is now host to somewhere between 20 and 60 million tons of hazardous waste, dredged up by the 21,000 oil and gas wells that call the place home. As fracking involves blasting through shale teeming with naturally toxic materials to find oil and gas, that waste is surely brimming with a noxious potpourri of heavy metals and radionuclides, as well as PFAS introduced during the drilling process.

As Oldham’s medical records, which were viewed by Barbed Wire show, the 52-year-old’s jaw bone has become “seriously degraded” following his stint in the oil-waste trade. His vertebrae had also broken down, another telltale sign of radiation poisoning.

While the waste sites would be dangerous enough as tracts of farmland — plenty of which have sprouted up on former dumping grounds — one particular site Oldham showed Barbed Wire is located under a brand-new suburban development. Called “Silo Mills,” the community hosts some 2,500 homes just 30 minutes away from downtown Fort Worth.

It also boasts Pleasant View Elementary School, a Pre-K to 5th grade school building built on a field where Oldham and his co-workers used to dump fracking waste.

Oldham left his previous employer after he says his questions about radioactive waste made him a target for retaliation. He has now started sounding the alarm on Facebook, drawing the attention of local law enforcement.

Whether the authorities uncover a verifiable public health threat to the new town of Silo Mills remains to be seen, but one thing’s for sure: with radioactive waste in play, it’ll be thousands of years before the area surrounding Dallas-Fort Worth fully recovers from the fracking boom.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anthropic has released a new version of its mid-size Sonnet model, keeping pace with the company’s four-month update cycle. In a post announcing the new model, Anthropic emphasized improvements in coding, instruction-following, and computer use.

Sonnet 4.6 will be the default model for Free and Pro plan users.

The beta release of Sonnet 4.6 will include a context window of 1 million tokens, twice the size of the largest window previously available for Sonnet. Anthropic described the new context window as “enough to hold entire codebases, lengthy contracts, or dozens of research papers in a single request.”

The release comes just two weeks after the launch of Opus 4.6, with an updated Haiku model likely to follow in the coming weeks.

The launch comes with a new set of record benchmark scores, including OS World for computer use and SWE-Bench for software engineering. But perhaps the most impressive is its 60.4% score on ARC-AGI-2, meant to measure skills specific to human intelligence. The score puts Sonnet 4.6 above most comparable models, although it still trails models like Opus 4.6, Gemini 3 Deep Think, and one refined version of GPT 5.2.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/17/mistral-ai-buys-koyeb-in-first-acquisition-to-back-its-cloud-ambitions/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Mistral AI, the French company last valued at $13.8 billion, has made its first acquisition. The OpenAI competitor has agreed to buy Koyeb, a Paris-based startup that simplifies AI app deployment at scale and manages the infrastructure behind it.

Mistral has been primarily known for developing large language models (LLMs), but this deal confirms its ambitions to position itself as a full-stack player. In June 2025, it had announced Mistral Compute, an AI cloud infrastructure offering which it now hopes Koyeb will accelerate.

Founded in 2020 by three former employees of French cloud provider Scaleway, Koyeb aimed to help developers process data without worrying about server infrastructure — a concept known as serverless. This approach gained relevance as AI grew more demanding, also inspiring the recent launch of Koyeb Sandboxes, which provide isolated environments to deploy AI agents.

Before the acquisition, Koyeb’s platform already helped users deploy models from Mistral and others. In a blog post, Koyeb said its platform will continue operating. But its team and technology will now also help Mistral deploy models directly on clients’ own hardware (on premises), optimize its use of GPUs, and help scale AI inference — the process of running a trained AI model to generate responses — according to a press release from Mistral.

As part of the deal, Koyeb’s 13 employees and its three co-founders, Yann Léger, Edouard Bonlieu, and Bastien Chatelard (pictured in 2020), are set to join the engineering team of Mistral, overseen by CTO and co-founder Timothée Lacroix. Under his leadership, Koyeb expects its platform to transition into a “core component” of Mistral Compute over the coming months.

“Koyeb’s product and expertise will accelerate our development on the Compute front, and contribute to building a true AI cloud,” Lacroix wrote in a statement. Mistral has been ramping up its cloud ambitions. Just a few days ago, the company announced a $1.4 billion investment in data centers in Sweden amid growing demand for alternatives to U.S. infrastructure.

Koyeb had raised $8.6 million to date, including a $1.6 million pre-seed round in 2020, followed in 2023 by a $7 million seed round led by Paris-based VC firm Serena, whose principal Floriane de Maupeou celebrated the acquisition. For the firm, this combination will play a key role “in building the foundations of sovereign AI infrastructure in Europe,” she told TechCrunch.

In part thanks to these geopolitical tailwinds, but also due to its focus on helping enterprises unlock value from AI, Mistral recently passed the milestone of $400 million in annual recurring revenue. Koyeb, too, will be focused on enterprise clients going forward, and new users will no longer be able to sign up for its Starter tier.

Mistral didn’t disclose financial terms of the deal, and it is unknown whether other acquisitions are in the works. But speaking at Stockholm’s Techarena conference last week, CEO Arthur Mensch said Mistral is hiring for infrastructure and other roles, pitching the company to prospective employees as an organization that is “headquartered in Europe, that is doing frontier research in Europe.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Travis Brashears, Cameron Ramos and Serena Grown-Haeberli began collaborating at SpaceX, developing optical communications links that keep thousands of Starlink internet satellites in constant contact.

Now, the three engineers are co-founders of Mesh Optical Technologies, a Los Angeles startup that announced a $50 million Series A led by Thrive Capital on Tuesday.

Mesh aims to mass-produce optical transceivers, devices that convert optical signals from fiber or laser into electrical signals for computers. CEO Brashears, President Ramos, and VP of Product Grown-Haeberli realized the opportunity when designing a new generation of compute-hungry SpaceX satellites forced them to assess the optical transceiver market, and they saw its limitations.

Optical transceivers are particularly important for data centers aimed at training and operating large deep learning models, because they allow multiple GPUs to work in concert. One established U.S. supplier, AOI, won a contract worth $4 billion to provide components for AWS data centers last year.

“Someone will brag about a million GPU cluster; you have to multiply by four to five for the number of transceivers in that cluster,” Brashears explained.

The company’s goal is to manufacture a thousand units per day within the year so they can begin qualifying for bulk orders in 2027 and 2028.

The optical transceiver market is dominated by Chinese firms and suppliers, and Mesh sees an advantage in building its supply chain outside of that country. While trade restrictions haven’t impacted the market yet, the founders and their backers see themselves as getting in front of a national security dilemma.

“If AI is the most important technology in several generations (which we believe to be true), to have critical parts of AI data center capex run through misaligned/competitive countries is a problem,” Thrive Partner Philip Clark wrote TechCrunch. “In the immediate term, Mesh is solving our need for better ways to do interconnect if we want to keep scaling AI.”

The challenge for Mesh, the founders say, is executing lights-out, automated manufacturing techniques, which aren’t common in U.S. industry. So much of this expertise is concentrated in China that even European equipment suppliers expect Chinese customers — one German firm’s standard intake form asks for a Chinese company registration number.

By co-locating design and production, the founders hope to realize more efficient and lower-cost components. Their current design removes one commonly used but power-hungry component, which Ramos said could reduce GPU cluster power usage by 3% to 5%, a meaningful amount as hyperscalers seek to wring as much efficiency out of their systems as possible.

Data centers are just the beginning of Mesh’s aspirations; the company sees optical wavelength communications as the next paradigm in communications.

“The world has primarily focused on [radio frequencies] for a long time,” Brashears told TechCrunch. “We want to be at the precipice of transition from RF to photonics…we want to interconnect everything, and not just computers, but that’s where we’re starting.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When we talk about the cost of AI infrastructure, the focus is usually on Nvidia and GPUs — but memory is an increasingly important part of the picture. As hyperscalers prepare to build out billions of dollars worth of new data centers, the price for DRAM chips has jumped roughly 7x in the last year.

At the same time, there’s a growing discipline in orchestrating all that memory to make sure the right data gets to the right agent at the right time. The companies that master it will be able to make the same queries with fewer tokens, which can be the difference between folding and staying in business.

Semiconductor analyst Dan O’Laughlin has an interesting look at the importance of memory chips on his Substack, where he talks with Val Bercovici, chief AI officer at Weka. They’re both semiconductor guys, so the focus is more on the chips than the broader architecture; the implications for AI software are pretty significant too.

I was particularly struck by this passage, in which Bercovici looks at the growing complexity of Anthropic’s prompt-caching documentation:

The tell is if we go to Anthropic’s prompt caching pricing page. It started off as a very simple page six or seven months ago, especially as Claude Code was launching — just “use caching, it’s cheaper.” Now it’s an encyclopedia of advice on exactly how many cache writes to pre-buy. You’ve got 5-minute tiers, which are very common across the industry, or 1-hour tiers — and nothing above. That’s a really important tell. Then of course you’ve got all sorts of arbitrage opportunities around the pricing for cache reads based on how many cache writes you’ve pre-purchased.

The question here is how long Claude holds your prompt in cached memory: you can pay for a 5-minute window, or pay more for an hour-long window. It’s much cheaper to draw on data that’s still in the cache, so if you manage it right, you can save an awful lot. There is a catch though: every new bit of data you add to the query may bump something else out of the cache window.

This is complex stuff, but the upshot is simple enough: Managing memory in AI models is going to be a huge part of AI going forward. Companies that do it well are going to rise to the top.

And there is plenty of progress to be made in this new field. Back in October, I covered a startup called TensorMesh that was working on one layer in the stack known as cache-optimization.

Opportunities exist in other parts of the stack. For instance, lower down the stack, there’s the question of how data centers are using the different types of memory they have. (The interview includes a nice discussion of when DRAM chips are used instead of HBM, although it’s pretty deep in the hardware weeds.) Higher up the stack, end users are figuring out how to structure their model swarms to take advantage of the shared cache.

As companies get better at memory orchestration, they’ll use fewer tokens and inference will get cheaper. Meanwhile, models are getting more efficient at processing each token, pushing the cost down still further. As server costs drop, a lot of applications that don’t seem viable now will start to edge into profitability.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/17/european-parliament-blocks-ai-on-lawmakers-devices-citing-security-risks/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The European Parliament has reportedly blocked lawmakers from using the baked-in AI tools on their work devices, citing cybersecurity and privacy risks with uploading confidential correspondence to the cloud.

Per an email seen by Politico, the parliament’s IT department said it could not guarantee the security of the data uploaded to the servers of AI companies and that the full extent of what information is shared with AI companies is “still being assessed.”

As such, the email said, “It is considered safer to keep such features disabled.”

Uploading data to AI chatbots, like Anthropic’s Claude, Microsoft’s Copilot, and OpenAI’s ChatGPT, for example, means that U.S. authorities can demand the companies that run the chatbots turn over information about their users.

AI chatbots also typically rely on using information that users provide or upload to improve their models, increasing the chance that potentially sensitive information uploaded by one person may be shared and seen by other users.

Europe has some of the strongest data protection rules in the world. But the European Commission, the executive body that oversees the 27-member state bloc, last year floated new legislative proposals aimed at relaxing its data protection rules to make it easier for tech giants to train their AI models on Europeans’ data, drawing ire from critics who said the move caves in to U.S. technology giants.

The move to restrict European lawmakers from accessing AI products on their devices comes as several EU member countries reevaluate their relationships with U.S. tech giants, which remain subject to U.S. law and the unpredictable whims and demands of the Trump administration.

In recent weeks, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has sent hundreds of subpoenas demanding U.S. tech and social media giants turn over information about people, including Americans, who have been publicly critical of the Trump administration’s policies.

Google, Meta, and Reddit complied in several cases, even though the subpoenas had not been issued by a judge and were not enforced by a court.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">WordPress.com, the website hosting platform from Automattic, will now include a built-in WordPress AI assistant, the company announced on Tuesday. The feature is designed to work inside the website to understand its content and layout, allowing site owners to make changes with natural language commands.

With the new tool, you can adjust the site’s layout, its style, or other patterns by issuing commands to the AI assistant, and then see the changes reflected on the site as you work. These instructions don’t have to be precisely tailored prompts, either, the company notes. Instead, you can use more general language, like “make this section feel more modern or spacious,” “change my site’s colors to be brighter and bolder,” or “give me more font options that feel clean and professional.”

You can also direct the AI to add or adjust your layout, instructing it to do things like “add a contact page,” or “add a testimonials section below this section.” However, the company notes that its adjustments work with block themes, not classic ones. If you’re using the latter, the assistant won’t appear in the editor.

The WordPress AI assistant can update the site’s content, as well, like asking it to rewrite your bio to sound more confident, or translating a section into another language.

The AI can also function like an editor, offering headline suggestions, fact checks, and other grammar and editing suggestions. This aspect is available through the block notes editor that arrived in WordPress 6.9, where you’re able to collaborate with teammates in the editor. Now, you can pull the AI into that workflow by typing @ai followed by your requests. The AI will provide its answers here, including relevant links and other information where it cites external sources.

Meanwhile, for help with visuals, the assistant leverages Google Gemini’s Nano Banana AI models, which can be used to either make new images or edit existing ones. With the AI helper, available as a new “Generate Image” button in the Media Library, you can specify image requirements like aspect ratios or dictate image styles.

The company notes the WordPress AI Assistant is an opt-in feature users can enable if they choose. To do so, they will need to visit their Sites list once logged in, click their site name, and then Settings. Under settings, they’ll scroll down to “AI tools” and toggle the “Enable AI assistant” setting on.

Customers who purchase a website with the AI website builder will have the assistant enabled automatically.

            <div id="article-text">Which political party provides more federal funding for science? Given climate-denial rhetoric, attacks on expertise, the size of government, and culture-war battles over research, many Americans may believe that Democrats support science and that Republicans don’t.

But this is not what we have found. In research published last fall in Science with our colleagues Nic Fishman and Leah Rosenstiel, we analyzed a comprehensive database of federal science appropriations, collected from presidents’ budget requests, from House and Senate committee bills, and from final, enacted annual appropriations from 1980 to 2020. The data include 171 budget accounts across 27 agencies, such as National Institutes of Health, NASA, National Science Foundation, and CDC, as well as Pentagon R&D programs.

When Republicans controlled the House or the presidency, science funding was substantially higher—on average, about $150 million more per budget account under a Republican House than a Democratic one, and $100 million more under a Republican president than a Democratic one. These differences held up across dozens of statistical tests and weren’t explained by the overall size of the budget or economic conditions. We found significantly higher appropriations for NIH under Republican control, higher funding for CDC under Republican presidents, and marginally higher support for NASA and NSF.

For the past year, we have wondered if our paper had documented something purely historical—a pattern from a Republican Party that no longer exists. The Trump administration proposed slashing NIH by about 40 percent. It attempted to cap indirect-cost recovery—the portion of federal grants that reimburses universities for expenses such as facilities, compliance, security, and equipment—at 15 percent, threatening billions in research infrastructure. It stalled grants; cleared out agency leadership; imposed political approval requirements on funding decisions, such as requiring senior political appointees to sign off on grants before they could be awarded and terminating programs addressing racial health gaps; and implemented targeted funding freezes at particular universities. The postwar compact between government and science appeared to be collapsing.

Listen: Defund science, distort culture, mock education

But Congress—under Republican control in both chambers—has systematically rejected the administration’s most extreme proposals.

In the funding bill that President Trump signed into law this month, lawmakers not only declined to cut NIH’s budget by 40 percent; they instead increased it by roughly $415 million. They added targeted funding for cancer research, Alzheimer’s disease, and the BRAIN Initiative for the development of neurotechnologies. The final number: $48.7 billion—virtually unchanged from the prior year.

Just as important, Congress included detailed language constraining executive overreach. It reiterated that NIH cannot unilaterally change how indirect-cost rates work. It limited the agency’s ability to shift funds toward multiyear awards that crowd out new grants. It required monthly briefings to Congress on grant awards and terminations to ensure the allocated money is actually being distributed. And it directed NIH to continue to professionalize the hiring of institute directors, with external scientific input and congressional oversight.

Similar patterns hold elsewhere. NASA faces a 1.6 percent cut rather than the 24 percent the administration sought. The NSF budget dropped 3.4 percent instead of 57 percent.

The budget accounts in the database we analyzed track the recurring operating expenses allocated across all parts of the federal government for science and research, including science done through grant-making and contracting with corporations. They don’t follow outgoing grants to researchers directly, so the numbers do not capture the kinds of funding freezes the Trump administration imposed on universities including Harvard, Columbia, and Penn.

Even so, the Republican-led Congress behaved much more like our data predicted than like what Trump requested. The appropriators funded science, protected research infrastructure, and asserted control over how agencies operate. In this regard, they did what Republicans in Congress have done for decades.

The Trump administration’s hostility to science is real and deeply concerning. But it has not—so far—reset the Republican Party’s position on science funding in the way that Trump reshaped GOP stances on trade, immigration, or foreign alliances.

Science funding in the United States has been sustained not just by partisan enthusiasm but also by institutional structure. In our data, funding tracked with control of the House and the presidency, but not the Senate. That’s because the House majority controls the appropriations process. And Republican appropriators seem to have once again funded science not despite their priorities but because of them. Economic competitiveness, technological leadership, and national security all rest on a foundation of scientific advancement.

This outcome appeared improbable six months ago—to many, including us, it looked nearly impossible. This wasn’t a normal policy disagreement. It was a stress test. And the institution is holding. The 2026 funding package highlights the commitment of the Republicans in Congress to consistently fund science.

Staffing losses are real, leadership vacancies create drift, and political interference in grant decisions remains a serious threat. Budgets alone don’t guarantee a functioning research system. But treating the GOP as monolithically anti-science risks alienating a coalition that has historically sustained federal research. Scientists who want to protect funding should spend less time lamenting Republican hostility and more time engaging Republican appropriators—particularly in the House, where the funding decisions get made.

Science came under attack, and a Republican Congress pushed back. That’s not an aberration.</div>

            <h2>Europe Has Received the Message</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/02/european-union-defense-spending/685983/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The European Union is finally on its way to becoming a power in its own right. That’s not because its member countries have suddenly stopped squabbling or its bureaucratic inertia has melted away. It’s because the past four years have produced an unremitting state of crisis. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was the beginning. Now the imperative comes from Donald Trump’s repositioning of the United States as something close to an antagonist.

Without the guarantee of American cooperation and NATO protection, the EU is newly vulnerable. And in response, in the past year, it has delivered a series of firsts that amount to a quiet revolution in how it exercises power.

In May, the EU decided, for the first time, to help finance defense spending for its 27 member states by taking on EU-wide debt. This move came from the realization that even serious spending hikes in individual countries—European states have doubled their defense outlays since 2015—would vary widely given the economic disparities. Germany, for instance, plans to invest roughly $77 billion over five years, meaning that by 2030, its defense budget could be the world’s third largest. But that kind of spending is not possible for countries that already carry more debt, and confronting Russian President Vladimir Putin, potentially without U.S. backing, will require the rearmament of all. To this end, the EU has now established an extraordinary instrument, called Security Action for Europe, or SAFE, that is prepared to fund up to $178 billion in upgrades to the continent’s capacity to produce and procure arms.

Shane Harris: Europe is answering Putin’s challenge

For the first time, Europe will essentially protect its defense industry. “European preference” was long dismissed as a French fantasy. But that was when buying U.S. weapons was a premium that allies paid for American protection. Now Trump has signaled that the deal is off: He talks with Putin over the heads of the Europeans and has suggested that America’s NATO commitments are a fiction. So European states that use SAFE funding will be required to procure more European-made weapons and parts than not. That priority has also been written into Europe’s recently agreed-on $107 billion debt-financed Ukraine package, which restricts Kyiv to purchasing European-made arms to the extent possible.

In general, European countries are making a point of reducing their dependence on the United States. Germany currently plans to spend only 8 percent of its rearmament budget on U.S. arms. It is even developing its own satellite-communications network to replace Starlink. Most striking, European capitals for the first time seek to address the core of Europe’s dependence: the American nuclear umbrella. Germany and Sweden are in talks with France and the United Kingdom on a potential European nuclear deterrent. Poland and the Netherlands have expressed an interest in joining.

Europe is benefiting economically from all of these changes in defense posture. In equity markets, homegrown defense firms outperformed the top seven U.S. tech stocks last year. And the defense firms are productive: Germany’s Rheinmetall will soon be able to produce more artillery shells than the entire U.S. defense industry. And EU leaders are currently considering applying the “buy European” provisions that have helped boost arms manufacturing to other industries, such as digital services and green technologies.

The EU once defined itself as a champion of open markets. Today it’s reassessing that commitment in light of its need for self-reliance. Berlin is planning to exclude Chinese suppliers from its 6G network and is testing an open-source alternative to Microsoft. The French government has replaced Zoom with a domestic video-conferencing platform. Together with reducing its dependence on the United States and China, Brussels is cultivating other relationships. In recent weeks it has concluded far-reaching free-trade agreements with members of the Mercosur trade bloc (Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay) and India.

The way that Europe makes decisions is changing to meet the moment, and these changes are perhaps the most crucial of all the “firsts.” In the past, EU members had to unanimously agree before Brussels could adopt policies on matters of particular sensitivity. Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel fiercely defended this rule. But today’s leaders have come to accept that abandoning it is the price of geopolitical relevance. In December, the EU invoked an emergency legal provision to bypass the unanimity requirement in order to freeze Russian assets indefinitely. That same month, the EU approved its debt-financed Ukraine package, also without unanimous approval: Hungary, Slovakia, and Czechia were pushed to opt out rather than veto it.

Anne Applebaum: Trump’s ‘American dominance’ may leave us with nothing

Europe is not yet a fully autonomous power, and it won’t become one tomorrow. But thanks to Trump, a transformation is under way. With each new first, others become thinkable. The decisive question is whether Europe can stay this course. A super-election year looms in 2027, when France, Italy, Spain, and Poland will all hold votes. Victories by the far right—especially in France and Poland—could derail the current trajectory.

Or not: EU approval is at 74 percent, a record high. Young far-right politicians may well understand that returning to the nation-state means choosing powerlessness.

This may be the outcome that leaders in Washington, Moscow, and Beijing prefer. But in their effort to fragment Europe into pliable nation-states, they are instead galvanizing its slow-motion march toward self-determination.</div>

            <h2>American Kids Used to Eat Everything</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/2026/02/picky-american-kids-food/685956/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The most striking passages in Picky, a forthcoming book by the historian Helen Zoe Veit, describe the way famous 19th-century American figures ate as children. I found myself gripped with envy as I read—not because the foods were particularly appetizing, but because I would kill for my kid to eat like that.

To wit: As a girl, Edith Wharton adored oyster sauce, turtle, stewed celery, cooked tomatoes, and lima beans in cream. Mark Twain fondly remembered eating succotash, string beans, squirrels, and rabbits on his uncle’s farm. And during her childhood, Veit writes, Elizabeth Cady Stanton “happily ate vegetables, hickory nuts, and cold jellied brain.”

If these don’t sound like typical “kid foods,” that’s because they aren’t, and weren’t. “Kid food,” as a category, is a recent invention. According to Veit, American kids weren’t picky until the early 20th century. (Indeed, the word picky came into widespread usage around then.) Before that, Veit writes, children in the United States ate “spicy relishes, vinegary pickles, wild plants, and a huge variety of animal species and organ meats. They slurped up raw oysters and looked forward to their daily coffee.” Fennel seeds and tomatoes were considered treats.

According to Veit, the idea that kids are naturally neophobic, or wary of new tastes, is a myth. Eating like a child, Veit explains, was once understood to mean being overly excited and undiscriminating about food, not being picky. In the 1860s, a doctor wrote that children generally ate “anything and everything.”

Veit’s book recounts how kids went from eating jellied brain to consuming, like my toddler, little but macaroni and cheese. A big part of the story, as she tells it, is that American kids used to be hungrier at mealtimes—which meant that they were more eager to eat anything. Before the 20th century, many children did hours of chores both before and after school, so they worked up a good appetite. (Maybe Twain was hungry for those string beans because he spent so much time hunting wild turkeys and clubbing pigeons to death.) Few kids snacked between meals, because processed foods weren’t widely available. In addition, parents tended to be confident that children could learn to like most adult foods. If a child didn’t like a given meal, they generally wouldn’t be offered an alternative, because, due to a lack of refrigeration, no other food was on hand. But after a series of societal changes in the 20th century, Veit writes, “the children were less hungry. The food was less delicious.” And pickiness was born.

First, children’s appetites waned because they became less active. As more Americans moved into cities and more families bought cars, fewer kids walked miles to school or performed farm chores. This coincided with a major shift in the American diet. Thanks to pasteurization and stepped-up government regulations, milk became much safer to drink in the 20th century, and food experts began to see it as essential. The standard recommendation for children in the 1930s and ’40s was a quart of milk a day—or roughly 600 calories of it. All that milk made kids less hungry for solid foods. Doctors eventually lowered their recommendation to two to three servings of dairy a day, but by then, snacking had emerged as another hunger dampener: Food companies began manufacturing snack cakes, cereals, and cookies, and suggesting that parents buy special foods for their kids.

Meanwhile, a misguided, Progressive-era public-health campaign encouraged parents to serve their children “easily digested” food such as eggs, broths, and gruel. Because child-nutrition experts at the time had little knowledge of germ theory, they claimed that rich and flavorful foods were the culprits for children constantly getting sick, and thus advised that kids should be given only bland foods with few condiments. Children’s foods, they said, should be seasoned with just salt, onion juice, or a “splash of milk”—even butter was considered too rich by some. Nutritionists no longer recommend giving kids bland food, but the idea that children should eat different foods than adults nevertheless stuck.

Advice to parents on how to address pickiness in their children also shifted over time. Prior to the ’40s and ’50s, Veit writes, the standard guidance was to just let food-refusing children go hungry until the next meal. But mid-century experts such as Clara Davis and Benjamin Spock suggested that children instinctively choose a healthy diet on their own, without their parents’ prodding. In fact, they argued without evidence, parents who urge children to try a bite of fish, say, might make them hate fish and turn them into picky eaters. All of this gave the impression that a good mother is one who presents a plate of food and sits silently by as her child pokes at it half-heartedly; if he refuses the meal, she offers something else.

This is still a common way of thinking—at least on social media. In my feeds, parenting influencers warn against putting “pressure” on kids to eat things they’re reluctant to try. They say that you shouldn’t let a child who has rejected a food go hungry until the next meal or use dessert as a reward for eating dinner. Instead, as one influencer puts it, you should enthusiastically comment on the food yourself—this is crunchy; this is green—a performance that, when observed by your child, might “invite them to their plate and their food.” Laura Ingalls’s Ma would never.

These changes in food options and advice have created a country in which the majority of kids’ daily calories come from ultra-processed foods. American kids today eat so poorly, Veit writes, that they are actually getting shorter. At the same time, she notes, “parents are exhausted by the struggle” of getting picky eaters to eat. (And some parents, of course, can’t afford to buy their kids food that they won’t eat.) She reassures parents that pickiness is not their fault. But it often feels like it is.

My son, Evan, became picky the way people go bankrupt: gradually, then suddenly. I distinctly remember him eating peas and coleslaw as a baby, but over time he grew less and less adventurous. Now, at nearly 2, pretty much all he eats is pasta.

My husband and I tried many of the tricks suggested to me by friends and by the internet. We’ve tried telling him that beans are pasta. (He begs to differ.) We’ve tried blending vegetables into his pasta sauce. (Tolerated up to a point.) We’ve tried giving him a small amount of his “safe food” (pasta) along with some new foods to try. (He eats only the pasta and then screams “more papa!” until we relent.)

Veit’s recommendations to reduce pickiness differ from these solutions, and some of them seem, well, more hard-core. She suggests restoring that appropriate feeling of hunger at mealtime by limiting the amount of snacks and milk that children have between meals. She recommends “affectionately and persistently” encouraging the child to try a rejected food at the same meal, including, perhaps, by “popping a small amount of food into her mouth when she’s distracted.” Crucially, she argues, parents should not offer alternative foods if a child won’t eat a meal.

Even reading that last one felt shocking. Forcing Evan to eat what I make, or else to go hungry, seems so wrong. I was a kid once, after all, and I hated it when adults pressured me to eat things I didn’t like. Sure, every day I slather him in sunscreen as he screams, and I shove a toothbrush between his locked little jaws, but I can’t bring myself to have a standoff over spinach.

When I called Nancy Zucker, a Duke psychiatrist who works with extremely picky kids, she told me that she agreed with some of Veit’s techniques but not others. She endorsed having set snack times that don’t interfere with meals—kids thrive on knowing, “This is when we eat, this is when we don’t eat,” she said. And she acknowledged that children probably have more sophisticated palates than adults may think; many of her patients, she said, are actually craving flavor.

Read: The drink that Americans won’t give up without a fight

But she cautioned against Veit’s other recommendations. Goading a child to eat more of something they don’t like may make them feel frustrated and recalcitrant, not excited to eat, she said—as can popping something into their mouth unexpectedly. And some kids can’t be starved into eating a rejected meal just because there’s no alternative. For some kids, “the hungrier they get, the more irritable they get, the more anxious they get, and the more rigid they get,” Zucker said. She’s known parents whose kids refused to eat for so long that they wound up in the emergency room for dehydration.

Zucker’s guidance to her patients depends on the specifics of the family she’s working with. But for many of them, her first step is to encourage families to restore positive associations with food and eating: having fun grocery shopping or cooking together, without expecting that the kid will become an instant cauliflower convert. She also thinks parents should reconsider how they engage with their kids at the dinner table. For many families, she said, mealtime is “like a sports commentary, where parents are constantly, ‘Take a bite of this!’” She asked, “Would you be having fun if you were the kid?” Instead, she suggests “letting the kid just kind of eat and experiment with the food.”

Since reading Veit’s book, I’ve tried some of her strategies and have been pleasantly surprised. One day, I withheld a snack after day care even as Evan hopped around the kitchen yelling “Mama, cookie!” He ate a bit of salmon that night and sampled some broccoli before spitting it out. Another night, pushing dinner a half hour later made him proclaim that a homemade soup—with visible chicken pieces—was “tasty.” But when he completely rejects an entire dinner, I still heat up something I know he’ll like. Eventually, I want him to eat oysters, but for now, I just want him to be full.

            <div id="article-text">Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.

I look forward to the cover of each issue of The Atlantic as much for the artistry as for the bold message it conveys. “The Unfinished Revolution,” however, struck me as, dare I say, revolutionary. I have the privilege of working with middle-school students, many of whom are learning about the American Revolution for the first time. Although we stress the importance of history’s “forgotten” heroes—in this case, the women, African Americans, and Native Americans without whom the efforts of the great men of the era would surely have failed—there are few, if any, images depicting them as equal to Washington or Jefferson. How inspiring for our young learners to see, in looking at Joe McKendry’s exquisite tableau, faces that reflect their own. I typically treasure old issues of The Atlantic, but this cover I’ll remove to display in a seventh-grade classroom.

Rick Atkinson’s “The Myth of Mad King George” is a timely reminder that history is nuanced and rarely divides neatly between villain and victim. George III was not mad; he was methodical, conscientious, and tragically certain that duty and inflexibility were synonymous.

The American colonists’ decision to frame their rebellion as a quarrel with a man rather than a system was brilliant from a public-relations standpoint, if not exactly honest. By aiming their indictment at the King, the Founders converted constitutional disputes into a moral crusade. They could preserve their identity as Englishmen defending their rights even as they repudiated England itself. As Carl N. Degler wrote in Out of Our Past: The Forces That Shaped Modern America, the American Revolution was radical in its political outcome but socially moderate. It left intact many of the hierarchies it claimed to overthrow, because tyranny had been embodied in a single sovereign, not the structures that sustained him. Perhaps this helps explain why the Founders could prevent the radical promise of the Declaration from extending to African Americans and Native Americans.

I’ve long considered myself a patriotic progressive, so I greatly appreciated George Packer’s “America Needs Patriotism” and its lament over how many Americans have lost a love of their country. When I attended a recent “No Kings” march, I was surprised to see that by far the most ubiquitous symbol was the American flag. I saw big flags waving in the air, tiny lawn flags carried by moms and kids, flag bandannas, flags on T-shirts, and flags as capes, including one pinned with a sign that read This Flag is Anti-Fascist. Where was this constellation of red, white, and blue? San Francisco. This was quite a contrast to the 2003 peace marches against the U.S. invasion of Iraq, where an American flag among the protesters was as common as a necktie at a rock concert. Perhaps Donald Trump has had at least one salutary effect on American civic culture: He’s convinced even the left to embrace the Stars and Stripes.

George Packer implies that the left is as culpable as the Trumpian right for deep skepticism about expressions of patriotism. But he seems to conflate three different positions: (1) belief in core values such as liberty, equality, and democracy; (2) flag-waving support for, or loyalty to, one’s own country; and (3) a belief in America’s “essential decency.”

It is perfectly reasonable to be skeptical of nationalism—to be, as Thoreau put it, citizens of the world first, “and Americans only at a late and convenient hour.” You don’t have to believe America is decent; you can be critical of the disturbing and sometimes horrific qualities that America has represented over much of its history but still offer a full-throated defense of democracy, equality, and other values that should be aspirational for people everywhere.

As the president and CEO of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation at the time of the 1994 slave auction, I took particular interest in Clint Smith’s article, “What Is Colonial Williamsburg For?”

The idea of reenacting a slave auction originated with Colonial Williamsburg’s African American Interpretation Department, whose director, Christy Coleman, approached the foundation’s leadership and said that her team was not only ready to put on the reenactment, but wanted to do it. Knowing that it would be controversial, we agreed that the reenactment would be based on records of actual slave auctions conducted in Virginia during the period, and that we would make it part of our educational programming. I gave her team my blessing.

On the morning of the program, after The New York Times published a story about our plans, representatives from the Virginia branches of the NAACP and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, as well as local ministers and others who wanted the reenactment canceled, asked to meet with me. I listened carefully and told them that I appreciated that they had come. I explained that the reenactment was something that our African American–interpretive staff wanted to do, that we thought it was the right thing to do, and that we had committed to the staff and the public that we were going to do it. I reminded them that our mission was educational—we were doing this not to sell tickets, but to teach.

They listened but told me that they still planned to attend and protest. Several blocked the stage before the program began, but when the audience of 2,000 began to boo, all except one protester stepped down. Christy and her colleagues worked the program around him. The other protesters remained silent.

We did the slave auction only once; it was simply too emotional an experience for the staff. I fielded some complaints from donors, and lost a few, but never regretted the decision. It was the right thing to do.

I was particularly interested in John Swansburg’s article on “Rip Van Winkle” because Cornelius S. Van Winkle—who originally published Washington Irving’s The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.—was the brother of my great-great-great-great-grandfather Peter Van Winkle.

Family lore has it that Irving got into some sort of heated disagreement with Cornelius, and got revenge by bestowing the Van Winkle name on his main character—a man unflatteringly described as having, among other things, an “insuperable aversion to all kinds of profitable labor.”

While I have no idea if there’s any truth to this hilarious tale, it’s worth noting that my Van Winkle ancestors were among the first Dutch settlers in this country, having arrived less than two decades after Henry Hudson sailed upriver in 1609. They came to live in present-day Albany, Rensselaer, and Hudson and Bergen Counties. I’ve always been proud to trace my roots directly back to the founding of our great nation, regardless of my connection to its founding folktale. In his article, Swansburg writes that, by the end of the story, Rip has “become a link to the past, a living connection to the history that predates the Revolution.” I look forward to rereading “Rip Van Winkle” and once again hearing what he has to say.

Two days after we received the November issue, my wife, Cindy Whitman, a retired history teacher, completed a diorama version of Joe McKendry’s cover painting. She customizes Playmobil figures and found objects to make scenes to display in libraries and children’s museums.

In this month’s cover story, “What’s the Worst That Could Happen?,” Josh Tyrangiel reports on how artificial intelligence will change the American job market. The new technology has the potential not just to make workers more efficient, Tyrangiel argues, but to render many of them obsolete. For our cover image, the artist Stephan Dybus evoked both the marvels of AI and a looming threat for which the American economy, and democracy, may not be prepared. — Paul Spella, Senior Art Director

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">“I don’t like erasures,” the novelist Toni Morrison told a Princeton audience in 2017. She had been asked what she thought about Confederate statues, then being torn down throughout the South. Leave them up, she said: “Talk about the offense. You know, put another statue next to it and say the opposite.” Hang a noose around its neck, she added. The audience laughed nervously, but she wasn’t kidding.

The moderator quickly moved on to another question, so Morrison kept the rest of her views to herself. After 11 novels, many of them prizewinning, and a wealth of essays and literary criticism, she was a monument in her own right—a canonical American writer awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1993—and monuments aren’t supposed to stir up trouble. In any case, she had laid out her theory of cultural preservation in the 1970s, a more experimental era than ours.

In a brilliant essay called “Rediscovering Black History,” she tells a story about racist statuary and the NAACP. The civil-rights organization had booked a hotel for a convention on the condition that two statuettes of Black jockeys be removed from the lobby. “The hotel management reluctantly agreed,” Morrison reports, “but before the statuettes could be temporarily removed, they were draped with sheets.” Morrison’s reaction to the incident was, and still is, remarkable. She did not criticize the management; she chided the NAACP for forgoing the opportunity to honor a little-known instance of Black accomplishment. Never mind that the statuettes were meant to be demeaning. Better to mine an artifact for history than conceal it for fear of white contempt:

The provocation was sheer Morrison. Part of her genius lay in the ability to discover meaning where no one else imagined it could be found. She set out to write her first novel, The Bluest Eye, in the early 1960s because “it was a book I wanted to read, and I couldn’t find it anywhere,” she told an interviewer in 1988. That book, published in 1970, was about a young Black girl dealing with severe family dysfunction and incest. “Vulnerable young black girls were profoundly absent” from American literature, she recollected in an essay about working on Beloved (1987), her most celebrated novel. “When they did appear, they were jokes or instances of pity—pity without understanding.”

Morrison wanted traces of Black history to be safeguarded regardless of their source, because she was “keenly aware of erasures and absences and silences,” she writes in that essay. She once said in an interview that she felt a responsibility toward the millions who died during the Middle Passage: “Nobody knows their names, and nobody thinks about them.” Their stories were not even preserved in the usual repositories of collective memory, such as folktale, song, and dance, Morrison speculated, because those who crossed the Atlantic with them would have been loath to share their memories. To the degree that these legions of the dead are remembered, it is as pure absence.

From the August 2025 issue: Clint Smith on how Toni Morrison changed publishing

When the history was available, Morrison was struck that much of it was unspeakable. In a 1987 essay about 18th- and 19th-century slave narratives, Morrison notes that the authors often cut their stories short “with a phrase such as, ‘But let us drop a veil over these proceedings too terrible to relate.’ ” They didn’t want to scare off the audiences they hoped to convert to abolitionism. As a 20th-century Black novelist, Morrison’s job was to “rip that veil.” The task daunted her. How could she know what it was like to have an iron bit shoved into one’s mouth? She also worried that she wouldn’t be able to resist the urge to idealize the victims, scrubbing them of flaws. Nothing could be more fatal to a work of fiction.

Above all, Morrison worried about turning characters, especially slaves, into objects of voyeurism. How could she write about obscene violence and abjection without arousing a prurient response? She didn’t want to produce what some people now call “trauma porn.” The difficulty redoubled when she tried to write about Black self-perception. In her foreword to The Bluest Eye, a novel about self-loathing, Morrison recalls struggling to sabotage the “despising glance”—white disparagement refracted through Black self-loathing—even as she re-created it.

Nonetheless, in novels about slavery, segregation, and racism—both the kind that comes from the outside and the kind that is internalized—Morrison channeled the Black experience to extraordinary effect. An awareness of absent ancestors prickles through her writing, but at the same time, her fictional worlds feel solid and present. Her characters do not lack agency; they are not made heroic; she did not write trauma porn. How did she avoid those traps? How do you represent the unrepresentable without betraying it?

Morrison never stopped thinking about the trick of evoking erasure and undoing it at the same time. In On Morrison, an incisive study of Morrison’s main works, Namwali Serpell calls this theme the “paradox of representation.” An English professor at Harvard and the author of two acclaimed novels, The Old Drift (2019) and The Furrows (2022), Serpell combines a professorial breadth of reference and a novelist’s fascination with the mechanics of literature. Her erudite digressions and granular readings add up to a kind of literary procedural. Plus, every so often, she fangirls: The novelist did not suffer fools; she could be high-handed. “Morrison’s imperiousness never failed to electrify me,” Serpell confesses.

To be clear, On Morrison is a work of criticism, not a biography. Morrison hoped that nobody would write one, and Serpell was happy not to. She has an argument to make. Morrison envied African novelists their freedom not to explain Black life to white people, Serpell writes, and to avoid “that omnipresent fog, the white gaze,” Morrison invented a uniquely Black aesthetic. Its sources lay in Black cultural practices—Black music and humor; masking; “signifying,” or competitive insulting; and so on. Serpell identifies a different cultural mode influencing the form of each work she considers.

Jazz (1992), for instance, reproduces the music’s swing and improvisational flow. Serpell highlights what Morrison does with sound and rhythm, such as when her sentences glide and trill in dreamlike riffs, then chop themselves up: “A colored man floats down out of the sky blowing a saxophone, and below him, in the space between two buildings, a girl talks earnestly to a man in a straw hat. He touches her lip to remove a bit of something there. Suddenly she is quiet. He tilts her chin up. They stand there.” The dominant device in Sula (1973) is an “ironic bluesy tone”—irony understood in its most basic sense, as saying the opposite of what one means. Serpell shows the novel proceeding from one seeming contradiction to the next: laughter that comes from both amusement and pain, the surname Peace for a family that has none, a mother’s mercy killing of her son.

Even as the forms of Morrison’s novels change, though, she is always trying to give voice to silence. Serpell introduces that theme in the chapter on The Bluest Eye, asking, “What would it look like to crack the quiet open, to break absence into pieces, to subject a void to rupture?” The void takes the shape of Pecola Breedlove, an 11-year-old girl raised without affection or care, who, over the course of a year in the early 1940s, is hollowed out even further by loneliness, racism, and abuse. The title derives from her deepest wish, born of the conviction that her dark skin makes her ugly: She yearns to have blue eyes. Her story is told by Claudia, looking back as an adult on that year, when she was 9 and her family took Pecola in. Claudia’s family is intact, barely scraping by but rich in love, and she has a constant companion, her sister, Frieda. The novel brightens when they come into view, and they make us painfully conscious of everything Pecola is deprived of.

Watch how Morrison evokes presence and absence at the same time in her description of the Breedloves’ bleak storefront apartment. Its furnishings

From the loss of a penny or brooch, Morrison proceeds to a deficit of life itself: “No one had given birth in one of the beds—or remembered with fondness the peeled paint places, because that’s what the baby, when he learned to pull himself up, used to pick loose.”

Pecola responds to her misery by trying to undo herself. When her parents fight loudly, she shuts her eyes and imagines herself disappearing, body part by body part. The parents themselves have long since come undone. Benumbed by extreme poverty and the wounds of Black childhood in Jim Crow America, they live in a state of complete isolation. In other words, the Breedloves have experienced social death.

The Bluest Eye could have been an “identitarian sob story,” Serpell writes, but “this emphasis on absence—the void, the vacuum, the vanished; the failed, the silenced, the missing” holds the bathos at bay, and elevates the novel to a work of art. Morrison, though, did not think it succeeded. In her foreword, she writes that she had been concerned that the fragile Pecola would be shattered by her circumstances, which would “lead readers into the comfort of pitying her rather than into an interrogation of themselves for the smashing.” And indeed, after Pecola is raped and impregnated by her father, her situation becomes so extreme that she seems beyond the reach of empathy. “It didn’t work,” Morrison writes. “Many readers remain touched but not moved.”

In The Bluest Eye, Morrison struggled to unite the there and not-there in the same figure: Claudia had occupied the positive pole, as it were, and Pecola, the negative. Four novels later, in Beloved, Morrison came up with a conceit that fused the two: a ghost.

Beloved opens in Ohio in 1873, a decade after Emancipation, though half of the novel is a flashback to life on a plantation in Kentucky in the 1850s. The work confronts the bodily and psychic horrors of slavery and its aftermath. Morrison based her main character, Sethe, on an escaped enslaved woman whom she had read about in a newspaper clipping from 1856, shortly after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act. The woman had fled Kentucky with her four children. When she was captured in the free state of Ohio, she tried to kill them and herself rather than let them all be taken back. She managed to kill only one child, a little girl, before she was stopped. That is Sethe’s backstory too. Now, 18 years later, Sethe and a surviving daughter live on the property where the murder took place, and they are haunted by an angry spirit.

The ghost in Beloved was not Morrison’s first spectral being. Pecola’s parents are in essence zombies—the walking dead. Song of Solomon (1977) has at least one ghost, a father who has been murdered in front of his young children, who wind up alone and homeless in the woods. But he is just a fleeting apparition who leads them to shelter. Beloved  ’s ghost occupies the foreground. It hurls furniture with the strength of a poltergeist and has substance enough to press handprints into cakes. Passersby hear its shrieks and moans from the road. All of this happens even before it takes human form.

Ghost stories defamiliarize worlds we think we know; Morrison uses the uncanny to make slavery feel real, rather than abstract. Possession is an apt metaphor for enslavement. “To be possessed can mean either to be taken over by a ghost or a spirit, or to be owned like an object,” Serpell writes, just as chattel slaves were. Morrison disorients readers from the very first line: “124 was spiteful.” What does that mean, a spiteful number? The author throws one startling image after another at us—“baby’s venom,” a shattered mirror, a kettleful of chickpeas steaming on the floor—before we begin to understand what the phrase refers to. “I wanted the reader to be kidnapped, thrown ruthlessly into an alien environment as the first step into a shared experience with the book’s population,” Morrison writes in the foreword to Beloved.

Ghosts blur the lines between past and present, life and death, destabilizing the order of things. Beloved ’s revenant defies the dictates of realism according to which a character is a bounded individual. The wraith materializes in the body of a young woman, but she is ambiguous as to number. She may be one; she may be many. She might be the ghost of Sethe’s murdered child, now grown up. Or she may not even be dead, but rather a living wreck of a girl who has been chained up in a white man’s house since childhood, presumably as a sex slave. She may be both. Or more than both.

She may even be one of those lost ancestors; she has memories of what seems to be the hold of a slave ship—Morrison’s reimagining of the underworld. The girl crouches because there is no room to stand. Along with everyone around her, she is being mummified by hunger and dehydration: “If we had more to drink we could make tears.” While “men without skin” (white people) push corpses overboard, the living strain to become ghosts themselves: “We are all trying to leave our bodies behind.” Beloved is sometimes identified as a work of magical realism, but it feels more like a religious novel—the religion being Afrodiasporic and syncretic. “If my work is to confront a reality unlike that received reality of the West,” Morrison writes in an essay, “it must centralize and animate information discredited by the West”—the kind of information, she adds, that is “dismissed as ‘lore’ or ‘gossip’ or ‘magic’ or ‘sentiment.’ ”

Among the many ironies characterizing the work of this writer so attentive to irony is that she adds even as she subtracts. Beloved ’s ghost is being and nonbeing, the chimerical in the flesh. And yet for all Morrison’s pains to make us feel the reality of unreality, her prose is rich in concrete pleasures. Serpell observes that even Pecola thrills to eruptions of beauty on a familiar rundown street that otherwise go unseen. “She owned the crack that made her stumble,” Morrison writes; “she owned the clumps of dandelions whose white heads, last fall, she had blown away; whose yellow heads, this fall, she peered into.” A passage in Sula in which two girls becoming friends lie together in the grass is a gorgeously corporeal yet delicate picture of teenage-girl intimacy. Their foreheads are “almost touching, their bodies stretched away from each other at a 180-degree angle. Sula’s head rested on her arm, an undone braid coiled around her wrist. Nel leaned on her elbows and worried long blades of grass with her fingers.”

Serpell doesn’t deliver a big takeaway. That isn’t her style. Her gift is reading closely. Notwithstanding her expert use of modern critical terminology, she belongs to the old-fashioned school of appreciation. She wants us to understand how difficult Morrison is. “She is difficult to read. She is difficult to teach,” Serpell writes on the first page of the book. I applaud her nerve. It’s a rare critic writing for nonspecialists who would deliberately discourage them like that. Serpell gives us Morrison the Black particularist, who is much less accessible than we may have thought. The point needs making. Morrison despised the notion that her writing achieved “universalism”—“a code word that had come to mean ‘nonblack,’ ” she once wrote. But I think Serpell overstates the difficulty. Morrison’s writing functions on many levels; her surfaces can be as rewarding as her depths.

Read: The exhibit that reveals Toni Morrison’s obsessions

My favorite story about how artists make something out of nothing appears in her foreword to Beloved. Morrison has just quit her job and is allowing herself to feel “free in a way I had never been, ever,” which leads her to thoughts of slavery. She sits on her porch with a view of the Hudson River, rocking in a swing and looking at the giant stones that serve as a breakwater. Enter the ghost: “She walked out of the water, climbed the rocks, and leaned against the gazebo. Nice hat.” In the essay recalling the writing of Beloved, Morrison tells the same story, this time in the academic mode. Having just remarked on how, as a student, she felt stymied by the gaps in Black history—“silences that I took for censure”—she notes that when she became a novelist, “the interstices of recorded history” became a place of liberation. That is where she finds “the ‘nothing’ or the ‘not enough’ or the ‘indistinct’ or ‘incomplete’ or ‘discredited’ or ‘buried’ information” that sets her imagination in motion. I can’t think of any writer in our time as rich as Morrison in negative capability.

The solution of course is to just raise the prices of mud, pennies and bananas so the rubes that bought magic copper wires don&#39;t feel so stupid.

Just picking nits.... but is there any other type of mud than &#39;wet&#39;?  Otherwise it&#39;s just dirt, no?

We&#39;re now charging PREMIUM for our new ProAudiophile(tm) MUD interface. Guaranteed or your money back!

It&#39;s about shooting farther in the pissing contest when two audiophiles talk about their system, and then it turns into a price contest because if you can&#39;t actually get better quality, at least you can say you paid for it.

So long as the conductor conducts and only adds minimal inductance / capacitance - anything is fine.  You will just be power limited with poor conductors.  That being said, conductors with higher resistance can pick up more external noise.  This is because the low impedance signal is no longer low impedance.  But in a clean environment this will not be an issue.

The article explains it poorly, but from the image it appears that the signal being referred to is the signal between audio source and amplifier.

Before my time in computers I was in auiio recording engineer and similar work.   So many times rookie engineers and musicians come in wanting to use our vintage microphone on cranked guitar amp and drums and we&#39;d say no.    They&#39;d whine so we would say okay we&#39;ll do a blindfold test you can tell the different you can use the vintage mic&#39;s.  They never won.  Same with musicians on overpriced speaker and guitar cords, they could never tell the difference.   We did tests on cables the super high priced and th

So, next time I need an extra guitar patch cable, if I have a spare banana laying around, I don&#39;t need to run to Guitar Center.

Which AI company is getting these drives? The one that tells people to walk to the car wash to get your car cleaned, or the one that makes blatant ripoffs of Marvel movies?

28GB/s under conditions that will never be met for more than a few seconds at a time given most enterprise workloads isn&#39;t nearly as interesting as getting 200k IOPS+ sustained random reads for arbitrary lengths of time, and that&#39;s something that&#39;s theoretically possible even on PCIe gen 3, albeit not on any drives that currently exist.

Not necessarily.  Suppose there are 10 different checkboxes for &quot;normal.&quot;  Then if everyone has one item abnormal, randomly distributed among items, then 90% of people are 90% normal, 90% of people have something abnormal, and for each criterion, 90% of people are completely normal.

Yeah, shoulders tend to give a lot of trouble.  The shoulder joint has the widest range of motion of any joint in the body, and its tendons are not well-served by blood vessels, so healing tends to take a long time.  I had adhesive capsulitis (aka &quot;frozen shoulder&quot;) starting in the beginning of 2023 and it was miserable.  It took about 18 months to resolve and even now I have slightly limited mobility in my left shoulder, though it doesn&#39;t affect my daily activities.

I too had adhesive capsulitis in both shoulders, one right after the other. One of them took more than 2 years to stop hurting, and the healing is so slow that I really can&#39;t say when it occurred. I just vaguely remember putting some clothes one day and suddenly noticing &quot;hey! my shoulder doesn&#39;t hurt anymore.&quot;

You don&#39;t get an MRI unless you have a problem.  99% of the people who got MRI because they had a problem were shown to have a problem visible on MRI.

This is nothing more than yet another propaganda attempt to save money on medical tests.

They didn&#39;t start with people who had sought MRIs. They started with a huge cohort of people who have volunteered to have their health studied (since 2000). People from this cohort were randomly selected and invited to join the study.

In 2022, the Health 2000 database was reviewed to identify all individuals eligible for the FIMAGE study. To be eligible, participants had to meet the following criteria: (1) prior participation in the Health 2000 survey, (2) valid consent for the Health 2000 follow-up, (3) ability to communicate in Finnish or Swedish, (4) ambulatory status, (5) maximum age of 75 years at the time of sampling, and (6) residence within the catchment areas of the 5 university hospitals, ensuring reasonable access to a 3-Tesla (3T) MRI facility.  You will note that &quot;has shoulder problem&quot; is not one of the criteria.  The study population: A total of 602 participants (median age, 58 [range, 41-76] years) underwent clinical shoulder examination and bilateral shoulder MRI and were included in the study. Of these, 313 (52.0%) were females and 289 (48.0%) were males. At the time of the research visit, 110 participants (18%) reported current shoulder symptoms. Among the asymptomatic group, 294 participants (60%) reported a previous history of shoulder symptoms  So 18% reported current shoulder symptoms, and of those who didn&#39;t, 40% reported having no history of shoulder symptoms.

I have a maga type friend who swears the spike protein in the covid vaccine damaged his shoulder joint.  This story is going to take off like wildfire for the most annoying reasons.

MAGA types (I know a few, plus my mom is one) specifically blame the &quot;spike protein&quot; for all sorts of random ailments. And, what&#39;s doubly weird is - it&#39;s only if it was associated with the vaccine, not with the Covid-19 virus itself.

My mom has been sick with actual Covid a couple times... but, when she&#39;s trying to pin the blame for some ailment or other on something, her go-to is the vaccine&#39;s spike protein &quot;floating around in her blood&quot;.

I actually do have shoulder problems, from a combination of a motorcycle accident and regular jujitsu. They told me I needed to reconstruct the shoulder. I put it off, and started combat sports instead... my shoulder no longer hurts (generally) and I&#39;ve got (mostly) full range of motion and strength.

In contrast, I suffered with lower back pain for years, and it got to the point where I was immobilized. MRI scans showed nothing.

The problem in most cases is usually muscular-skeletal interaction. Not the bones

For decades the surgeons  have checked out people with back pain, found slipped or decaying discs, an declared that the problem.  Then they do horrific things like vertebral fusions.Problem was/is that there&#39;s no database of Xrays/CT/NMR scans of people *without* back pain to see how many have bad discs

Knees too. Really all joints. It turns out that things like cartilage tears and other &quot;abnormalities&quot; are not great indications of dysfunction or pain. I can understand how we got here. It seems obvious when tissue looks damaged in an image that something must be wrong- especially when surgeons can go back and &quot;fix&#39; the tear so it looks right again in an MRI. Procedures are also cash cows (especially ones that can be done en masse by outpatient surgery centers), so there is a huge built-in incentive to deal

Steal until you have it all, then hire a security guard.

The part about copyright comes before the amendments.

The laws have changed but the constitution has had it as available from the start.

Depends on what you mean.  Through the 1950&#39;s and into the 1960&#39;s the US refused to recognize copyrights on works that were first published in foreign countries.

Yeah, this is hilarious - a communist regime that once thought nothing about intellectual property, until they discovered that they have some that they&#39;d like to monetize

yes, the US is investing in being awesome by legislating having to repeat &quot;I&#39;m awesome&quot; as often as possible, making saying &quot;I&#39;m not awesome&quot; come with real consequences

The thing is, copyright, trademark, and patent are all useful laws...when in the proper proportion.  Unfortunately, the powerful always want to extend them beyond all reason.  E.g., the term of a copyright should be related to the up-front costs of developing the item patented.  No law has EVER done that, or even really tried to do so.  (It&#39;s probably hopeless to try, as the rewards for gaming the system would be too large.)

Give me the mainland for a nerve job any day. Fix you right, mate

Communism:  What is yours is mine, and what is mine is mine.

â¦now stealing from itself. I blame the perverse incentives and totalitarian government structure. When the Chinese throw off their retched leaders, real honesty and business can be done.

Only tactile feedback has any hope of keeping your eyes on the road while using the dash.

It&#39;s not as convenient for a dynamic interface... but as a driver your job is to keep the car, its occupants, and the world around it safe, not to choose the next song you want to hear.

Push-button activated voice command is a nice alternative.

Our infotainment is the worst. Everybody says so.

This is why things like climate control being physical controls makes sense, you can reach over without looking and turn the dial to increase/decrease temperature without looking.   For audio, I use voice control or on steering wheel for almost everything, or save changes to pre-sets for when I am out of traffic.

I once had a Mazda crossover as a rental car. I only made that mistake once.

It&#39;s crazy how in every other car I had no problem doing something like changing a radio station while driving and not diverting attention from the road. But it was nigh impossible in the Mazda. I swear those cars were purposely built to enrage me. Never have I hated a car so much, for that and other reasons.

Have you actually used their infotainment? It is not good at making sure you keep your eyes on the road.

&quot;Hey mazda&quot; (or whatever) &quot;turn the temporature up to 20 centigrade on the drivers side&quot;

&quot;Would you like to navigate to ... Tempup?&quot;

The mazda dial works well, their voice control however sucks rocks and then some, it truly is abysmal, so unless they&#39;ve improved it in the new CX5 then there are going to be lots of unhappy drivers.

&quot;We don&#39;t make money from that, so it can&#39;t be an option.&quot;

I wonder what money they make from Apple and Google, because Android Auto works fine in my MX-30.

As for the rest of the controls, I don&#39;t mind using the control knob instead of touchscreen. One less screen to keep clean from smudges I guess.

I don&#39;t want a touch screen, I want buttons. Buttons for my hvac, buttons for preset stations, buttons for my heated seats, buttons for my everything.

I have never touched the touch screen on my BMW. I either use voice controls, buttons on the wheel, or the physical buttons and nobs provided. Who wants to clean a greasy screen?

You forgot the obligatory &quot;Get Off My Lawn!&quot; .. so here it is.

And  yes, BUTTONS and DIALS are best for drivers.

The alternative is voice and steering wheel controls, but I don&#39;t like either as much as dials and actual buttons.

I remember it took BMW a lot of development efforts to get the i-drive system right. Early model years were not good. But now they work really nicely.

Mazda tried to do the same thing on the cheap, had much worse results, and then decide that doubling down on the digital shit is the way to go apparently.

Unless they reverse this bad decision, I don&#39;t see Mazda existing much longer.

Buttons are best for core vehicle functions, but touch screens are better for music/nav.

Mazdas isn&#39;t. I&#39;ve driven recent models of both makes and the mazda voice control is next to useless - unless you speak slowly and carefully one of a limited set of phrases it understands (preferably while the car is stationary as noise kills the system dead) which means you have to memorise them, then you&#39;ll get nowhere. BMW meanwhile is a lot more freeform and usually gets it correct.

The new rivian has really cool steering wheel input devices that do good things. Mazda wasn&#39;t wrong, they just did it wrong.

i have a knob on the console and some options to scroll through.  i haven&#39;t fully utilized the features yet.  what part are people saying sucks again?My BMW has the same scroll wheel setup and I&#39;ll take it over a touch screen any day.  Fortunately I also still have physical controls for all the important things, otherwise neither would be an acceptable alternative.

If you use CarPlay, the default settings won&#39;t let you touch the screen to do anything, so you have to bounce around the UI with the scroll wheel, and with the latest CarPlay the active item is gray, and the inactive items are green. I don&#39;t know who signed off on that, but they should be fired.

You can enable [mazdausa.com] the touchscreen while the vehicle is in motion.

Because a touchscreen and no buttons will definitely make it safer. Looks like they&#39;re only just getting familiar with the idea of touchscreens while their competitors are 10 years ahead having already done the homework on touchscreens and many of them reverting back to physical buttons for actual safety.

The UI is terrible, but it&#39;s because it had too few buttons, not too many.  You cannot easily, for instance, channel-surf through FM radio.  And even once you finally figure out the horrible menus you need to navigate to get a screen where you can channel-surf through FM radio with considerable difficulty (while parked somewhere, if you value your life!), you can&#39;t use the display for anything else while you&#39;re doing it, and you have to be very careful not to make any wrong moves lest you end up somewhere e

Right as other manufacturers realize physical buttons are good actually and are changing back:

https://www.businessinsider.co... [businessinsider.com]https://www.autoblog.com/news/... [autoblog.com]

A button-less design allows the whole product line to use one infotainment unit.  Year on year improvements are software only. Features can vary by model without needing different hardware.  I think this is all a manufacturing cost thing.

I have never heard someone ask for a touch screen replacement for physical buttons. They don&#39;t work with all gloves. They don&#39;t work well when dirty.  They require much more time with your eyes off the road. There is no customer benefit to this, only manufacturing cost.

&quot;We will be back! We will reclaim the title!&quot;

I own a Mazda with the center console scrollwheel.  It is completely awesome.  No reaching whatsoever, and very easy to navigate.  It should be a model for everyone else.   It got high praises when first introduced.  Nothing has changed.  This sounds like they just want to lower the cost of the car by getting rid of the wheel, button and associated wiring.    I&#39;m planning on a replacing my current Mazda with a slightly used one anyhow, which will still have the scroll wheel.    Unbelievable. So dissapointed at Mazda.

The fact that they were charging $2/conversation is interesting. My Eliza Bot could very slowly bankrupt them.

$2 per conversation is INSANE.I hope these are the most insightful, life changing conversation.

Cause I used the chat bot of a subscription service yesterday and it&#39;s so bad I decided to call and wait 2 hours on the phone instead.

Clearly the paywalled article business model is dead.

>AI agents don&#39;t sit in chairs, and they don&#39;t need licences.

Yeah, right. I don&#39;t think so. If it is using the software, it is going to need a license. Multiple agents, multiple licenses. It&#39;s not hard.

In many cases it&#39;s &quot;multiple copies running&quot; and that&#39;s been a thing for decades. Each agent is going to need another copy running any time it&#39;s using the software. If you want to have all the agents queue up all of their requests and then have a single worker process serve all of them then you might reduce the number of licenses used, but it won&#39;t necessarily reduce them to 1 depending on the load. And this sort of thing has already long been done, with workers in specific rules doing all of a certain type

A CEO who&#39;s woken up to the realisation that all this useless AI costs heaps of money for even the simplest of tasks?

Sounds like the only reason why this article was written was to cosy up the public to pay more soon.

The AI investment pond must be drying up very quickly out there, with sheer desperation for any returns.

I want one article that states clearly and unambiguously what tasks Ai is replacing human workers on.

And the world&#39;s smallest violin, played by a tardigrave, is the music.

SaaS was *always* a terrible idea for anyone but the rent-seekers.

We’re coming up on a big national anniversary, the (defiantly unspellable) semiquincentennial. To get in the spirit of things, I’ve been curled up with books about the founders, particularly George Washington, someone I became acquainted with when I wrote a book about him many years ago. But meanwhile, our current president has been honking away in the distance—a man difficult to abide and impossible to ignore.

Despite the glaring differences between Washington and Donald Trump in character, judgment, and historical significance, there are some interesting similarities. Born rich. Aggressive acquirers of real estate. Big-house guys. Thin-skinned, image-conscious. Extremely nationalistic: Trump’s message is Make America Great Again. Washington’s was … Make America.

So why will history judge them as polar opposites? In part because Washington readily and repeatedly gave up power. He did so conspicuously at the end of the War of Independence, then again after eight years as president. He lived in an era in which selflessness was considered one of the core virtues of a great leader, and at crucial moments in our history, he behaved accordingly.

Whereas Trump … well, he’s no George Washington. And he tells us so! He is instinctively royalist and brazenly self-aggrandizing. He repeatedly claims powers he does not legally have. He promiscuously puts his name on everything this side of the moon, and I probably shouldn’t even mention that particular satellite, lest he get ideas.

His decision to appoint himself as chair of the Kennedy Center was outrageous enough, but then he put his name on the place. He also put his name on the United States Institute of Peace, just a few blocks away. His face is all over D.C. now, on huge banners hanging from government buildings. He wants Dulles International Airport named for him, and also Penn Station. His open campaigning for the Nobel Peace Prize was plenty dismaying, but then he threw one of his tantrums when he didn’t get laureated and, in an official letter to the leader of Norway, demanded Greenland in compensation. At this point, we know that Trump is going to be Trump, and if anything, he leans into the narcissism, becoming Trumpier by the day. Trump has learned that his most flamboyantly selfish behavior will likely be ignored or forgiven by his base and political allies. There is no one willing to tell him that You Can’t Do This.

Our nation was founded upon the principle that power derives from the people. We don’t like despots and dictators and monarchs or anything smacking of royalty. That was why the founders were very careful when they crafted the Constitution: The president is just one branch of government, is constrained by checks and balances, and can always be given the heave-ho.

Which takes us back to George Washington. Everyone knew he was going to be the first president—he was right there in the room, presiding, when the founders drew up the Constitution. But they were taking a chance, because no one really knew what a president was. Such a thing didn’t exist anywhere in the world. George Washington had to define the role through his actions.

What modern historians know is that selflessness didn’t come effortlessly to Washington. He had to will it, in tension with his natural, human desires.

This is a subtlety of Washington that Americans weren’t taught in elementary school, and I don’t think the A.I. bots have quite figured it out. A schoolkid asking an A.I. program for help with an essay about Washington will probably get highlights of the man’s consequential life, the first-in-war, first-in-peace stuff, and perhaps learn that he was an enslaver who, like the other founders, failed to end the vile institution of human bondage. But the child is unlikely to find out what Washington was really like. Here’s what ChatGPT produced when I asked it to “write an essay on George Washington’s personality”:

George Washington was a man of great integrity, character, and leadership. His personality was marked by a strong sense of duty, humility, and selflessness. … Despite his many accomplishments and successes, he remained humble and never sought accolades or praise for himself.

Oh, balderdash. Yes, Washington was indeed a man of integrity, character, and leadership. That led him to behave selflessly at critical moments during the founding of our country. But Washington desperately wanted to be a great man, and wanted to be remembered as such. He craved the approbation (one of his favorite words) of his peers and guarded his image as though it were the front line of a war. He sought, as multiple biographers have put it, “secular immortality.”

He didn’t wander into greatness: he pursued it, willed it, achieved it. He had a “monumental ego,” in the words of historian Joseph Ellis. Peter Henriques, an admirer of Washington who has recently published two insightful books on his character, writes that Washington “was not a ‘selfless’ man or one who was simply engaging in disinterested service. Rather, a pattern emerges of a man who was deeply ambitious, massively concerned with his reputation, and in regular search of the public approbation, even as he denied such desires.” This is not revisionist history. This is the man as he really was. Washington is so tied up with the narrative of American greatness and exceptionalism that some people may think it’s wrong to probe him too deeply. Why not just salute and move on? As Alexis Coe put it in her recent biography, “We haven’t been taught to think critically about Washington.”

His avaricious acquisitions of western lands is well known and not incidental to his desire to break from Great Britain, which had tried to limit western migration. When I wrote my book The Grand Idea, about Washington and his Potomac River schemes (he thought it would surely be the great commercial highway to the West), I was a bit shocked at his imperious behavior when he traveled across the mountains into what is now western Pennsylvania and confronted poor farmers who (he alleged) were squatting on his land. He sued them. He forced them to pull up stakes. He could be pretty high-and-mighty, and certainly not exactly a small-d democrat.

And yet his drive, his ambition, his hunger for glory were essential to the enterprise of wresting the colonies from the grip of distant overlords. And his desire for secular immortality didn’t mean he was pretending to have lofty republican sensibilities. He was anti-monarchical to the core.

Washington curated his reputation and polished it for the eyes of future generations. Shortly before his death, he wrote a will that broke apart his vast estate, including more than 50,000 acres of land, and set in motion the freeing of the enslaved people under his legal control (delaying manumission until the death of his wife). These were actions very consciously taken with the eyes of history upon him. He knew that slavery would be a permanent stain on his reputation. And he was right.

Early biographers helped advance the image of a godlike Washington. Most famously, Parson Weems invented from whole cloth the story about young Washington taking a hatchet to his father’s cherry tree, then confessing to it. The early chroniclers, including John Marshall (who fought under Washington’s command and later served as chief justice of the United States), delivered to the public the kind of man that the fragile young nation desired: an unblemished father figure, preposterously virtuous.

Go to the Capitol rotunda and look up at the dome, where Constantino Brumidi’s fresco The Apotheosis of Washington, painted during the Civil War, shows Washington in heaven, flanked by goddesses. You have to strain to see him, way up there, high above this mortal coil. He’s a remote figure, unapproachable. Not like us.

Washington cared a lot about appearances and made sure that he presented himself as a formidable, dignified figure, not someone you’d slap on the back on a whim. He liked a bit of pomp and pizzazz as president. He was meticulous in ordering well-made clothes, and a “chariot” with some gilding wouldn’t be too excessive, he thought. But he had to be careful. If he acted too much like royalty, he’d get spanked by his peers and excoriated by anti-Federalist newspapers. “No Kings” was not just a protest sign in those days.

Human nature has not changed. There have always been people who desire wealth and power. They are never infallible or immune to misjudgment. What changes and evolves are the political ecosystems. Laws change, as do values, societal expectations, the means of communication, the technologies of political life. The norms. Norms can erode.

Trump, the opposite of an enigma, constantly tells us exactly who he is. He reveals this in late-night social media rants (“SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”) and unguarded conversations caught on tape (“When you’re a star, they let you do it” and “I just want to find 11,780 votes”).

He is at least consistent in his message. He tells us, over and over, This is all about me. So of course when Rob Reiner and his wife were murdered, Trump immediately said the killings were linked to Reiner’s political opposition to him. His solipsism is nonnegotiable.

Historians will have an overwhelming job of compiling and organizing the confetti of royalist declarations from this president, but let’s simplify their work a bit. The most important moment, the defining one, is obvious: Trump refused to accept that he lost the 2020 election and—another example of action defining character—urged the vice president and an unruly mob to halt the peaceful transfer of power. That’s as un–George Washington as it gets. Washington knew he was part of something bigger than himself. He had helped create a nation, but it didn’t belong to him. So after eight years fashioning the office of the presidency, he did something simple and exemplary: He went home.

            <div id="article-text">It&#39;s like the movie Inception, but without Leonardo DiCaprio, unless you imagine him. Researchers used carefully timed sound cues to nudge dream content, and in some cases, boost next-morning problem solving. Could dreamtime product placement come next?

The team, based at Illinois&#39; Northwestern University, used a technique known as targeted memory reactivation (TMR) to trigger dreams of puzzles that sleep study participants were unable to solve while awake. According to their findings, among the 12 of 20 participants whose dreams incorporated the cued puzzles, solving rates rose from 20 percent to 40 percent - still not a majority, but a statistically significant jump.

The TMR technique used in the study involved playing certain audio cues while participants tried solving the puzzles in order to associate each puzzle with a specific sound. Researchers then played the sounds linked to unsolved puzzles while participants slept, hoping to prompt recall during dreaming and improve next-day solving.

In other words, the team was trying to determine whether the idiom of sleeping on a problem would actually help participants find a solution, and it appears there&#39;s some truth to that.

The researchers also found that the effect held among the 12 of 20 participants whose dreams incorporated the cued puzzles, even when they were not lucid - that is, not consciously aware they were dreaming or deliberately steering the dream.

The team recruited people with prior lucid-dreaming experience because they are better able to control dream content and search for insight while asleep, but participants were not consistently lucid during the cued dreams.

&quot;Even without lucidity, one dreamer asked a dream character for help solving the puzzle we were cueing,&quot; lead author of the paper Karen Konkoly, a researcher at Northwestern&#39;s Paller Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory, said of the findings. The results, she added, &quot;showed how dreamers can follow instructions, and dreams can be influenced by sounds during sleep, even without lucidity.&quot;

Of course, any study like this has to be taken with a heap of salt - the sample size was only 20 people, and the researchers admit that their attempts to link dreaming to creativity and problem solving are limited.

&quot;This study design did not allow us to disentangle whether creativity is an inherent function of dreaming versus whether this benefit emerges when combined with pre-sleep intention,&quot; the team noted in their paper. &quot;Further, given that participants could not be fully blinded from the purpose of the study, we cannot rule out the influence of demand characteristics.&quot;

We reached out to Konkoly to get her take on whether a similar technique could be used to influence people to dream about particular products in a bid to place ads inside dreams, and while we didn&#39;t hear back, there is evidence that it&#39;s been tried before.

Back in 2021, Molson Coors Beverage Company rolled out an unorthodox advertising campaign that invited consumers to try dreaming about Coors. Shut out of running a traditional national Super Bowl ad because of beer-category exclusivity rules, the brewer pitched the stunt as an alternative way to appear during the Big Game.

The Coors Dream Project directed users to a campaign website featuring visual and audio stimuli, including an eight-hour soundscape designed to play while participants slept, which the company said would “shape and compel your subconscious ... to dream the Coors Big Game ad.”

The company claimed in press material that trial runs successfully led to volunteers dreaming about &quot;refreshing streams, mountains, waterfalls, and even Coors itself.&quot;

Coors said it was using a technique known as targeted dream incubation in its ad campaign, and that technique gets mentioned in the Northwestern paper as the topic of a prior project Konkoly worked on.

According to that research, reported in October 2025, &quot;dream incubation and TMR can increase dream incorporation of real-world memories.&quot;

It&#39;s unlikely that such techniques could be used on consumers without them noticing at this point, given how such a scheme would require the hijacking of an internet-connected device to play trigger sounds while folks slept. Still, maybe mute that charging smartphone next time you turn in. ®

            <h2>React survey shows TanStack gains, doubts over server components</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/17/react_survey_shows_tanstack_gains/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Devographics has published its State of React survey, with over 3,700 developers speaking out about what they love and hate in the fractured React ecosystem.

React, originally sponsored by Meta, is a JavaScript library but not a complete framework, the result being that developers using React have a lot of choices when it comes to React-based frameworks and tools. The complexity of the ecosystem is a problem. &quot;Getting a build and testing harness and CI system and IDE tools to all play nicely together is reliably a nightmare,&quot; complained one respondent.

Despite such concerns, React usage remains high and may grow further thanks to AI. &quot;With generative AI&#39;s reliance on existing codebases in order to spew out new code, could React become even more entrenched?&quot; asks Devographics writer Sacha Greif, introducing the survey, which is sponsored by companies including Google, JetBrains, and Algolia.

React API top pain points according to the 2025 State of React survey. Note that forwardRef was deprecated in React 19

Next.js, which once looked set to become the standard choice for full-stack React, is widely used but not particularly beloved. Eighty percent of respondents have used it, but 17 percent have a negative sentiment, with most complaints focused on excessive complexity and too-tight integration with its main sponsor, hosting company Vercel. &quot;Vendor lock in, complex APIs, and too much noise in the Next.js ecosystem make it a no-go for me,&quot; said one comment. Still, 27 percent ticked the box for positive sentiment, so opinion is divided.

If Next.js declines, the winner may be TanStack. TanStack Query, used for data fetching, has 68 percent usage, 42 percent positive sentiment, and just 1 percent negative. TanStack Start, a full-stack framework using React, Solid.js and the Vite build tool currently in release candidate phase, is used by only 15 percent, probably because it is in preview, but liked by nearly half of those who use it or have heard of it.

TanStack is an open source project created by Tanner Lindsey, co-founder of SEO (search engine optimization) rank tracking company Nozzle. In March 20025 it was sponsored by hosting company Netlify as an alternative to &quot;bloated, over-abstracted frameworks,&quot; perhaps with Next.js in mind. TanStack is focused on type-safety using TypeScript and file-based routing.

There are several TanStack sub-projects, in varying states of readiness. Alongside Query and Start, others include the TanStack DB data store (beta), TanStack AI (alpha) and TanStack CLI (command line interface), including an MCP (model context protocol) server for use by AI agents.

Both Next.js and TanStack Start implement React Server Components, but respondents to the survey are not all convinced that React belongs on the server as well as in the browser. &quot;Completely not interested in this feature,&quot; said one. The cool response to both server component and server functions is described by the survey authors as &quot;troubling for a set of new APIs that was supposed to pave the way towards React&#39;s next big evolution.&quot;

Another newish feature, the React Compiler, fares better, with 62 percent of respondents stating their enthusiasm for it. &quot;We can stop littering our code with useMemo and useCallback,&quot; said Aurora Scharff, certification lead and React educator, in her conclusion to the survey.

Respondents are also positive about the planned React Foundation, introduced in October 2025 to maintain React&#39;s infrastructure and organize its main event, ReactConf.

Like Greif, Scharff notes that for AI-assisted coding, &quot;React has ... become the default output when you prompt for UI.&quot;

Despite its pain points, the future popularity of React seems assured. ®

            <h2>European Parliament bars lawmakers from using AI tools</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/17/european_parliament_bars_lawmakers_from/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The European Parliament has reportedly turned off AI features on lawmakers&#39; devices amid concerns about content going where it shouldn&#39;t.

According to Politico, staff were notified that AI features on corporate devices (including tablets) were disabled because the IT department could not guarantee data security.

The bone of contention is that some AI assistants require the use of cloud services to perform tasks including email summarization, and so send the data off the device – a challenge for data protection.

It&#39;s a unfortunate for device vendors that promote on-device processing, but the European Parliament&#39;s tech support desk reportedly stated: &quot;As these features continue to evolve and become available on more devices, the full extent of data shared with service providers is still being assessed. Until this is fully clarified, it is considered safer to keep such features disabled.&quot;

The Register contacted the European Parliament for comment.

Data privacy and AI services have not been the greatest of bedfellows. Studies have shown that employees regularly leak company secrets via assistants, and on-device AI services are a focus of vendors amid concerns about exactly what is being sent to the cloud.

The thought of confidential data being sent to an unknown location in the cloud to generate a helpful summary has clearly worried lawmakers, which is why there is a blanket ban. However, the issue has less relevance if the process occurs on the device itself.

The Politico report noted that day-to-day tools, such as calendar applications, are not affected by the edict. The ban is temporary until the tech boffins can clarify what is being shared and where it is going.

The European Parliament has scrutinized AI over recent years and has enacted the world&#39;s first legislation specifically designed to address perceived risks from the technology. The ban, alongside guidance to steer lawmakers away from using the services for Parliament business, is more about fears about where the data could end up than anything specific about AI.

The guidance also advised against granting third-party AI apps broad access to data, which seems a sensible instruction regardless of where a user works. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The AI hype cycle has officially reached the toilet, with a Japanese bathroom giant suddenly being pitched as a serious tech play.

Activist investor Palliser Capital has taken aim at Japanese loo legend Toto, urging the firm to make more noise about its little-known chip components business and arguing the maker of the &quot;Washlet&quot; – described by the company as &quot;the original shower toilet&quot; – is quietly sitting on a flush of value tied to the AI boom.

In a statement to The Register, Palliser confirmed it had taken a stake in Toto but didn&#39;t comment on specifics, beyond saying it&#39;s a &quot;top 20 shareholder.&quot;

In a newly published presentation, the investment firm called Toto &quot;the most undervalued and overlooked AI memory beneficiary,&quot; saying the company has evolved into a &quot;strategically critical semiconductor materials innovator and supplier.&quot;

The UK-based fund says the company&#39;s advanced ceramics arm produces electrostatic chucks used in cryogenic etching tools for 3D NAND manufacturing – niche but essential kit that helps hold silicon wafers steady. The ceramics are designed to remain stable at extremely low temperatures, helping to clamp wafers in place as memory chips become increasingly layered and finicky.

Palliser argues the business is central to next-generation chip production and says the segment now contributes more than half of operating profit, underscoring how much of Toto&#39;s real value sits far from the bathroom showroom.

With AI infrastructure spending still in full froth, it seems anything with even a whiff of exposure to memory chips is being hauled into the spotlight. Palliser reckons Toto&#39;s valuation gap is largely down to investors not fully appreciating what&#39;s going on behind the bathroom door, putting the disconnect at about ¥554 billion ($3.6 billion).

The fund says fixing disclosure, tightening capital allocation, and improving capital efficiency could unlock &quot;well over 55 percent upside&quot; for shareholders – a pitch that essentially boils down to telling the market there&#39;s more to this outfit than heated toilet seats. Palliser says the factors behind the valuation gap are &quot;readily solvable&quot; if the company leans harder into the story and backs the business appropriately.

When the market starts pitching a toilet maker as an AI infrastructure bet, you can&#39;t help but wonder whether the hype has finally gone fully down the drain – or whether investors are just determined to squeeze every last drop out of the boom before someone eventually pulls the chain. ®

            <h2>Dear Oracle, we need to talk about the future of MySQL</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/17/mysql_foundation_oracle_letter/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A group of influential users and developers of MySQL have invited Oracle to join their plans to create an independent foundation to guide the future development of the popular open source database, which Big Red owns.

The group aims to establish a nonprofit foundation to support the MySQL community and wants Oracle to help form the plans as the owner of the MySQL software and trademark.

A number of companies that support and develop systems based on MySQL are supporting the initiative. The open letter to Oracle inviting it to take part in plans to create an independent foundation to govern MySQL has attracted around 100 signatures at the time of writing.

The group sees the plan as the best way to address a number of challenges facing MySQL, which became popular among internet startups in the early 2000s. MySQL was part of the LAMP stack commonly used for internet services at the time.

However, some users and developers are concerned about its future. The group representing them has signed a document setting out the challenges MySQL now faces. They include the declining popularity and market share of MySQL as new projects and younger developers are more likely to use PostgreSQL. As such, it has become difficult to attract new developers to MySQL, they argue.

Under Oracle&#39;s management, MySQL&#39;s development lacks transparency and largely takes place behind closed doors through private code drops, &quot;with limited visibility into the roadmap or decision-making,&quot; the group letter said.

At the same time, security-related bugs are now publicly tracked, &quot;leaving users unable to verify whether known issues affect them.&quot; The letter said many developers suspected Oracle was prioritizing proprietary enterprise features and HeatWave over the community edition.

Next, it is difficult for the user community to contribute code. Although technically possible, the process is opaque and frustrating. The group also argued that MySQL lacks features that should be standard on a modern database, such as vector search often used to support AI applications. Lastly, the group was concerned that the developers behind MySQL were getting older and too few new developers, students, and professionals were coming on board.

&quot;To address these systemic issues, we propose the formation of a vendor-neutral, nonprofit foundation. This entity would serve as a shared home for the ecosystem, independent of any single company&#39;s commercial interests. A foundation isn&#39;t just paperwork; it is a practical, proven structure to fix the issues above,&quot; the statement said.

Vadim Tkachenko previously worked for MySQL AB, the Swedish company that developed the database before it was bought by Sun Microsystems, later acquired by Oracle. Also CTO at open source consultancy Percona, he is speaking for the developers and users behind the open letter.

Tkachenko told The Register that the community wanted to give Oracle time to consider whether to take part in the initiative, setting a deadline of the end of March. If the group has heard little of note from the tech giant by that time, it may move ahead without the vendor.

&quot;We need to give Oracle some space,&quot; he said. &quot;If Oracle give us a signal that they want to work together, then it is not a strict deadline, but if we just hear nothing from Oracle, then I don&#39;t think we have the luxury of time to wait significantly longer again, because of the risk of falling into irrelevance is getting greater every quarter.&quot;

Last week, Oracle promised a &quot;decisive new approach&quot; to MySQL. Big Red, which acquired MySQL with Sun Microsystems in 2009, said MySQL has new engineering leadership at the company and &quot;a clear vision for 2026 and beyond.&quot;

In the post, Frederic Descamps, Oracle MySQL community manager, promised a new era of community engagement from the vendor. He said Oracle would take a three-pronged approach, firstly by introducing developer-focused features into the open source MySQL Community Edition. He said Big Red also planned to &quot;extend and enrich&quot; the developer community by offering more tools, frameworks, and connectors for MySQL.

However, Tkachenko said the Oracle MySQL team is &quot;in chaos right now.&quot; Descamps has since announced his departure to become community manager for the MariaDB Foundation, itself based around a fork of MySQL. Meanwhile, Oracle has not appointed a vice president to head up MySQL development, he claimed.

Oracle has been offered the opportunity to comment.

Percona co-founder and MySQL performance expert Peter Zaitsev, who also signed the letter, said news of the shift from Oracle had not been enough to stop the group setting its own timetable.

&quot;We need to understand what Oracle will actually be able to execute. We believe, especially in this case, when Oracle makes these promises, there should be an independent organization of MySQL users to keep Oracle accountable. We have to have somebody who can speak in a single voice and say, &#39;Oracle, you did this, you didn&#39;t deliver, and that is not OK, right?&#39;&quot;

He added that the group wanted to see a wide group of companies invited into the MySQL development community.

&quot;If you go to mysql.com, you find nothing which is not Oracle. This is very different from something like PostgreSQL, where you come and you see all the PostgreSQL vendors out there having an even playing field. In modern open source, if you&#39;re doing something great in the MySQL space, you should have a vehicle to get it out there,&quot; he said.

MySQL&#39;s founding developer, Michael &quot;Monty&quot; Widenius, last year said he was &quot;heartbroken&quot; on hearing the news of job losses at Oracle&#39;s MySQL engineering team, while the system has seen a dramatic fall in the number of commits to the project.

The coming months will show if Oracle has an answer for those who want to reverse the trend. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The UK&#39;s long-promised &quot;Single Trade Window&quot; has quietly run out of steam after burning through more than £111 million ($150 million), with officials confirming the program has been &quot;brought to early closure.&quot;

Freedom of Information (FOI) responses obtained by TaxWatch and shared with The Register suggest the flagship border digitization scheme is effectively on ice. HM Revenue & Customs says there are no staff working on the project and no spending on it this financial year, despite total costs reaching £111.44 million. The Treasury has gone further, saying the program was &quot;brought to early closure,&quot; even as officials insist policy work continues somewhere in the background.

&quot;The delivery of the Single Trade Window (STW) for the financial year 25/26 has been paused,&quot; the FOI response reads. &quot;As a result, there are currently no HMRC staff assigned to the operational delivery of the STW programme, nor has any expenditure been incurred for its delivery during this period.&quot;

In a separate document seen by The Register, HMRC also confirmed the technical delivery contract, awarded to Deloitte, has been closed, another sign the program is effectively defunct despite years of promises that a one-stop digital portal for traders was just around the corner.

The STW was supposed to make import and export paperwork less of a slog by allowing businesses to submit data once rather than switching between government systems. Ministers long pitched it as a cornerstone of post-Brexit border modernization, part of the plan to build the &quot;world&#39;s most effective border.&quot;

The government handed Deloitte the border technology contract in 2023, but the National Audit Office later warned HMRC it needed to be a stronger &quot;intelligent client&quot; when dealing with major suppliers – a warning the latest disclosures suggest didn&#39;t get much traction.

TaxWatch, an investigative think tank focused on tax compliance and policy, said the episode is a reminder of how messy large public sector IT projects can get – and why transparency matters when they do. In a post on Tuesday, the group noted that while HMRC remains remarkably efficient overall, collecting nearly £1 trillion in revenue last year at a cost of about £5.7 billion, big transformation projects still have a habit of going sideways.

&quot;The UK&#39;s tax and customs administration remains amazing value for money,&quot; TaxWatch director Mike Lewis told The Register. &quot;But it&#39;s also the case that most major projects, at HMRC and elsewhere, end up having costs and delivery times considerably greater than first envisaged. Contractors failing to deliver a key border project doesn&#39;t bode well at a time when HMRC is trying to tackle major challenges to trade taxation.&quot;

Businesses that had hoped the system would eventually smooth border processes and cut down on admin are unlikely to be thrilled, despite officials insisting the program has merely been paused and that policy development is ongoing. With no delivery staff, no active spending, and the main contract wrapped up, the reality looks a lot like a project that has slipped quietly into limbo.

&quot;If there&#39;s no spending, no staff working on delivering the project operationally, and traders haven&#39;t been given any indication about when it&#39;s coming, then it&#39;s very difficult to read that as anything other than the project being cancelled,&quot; Lewis said.

The broader lesson, according to TaxWatch, is not that HMRC is failing, but that major digital transformations need clear accountability when they falter. The UK&#39;s tax and customs system underpins everything from public services to national defense, making it essential that the government learns from costly missteps rather than quietly moving on.

&quot;Quietly shelving a key tax and trade project, while ministers continue to tell Parliament it&#39;s still on its way, prevents lessons being learned,&quot; Lewis concluded. ®

﻿The opt-in AI assistant can generate images, edit and translate text, and reorganize WordPress sites.

Starting on Tuesday, WordPress users can edit their websites using the new AI assistant built into the platform’s site editor and media library, TechCrunch reports. The AI has a sidebar in the WordPress site editor where users can ask it to edit and translate text, generate and edit images using Google’s Nano Banana, and make adjustments to their sites like creating new pages or changing fonts.

Users can also interact with the AI through the new block notes feature WordPress added in its 6.9 update in December, which allows users to leave comments in the site editor. By tagging the AI assistant with “@ai” in block notes, users can give it prompts like asking it to edit a specific block of text or suggest a headline.

To try out the AI assistant, users have to manually enable it by going into their site’s settings and toggling on “AI tools.” Sites that were made with the AI website builder WordPress launched last year will have AI tools enabled by default.

﻿The Lens Lizard is an aftermarket upgrade kit that keeps your car’s backup camera clean and actually usable.

A Vermont-based startup has announced a new upgrade kit that adds a remotely triggered backup camera cleaner to your car. The Lens Lizard system might seem like an unnecessary luxury to some, but if you deal with ice and snow obscuring your backup camera every winter, or live somewhere remote with dirt roads mucking up your ride, the upgrade will save you from having to frequently clean the camera yourself.

Its creators are making the Lens Lizard available through a Kickstarter and those who back the crowdfunding campaign can preorder a kit discounted to $99. Full retail pricing is expected to be closer to $149 while shipping will start in April 2026.

The NHTSA has mandated backup cameras on new vehicles since 2018, but cleaning systems aren’t common and can be costly. You can find them on vehicles from Subaru, Toyota, and VW, but the feature is frequently part of more expensive trim packages. The Lens Lizard is an aftermarket upgrade that’s compatible with “most North American vehicles” as long as the backup camera is located above the rear license plate.

One of the reasons the Lens Lizard is limited to North American vehicles is because the hardware is sized and shaped to be a self-contained module that’s installed behind your license plate using the existing screw holes and minimal tools. It features a refillable reservoir for wiper fluid that’s blasted at a backup camera using an adjustable high-pressure pump.

The reservoir and removable rechargeable battery powering the pump will supposedly last for four to six months depending on how frequently you’re cleaning the lens. To further simplify installation, the Lens Lizard doesn’t connect to your vehicle’s electrical system. You can instead remotely trigger it, even while driving, using an included wireless Bluetooth remote.

One of the best upgrades you can make to your gaming PC setup is an OLED monitor. Assuming that games already run great on your desktop or laptop, a monitor with per-pixel color and brightness control will make them look better than ever. If you’ve been shopping for one that’s on sale, Alienware’s 27-inch 1440p QD-OLED monitor is a fine candidate that just dropped to its lowest price yet, selling for $499.99 at Amazon and through Dell (originally $649.99).

Alienware is a major player when it comes to OLED monitors. This 27-inch 360Hz model hits the sweet spot in terms of screen resolution, features, and — most importantly — price.

It’s easy to find monitors of this size selling for slightly less, but the Alienware’s 360Hz refresh rate at 1440p resolution makes it stand out from the 240Hz offered by most others. The panel has a 111 pixels per inch (PPI) density, which is common among monitors of this size and price, and it features two DisplayPort ports and a single HDMI 2.1 port. It can only achieve 360Hz via DisplayPort, as its HDMI port caps out at 144Hz. No support for video over USB-C is a disappointment (since MSI’s often-cheaper QD-OLED at Costco has it), but its omission may not be an issue for you.

﻿The automaker’s EV skunkworks team is using ‘bounties’ to guide engineering decisions that track gains in battery range and reductions in cost.

To say that Ford has struggled to make profitable electric vehicles would be an understatement. The company recently pulled the plug on its F-150 Lightning, a truck once heralded as the most important EV ever made, after taking a staggering $19.5 billion hit on its EV investments in 2025. A new focus on hybrids and extended-range EVs, as well as internal-combustion engine vehicles that still bring in the most revenue, are now the new way forward for the iconic 122-year old company. Everything old is new again.

But Ford still sees EVs as the future — just not oversize ones with “no path to profitability,” like the Lightning, as Andrew Frick, president of Ford Model e and Ford Blue, said last year. Instead, the automaker is betting the farm on more affordable EVs, purpose-built with unique designs and smaller batteries, that can reignite customer demand while also turning a profit. Oh, and they need to be super fun to drive, too.

Tasked with this monumental challenge is Ford’s Silicon Valley-based skunkworks lab, led by Alan Clarke, the automaker’s executive director for EV programs and a 12-year veteran of Tesla. So far, Ford has hidden much of that work from the public — but now it’s ready to start showing off. In a briefing with a small group of reporters last week, Clarke pulled back the curtain on Ford’s so-called Universal EV Platform (UEV), which will eventually underpin a whole family of low-cost EVs, starting with a $30,000 midsize truck in 2027.

The team of around 500 engineers, spread across Silicon Valley and Los Angeles, is organized around two basic principles: efficiency and affordability. Success in the former — shedding weight, reducing friction, enhancing aerodynamics — is seen as absolutely critical in boosting the latter. And now the skunkworks team is getting ready to graduate to the main event, Clarke said. The product is being fully integrated into Ford’s manufacturing engine, with the goal to combine innovation with the company’s massive scale. In other words, Ford’s UEV team is moving past the design phase and into the “heavy lifting” of securing a supply chain and preparing for mass production.

“Once you do that, it’s much less of a ‘skunkworks’ model and much more the way that Ford operates. And so, it is smaller than a typical program, yes; but it’s also the largest product and platform change that Ford has done in at least a decade.”

The biggest impediment in bringing down the cost of an EV, Clarke says, is the battery, which typically comprises about 40 percent of the total cost of the vehicle. But rather than hold out hope for a mythical, long-promised innovation, like solid-state batteries, Ford’s skunkworks team opted instead to focus on squeezing the most range out of the smallest possible battery pack.

To do this, Ford introduced a new system it calls “bounties” to guide its engineers’ decisions. These are numerical metrics assigned to key efficiency drivers such as vehicle mass and aerodynamic drag — factors that directly affect range and cost.

For example, a one-millimeter change in roof height can translate into a $1.30 savings in battery costs. Or perhaps a small increase in material costs could reduce brake drag, which then translates into improved efficiency and range. As they model different materials and designs, Ford’s engineers are constantly thinking about these tradeoffs thanks to the new bounty system, Clarke said.

“Bounties is a very tangible way for every engineer, every product person, every designer to understand how their micro decisions on a day-to-day basis impact the customer and the end product,” he said.

In low-cost vehicles, it can seem counterintuitive to use a more expensive part just because it’s lighter. But by assigning a monetary value to weight savings in terms of reduced battery cost, Ford’s engineers can determine those types of parts actually lower the overall cost of the whole vehicle.

Ford’s push to develop affordable EVs is also a fight against physics itself. Every bit of inefficiency caused by drag robs you of range. At higher speeds, drag becomes even more of a hindrance. If you go twice as fast, the air holds you back four times as much, and you need eight times more power to keep going that speed, Clarke says.

With that in mind, Ford’s engineers got together with some of the brightest minds from Formula One and took direct aim at this problem. They streamlined the UEV’s underbody by making bolt holes shallower, carefully routed airflow around tires and suspension, and shaped certain components to hide the front tire wake behind the rear tires. Bounty estimate? 4.5 miles of range added.

The side mirrors also needed a rethink. Rather than using separate motors for mirror adjustment and folding, Ford merged both functions into a single actuator that moves the entire mirror body. This allowed the mirror to be more than 20 percent smaller than normal, reducing mass, cost, and drag. Bounty estimate? 1.5 miles of additional range.

Weight is another enemy of aerodynamics. To slim down, Ford is for the first time using large aluminum unicastings, which the automaker estimates will deliver more than a 27 percent weight improvement compared to competitors. For context, the Ford Maverick uses 146 structural parts in its front and rear structure. The new midsize electric pickup will use just two.

Ford also aims to slash its battery costs by adopting cheaper LFP batteries that eschew cobalt and nickel, two minerals that are among the most expensive to acquire. Using prismatic cells, Ford developed a highly efficient cell-to-structure architecture that effectively turns the battery pack into part of the truck’s skeleton. Tesla is generally recognized as a pioneer in structural batteries; BMW, Volvo, and now Ford are now seeing the gains in efficiency and weight in their use.

The UEV Platform will be Ford’s first crack at a zonal wiring system, rather than one that is a domain style. A zonal architecture means fewer electronic control units (ECUs), less wiring, and most importantly, decreased production cost. Tesla pioneered the use, and it has since been adapted by several EV-only shops, including Rivian and Scout.

But Clarke challenged the idea that Ford was simply chasing those other automakers in the adoption of a zonal architecture. The term itself is often used in marketing, he argues, despite actually referring to a form of zonal aggregation in most vehicles, where ECUs mainly serve to shorten wiring harnesses while logic remains centralized.

“In reality, very few vehicles that exist in the world are actually zonal architectures,” he added.

In contrast, Ford’s approach moves that logic closer to where functions physically occur in the vehicle, Clarke says. This reduces harness complexity further and allows compute resources to be used more dynamically across the car, depending on what functions are needed at a given time.

Ford extends this consolidation to power electronics as well. The DC-to-DC converter and the AC charger now share a single board and components in one compact module, which also manages power distribution and battery management, and can provide AC power to a home during an outage. By grouping these systems together and consolidating shared components, Ford created a small, serviceable module known as the E-Box.

There are tradeoffs, of course. With 400-volt architectures, Ford’s new EVs won’t charge as fast as 800-volt Hyundai and Kia EVs, for example. Clarke explained that after extensive internal studies, the team concluded 800-volt systems don’t provide any meaningful charging or powertrain advantage for this vehicle segment. And Ford wanted flexibility to support not only lithium iron phosphate batteries but also future chemistries, which will be more straightforward at 400 volts.

In addition to battling physics, Ford is also fighting political headwinds that are directly contributing to a slowdown in EV sales growth. But Clarke says that the company’s future success never depended on incentives like tax credits, which Ford always viewed as “icing on the cake.”

As a 122-year-old legacy company with a sprawling network of suppliers, Ford was always going to lag behind more vertically integrated companies like Tesla in developing software driven EVs. But the UEV project begins the necessary work of bringing as much of those systems and components under Ford’s direct control, Clarke says, so the company doesn’t have to negotiate with third-party companies about future feature improvements.

In a video presentation, Ford teased some of the designs under consideration for its future truck. In contrast to most of the trucks today, Ford’s new electric pickup will be more aerodynamically designed, with an angled hood and teardrop-shaped roofline. Not your average high-riding truck with a blunt front-end, but rather another egg-shaped EV — a design trend that has been criticized for being overused.

Clarke explains that if the aerodynamicists worked alone, the result would likely be a pure teardrop shape, which would be impractical and undesirable as a truck. Instead, by embedding aerodynamic experts alongside Ford’s other designers, each decision becomes an opportunity for shared learning.

“You can be the judge when you finally get to see the truck,” he added. “We know we want people to desire it immediately. They have to want to buy it. They have to like the way that it looks.”

For almost as long as phones have been around, people have wanted those phones to also be laptops. It seems so simple: Your phone has plenty of computing power, access to all your apps and data, an always-on connection. The only problem? Your phone’s screen is too small for many tasks, and so is its keyboard. Or at least, they were, until foldable phones made it possible to carry a truly gigantic screen in your pocket. Now all bets are off.

On this episode of The Vergecast, The Verge’s Allison Johnson explains how she turned a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 into her on-the-go laptop. It took a little work, and at least one new accessory, but she’s actually starting to leave her laptop home more often. There’s even a chance that Google’s Android team and app developers might start to make the system work even better.

After that, it’s time for an update on the world of sports streaming. Sportico’s Jacob Feldman joins the show to talk about the whirring drones all over the Winter Olympics coverage, the boring (in a good way) Super Bowl we just had, YouTube’s increasing leverage over both the TV world and the sports world, and whether the Netflix / Paramount / Warner Bros. deal will change the streaming landscape. The good news is, sports streaming is better than ever. The bad news is, chaos reigns.

After that, David takes a question from the Vergecast Hotline (call 866-VERGE11 or email vergecast@theverge.com) about flip phones, AI, and whether one device can feel and work like two devices. The answer is yes, in theory, we think. But the software doesn’t work.

The curious case of the disappearing Lamborghinis

Across the world, unsuspecting people are unwittingly becoming caught up in a new and growing type of organized criminal enterprise: vehicle transport fraud and theft.Crooks use email phishing, fraudulent paperwork, and other tactics to impersonate legitimate transport companies and get hired to deliver a luxury vehicle. They divert the shipment away from its intended destination before using a mix of technology, computer skills, and old-school techniques to erase traces of the vehicle’s original ownership and registration. In some cases, the car has been resold or is out of the country by the time the rightful owner even realizes it’s missing.The nationwide epidemic of vehicle transport fraud and theft has remained under the radar, even as it’s rocked the industry over the past two years. MIT Technology Review identified more than a dozen cases involving high-end vehicles, obtained court records, and spoke to law enforcement, brokers, drivers, and victims in multiple states to reveal how transport fraud is wreaking havoc across the country.

The scientist using AI to hunt for antibiotics just about everywhere

Antimicrobial resistance is a major problem. Infections caused by bacteria, fungi, and viruses that have evolved ways to evade treatments are now associated with more than 4 million deaths per year, and a recent analysis predicts that number could surge past 8 million by 2050.

Bioengineer and computational biologist César de la Fuente has a plan. His team at the University of Pennsylvania is training AI tools to search genomes far and deep for peptides with antibiotic properties. His vision is to assemble those peptides—molecules made of up to 50 amino acids linked together—into various configurations, including some never seen in nature. The results, he hopes, could defend the body against microbes that withstand traditional treatments—and his quest has unearthed promising candidates in unexpected places. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">When Sam Zahr first saw the gray Rolls-Royce Dawn convertible with orange interior and orange roof, he knew he’d found a perfect addition to his fleet. “It was very appealing to our clientele,” he told me. As the director of operations at Dream Luxury Rental, he outfits customers in the Detroit area looking to ride in style to a wedding, a graduation, or any other event with high-end vehicles—Rolls-Royces, Lamborghinis, Bentleys, Mercedes G-Wagons, and more.

But before he could rent out the Rolls, Zahr needed to get the car to Detroit from Miami, where he bought it from a used-car dealer.

His team posted the convertible on Central Dispatch, an online marketplace that’s popular among car dealers, manufacturers, and owners who want to arrange vehicle shipments. It’s not too complicated, at least in theory: A typical listing includes the type of vehicle, zip codes of the origin and destination, dates for pickup and delivery, and the fee. Anyone with a Central Dispatch account can see the job, and an individual carrier or transport broker who wants it can call the number on the listing.

Zahr’s team got a call from a transport company that wanted the job. They agreed on the price and scheduled pickup for January 17, 2025. Zahr watched from a few feet away as the car was loaded into an enclosed trailer. He expected the vehicle to arrive in Detroit just a few days later—by January 21.

Zahr called a contact at the transport company to ask what happened.

“He’s like, I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

Zahr told me his contact angrily told him they mostly ship Coca-Cola products, not luxury cars. “He was yelling and screaming about it,” Zahr said.

Over the years, people have broken into his business to steal cars, or they’ve rented them out and never come back. But until this day, he’d never had a car simply disappear during shipping. He’d expected no trouble this time around, especially since he’d used Central Dispatch—“a legit platform that everyone uses to transport cars,” he said.

“That’s the scary part about it, you know?”

Zahr had unwittingly been caught up in a new and growing type of organized criminal enterprise: vehicle transport fraud and theft. Crooks use email phishing, fraudulent paperwork, and other tactics to impersonate legitimate transport companies and get hired to deliver a luxury vehicle. They divert the shipment away from its intended destination and then use a mix of technology, computer skills, and old-school chop shop techniques to erase traces of the vehicle’s original ownership and registration.

These vehicles can be retitled and resold in the US or loaded into a shipping container and sent to an overseas buyer. In some cases, the car has been resold or is out of the country by the time the rightful owner even realizes it’s missing.

“Criminals have learned that stealing cars via the web portals has become extremely easy, and when I say easy—it’s become seamless,” says Steven Yariv, the CEO of Dealers Choice Auto Transport of West Palm Beach, Florida, one of the country’s largest luxury-vehicle transport brokers.

Individual cases have received media coverage thanks to the high value of the stolen cars and the fact that some belong to professional athletes and other celebrities. In late 2024, a Lamborghini Huracán belonging to Colorado Rockies third baseman Kris Bryant went missing en route to his home in Las Vegas; R&B singer Ray J told TMZ the same year that two Mercedes Maybachs never arrived in New York as planned; and last fall, NBA Hall of Famer Shaquille O’Neal had a $180,000 custom Range Rover stolen when the transport company hired to move the vehicle was hacked. “They’re saying they think it’s probably in Dubai by now, to be honest,” an employee of the company that customized the SUV told Shaq in a YouTube video.

“Criminals have learned that stealing cars via the web portals has become extremely easy, and when I say easy—it’s become seamless.”

But the nationwide epidemic of vehicle transport fraud and theft has remained under the radar, even as it’s rocked the industry over the past two years. MIT Technology Review identified more than a dozen cases involving high-end vehicles, obtained court records, and spoke to law enforcement, brokers, drivers, and victims in multiple states to reveal how transport fraud is wreaking havoc across the country.

It’s challenging to quantify the scale of this type of crime, since there isn’t a single entity or association that tracks it. Still, these law enforcement officials and brokers, as well as the country’s biggest online car-transport marketplaces, acknowledge that fraud and theft are on the rise.

When I spoke with him in August, Yariv estimated that around 8,000 exotic and high-end cars had been stolen since the spring of 2024, resulting in over $1 billion in losses. “You’re talking 30 cars a day [on] average is gone,” he said.

Multiple state and local law enforcement officials told MIT Technology Review that the number is plausible. (The FBI did not respond to a request for an interview.)

“It doesn’t surprise me,” said J.D. Decker, chief of the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles’ police division and chair of the fraud subcommittee for the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators. “It’s a huge business.”

Data from the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB), a nonprofit that works with law enforcement and the insurance industry to investigate insurance fraud and related crimes, provides further evidence of this crime wave. NICB tracks both car theft and cargo theft, a broad category that refers to goods, money, or baggage that is stolen while part of a commercial shipment; the category also covers cases in which a vehicle is stolen via a diverted transport truck or a purloined car is loaded into a shipping container. NICB’s statistics about car theft show that it has declined following an increase during the pandemic—but over the same period cargo theft has dramatically increased, to an estimated $35 billion annually. The group projected in June that it was expected to rise 22% in 2025.

NICB doesn’t break out data for vehicles as opposed to other types of stolen cargo. But Bill Woolf, a regional director for the organization, said an antifraud initiative at the Port of Baltimore experienced a 200% increase from 2023 to 2024 in the number of stolen vehicles recovered. He said the jump could be due to the increased effort to identify stolen cars moving through the port, but he noted that earlier the day we spoke, agents had recovered two high-end stolen vehicles bound for overseas.

“One day, one container—a million dollars,” he said.

Many other vehicles are never recovered—perhaps a result of the speed with which they’re shipped off or sold. Travis Payne, an exotic-car dealer in Atlanta, told me that transport thieves often have buyers lined up before they take a car: “When they steal them, they have a plan.”

In 2024, Payne spent months trying to locate a Rolls-Royce he’d purchased after it was stolen via transport fraud. It eventually turned up in the Instagram feed of a Mexican pop star, he says. He never got the car back.

The criminals are “gonna keep doing it,” he says, “because they make a couple phone calls, make a couple email accounts, and they get a $400,000 car for free. I mean, it makes them God, you know?”

The explosion of vehicle transport fraud follows a pattern that has played out across the economy over the past roughly two decades: A business that once ran on phones, faxes, and personal relationships shifted to online marketplaces that increased efficiency and brought down costs—but the reduction in human-to-human interaction introduced security vulnerabilities that allowed organized and often international fraudsters to enter the industry.

In the case of vehicle transport, the marketplaces are online “load boards” where car owners, dealerships, and manufacturers post about vehicles that need to be shipped from one location to another. Central Dispatch claims to be the largest vehicle load board and says on its website that thousands of vehicles are posted on its platform each day. It’s part of Cox Automotive, an industry juggernaut that owns major vehicle auctions, Autotrader, Kelley Blue Book, and other businesses that work with auto dealers, lenders, and buyers.

The system worked pretty well until roughly two years ago, when organized fraud rings began compromising broker and carrier accounts and exploiting loopholes in government licensing to steal loads with surprising ease and alarming frequency.

A theft can start with a phishing email that appears to come from a legitimate load board. The recipient, a broker or carrier, clicks a link in the message, which appears to go to the real site—but logging in sends the victim’s username and password to a criminal. The crook logs in as the victim, changes the account’s email and phone number to reroute all communications, and begins claiming loads of high-end vehicles. Cox Automotive declined an interview request but said in a statement that the “load board system still works well” and that “fraud impacts a very small portion” of listings.

“Every time we come up with a security measure to prevent the fraudster, they come up with a countermeasure.”

Criminals also gain access to online marketplaces by exploiting a lax regulatory environment. While a valid US Department of Transportation registration is required to access online marketplaces, it’s not hard for bad actors to register sham transport companies and obtain a USDOT number from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, the agency that regulates commercial motor vehicles. In other cases, criminals compromise the FMCSA accounts of legitimate companies and change their phone numbers and email addresses in order to impersonate them and steal loads. (USDOT did not respond to a request for comment.)

As Bek Abdullayev, the founder of Super Dispatch, one of Central Dispatch’s biggest competitors, explained in an episode of the podcast Auto Transport Co-Pilot, “FMCSA [is] authorizing people that are fraudulent companies—people that are not who they say they are.” He added that people can “game the system and … obtain paperwork that makes [them] look like a legitimate company.” For example, vehicle carrier insurance can be obtained quickly—if temporarily—by submitting an online application with fraudulent payment credentials.

The bottom line is that crooks have found myriad ways to present themselves as genuine and permitted vehicle transport brokers and carriers. Once hired to move a vehicle, they often repost the car on a load board using a different fraudulent or compromised account. While this kind of subcontracting, known as “double-­brokering,” is sometimes used by companies to save money, it can also be used by criminals to hire an unwitting accomplice to deliver the stolen car to their desired location. “They’re booking cars and then they’re just reposting them and dispatching them out to different routes,” says Yariv, the West Palm Beach transport broker.

“A lot of this is cartel operated,” says Decker, of the Nevada DMV, who also serves on a vehicle fraud committee for the International Association of Chiefs of Police. “There’s so much money in it that it rivals selling drugs.”

Even though this problem is becoming increasingly well known, fraudsters continue to steal, largely with impunity. Brokers, auto industry insiders, and law enforcement told MIT Technology Review that load boards and the USDOT have been too slow to catch and ban bad actors. (In its statement, Cox Automotive said it has been “dedicated to continually enhancing our processes, technology, and education efforts across the industry to fight fraud.”)

Jake MacDonald, who leads Super Dispatch’s fraud monitoring and investigation efforts, put it bluntly on the podcast with Abdullayev: the reason that fraud is “jumping so much” is that “the industry is slowly moving over to a more technologically advanced position, but it’s so slow that fraud is actually [out-]innovating the industry.”

As it turns out, the person Zahr’s team hired on Central Dispatch didn’t really work for the transport company.

After securing the job, the fraudster reposted the orange-and-gray Rolls convertible to a load board. And instead of saying that the car needed to go from Miami to the real destination of Detroit, the new job listed an end point of Hallandale Beach, Florida, just 20 or so miles away. It was a classic case of malicious double-­brokering: the crooks claimed a load and then reposted it in order to find a new, unsuspecting driver to deliver the car into their possession.

On January 17 of last year, the legitimate driver showed up in a Dodge Ram and loaded the Rolls into an enclosed trailer as Zahr watched.

“The guy came in and looked very professional, and we took a video of him loading the car, taking pictures of everything,” Zahr told me. He never thought to double-­check where the driver was headed or which company he worked for.

Not long after a panicked Zahr spoke with his contact at the transport company he thought he was working with, he reported the car as stolen to the Miami police. Detective Ryan Chin was assigned to the case. It fit with a pattern of high-end auto theft that he and his colleagues had recently been tracking.

“Over the past few weeks, detectives have been made aware of a new method on the rise for vehicles being stolen by utilizing Central Dispatch,” Chin wrote in records obtained by MIT Technology Review. “Specific brokers are re-routing the truck drivers upon them picking up vehicles posted for transport and routing them to other locations provided by the broker.”

Chin used Zahr’s photos and video to identify the truck and driver who’d taken the Rolls. By the time police found him, on January 31, the driver had already dropped off Zahr’s Rolls in Hallandale Beach. He’d also picked up and delivered a black Lamborghini Urus and a White Audi R8 for the same client. Each car had been stolen via double-brokering transport fraud, according to court records.

The police department declined to comment or to make Chin available for an interview. But a source with knowledge of the case said the driver was “super cooperative.” (The source asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media, and the driver does not appear to have been identified in court records.)

The driver told police that he had another load to pick up at a dealership in Naples, Florida, later that same day—a second Lamborghini Urus, this one orange. Police later discovered it was supposed to be shipped to California. But the carrier had been hired to bring the car, which retails for about $250,000, to a mall in nearby Aventura. He told police that he suspected it was going to be delivered to the same person who had booked him for the earlier Rolls, Audi, and Lamborghini deliveries, since “the voice sounds consistent with who [the driver] dealt with prior on the phone.” This drop-off was slated for 4 p.m. at the Waterways Shoppes mall in Aventura.

That was when Chin and a fellow detective, Orlando Rodriguez, decided to set up a sting.

The officers and colleagues across three law enforcement agencies quickly positioned themselves in the Waterways parking lot ahead of the scheduled delivery of the Urus. They watched as, pretty much right on schedule that afternoon, the cooperative driver of the Dodge Ram rolled to a stop in the palm-tree-lined lot, which was surrounded by a kosher supermarket, Japanese and Middle Eastern restaurants, and a physiotherapy clinic.

The driver went inside the trailer and emerged in the orange Lamborghini. He parked it and waited near the vehicle.

Roughly 30 minutes later, a green Rolls-Royce Cullinan (price: $400,000 and up) arrived with two men and a teenager inside. They got out, opened the trunk, and sat on the tailgate of the vehicle as one man counted cash.

“They’re doing countersurveillance, looking around,” the source told me later. “It’s a little out of the ordinary, you know. They kept being fixated [on] where the truck was parked.”

The transport driver and the three males who arrived in the Rolls-Royce did not interact. But soon enough, another luxury vehicle, a Bentley Continental GT, which last year retailed for about $250,000 and up, pulled in. The Bentley driver got out, took the cash from one of the men sitting on the back of the Rolls, and walked over to the transport driver. He handed him $700 and took the keys to the Lamborghini.

That’s when more than a dozen officers swooped in.

“They had nowhere to go,” the source told me. “We surrounded them.”

The two men in the Rolls were later identified as Arman Gevorgyan and Hrant Nazarian, and the man in the Bentley as Yuriy Korotovskyy. The three were arrested and charged with dealing in stolen property, grand theft over $100,000, and organized fraud. (The teenager who arrived in the Rolls was Gevorgyan’s son. He was detained and released, according to Richard Cooper, Gevorgyan’s attorney.)

As investigators dug into the case, the evidence suggested that this was part of the criminal pattern they’d been following. “I think it’s organized,” the source told me.

It’s something that transport industry insiders have talked about for a while, according to Fred Mills, the owner of Florida-based Advantage Auto Transport, a company that specializes in transporting high-end vehicles. He said there’s even a slang term to describe people engaged in transport fraud: the flip-flop mafia.

It has multiple meanings. One is that the people who show up to transport or accept a vehicle “are out there wearing, you know, flip-flops and slides,” Mills says.

The second refers to how fraudsters “flip” from one carrier registration to another as they try to stay ahead of regulators and complaints.

In addition to needing a USDOT number, carriers working across states need an interstate operating authority (commonly known as an MC number) from the USDOT. Both IDs are typically printed on the driver and passenger doors. But the rise of ­double-brokering—and of fly-by-night and fraudulent carriers—means that drivers increasingly just tape IDs to their door.

Mills says fraudsters will use a USDOT number for 10 or 11 months, racking up violations, and then tape up a new one. “They just wash, rinse, and repeat,” he says.

Decker from the Nevada DMV says a lot of high-end vehicles are stolen because dealerships and individual customers don’t properly check the paperwork or identity of the person who shows up to transport them.

“‘Flip-flop mafia’ is an apt nickname because it’s surprisingly easy to get a car on a truck and convince somebody that they’re a legitimate transport operation when they’re not,” he says.

Roughly a month after it disappeared, Zahr’s Rolls-Royce was recovered by the Miami Beach Police. Video footage obtained by a local TV station showed the gray car with its distinctive orange top being towed into a police garage.

Among the items confiscated from the men in Florida were $10,796 in cash and a GPS jammer. Law enforcement sources say jammers have become a core piece of technology for modern car thieves—necessary to disable the location tracking provided by GPS navigation systems in most cars. “Once they get the vehicles, they usually park them somewhere [and] put a signal jammer in there or cut out the GPS,” the Florida source told me. This buys them time to swap and reprogram the vehicle identification number (VIN), wipe car computers, and reprogram fobs to remove traces of the car’s provenance.

No two VINs are the same, and each is assigned to a specific vehicle by the manufacturer. Where they’re placed inside a vehicle varies by make and model. The NICB’s Woolf says cars also have confidential VINs located in places—including their electronic components—that are supposed to be known only to law enforcement and his organization. But criminals have figured out how to find and change them.

“It’s making it more and more difficult for us to identify vehicles as stolen,” Woolf says. “Every time we come up with a security measure to prevent the fraudster, they come up with a countermeasure.”

All this doesn’t even take very much time. “If you know what you’re doing, and you steal the car at one o’clock today, you can have it completely done at two o’clock today,” says Woolf. A vehicle can be rerouted, reprogrammed, re-VINed, and sometimes even retitled before an owner files a police report.

That appears to have been the plan in the case of the stolen light-gray 2023 Lamborghini Huracán owned by the Rockies’ Kris Bryant.

On September 29, 2024, a carrier hired via a load board arrived at Bryant’s home in Cherry Hills, Colorado, to pick up the car. It was supposed to be transported to Bryant’s Las Vegas residence within a few days. It never showed up there—but it was in fact in Vegas.

Using Flock traffic cameras, which capture license plate information in areas across the country, Detective Justin Smith of the Cherry Hills Village Police Department tracked the truck and trailer that had picked up the Lambo to Nevada, and he alerted local police.

On October 7, a Las Vegas officer spotted a car matching the Lamborghini’s description and pulled it over. The driver said the Huracán had been brought to his auto shop by a man whom the police were able to identify as Dat Viet Tieu. They arrested Tieu later that same day. In an interview with police, he identified himself as a car broker. He said he was going to resell the Lamborghini and that he had no idea that the car was stolen, according to the arrest report.

Police searched a Jeep Wrangler that Tieu had parked nearby and discovered it had been stolen—and had been re-VINed, retitled, and registered to his wife. Inside the car, police discovered “multiple fraudulent VIN stickers, key fobs to other high-end stolen vehicles, and fictitious placards,” their report said.

One of the fake VINs matched the make and model of Bryant’s Lamborghini. (Representatives for Bryant and the Rockies did not respond to a request for comment.)

Tieu was released on bail. But after he returned to LVPD headquarters two days later, on October 9, to reclaim his personal property, officers secretly placed him under surveillance with the hope that he’d lead them to one of the other stolen cars matching the key fobs they’d found in the Jeep.

It didn’t take long for them to get lucky. A few hours after leaving the police station, Tieu drove to Harry Reid International Airport, where he picked up an unidentified man. They drove to the Caesars Palace parking garage and pulled in near a GMC Sierra. Over the next three hours, the man worked on a laptop inside and outside the vehicle, according to a police report. At one point, he and Tieu connected jumper cables from Tieu’s rented Toyota Camry to the Sierra.

“At 2323 hours, the white male adult enters the GMC Sierra, and the vehicle’s ignition starts. It was readily apparent the [two men] had successfully re-programmed a key fob to the GMC Sierra,” the report said.

An officer watched as the man gave two key fobs to Tieu, who handed the man an unknown amount of cash. Still, the police let the men leave the garage.

The police kept Tieu and his wife under surveillance for more than a week. Then, on October 18, fearing the couple was about to leave town, officers entered Nora’s Italian Restaurant just off the Vegas Strip and took them into custody.

“Obviously, we meet again,” a detective told Tieu.

Police later searched the VIN on the Sierra from the Caesars lot and found that it had been reported stolen in Tremonton, Utah, roughly two weeks earlier. They eventually returned both the Sierra and Kris Bryant’s Lamborghini to their owners.

Tieu pleaded guilty to two felony counts of possession of a stolen vehicle and one count of defacing, altering, substituting, or removing a VIN. In October, he was sentenced to up to one year of probation; if it’s completed successfully, the plea agreement says, the counts of possession of a stolen vehicle will be dismissed. His attorneys, David Z. Chesnoff and Richard A. Schonfeld, said in a statement that they were “pleased” with the court’s decision, “in light of [Tieu’s] acceptance of responsibility.”

Many vehicles stolen via transport fraud are never recovered. Experts say the best way to stop this criminal cycle would be to disrupt it before it starts.

That would require significant changes to the way that load boards operate. Bryant’s Lamborghini, Zahr’s and Payne’s Rolls-Royces, and the orange Lamborghini Urus in Florida were all posted for transport on Central Dispatch. Both brokers and shippers argue that the company hasn’t taken enough responsibility for what they characterize as weak oversight.

“If the crap hits the fan, it’s on us as a broker, or it’s on the trucking company … they have no liability in the whole transaction process. So it definitely frosted a lot of people’s feathers.”

“You’re Cox Automotive—you’re the biggest car company in the world for dealers—and you’re not doing better screenings when you sign people up?” says Payne. (The spokesperson for Cox Automotive said that it has “a robust verification process for all clients … who sign up.”)

“If the crap hits the fan, it’s on us as a broker, or it’s on the trucking company, or the clients’ insurance, [which means] that they have no liability in the whole transaction process,” says Mills. “So it definitely frosted a lot of people’s feathers.”

Over the last year, Central Dispatch has made changes to further secure its platform. It introduced two-factor authentication for user accounts and started enabling shippers to use its app to track loads in real time, among other measures. It also kicked off an awareness campaign that includes online educational content and media appearances to communicate that the company takes its responsibilities seriously.

“We’ve removed over 500 accounts already in 2025, and we’ll continue to take any of that aggressive action where it’s needed,” said Lainey Sibble, Central Dispatch’s head of business, in a sponsored episode of the Auto Remarketing Podcast. “We also recognize this is not going to happen in a silo. Everyone has a role to play here, and it’s really going to take us all working together in partnership to combat this issue.”

Mills says Central Dispatch got faster at shutting down fraudulent accounts toward the end of last year. But it’s going to take time to fix the industry, he adds: “I compare it to a 15-year opioid addiction. It’s going to take a while to detox the system.”

Yariv, the broker in West Palm Beach, says he has stopped using Central Dispatch and other load boards altogether. “One person has access here, and that’s me. I don’t even log in,” he told me. His team has gone back to working the phones, as evidenced by the din of voices in the background as we spoke.

“[The fraud is] everywhere. It’s constant,” he said. “The only way it goes away is the dispatch boards have to be shut down—and that’ll never happen.”

It also remains to be seen what kind of accountability there will be for the alleged thieves in Florida. Korotovskyy and Nazarian pleaded not guilty; as of press time, their trials were scheduled to begin in May. (Korotovskyy’s lawyer, Bruce Prober, said in a statement that the case “is an ongoing matter” and his client is “presumed innocent,” while Nazarian’s attorney, Yale Sanford, said in a statement, “As the investigation continues, Mr. Nazarian firmly asserts his innocence.” A spokesperson with Florida’s Office of the State Attorney emailed a statement: “The circumstances related to these arrests are still a matter of investigation and prosecution. It would be inappropriate to be commenting further.”)

In contrast, Gevorgyan, the third man arrested in the Florida sting, pleaded guilty to four charges.

Yet he maintains his innocence, according to Cooper, his lawyer: “He was pleading [guilty] to get out and go home.” Cooper describes his client as a wealthy Armenian national who runs a jewelry business back home, adding that he was deported to Armenia in September.

Cooper says his client’s “sweetheart” plea deal doesn’t require him to testify or otherwise supply information against his alleged co-conspirators—or to reveal details about how all these luxury cars were mysteriously disappearing across South Florida. Cooper also says prosecutors may have a difficult time convicting the other two men, arguing that police acted prematurely by arresting the trio without first seeing what, if anything, they intended to do with the Lamborghini.

“All they ever had,” Cooper says, “was three schmucks sitting outside of the Lamborghini.”

Here are our picks for the advances to watch in the years ahead—and why we think they matter right now.

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

Speaking with popular AI content creators convinces me that “slop” isn’t just the internet rotting in real time, but the early draft of a new kind of pop culture.

I asked my MIT class to consider why some of the advances that MIT Technology Review’s journalists thought would change our world never really did—and what we can learn from the flops.

            <div id="article-text">When work went remote, the sound of business changed. What began as a scramble to make home offices functional has evolved into a revolution in how people hear and are heard. From education to enterprises, companies across industries have reimagined what clear, reliable communication can mean in a hybrid world. For major audio and communications enterprises like Shure and Zoom, that transformation has been powered by artificial intelligence, new acoustic technologies, and a shared mission: making connection effortless.

Necessity during the pandemic accelerated years of innovation in months.

&quot;Audio and video just working is a baseline for collaboration,&quot; says chief ecosystem officer at Zoom, Brendan Ittelson. &quot;That expectation has shifted from connecting people to enhancing productivity and creativity across the entire ecosystem.&quot;

Audio is a foundation for trust, understanding, and collaboration. Poor sound quality can distort meaning and fatigue listeners, while crisp audio and intelligent processing can make digital interactions feel nearly as natural as in-person exchanges.

&quot;If you think about the fundamental need here,&quot; adds chief technology officer at Shure, Sam Sabet, &quot;It&#39;s the ability to amplify the audio and the information that&#39;s really needed, and diminish the unwanted sounds and audio so that we can enhance that experience and make it seamless for people to communicate.&quot;

For both Ittelson and Sabet, AI now sits at the center of this progress. For Shure, machine learning powers real-time noise suppression, adaptive beamforming, and spatial audio that tunes itself to a room’s acoustics. For Zoom, AI underpins every layer of its platform, from dynamic noise reduction to automated meeting summaries and intelligent assistants that anticipate user needs. These tools are transforming communication from reactive to proactive, enabling systems that understand intent, context, and emotion.

&quot;Even if you&#39;re not working from home and coming into the office, the types of spaces and environments you try to collaborate in today are constantly changing because our needs are constantly changing,&quot; says Sabet. &quot;Having software and algorithms that adapt seamlessly and self-optimize based on the acoustics of the room, based on the different layouts of the spaces where people collaborate in is instrumental.&quot;

The future, they suggest, is one where technology fades into the background. As audio devices and AI companions learn to self-optimize, users won’t think about microphones or meeting links. Instead, they’ll simply connect. Both companies are now exploring agentic AI systems and advanced wireless solutions that promise to make collaboration seamless across spaces, whether in classrooms, conference rooms, or virtual environments yet to come.

&quot;It&#39;s about helping people focus on strategy and creativity instead of administrative busy work,&quot; says Ittelson.

This episode is produced in partnership with Shure.

Now as the pandemic ushered in the cultural shift that led to our increasingly virtual world, it also sparked a flurry of innovation in the audio and video industries to keep employees and customers connected and businesses running. Today we&#39;re going to talk about the AI technologies behind those innovations, the impact on audio innovation, and the continuing emerging opportunities for further advances in audio capabilities.

My guests today are Sam Sabet, chief technology officer at Shure, and Brendan Ittelson, chief ecosystem officer at Zoom.

Sam Sabet: Thank you, Megan. It&#39;s a pleasure to be here and I&#39;m looking forward to this conversation with both you and Brendan. It should be a very exciting conversation.

Brendan Ittelson: Thank you so much for having me today. I&#39;m looking forward to the conversation and all the topics we have to dive into on this area.

Megan: Fantastic. Lovely to have you both here. And Sam, just to set some context, I wonder if we could start with the pandemic and the innovation that really was born out of necessity. I mean, when it became clear that we were all going to be virtual for the foreseeable future, I wonder what was the first technological mission for Shure?

Sam: Yeah, very good question. The pandemic really accelerated a lot of innovation around virtual communications and fundamentally how we perform our everyday jobs remotely. One of our first technological mission when the pandemic happened and everybody ended up going home and performing their functions remotely was to make sure that people could continue to communicate effectively, whether that&#39;s for business meetings, virtual events, or educational purposes. We focused on collaboration and enhancing collaboration tools. And ideally what we were aiming to do, or we focused on, was to basically improve the ease of use and configuration of audio tool sets.

Because unlike the office environment where it might be a lot more controlled, people are working from non-traditional areas like home offices or other makeshift solutions, we needed to make sure that people could still get pristine audio and that studio level audio even in uncontrolled environments that are not really made for that. We expedited development in our software solutions. We created tool sets that allowed for ease of deployment and remote configuration and management so we could enable people to continue doing the things they needed to do without having to worry about the underlying technology.

Megan: And Brendan, during that time, it seemed everyone became a Zoom user of some sort. I mean, what was the first mission at Zoom when virtual connection became this necessity for everyone?

Brendan: Well, our mission fundamentally didn&#39;t change. It&#39;s always been about delivering frictionless communications. What shifted was the urgency and the magnitude of what we were doing. Our focus shifted on how we do this reliably, securely, and to scale to ensure these millions of new users could connect instantly without friction. We really shifted our thinking of being just a business continuity tool to becoming a lifeline for so many individuals and industries. The stories that we heard across education, healthcare, and just general human connection, the number of those moments that matter to people that we were able to help facilitate just became so important. We really focused on how can we be there and make it frictionless so folks can focus on that human connection. And that accelerated our thinking in terms of innovation and reinforced the thought that we need to focus on the simplicity, accessibility, and trust in communication technology so that people could focus on that connection and not the technology that makes it possible.

Megan: That&#39;s so true. It did really just become an absolute lifeline for people, didn&#39;t it? And before we dive into the technologies beyond these emerging capabilities, I wonder if we could first talk about just the importance of clear audio. I mean, Sam, as much as we all worry over how we look on Zoom, is how we sound perhaps as or even more impactful?

Sam: Yeah, you&#39;re absolutely correct. I mean, clear audio is absolutely critical for effective communications. Video quality is very important absolutely, but poor audio can really hinder understanding and engagement. As a matter of fact, there&#39;s studies and research from areas such as Yale University that say that poor audio can make understanding somewhat more challenged and even affect retention of information. Especially in an educational type environment where there&#39;s a lot of background noise and very differing types of spaces like auditoriums and lecture halls, it really becomes a high priority that you have great audio quality. And during the pandemic, as you said, and as Brendan rightly said, it became one of our highest priorities to focus on technologies like beamforming mics and ways to focus on the speaker&#39;s voice and minimize that unwanted background noise so that we could ensure that the communication was efficient, was well understood, and that it removed the distraction so people could be able to actually communicate and retain the information that was being shared.

Megan: It is incredible just how impactful audio can be, can&#39;t it? Brendan, I mean as you said, remote and hybrid collaboration is part of Zoom&#39;s DNA. What observations can you share about how users have grown along with the technological advancements and maybe how their expectations have grown as well?

Brendan: Definitely. I mean, users now expect seamless and intelligent experiences. Audio and video just working is a baseline for collaboration. That expectation has shifted from connecting people to enhancing productivity and creativity across the entire ecosystem. When we look at it, we&#39;re really looking at these trends in terms of how people want to be better when they&#39;re at home. For example, AI-powered tools like Smart Summaries, translation and noise suppression to help people stay productive and connected no matter where they&#39;re working. But then this also comes into play at the office. We&#39;re starting to see folks that dive into our technology like Intelligent Director and Smart Name Tags that create that meeting equity even when they&#39;re in a conference room.

So, the remote experience and the room experience all are similar and create that same ability to be seen, heard, and contribute. And we&#39;re now diving further into this that it&#39;s beyond just meetings. Zoom is really transforming into an AI-first work platform that&#39;s focused on human connection. And so that goes beyond the meetings into things like Chat, Zoom Docs, Zoom Events and Webinars, the Zoom Contact Center and more. And all of this being brought together using our AI Companion at its core to help connect all of those different points of connection for individuals.

Megan: I mean, so Brendan, we know it wasn&#39;t only workplaces that were affected by the pandemic, it was also the education sector that had to undergo a huge change. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about how Zoom has operated in that higher education sphere as well.

Brendan: Definitely. Education has always been a focus for Zoom and an area that we&#39;ve believed in. Because education and learning is something as a company we value and so we have invested in that sector. And personally being the son of academics, it is always an area that I find fascinating. We continue to invest in terms of how do we make the classroom a stronger space? And especially now that the classroom has changed, where it can be in person, it can be virtual, it can be a mix. And using Zoom and its tools, we&#39;re able to help bridge all those different scenarios to make learning accessible to students no matter their means.

That&#39;s what truly excites us, is being able to have that technology that allows people to pursue their desires, their interests, and really up-level their pursuits and inspire more. We&#39;re constantly investing in how to allow those messages to get out and to integrate in the flow of communication and collaboration that higher education uses, whether that&#39;s being integrated into the classroom, into learning management systems, to make that a seamless flow so that students and their educators can just collaborate seamlessly. And also that we can support all the infrastructure and administration that helps make that possible.

Megan: Absolutely. Such an important thing. And Sam, Shure as well, could you talk to us a bit about how you worked in that kind of education space as well from an audio point of view?

Sam: Absolutely. Actually, this is a topic that&#39;s near and dear to my heart because I&#39;m actually an adjunct professor in my free time.

Sam: And the challenges of trying to do this sort of a hybrid lecture, if you will. And Shure has been particularly well suited for this environment and we&#39;ve been focused on it and investing in technologies there for decades. If you think about how a lecture hall is structured, it&#39;s a little different than just having a meeting around the conference table. And Shure has focused on creating products that allow this combination of a presenter scenario along with a meeting space plus the far end where users or students are remote, they can hear intelligibly what&#39;s happening in the lecture hall, but they can also participate.

Between our products like the Ceiling Mic Arrays and our wireless microphones that are purpose built for presenters and educators like our MXW neXt product line, we&#39;ve created technologies that allow those two previously separate worlds to integrate together. And then add that onto integrating with Zoom and other products that allow for that collaboration has been very instrumental. And again, being a user and providing those lectures, I can see a night and day difference and just how much more effective my lectures are today from where they were five to six years ago. And that&#39;s all just made possible by all the technologies that are purpose built for these scenarios and integrating more with these powerful tools that just make the job so much more seamless.

Megan: Absolutely fascinating that you got to put the technology to use yourself as well to check that it was all working well. And you mentioned AI there, of course. I mean, Sam, what AI technologies have had the most significant impact on recent audio advancements too?

Sam: Yeah. Absolutely. If you think about the fundamental need here, it&#39;s the ability to amplify the audio and the information that&#39;s really needed and diminish the unwanted sounds and audio so that we can enhance that experience and make it seamless for people to communicate. With our innovations at Shure, we&#39;ve leveraged the cutting-edge technologies to both enhance communication effectiveness and to align seamlessly with evolving features in unified communications like the ones that Brandon just mentioned in the Zoom platforms.

We partner with industry leaders like Zoom to ensure that we&#39;re providing the ability to be able to focus on that needed audio and eliminate all the background distractions. AI has transformed that audio technology with things like machine learning algorithms that enable us to do more real-time audio processing and significantly enhancing things like noise reduction and speech isolation. Just to give you a simple example, our IntelliMix Room audio processing software that we&#39;ve released as well as part of a complete room solution uses AI to optimize sound in different environments.

And really that&#39;s one of the fundamental changes in this period, whether that&#39;s pandemic or post-pandemic, is that the key is really flexibility and being able to adapt to changing work environments. Even if you&#39;re not working from home and coming into the office, the types of spaces and environments you try to collaborate in today are constantly changing because our needs are constantly changing. And so having software and algorithms that adapt seamlessly and are able to self-optimize based on the acoustics of the room, based on the different layouts of the spaces where people collaborate in is instrumental.

And then last but not least, AI has transformed the way audio and video integrate. For example, we utilize voice recognition systems that integrate with intelligent cameras so that we enable voice tracking technology so that cameras can not only identify who&#39;s speaking, but you have the ability to hear and see people clearly. And that in general just enhances the overall communication experience.

Megan: Wow. It&#39;s just so much innovation in quite a short space of time really. I mean, Brendan, you mentioned AI a little bit there beforehand, but I wonder what other AI technologies have had the biggest impact as Zoom builds out its own emerging capabilities?

Brendan: Definitely. And I couldn&#39;t agree more with Sam that, I mean, AI has made such a big shift and it&#39;s really across the spectrum. And when I think about it, there&#39;s almost three tiers when you look at the stack. You start off at the raw audio where AI is doing those things like noise suppression, echo cancellation, voice enhancements. All of that just makes this amazing audio signal that can then go into the next layer, which is the speech AI and natural language processing. Which starts to open up those items such as the real-time transcription, translation, searchable content to make the communication not just what&#39;s heard, but making it more accessible to more individuals and inclusive by providing that content in a format that is best for them.

And then you take those two layers and put the generative and agentic AI on top of that, that can start surfacing insights, summarize the conversation, and even take actions on someone&#39;s behalf. It really starts to change the way that people work and how they have access and allows them to connect. I think it is a huge shift and I&#39;m very excited by how those three levels start to interact to really enable people to do more and to connect thanks to AI.

Megan: Yeah. Absolutely. So much rich information that can come out from a single call now because of those sorts of tools. And following on from that, Brendan, I mean, you mentioned before the Zoom AI Companion. I wondered if you could talk a bit about what were your top priorities when building that product to ensure it was truly useful for your customers?

Brendan: Definitely. When we developed AI Companion, we had two priority focus areas from day one, trust and security, and then accuracy and relevance. On the trust side, it was a non-negotiable that customer data wouldn&#39;t be used to train our models. People need to know that their conversations and content are private and secure.

Brendan: And then with accuracy, we needed to ensure AI outputs weren&#39;t generic but grounded in the actual context of a meeting, a chat or a product. But the real story here when I think about AI Companion is the customer value that it delivers. AI Companion helps people save time with meeting recaps, task generation, and proactive prep for the next session. It reduces that friction in hybrid work, whether you&#39;re in a meeting room, a Zoom room, or collaborating across different collaboration tools like Microsoft or Google. And it enables more equitable participation by surfacing the right context for everyone no matter where and how they&#39;re working.

All this leads to a result where it&#39;s practical, trustworthy, and embedded where work happens. And it&#39;s just not another tool to manage, it&#39;s there in someone&#39;s flow of work to help them along the way.

Megan: Yeah. That trust piece is just so important, isn&#39;t it, today? And Sam, as much as AI has impacted audio innovation, audio has also had an impact on AI capabilities. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about audio as a data input and the advancements technologies like large language models, LLMs, are enabling.

Sam: Absolutely. Audio is really a rich data source that&#39;s added a new dimension to AI capabilities. If you think about speech recognition or natural language processing, they&#39;ve had significant advances due to audio data that&#39;s provided for them. And to Brendan&#39;s point about trust and accuracy, I like to think of the products that Shure enables customers with as essentially the eyes and ears in the room for leading AI companions just like the Zoom AI Companion. You really need that pristine audio input to be able to trust the accuracy of what the AI generates. These AI Companions have been very instrumental in the way we do business every day. I mean, between transcription, speaker attributions, the ability to add action items within a meeting and be able to track what&#39;s happening in our interactions, all of that really has to rely on that accurate and pristine input from audio into the AI. I feel that further improves the trust that our end users have to the results of AI and be able to leverage it more.

If you think about it, if you look at how AI audio inputs enhance that interactive AI system, it enables more natural and intuitive interactions with AI. And it really allows for that seamless integration and the ability for users to use it without having to worry about, is the room set up correctly? Is the audio level proper? And when we talk even about agentic AI, we&#39;re working on future developments where systems can self-heal or detect that there are issues in the environment so that they can autocorrect and adapt in all these different environments and further enable the AI to be able to do a much more effective job, if you will.

Megan: Sam, you touched on future developments there. I wonder if we could close our conversation today with a bit of a future forward look, if we could. Brendan, can you share innovations that Zoom is working on now and what are you most excited to see come to fruition?

Brendan: Well, your timing for this question is absolutely perfect because we&#39;ve just wrapped up Zoomtopia 2025.

Brendan: And this is where we discussed a lot of the new AI innovations that we have coming to Zoom. Starting off, there&#39;s AI Companion 3.0. And we&#39;ve launched this next generation of agentic AI capabilities in Zoom Workplace. And with 3.0 when it releases, it isn&#39;t just about transcribing, it&#39;s turned into really a platform that helps you with follow-up task, prep for your next conversation, and even proactively suggest how to free up your time. For example, AI Companion can help you schedule meetings intelligently across time zones, suggest which meetings you can skip, and still stay informed and even prepare you with context and insights before you walk into the conversation. It&#39;s about helping people focus on strategy and creativity instead of administrative busy work. And for hybrid work specifically, we introduced Zoomie Group Assistant, which will be a big leap for hybrid collaboration.

Acting as an assistant for a group chat and meetings, you can simply ask, “@Zoomie, what&#39;s the latest update on the project?” Or “@Zoomie, what are the team&#39;s action items?” And then get instant answers. Or because we&#39;re talking about audio here, you can go into a conference room and say, &quot;Hey, Zoomie,&quot; and get help with things like checking into a room, adjusting lights, temperature, or even sharing your screen. And while all these are built-in features, we&#39;re also expanding the platform to allow custom AI agents through our AI Studio, so organizations can bring their own agents or integrate with third-party ones.

Zoom has always believed in an open platform and philosophy and that is continuing. Folks using AI Companion 3.0 will be able to use agents across platforms to work with the workflows that they have across all the different SaaS vendors that they might have in their environment, whether that&#39;s Google, Microsoft, ServiceNow, Cisco, and so many other tools.

Megan: Fantastic. It certainly sounds like a tool I could use in my work, so I look forward to hearing more about that. And Sam, we&#39;ve touched on there are so many exciting things happening in audio too. What are you working on at Shure? And what are you most excited to see come to fruition?

Sam: At Shure, our engineering teams are really working on a range of exciting projects, but particularly we&#39;re working on developing new collaboration solutions that are integral for IT end users. And these integrate obviously with the leading UC platforms.

We&#39;re integrating audio and video technologies that are scalable, reliable solutions. And we want to be able to seamlessly connect these to cloud services so that we can leverage both AI technologies and the tool sets available to optimize every type of workspace essentially. Not just meeting rooms, but lecture halls, work from home scenarios, et cetera.

The other area that we really focus on in terms of our reliability and quality really comes from our DNA in the pro audio world. And that&#39;s really all-around wireless audio technologies. We&#39;re developing our next-generation wireless systems and these are going to offer even greater reliability and range. And they really become ideal for everything from a large-scale event to personal home use and the gamut across that whole spectrum. And I think all of that in partnership with our partners like Zoom will help just facilitate the modern workspace.

Megan: Absolutely. So much exciting innovation clearly going on behind the scenes. Thank you both so much.

Hackers made death threats against this security researcher. Big mistake.

In April 2024, a mysterious someone using the online handles “Waifu” and “Judische” began posting death threats on Telegram and Discord channels aimed at a cybersecurity researcher named Allison Nixon.These anonymous personas targeted Nixon because she had become a formidable threat: As chief research officer at the cyber investigations firm Unit 221B, named after Sherlock Holmes’s apartment, she had built a career tracking cybercriminals and helping get them arrested.Though she’d done this work for more than a decade, Nixon couldn’t understand why the person behind the accounts was suddenly threatening her. And although she had taken an interest in the Waifu persona in years past for crimes he boasted about committing, he hadn’t been on her radar for a while when the threats began, because she was tracking other targets.Now Nixon resolved to unmask Waifu/Judische and others responsible for the death threats—and take them down for crimes they admitted to committing.

ALS stole this musician’s voice. AI let him sing again.

There are tears in the audience as Patrick Darling’s song begins to play. It’s a heartfelt song written for his great-grandfather, whom he never got the chance to meet. But this performance is emotional for another reason: It’s Darling’s first time on stage with his bandmates since he lost the ability to sing two years ago.

The 32-year-old musician was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) when he was 29 years old. Like other types of motor neuron disease, it affects nerves that supply the body’s muscles. People with ALS eventually lose the ability to control their muscles, including those that allow them to move, speak, and breathe.

Darling’s last stage performance was over two years ago. By that point, he had already lost the ability to stand and play his instruments and was struggling to sing or speak. But recently, he was able to re-create his lost voice using an AI tool trained on snippets of old audio recordings. Another AI tool has enabled him to use this “voice clone” to compose new songs. Darling is able to make music again. Read the full story.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/16/1132516/cesar-de-la-fuente-using-ai-antibiotics-hunt/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When he was just a teenager trying to decide what to do with his life, César de la Fuente compiled a list of the world’s biggest problems. He ranked them inversely by how much money governments were spending to solve them. Antimicrobial resistance topped the list.

Twenty years on, the problem has not gone away. If anything, it’s gotten worse. Infections caused by bacteria, fungi, and viruses that have evolved ways to evade treatments are now associated with more than 4 million deaths per year, and a recent analysis, published in the Lancet, predicts that number could surge past 8 million by 2050. In a July 2025 essay in Physical Review Letters, de la Fuente, now a bioengineer and computational biologist, and synthetic biologist James Collins warned of a looming “post­antibiotic” era in which infections from drug-resistant strains of common bacteria like Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus, which can often still be treated by our current arsenal of medications, become fatal. “The antibiotic discovery pipeline remains perilously thin,” they wrote, “impeded by high development costs, lengthy timelines, and low returns on investment.”

But de la Fuente is using artificial intelligence to bring about a different future. His team at the University of Pennsylvania is training AI tools to search genomes far and deep for peptides with antibiotic properties. His vision is to assemble those peptides—molecules made of up to 50 amino acids linked together—into various configurations, including some never seen in nature. The results, he hopes, could defend the body against microbes that withstand traditional treatments.

His quest has unearthed promising candidates in unexpected places. In August 2025 his team, which includes 16 scientists in Penn’s Machine Biology Group, described peptides hiding in the genetic code of ancient single-celled organisms called archaea. Before that, they’d excavated a list of candidates from the venom of snakes, wasps, and spiders. And in an ongoing project de la Fuente calls “molecular de-­extinction,” he and his collaborators have been scanning published genetic sequences of extinct species for potentially functional molecules. Those species include hominids like Neanderthals and Denisovans and charismatic megafauna like woolly mammoths, as well as ancient zebras and penguins. In the history of life on Earth, de la Fuente reasons, maybe some organism evolved an antimicrobial defense that could be helpful today. Those long-gone codes have given rise to resurrected compounds with names like ­mammuthusin-2 (from woolly mammoth DNA), mylodonin-2 (from the giant sloth), and hydrodamin-1 (from the ancient sea cow). Over the last few years, this molecular binge has enabled de la Fuente to amass a library of more than a million genetic recipes.

At 40 years old, de la Fuente has also collected a trophy case of awards from the American Society for Microbiology, the American Chemical Society, and other organizations. (In 2019, this magazine named him one of “35 Innovators Under 35” for bringing computational approaches to antibiotic discovery.) He’s widely recognized as a leader in the effort to harness AI for real-world problems. “He’s really helped pioneer that space,” says Collins, who is at MIT. (The two have not collaborated in the laboratory, but Collins has long been at the forefront of using AI for drug discovery, including the search for antibiotics. In 2020, Collins’s team used an AI model to predict a broad-­spectrum antibiotic, halicin, that is now in preclinical development.)

The world of antibiotic development needs as much creativity and innovation as researchers can muster, says Collins. And de la Fuente’s work on peptides has pushed the field forward: “César is marvelously talented, very innovative.”

De la Fuente describes antimicrobial resistance as an “almost impossible” problem, but he sees plenty of room for exploration in the word almost. “I like challenges,” he says, “and I think this is the ultimate challenge.”

The use, overuse, and misuse of antibiotics, he says, drives antimicrobial resistance. And the problem is growing unchecked because conventional ways to find, make, and test the drugs are prohibitively expensive and often lead to dead ends. “A lot of the companies that have attempted to do antibiotic development in the past have ended up folding because there’s no good return on investment at the end of the day,” he says.

Antibiotic discovery has always been a messy, noisy endeavor, driven by serendipity and fraught with uncertainty and misdirection. For decades, researchers have largely relied on brute-force mechanical methods. “Scientists dig into soil, they dig into water,” says de la Fuente. “And then from that complex organic matter they try to extract antimicrobial molecules.”

But molecules can be extraordinarily complex. Researchers have estimated the number of possible organic combinations that could be synthesized at somewhere around 1060. For reference, Earth contains an estimated 1018 grains of sand. “Drug discovery in any domain is a statistics game,” says Jonathan Stokes, a chemical biologist at McMaster University in Canada, who has been using generative AI to design potential new antibiotics that can be synthesized in a lab, and who worked with Collins on halicin. “You need enough shots on goal to happen to get one.”

Those have to be good shots, though. And AI seems well suited to improving researchers’ aim. Biology is an information source, de la Fuente explains: “It’s like a bunch of code.” The code of DNA has four letters; proteins and peptides have 20, where each “letter” represents an amino acid. De la Fuente says his work amounts to training AI models to recognize sequences of letters that encode antimicrobial peptides, or AMPs. “If you think about it that way,” he says, “you can devise algorithms to mine the code and identify functional molecules, which can be antimicrobials. Or antimalarials. Or anticancer agents.”

Practically speaking, we’re still not there: These peptides haven’t yet been transformed into usable drugs that help people, and there are plenty of details—dosage, delivery, specific targets—that need to be sorted out, says de la Fuente. But AMPs are appealing because the body already uses them.They’re a critical part of the immune system and often the first line of defense against pathogenic infections. Unlike conventional antibiotics, which typically have one trick for killing bacteria, AMPs often exhibit a multimodal approach. They may disrupt the cell wall and the genetic material inside as well as a variety of cellular processes. A bacterial pathogen may evolve resistance to a conventional drug’s single mode of action, but maybe not to a multipronged AMP attack.

De la Fuente’s group is one of many pushing the boundaries of using AI for antibiotics. Where he focuses primarily on peptides, Collins works on small-molecule discovery. So does Stokes, at McMaster, whose models identify promising new molecules and predict whether they can be synthesized. “It’s only been a few years since folks have been using AI meaningfully in drug discovery,” says Collins.

Even in that short time the tools have changed, says James Zou, a computer scientist at Stanford University, who has worked with Stokes and Collins. Researchers have moved from using predictive models to developing generative approaches. With a predictive approach, Zou says, researchers screen large libraries of candidates that are known to be promising. Generative approaches offer something else: the appeal of designing a new molecule from scratch. Last year, for example, de la Fuente’s team used one generative AI model to design a suite of synthetic peptides and another to assess them. The group tested two of the resulting compounds on mice infected with a drug-resistant strain of Acinetobacter baumannii, a germ that the World Health Organization has identified as a “critical priority” in research on antimicrobial resistance. Both successfully and safely treated the infection.

But the field is still in the discovery phase. In his current work, de la Fuente is trying to get candidates closer to clinical testing. To that end, his team is developing an ambitious multimodal model called ApexOracle that’s designed to analyze a new pathogen, pinpoint its genetic weaknesses, match it to antimicrobial peptides that might work against it, and then predict how an antibiotic, built from those peptides, would fare in lab tests. It “converges understanding in chemistry, genomics, and language,” he says. It’s preliminary, he adds, but even if it doesn’t work perfectly, it will help steer the next generation of AI models toward the ultimate goal of resisting resistance.

Using AI, he believes, human researchers now have a fighting chance at catching up to the giant threat before them. The technology has already saved decades of human research time. Now he wants it to save lives, too: “This is the world that we live in today, and it’s incredible.”

            <h2>Hackers made death threats against this security researcher. Big mistake.</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/16/1132526/allison-nixon-hackers-security-researcher/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In April 2024, a mysterious someone using the online handles “Waifu” and “Judische” began posting death threats on Telegram and Discord channels aimed at a cybersecurity researcher named Allison Nixon.

“Alison [sic] Nixon is gonna get necklaced with a tire filled with gasoline soon,” wrote Waifu/Judische, both of which are words with offensive connotations. “Decerebration is my fav type of brain death, thats whats gonna happen to alison Nixon.”

It wasn’t long before others piled on. Someone shared AI-generated nudes of Nixon.

These anonymous personas targeted Nixon because she had become a formidable threat: As chief research officer at the cyber investigations firm Unit 221B, named after Sherlock Holmes’s apartment, she had built a career tracking cybercriminals and helping get them arrested. For years she had lurked quietly in online chat channels or used pseudonyms to engage with perpetrators directly while piecing together clues they’d carelessly drop about themselves and their crimes. This had helped her bring to justice a number of cybercriminals—especially members of a loosely affiliated subculture of anarchic hackers who call themselves the Com.

But members of the Com aren’t just involved in hacking; some of them also engage in offline violence against researchers who track them. This includes bricking (throwing a brick through a victim’s window) and swatting (a dangerous type of hoax that involves reporting a false murder or hostage situation at someone’s home so SWAT teams will swarm it with guns drawn). Members of a Com offshoot known as 764 have been accused of even more violent acts—including animal torture, stabbings, and school shootings—or of inciting others in and outside the Com to commit these crimes.

Nixon started tracking members of the community more than a decade ago, when other researchers and people in law enforcement were largely ignoring them because they were young—many in their teens. Her early attention allowed her to develop strategies for unmasking them.

Ryan Brogan, a special agent with the FBI, says Nixon has helped him and colleagues identify and arrest more than two dozen members of the community since 2011, when he first began working with her, and that her skills in exposing them are unparalleled. “If you get on Allison’s and my radar, you’re going [down]. It’s just a matter of time,” he says. “No matter how much digital anonymity and tradecraft you try to apply, you’re done.”

Though she’d done this work for more than a decade, Nixon couldn’t understand why the person behind the Waifu/Judische accounts was suddenly threatening her. She had given media interviews about the Com—most recently on 60 Minutes—but not about her work unmasking members to get them arrested, so the hostility seemed to come out of the blue. And although she had taken an interest in the Waifu persona in years past for crimes he boasted about committing, he hadn’t been on her radar for a while when the threats began, because she was tracking other targets.

Now Nixon resolved to unmask Waifu/Judische and others responsible for the death threats—and take them down for crimes they admitted to committing. “Prior to them death-threatening me, I had no reason to pay attention to them,” she says.

Most people have never heard of the Com, but its influence and threat are growing.

It’s an online community comprising loosely affiliated groups of, primarily, teens and twentysomethings in North America and English-speaking parts of Europe who have become part of what some call a cybercrime youth movement.

International laws and norms, and fears of retaliation, prevent states from going all out in cyber operations. That doesn’t stop the anarchic Com.

Over the last decade, its criminal activities have escalated from simple distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that disrupt websites to SIM-swapping hacks that hijack a victim’s phone service, as well as crypto theft, ransomware attacks, and corporate data theft. These crimes have affected AT&T, Microsoft, Uber, and others. Com members have also been involved in various forms of sextortion aimed at forcing victims to physically harm themselves or record themselves doing sexually explicit activities. The Com’s impact has also spread beyond the digital realm to kidnapping, beatings, and other violence.

One longtime cybercrime researcher, who asked to remain anonymous because of his work, says the Com is as big a threat in the cyber realm as Russia and China—for one unusual reason.

“There’s only so far that China is willing to go; there’s only so far that Russia or North Korea is willing to go,” he says, referring to international laws and norms, and fears of retaliation, that prevent states from going all out in cyber operations. That doesn’t stop the anarchic Com, he says.

“It is a pretty significant threat, and people tend to … push it under the rug [because] it’s just a bunch of kids,” he says. “But look at the impact [they have].”

Brogan says the amount of damage they do in terms of monetary losses “can become staggering very quickly.”

There is no single site where Com members congregate; they spread across a number of web forums and Telegram and Discord channels. The group follows a long line of hacking and subculture communities that emerged online over the last two decades, gained notoriety, and then faded or vanished after prominent members were arrested or other factors caused their decline. They differed in motivation and activity, but all emerged from “the same primordial soup,” says Nixon. The Com’s roots can be traced to the Scene, which began as a community of various “warez” groups engaged in pirating computer games, music, and movies.

When Nixon began looking at the Scene, in 2011, its members were hijacking gaming accounts, launching DDoS attacks, and running booter services. (DDoS attacks overwhelm a server or computer with traffic from bot-controlled machines, preventing legitimate traffic from getting through; booters are tools that anyone can rent to launch a DDoS attack against a target of choice.) While they made some money, their primary goal was notoriety.

This changed around 2018. Cryptocurrency values were rising, and the Com—or the Community, as it sometimes called itself—emerged as a subgroup that ultimately took over the Scene. Members began to focus on financial gain—cryptocurrency theft, data theft, and extortion.

The pandemic two years later saw a surge in Com membership that Nixon attributes to social isolation and the forced movement of kids online for schooling. But she believes economic conditions and socialization problems have also driven its growth. Many Com members can’t get jobs because they lack skills or have behavioral issues, she says. A number who have been arrested have had troubled home lives and difficulty adapting to school, and some have shown signs of mental illness. The Com provides camaraderie, support, and an outlet for personal frustrations. Since 2018, it has also offered some a solution to their money problems.

Loose-knit cells have sprouted from the community—Star Fraud, ShinyHunters, Scattered Spider, Lapsus$—to collaborate on clusters of crime. They usually target high-profile crypto bros and tech giants and have made millions of dollars from theft and extortion, according to court records.

But dominance, power, and bragging rights are still motivators, even in profit operations, says the cybercrime researcher, which is partly why members target “big whales.”

“There is financial gain,” he says, “but it’s also [sending a message that] I can reach out and touch the people that think they’re untouchable.” In fact, Nixon says, some members of the Com have overwhelming ego-driven motivations that end up conflicting with their financial motives.

“Often their financial schemes fall apart because of their ego, and that phenomenon is also what I’ve made my career on,” she says.

Nixon has straight dark hair, wears wire-rimmed glasses, and has a slight build and bookish demeanor that, on first impression, could allow her to pass for a teen herself. She talks about her work in rapid cadences, like someone whose brain is filled with facts that are under pressure to get out, and she exudes a sense of urgency as she tries to make people understand the threat the Com poses. She doesn’t suppress her happiness when someone she’s been tracking gets arrested.

In 2011, when she first began investigating the communities from which the Com emerged, she was working the night shift in the security operations center of the security firm SecureWorks. The center responded to tickets and security alerts emanating from customer networks, but Nixon coveted a position on the company’s counter-threats team, which investigated and published threat-intelligence reports on mostly state-sponsored hacking groups from China and Russia. Without connections or experience, she had no path to investigative work. But Nixon is an intensely curious person, and this created its own path.

Where the threat team focused on the impact hackers had on customer networks—how they broke in, what they stole—Nixon was more interested in their motivations and the personality traits that drove their actions. She assumed there must be online forums where criminal hackers congregated, so she googled “hacking forums” and landed on a site called Hack Forums.

She was surprised to see members openly discussing their crimes there. She reached out to someone on the SecureWorks threat team to see if he was aware of the site, and he dismissed it as a place for “script kiddies”—a pejorative term for unskilled hackers.

This was a time when many cybersecurity pros were shifting their focus away from cybercrime to state-sponsored hacking operations, which were more sophisticated and getting a lot of attention. But Nixon likes to zig where others zag, and her colleague’s dismissiveness fueled her interest in the forums. Two other SecureWorks colleagues shared that interest, and the three studied the forums during downtime on their shifts. They focused on trying to identify the people running DDoS booters.

What Nixon loved about the forums was how accessible they were to a beginner like herself. Threat-intelligence teams require privileged access to a victim’s network to investigate breaches. But Nixon could access everything she needed in the public forums, where the hackers seemed to think no one was watching. Because of this, they often made mistakes in operational security, or OPSEC—letting slip little biographical facts such as the city where they lived, a school they attended, or a place they used to work. These details revealed in their chats, combined with other information, could help expose the real identities behind their anonymous masks.

“It was a shock to me that it was relatively easy to figure out who [they were],” she says.

She wasn’t bothered by the immature boasting and petty fights that dominated the forums. “A lot of people don’t like to do this work of reading chat logs. I realize that this is a very uncommon thing. And maybe my brain is built a little weird that I’m willing to do this,” she says. “I have a special talent that I can wade through garbage and it doesn’t bother me.”

Nixon soon realized that not all the members were script kiddies. Some exhibited real ingenuity and “powerful” skills, she says, but because they were applying these to frivolous purposes—hijacking gamer accounts instead of draining bank accounts—researchers and law enforcement were ignoring them. Nixon began tracking them, suspecting that they would eventually direct their skills at more significant targets—an intuition that proved to be correct. And when they did, she had already amassed a wealth of information about them.

She continued her DDoS research for two years until a turning point in 2013, when the cybersecurity journalist Brian Krebs, who made a career tracking cybercriminals, got swatted.

About a dozen people from the security community worked with Krebs to expose the perpetrator, and Nixon was invited to help. Krebs sent her pieces of the puzzle to investigate, and eventually the group identified the culprit (though it would take two years for him to be arrested). When she was invited to dinner with Krebs and the other investigators, she realized she’d found her people.

“It was an amazing moment for me,” she says. “I was like, wow, there’s all these like-minded people that just want to help and are doing it just for the love of the game, basically.”

It was porn stars who provided Nixon with her next big research focus—one that underscored her skill at spotting Com actors and criminal trends in their nascent stages, before they emerged as major threats.

In 2018, someone was hijacking the social media accounts of certain adult-film stars and using those accounts to blast out crypto scams to their large follower bases. Nixon couldn’t figure out how the hackers had hijacked the social media profiles, but she promised to help the actors regain access to their accounts if they agreed to show her the private messages the hackers had sent or received during the time they controlled them. These messages led her to a forum where members were talking about how they stole the accounts. The hackers had tricked some of these actors into disclosing the mobile phone numbers of others. Then they used a technique called SIM swapping to reset passwords for social media accounts belonging to those other stars, locking them out.

In SIM swapping, fraudsters get a victim’s phone number assigned to a SIM card and phone they control, so that calls and messages intended for the victim go to them instead. This includes one-time security codes that sites text to account holders to verify themselves when accessing their account or changing its password. In some of the cases involving the porn stars, the hackers had manipulated telecom workers into making the SIM swaps for what they thought were legitimate reasons, and in other cases they bribed the workers to make the change. The hackers were then able to alter the password on the actors’ social media accounts, lock out the owners, and use the accounts to advertise their crypto scams.

SIM swapping is a powerful technique that can be used to hijack and drain entire cryptocurrency and bank accounts, so Nixon was surprised to see the fraudsters using it for relatively unprofitable schemes. But SIM swapping had rarely been used for financial fraud at that point, and like the earlier hackers Nixon had seen on Hack Forums, the ones hijacking porn star accounts didn’t seem to grasp the power of the technique they were using. Nixon suspected that this would change and SIM swapping would soon become a major problem, so she shifted her research focus accordingly. It didn’t take long for the fraudsters to pivot as well.

Nixon’s skill at looking ahead in this way has served her throughout her career. On multiple occasions a hacker or hacking group would catch her attention—for using a novel hacking approach in some minor operation, for example—and she’d begin tracking their online posts and chats in the belief that they’d eventually do something significant with that skill.

They usually did. When they later grabbed headlines with a showy or impactful operation, these hackers would seem to others to have emerged from nowhere, sending researchers and law enforcement scrambling to understand who they were. But Nixon would already have a dossier compiled on them and, in some cases, had unmasked their real identity as well. Lizard Squad was an example of this. The group burst into the headlines in 2014 and 2015 with a series of high-profile DDoS campaigns, but Nixon and colleagues at the job where she worked at the time had already been watching its members as individuals for a while. So the FBI sought their assistance in identifying them.

“The thing about these young hackers is that they … keep going until they get arrested, but it takes years for them to get arrested,” she says. “So a huge aspect of my career is just sitting on this information that has not been actioned [yet].”

It was during the Lizard Squad years that Nixon began developing tools to scrape and record hacker communications online, though it would be years before she began using these concepts to scrape the Com chatrooms and forums. These channels held a wealth of data that might not seem useful during the nascent stage of a hacker’s career but could prove critical later, when law enforcement got around to investigating them; yet the contents were always at risk of being deleted by Com members or getting taken down by law enforcement when it seized websites and chat channels.

Nixon’s work is unique because she engages with the actors in chat spaces to draw out information from them that “would not be otherwise normally available.”

Over several years, she scraped and preserved whatever chatrooms she was investigating. But it wasn’t until early 2020, when she joined Unit 221B, that she got the chance to scrape the Telegram and Discord channels of the Com. She pulled all of this data together into a searchable platform that other researchers and law enforcement could use. The company hired two former hackers to help build scraping tools and infrastructure for this work; the result is eWitness, a community-driven, invitation-­only platform. It was initially seeded only with data Nixon had collected after she arrived at Unit 221B, but has since been augmented with data that other users of the platform have scraped from Com social spaces as well, some of which doesn’t exist in public forums anymore.

Brogan, of the FBI, says it’s an incredibly valuable tool, made more so by Nixon’s own contributions. Other security firms scrape online criminal spaces as well, but they seldom share the content with outsiders, and Brogan says Nixon’s work is unique because she engages with the actors in chat spaces to draw out information from them that “would not be otherwise normally available.”

The preservation project she started when she got to Unit 221B could not have been better timed, because it coincided with the pandemic, the surge in new Com membership, and the emergence of two disturbing Com offshoots, CVLT and 764. She was able to capture their chats as these groups first emerged; after law enforcement arrested leaders of the groups and took control of the servers where their chats were posted, this material went offline.

CVLT—pronounced “cult”—was reportedly founded around 2019 with a focus on sextortion and child sexual abuse material. 764 emerged from CVLT and was spearheaded by a 15-year-old in Texas named Bradley Cadenhead, who named it after the first digits of his zip code. Its focus was extremism and violence.

In 2021, because of what she observed in these groups, Nixon turned her attention to sextortion among Com members.

The type of sextortion they engaged in has its roots in activity that began a decade ago as “fan signing.” Hackers would use the threat of doxxing to coerce someone, usually a young female, into writing the hacker’s handle on a piece of paper. The hacker would use a photo of it as an avatar on his online accounts—a kind of trophy. Eventually some began blackmailing victims into writing the hacker’s handle on their face, breasts, or genitals. With CVLT, this escalated even further; targets were blackmailed into carving a Com member’s name into their skin or engaging in sexually explicit acts while recording or livestreaming themselves.

During the pandemic a surprising number of SIM swappers crossed into child sexual abuse material and sadistic sextortion, according to Nixon. She hates tracking this gruesome activity, but she saw an opportunity to exploit it for good. She had long been frustrated at how leniently judges treated financial fraudsters because of their crimes’ seemingly nonviolent nature. But she saw a chance to get harsher sentences for them if she could tie them to their sextortion and began to focus on these crimes.

At this point, Waifu still wasn’t on her radar. But that was about to change.

Nixon landed in Waifu’s crosshairs after he and fellow members of the Com were involved in a large hack involving AT&T customer call records in April 2024.

Waifu’s group gained access to dozens of cloud accounts with Snowflake, a company that provides online data storage for customers. One of those customers had more than 50 billion call logs of AT&T wireless subscribers stored in its Snowflake account.

They tried to re-extort the telecom, threatening on social media to leak the records. They tagged the FBI in the post. “It’s like they were begging to be investigated,” says Nixon.

Among the subscriber records were call logs for FBI agents who were AT&T customers. Nixon and other researchers believe the hackers may have been able to identify the phone numbers of agents through other means. Then they may have used a reverse-lookup program to identify the owners of phone numbers that the agents called or that called them and found Nixon’s number among them. This is when they began harassing her.

But then they got reckless. They allegedly extorted nearly $400,000 from AT&T in exchange for promising to delete the call records they’d stolen. Then they tried to re-extort the telecom, threatening on social media to leak the records they claimed to have deleted if it didn’t pay more. They tagged the FBI in the post.

“It’s like they were begging to be investigated,” says Nixon.

The Snowflake breaches and AT&T records theft were grabbing headlines at the time, but Nixon had no idea her number was in the stolen logs or that Waifu/Judische was a prime suspect in the breaches. So she was perplexed when he started taunting and threatening her online.

Over several weeks in May and June, a pattern developed. Waifu or one of his associates would post a threat against her and then post a message online inviting her to talk. She assumes now that they believed she was helping law enforcement investigate the Snowflake breaches and hoped to draw her into a dialogue to extract information from her about what authorities knew. But Nixon wasn’t helping the FBI investigate them yet. It was only after she began looking at Waifu for the threats that she became aware of his suspected role in the Snowflake hack.

It wasn’t the first time she had studied him, though. Waifu had come to her attention in 2019 when he bragged about framing another Com member for a hoax bomb threat and later talked about his involvement in SIM-swapping operations. He made an impression on her. He clearly had technical skills, but Nixon says he also often appeared immature, impulsive, and emotionally unstable, and he was desperate for attention in his interactions with other members. He bragged about not needing sleep and using Adderall to hack through the night. He was also a bit reckless about protecting personal details. He wrote in private chats to another researcher that he would never get caught because he was good at OPSEC, but he also told the researcher that he lived in Canada—which turned out to be true.

Nixon’s process for unmasking Waifu followed a general recipe she used to unmask Com members: She’d draw a large investigative circle around a target and all the personas that communicated with that person online, and then study their interactions to narrow the circle to the people with the most significant connections to the target. Some of the best leads came from a target’s enemies; she could glean a lot of information about their identity, personality, and activities from what the people they fought with online said about them.

“The enemies and the ex-girlfriends, generally speaking, are the best [for gathering intelligence on a suspect],” she says. “I love them.”

While she was doing this, Waifu and his group were reaching out to other security researchers, trying to glean information about Nixon and what she might be investigating. They also attempted to plant false clues with the researchers by dropping the names of other cybercriminals in Canada who could plausibly be Waifu. Nixon had never seen cybercriminals engage in counterintelligence tactics like this.

Amid this subterfuge and confusion, Nixon and another researcher working with her did a lot of consulting and cross-checking with other researchers about the clues they were gathering to ensure they had the right name before they gave it to the FBI.

By July she and the researcher were convinced they had their guy: Connor Riley Moucka, a 25-year-old high school dropout living with his grandfather in Ontario. On October 30, Royal Canadian Mounted Police converged on Moucka’s home and arrested him.

According to an affidavit filed in Canadian court, a plainclothes Canadian police officer visited Moucka’s house under some pretense on the afternoon of October 21, nine days before the arrest, to secretly capture a photo of him and compare it with an image US authorities had provided. The officer knocked and rang the bell; Moucka opened the door looking disheveled and told the visitor: “You woke me up, sir.” He told the officer his name was Alex; Moucka sometimes used the alias Alexander Antonin Moucka. Satisfied that the person who answered the door was the person the US was seeking, the officer left. Waifu’s online rants against Nixon escalated at this point, as did his attempts at misdirection. She believes the visit to his door spooked him.

Nixon won’t say exactly how they unmasked Moucka—only that he made a mistake.

“I don’t want to train these people in how to not get caught [by revealing his error],” she says.

The Canadian affidavit against Moucka reveals a number of other violent posts he’s alleged to have made online beyond the threats he made against her. Some involve musings about becoming a serial killer or mass-mailing sodium nitrate pills to Black people in Michigan and Ohio; in another, his online persona talks about obtaining firearms to “kill Canadians” and commit “suicide by cop.”

Prosecutors, who list Moucka’s online aliases as including Waifu, Judische, and two more in the indictment, say he and others extorted at least $2.5 million from at least three victims whose data they stole from Snowflake accounts. Moucka has been charged with nearly two dozen counts, including conspiracy, unauthorized access to computers, extortion, and wire fraud. He has pleaded not guilty and was extradited to the US last July. His trial is scheduled for October this year, though hacking cases usually end in plea agreements rather than going to trial.

It took months for authorities to arrest Moucka after Nixon and her colleague shared their findings with the authorities, but an alleged associate of his in the Snowflake conspiracy, a US Army soldier named Cameron John Wagenius (Kiberphant0m online), was arrested more quickly.

On November 10, 2024, Nixon and her team found a mistake Wagenius made that helped identify him, and on December 20 he was arrested. Wagenius has already pleaded guilty to two charges around the sale or attempted sale of confidential phone records and will be sentenced this March.

These days Nixon continues to investigate sextortion among Com members. But she says that remaining members of Waifu’s group still taunt and threaten her.

“They are continuing to persist in their nonsense, and they are getting taken out one by one,” she says. “And I’m just going to keep doing that until there’s no one left on that side.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Venture capital has long avoided ‘hard’ sectors such as government, defence, energy, manufacturing, and hardware, viewing them as uninvestable because startups have limited scope to challenge incumbents. Instead, investors have prioritised fast-moving and lightly regulated software markets with lower barriers to entry.

End users in these hard industries have paid the price, as a lack of innovation funding has left them stuck with incumbent providers that continue to deliver clunky, unintuitive solutions that are difficult to migrate from.

However, that perception is now shifting. Investors are responding to new market dynamics within complex industries and the evolving methods startups are using to outperform incumbents.

Government technology spending more than doubled between 2021 and 2025, while defence technology more than doubled in 2025 alone, and we see similar trends in robotics, industrial technology, and healthcare.  This signals a clear change in investor mindset as AI-first approaches are changing adoption cycles.

Historically, those sectors had been viewed as incompatible with venture capital norms: slow procurement cycles, strict regulation, heavy operational and capital requirements, as well as deep integration into physical systems.

For example, on a global level, public procurement can take years, constrained by budgeting cycles, legislation and accountability frameworks. Energy projects must comply with regulatory regimes and national permitting structures, and infrastructure and hardware deployments require extensive certification and long engineering cycles.

Government and public-sector buyers also tend to prioritise reliability, compliance, track record, and legacy relationships over speed, meaning major contracts often go to incumbents rather than startups. Similar dynamics exist in construction, mining, logistics, and manufacturing, all sectors that are still dominated by legacy vendors, complex supply chains, and thin operational margins.

That view is now changing. Capital is increasingly flowing into sectors once seen as too bureaucratic or operationally complex. Beyond those headline sectors, construction tech, industrial automation, logistics software, healthcare, and public-sector tooling are attracting record levels of early-stage and growth capital.

The key question is: what is driving this shift in investor thinking?

The shift in investor priorities is partly driven by macro and geopolitical pressures. Supply-chain disruption, energyinsecurity and infrastructure fragility have elevated industrial resilience to a national priority. Governments are investing heavily in grid modernisation, logistics networks, and critical infrastructure, while public institutions face mounting pressure to digitise procurement, compliance, and workflow systems.

What were once considered slow, bureaucratic markets are now seen as structurally supported by policy and long-term demand.

AI is the driving force and is reshaping traditionally hard industries. By lowering the cost of building sophisticated software and enabling immediate performance gains with shorter adoption cycles, AI allows startups to compete with incumbents in sectors such as construction, mining, manufacturing, logistics, and public services from day one.

As software becomes easier to replicate, defensibility is shifting toward operational depth, substantial UI/UX improvements, speed to market, and more seamless integration into complex real-world systems.

Finally, saturation in horizontal SaaS has pushed investors to look elsewhere for differentiated returns. Crowded softwarecategories offer diminishing breakout potential and are often threatened by OpenAI and Anthropic’s fast pace of innovation, whereas regulated and infrastructure-heavy sectors provide less competition, stronger pricing power, higher switching costs, and gigantic TAMs.

SAP with a $200B cap is just an example, but the same goes for Caterpillar, Siemens, Big Utilities, Big Pharma, and many others.

Regulation, once viewed as a deterrent, is increasingly understood as a moat. Startups that successfully navigate procurement frameworks, compliance regimes, and industry standards build advantages that are difficult for new entrants to replicate and cannot be vibe-coded.

Legacy players, while trying to adopt new AI tooling as quickly as they can, still struggle to adapt their workflows and scale innovation as quickly as younger companies can. Their dominance has relied on the high cost of switching away from their solutions, but as attention and investment shift toward hard sectors, incumbents can no longer rely solely on their brand reputation.

Even industry leaders like Salesforce are relying more on acquisitions to keep up, showing how new technology and easier alternatives are lowering switching costs and making it harder for established companies to hold onto customers.

Startups are also increasingly being built by innovative industry specialists, who aren’t confined by the same limitations as legacy players. Many startup founders in defence, energy, healthcare, and government procurement come directly from these industries or have unique insights into their inner weaknesses.

The next wave of disruption will hit legacy companies hard, as startups prove they can innovate with the speed, flexibilityand focus that incumbents often lack. In sectors long protected by regulation or procurement friction, younger companiesare demonstrating that modern software, AI, and new business models can unlock performance improvements that established players struggle to match. Investor playbooks are already evolving, and that shift will likely accelerate in the year ahead.

At the same time, the total addressable market ceiling has been lifted. By moving beyond narrow software categories and into the physical economy, startups are targeting markets measured not in billions, but in trillions. As a result, we should expect more $100 billion companies to be built in this cycle. It’s no longer just about building better software.

It’s about rebuilding foundational sectors of the global economy.

            <h2>The European Parliament pulls back AI from its own devices</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/the-european-parliament-pulls-back-ai-from-its-own-devices">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The European Parliament has taken a rare and telling step: it has disabled built-in artificial intelligence features on work devices used by lawmakers and staff, citing unresolved concerns about data security, privacy, and the opaque nature of cloud-based AI processing.

The decision, communicated to Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) in an internal memo this week, reflects a deepening unease at the heart of European institutions about how AI systems handle sensitive data.

The Parliament’s IT department concluded that it could not guarantee the safety of certain AI-driven functions, notably writing assistants, text summarization tools, virtual assistants, and web page summary features, because they rely on cloud-based processing that sends data off the device.

In a workplace where draft legislation, confidential correspondence, and internal deliberations circulate daily, even momentary exposure of sensitive information is viewed as unacceptable.

For now, the measures apply only to these native, built-in AI features on Parliament-issued tablets and smartphones, not to everyday apps like email or calendars. The institution has declined to specify which operating systems or device manufacturers are affected, citing the “sensitive nature” of cybersecurity matters.

The internal memo did more than announce a software rollback. It advised lawmakers to review AI settings on their personal phones and tablets, warning them against exposing work emails, documents, or internal information to AI tools that “scan or analyze content,” and urging caution with third-party AI applications that seek broad access to data.

This guidance implicitly acknowledges a larger truth: for many elected officials and staff, the boundary between official and personal devices is porous. The Parliament’s approach underscores that risks are not confined to issued hardware but extend into the consumer technology choices of its own members.

The move is the latest in a series of precautionary steps by EU institutions. In 2023 the Parliament banned the use of TikTok on staff devices over similar data concerns, and ongoing debates have questioned the use of foreign-developed productivity software. Some lawmakers have even suggested moving away from Microsoft products in favor of European alternatives, part of a broader push for digital sovereignty.

That push is not abstract. The EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act, the world’s first comprehensive regulatory framework on AI, has been in force since 2024 and imposes obligations on AI providers and users alike, categorizing systems by risk and demanding transparency, traceability, and human oversight.

Yet the Parliament’s latest action reveals a paradox: while Europe seeks to regulate and shape AI at scale, it is simultaneously wary of the very tools it aims to master. Stopping short of a full ban on AI use, the institution is essentially saying that in certain contexts, the technology is too unpredictable to trust, especially when critical information could leak outside secure boundaries.

The Parliament’s decision may seem narrowly targeted, but it carries broader implications. It signals that even for progressive regulators who have championed innovation alongside rights protections, the practical limits of AI integration are now a central concern. Cybersecurity teams within government institutions are not merely technologists; they are custodians of trust in an era when data is both an asset and a vulnerability.

For businesses and citizens watching Europe’s regulatory trajectory, this episode is instructive. It suggests that the EU’s approach to AI will not only be legal and ethical but deeply pragmatic. Regulations may promote responsible innovation, but European institutions are prepared to pull back when security and control are at stake.

As AI capabilities continue to evolve and become embedded in devices worldwide, the Parliament’s cautionary step highlights a core tension of the digital age: balancing the potential of AI with its unseen and unquantified risks.

Whether other governments follow suit, or whether this stance influences corporate and product strategy, remains to be seen. In the meantime, the message from Brussels is unmistakable: when it comes to AI and sensitive data, trust but verify is no longer enough.

            <h2>AI FOMO: Where the “I” is not just intelligence, but I, the human</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When FOMO ( fear of missing out) first entered popular language, it was about teenagers scrolling through friends’ social feeds and worrying they weren’t having as much fun. But today, that word has taken on a different meaning in the era of artificial intelligence.

The fear now isn’t about beach photos or party snapshots. It’s about being left behind in a technological revolution that promises dramatic changes in work, creativity, and competition. It’s about the feeling that your own intelligence is not enough anymore, and you can’t compete with the artificial one.

You might call it AI FOMO, the worry, for individuals and companies alike, that others are moving ahead with AI while you stand still. And this feeling is real enough that researchers are trying to understand it scientifically.

They’ve developed tools to measure how much people fear falling behind in AI skills or access. A recent study showing how this fear plays out found that more than one in nine adults report elevated levels of anxiety about not keeping up with AI, especially younger people and women. Importantly, those with better AI literacy reported less fear, suggesting that understanding the technology reduces anxiety.

This isn’t abstract psychological jargon. It is a psychological undercurrent that feels entirely modern: tied to the ubiquity of AI in press, policy, and venture capital. The sense that everyone must adopt intelligent technology or risk irrelevance. But like most anxieties, its influence extends far beyond individual nervousness.

I think we reached the point where AI FOMO is shaping business decisions, corporate strategy, and even public policy.

The ripples from AI FOMO extend far beyond individual stress. They reach into boardrooms and strategic plans where companies, whether big or small, are deciding how hard to pursue AI.

A survey by intelligent automation company ABBYY found that around 60-70 % of technology leaders report fear of missing out as a major reason their organisation is investing in AI. Many worry that if they don’t adopt AI now, competitors will seize an advantage. And together with the leaders’ fear, some decisions are coming that may affect the employees.

I will give credit. That fear can feel logical. After all, AI promises efficiency, insight, and new capabilities, even for thought less capable.

But when fear becomes the main reason for action, it warps strategy. Rather than asking “What problem are we solving with AI?”, decision-makers ask “Can we afford not to use AI?” This change from thoughtful problem-solving to panic-driven adoption creates an illusion of purpose where there may be none.

And the results can be underwhelming. Recent business surveys show that many companies are still struggling to see real returns from their AI investments. Some executives report that less than half of their AI projects deliver measurable impact, or struggle to even quantify it. That’s a sign that widespread adoption does not automatically translate into value, especially when the impetus to buy in comes from anxiety rather than strategy.

AI FOMO isn’t just a corporate phenomenon. It affects workers too. Research focused on attitudes in the workplace shows that employees who believe AI will reduce their autonomy or make their skills obsolete tend to experience fear of missing out on AI adoption alongside heightened job anxiety. This connects with broader concerns about technology and wellbeing at work: many people worry that AI might replace tasks or change job expectations without clarity.

That fear can influence behaviour, too. Anecdotal reports, such as research showing a significant share of workers using AI tools secretly to keep up with perceived expectations, reflect this sense of needing to keep pace, even in silence. It’s not just about skills; it’s about identity, worth, and belonging in a professional world that is moving so fast.

The result is a kind of feedback loop. Investment without strategy, momentum without direction. In the pursuit of not falling behind, many risk falling into the very inefficiency they hoped to avoid.

To navigate this moment with equanimity requires resisting the gravitational pull of fear. This is not a rejection of AI’s transformative potential. A large majority of business leaders still view AI as an opportunity, even as concerns about risk and readiness grow.

But recognising AI FOMO as a real force, not just a catchphrase, allows companies, governments, and individuals to ask better questions:

The answer, ultimately, is not to replace fear with oblivious optimism, but to replace reflexive action with intentional adoption.

In the end, AI FOMO tells us something deeper about ourselves than any quarterly earnings report or headline about the next breakthrough. It reveals how closely we have tied our hopes, and our anxieties, to a technology that is, for many of us, still only partly understood.

We see AI everywhere: pitched as productivity’s savior one moment, feared as a job-eating force the next. Across workplaces and dinner-table conversations alike, even on dating apps, the underlying emotion often isn’t excitement or dread alone, but something that feels curiously familiar and deeply human: the fear of falling behind, of being outpaced by peers, competitors, or even young strangers we’ve never met.

This feeling is more than a distraction or a fancy word. It is linked to genuine stress, anxiety, and reduced well-being for some, and it shapes behaviour in subtle but far-reaching ways. People tweak their resumes, accept rushed technology rollouts, or hunch over training modules long into the night; not because they are certain of the value, but because they fear the alternative.

This moment, then, feels like more than a fad. It is a crossroads between reaction and reflection. We can choose to let fear drive our choices, or we can treat that fear as a signal to slow down, learn, and make room for real understanding.

If I’ve learned anything in the years since AI leapt into the popular imagination, it’s this: technology changes fastest when we pair curiosity with clarity, and adapts most successfully when we meet it with empathy rather than anxiety.

So as the next wave of models arrives, as companies wordsmith their AI strategies, and as employees juggle training modules alongside tools and dashboards, here’s one gentle reminder worth holding onto: technology doesn’t define us. Our reactions to it do. We are the ones who imagine, experiment, hesitate, question, and decide.

            <div id="article-text">If you checked X today expecting the usual stream of hot takes, memes, and AI spats, you probably saw… nothing. A widespread outage hit the platform today, leaving feeds blank, timelines unresponsive, and users staring at the digital equivalent of an empty room.

Outage trackers such as Downdetector logged a dramatic surge in problem reports around midday GMT, with tens of thousands of users across regions, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Pakistan, and India, reporting problems accessing the service. Some described impossible login loops and error messages telling them only that “something went wrong.”

Here’s where it gets curious: nobody from X has confirmed why the platform hiccupped. Despite the scale of the disruption, and a global user base reliant on the service for everything from breaking news to weather alerts, there’s been no official timeline for a fix or even an acknowledgement of a broader issue. For a service that prides itself on instant updates, the silence is notable.

This isn’t the first time X has ground to a halt. The platform has a history of outages since its rebranding from Twitter, with users historically greeted by messages like “Something went wrong” when backend systems hiccup.

Today’s disruption even impacted associated tech. Reports suggest that Grok, the AI chatbot tied into X’s ecosystem, also faced interruptions as timelines failed to load, underscoring how much of the platform’s experience still depends on backend stability.

For now, the outage remains a developing story, and users left refreshing their browsers might be asking the most modern question of all: was it a bug, a server gremlin, or just another Monday on X?

            <h2>What my CS team was missing</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/what-my-cs-team-was-missing">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">I need to say something that might make CS leaders uncomfortable: most of what your team does before a renewal is valuable, but it’s listening to only one channel. Your EBRs, your health scores, your stakeholder maps. They capture what your customer is willing to tell you directly. What they don’t capture is the conversation happening everywhere else. And that’s usually where churn starts.

I know because I ran the standard playbook for years. EBRs, stakeholder mapping, health score reviews, and renewal prep meetings, where we rated our gut feeling on a scale of green to red. We had dashboards. We had strong CSMs who genuinely cared about their accounts. And we still got blindsided.

The $2M quarter is the one I can’t forget. Two enterprise accounts churned in the same 90-day window. Both were green in every system we had. One had an NPS of 72.

When I dug into what happened, I didn’t find a CS execution problem. I found a coverage gap. Every signal had been there. Just not in the places our process was designed to look. I sat in the post-mortem knowing we’d done everything our process asked us to do. That was the problem.

Later in this article, I’ll show you what both of those accounts would have looked like inside Renewal Fix. Before anyone on my team knew there was a problem.

I’m not saying EBRs are useless. A well-run EBR builds relationship depth, gives your champion ammunition internally, and surfaces problems the customer is willing to raise directly. But even the best EBR has a structural limitation: it only captures what someone chooses to say out loud, in a meeting, to a vendor.

The real conversation about your product is happening in a Slack channel you’ll never see, in a procurement review you weren’t invited to, and in a 1:1 between your champion and their new boss who just joined from a company that used your competitor. The EBR gives you one essential channel. The danger is treating it as the only one.

Here’s what was actually happening in those two accounts that churned on me.

Account one: their engineering team had filed 23 support tickets about API latency over four months. Not “the product is broken” tickets. Small, specific, technical complaints that got resolved individually. Nobody in CS ever saw them because they never escalated to “critical.” But lined up chronologically, the pattern was unmistakable: this team was losing patience, one resolved ticket at a time.

Account two: three of their five power users updated their LinkedIn profiles in the same two-week window. One started posting about a competitor’s product. Our champion’s title changed from “Head of” to “Senior Manager.” A quiet demotion nobody noticed because we were watching product usage dashboards, not org charts.

Every CS leader I know has lost an account and later found out the champion left months ago. The customer’s reaction is always the same: “We assumed you knew.” They expect you to track publicly available professional changes, the same information any recruiter monitors. Not tracking them isn’t respectful. It’s a blind spot.

Neither signal lived in our CRM. Neither showed up in our health score. They were sitting in plain sight in systems our CS team had no reason to check.

Health scores aren’t the problem. Treating them as the whole picture is. A typical health score aggregates NPS, login frequency, support ticket count, and feature adoption. Green means safe. Red means act. But these are lagging indicators. By the time login frequency drops, the decision to evaluate alternatives may already be in motion.

When I started tracking leading indicators alongside our existing health model, the difference was striking. Across roughly 300 mid-market accounts over 18 months, we found that support ticket velocity, specifically the rate of increase in non-critical tickets over a rolling 90-day window, predicted churn at T-90 at roughly 2x the accuracy of our composite health score. The signals that actually predict churn aren’t the ones most CS platforms are designed to track.

The teams with the strongest renewal rates don’t abandon their existing processes. They add a signal layer on top. The highest-signal sources break into three tiers.

Tier 1: Support ticket patterns. Not the count, but the velocity, the sentiment trend, and whether the same team keeps filing. A steady trickle of “resolved” tickets from one engineering team is often a louder signal than a single P1 escalation. At scale, this becomes cohort-level complaint clustering across a segment.

Tier 2: People changes. Champion turnover, re-orgs, title changes, and new executives from a competitor’s customer base. The person who bought your product and the person renewing it are often not the same person. At scale, you’re watching for patterns of org instability across your book.

Tier 3: Competitive exposure. Whether your customer is being actively pitched, attending competitor events, or has team members engaging with competitor content online. At scale, you’re tracking which segments your competitors are targeting hardest.

The real challenge isn’t knowing what to track. It’s that these signals live in five or six different systems, and nobody’s job is to stitch them together. Your CSM sees Zendesk. Your SE sees Jira. Your AE sees Salesforce. The full picture only exists if someone manually assembles it.

One team I worked with built a manual version of this: CSMs logging signals from six different sources every Friday. About 90 minutes per account per week. Their renewal rate hit 96%. But the approach doesn’t scale past a 25-account book.

At 80 accounts in a mid-market motion, you need automation. At 150+ in a PLG model, the signals are still there, you’re watching for cohort-level drops in feature adoption or clusters of the same complaint across a segment, but you cannot find them without automation.

The teams doing this manually are logging into six tools every Friday. The teams doing this with automation get a Slack message when something changes. No dashboard to check. No Friday ritual.

Detection without a playbook is just anxiety. The point of catching signals early isn’t to panic. It’s to have time to act. An executive sponsor who hasn’t logged in for 90 days needs a different intervention than an account with a competitor POC in their Salesforce sandbox. The signal tells you what’s happening. The response has to match.

That gap between knowing what to track and actually tracking it consistently is why I built Renewal Fix. Not to replace the manual process, but to remove the ceiling on it. The platform pulls signals from support tickets, call recordings, CRM data, and engineering channels automatically, stitches them into a single account view, and flags them before they become a renewal surprise.

Enter your work email at renewalfix.com. In 30 seconds, you’ll get a one-page executive brief showing your blind spots: 10 accounts that look like they belong in your CS platform, built from your company’s products, competitive landscape, and integration stack, each with a health score and risk signals sourced from support tickets, call recordings, and org changes that your current dashboard would never surface. No demo, no sales call.

Find the account that looks most like Account One. Health score in the 70s, risk signals hiding underneath. Then click “Executive Brief” for a one-page summary of your portfolio’s total risk exposure, with dollar amounts and prioritized actions. That view is what Renewal Fix delivers weekly in production.

Your green accounts aren’t necessarily at risk. But they might be quieter than you realize.

            <h2>Peter Steinberger joins OpenAI</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, Peter Steinberger was experimenting with a side project that quickly caught fire across the developer world. His open-source AI assistant, OpenClaw, wasn’t just another chatbot; it could act on your behalf, from managing emails to integrating with calendars and messaging platforms.

Today, that project has a new chapter: Steinberger is joining OpenAI to help build the next generation of personal AI agents.

This move isn’t just about talent acquisition. It marks a switch in how the AI industry thinks about assistants: from reactive systems you talk to, toward agents that take initiative and perform tasks autonomously, with potential implications for productivity, workflows, and personal automation.

OpenClaw first emerged in late 2025 under names like Clawdbot and Moltbot. What distinguished it was not fancy visuals or marketing, but its practical ambition: give users an AI that connects to their tools and executes workflows, booking flights, sorting messages, scheduling meetings, in ways that feel closer to agency than assistant.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

It quickly went viral on GitHub, drawing more than 100,000 stars and millions of visits to its project page within weeks.

Rather than turning OpenClaw into a standalone company, Steinberger chose to partner with OpenAI, a decision he explained in a blog post as driven by a simple goal: bring intelligent agents to a broader audience as quickly as possible.

According to him, OpenAI’s infrastructure, research resources, and product ecosystem offered the best path to scale such an ambitious idea.

OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman welcomed Steinberger’s move as strategic, underscoring that the company expects personal agents, systems capable of initiating, coordinating, and completing tasks across apps, to be an important part of future AI products.

Altman’s public post noted that OpenClaw will continue to exist as an open-source project under a new foundation supported by OpenAI, preserving its accessibility and community roots.

The notion of AI that does things has been bubbling under the surface of tech discourse, but OpenClaw’s popularity crystallised it. Users interact with their agents through familiar interfaces like messaging platforms, but behind the scenes, these agents orchestrate API calls, automate scripts, handle notifications, and adapt to changing schedules, all without explicit commands after initial setup.

This trajectory, from an experimental open-source project to a central piece of a major AI lab’s strategy, speaks to broader trends in the industry. Competitors from Anthropic to Google DeepMind have also indicated interest in multi-agent systems and autonomous workflows, but OpenAI’s move signals how seriously the category is now being taken.

It suggests a future where AI isn’t just conversational, but proactive and tightly integrated into everyday tooling.

At the same time, this evolution raises fresh questions about governance and safety. OpenClaw’s open-source nature meant that developers could experiment freely, but that freedom also exposed potential attack surfaces; misconfigured agents with access to sensitive accounts or automation processes could be exploited if not properly safeguarded.

That is one reason why maintaining an open foundation with careful oversight matters as these tools scale.

For OpenAI, Steinberger’s arrival embeds this agent-first thinking into its product roadmap at a critical moment. The company is already exploring “multi-agent” architectures, where specialised AIs coordinate with each other and with users to handle complex tasks more effectively than monolithic models alone. Steinberger brings an experimental sensibility and real-world experience that could accelerate those efforts.

This could mean future versions of ChatGPT or other OpenAI products will be able to carry out tasks you define, rather than waiting for you to prompt them. That shift, from conversational replies to autonomous action, is the next frontier in how AI will fit into daily digital life.

And with OpenClaw’s creator now inside one of the most influential AI labs in the world, that future feels closer than ever.
