            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Diablo II is one of those storied classic PC games that’s pretty much always fun to come back to—so much so that some players have put thousands of hours into the game over more than two decades. Across all those years, though, the game itself has barely changed, becoming something of a familiar, comfortable blanket of hellfire for longtime players.

That makes last week’s introduction of a new playable Warlock class in Diablo II Resurrected’s new “Reign of the Warlock” DLC a pretty big deal. And after playing through a few Acts with the Warlock over the recent holiday weekend, I found the new option to be a great excuse to come back to a game that’s overdue for a shot in the arm.

How your Warlock build goes depends heavily on which of the three main upgrade branches you choose to go down. Of these, I found the Eldritch branch had been the most interesting and fun to explore. That’s in large part because of a new skill that lets you levitate a powerful two-handed weapon in front of you while still holding a strong shield in your hands. It seems like a small change, but my relief was palpable in this playthrough as I was able to avoid these kinds of tough choices between defense and offense as I juggled my inventory.

Then there’s the Echoing Strike skill, which essentially lets you turn your melee weapons into ranged attacks, using a bit of mana to throw a ghostly “echo” at far-off enemies. I ended up relying heavily on this almost as soon as I got it at Level 14, spamming a long-range copy of my powerful two-handed staff, complete with its fire and poison effects intact. Like weapon levitation, adding an effective ranged attack to what were once exclusively close-quarters combat options is a simple change that opens up a lot of gameplay variety.

The Demon upgrade branch has been much less interesting, in my experience. The basic pattern of summoning monstrous allies to fight alongside you and absorb some enemy attention will be broadly familiar to anyone who has played the Necromancer class. And, to be frank, I found summoning a massive army of fragile skeletons as a Necromancer to be a lot more fun than summoning a singular tank of a Demon as a Warlock early on (summoning multiple demons at once requires a full 10 points of skill tree investment).

Of the Warlock’s three Demonic partner options, I found myself leaning most on the Tainted, which can stay out of harm’s way while harassing slower enemies from afar with fireballs. The other Demon options both had their charms but often got too caught up in massive enemy swarms to be as effective as I wanted, I found. I also didn’t see much point in the skill option that let me teleport my demon into a specific fight or sacrifice itself for some splash damage; their standard, AI-controlled attack patterns were usually sufficient.

Then there’s the Chaos upgrade branch, which is focused mostly on area-of-effect (AoE) spells. My build thus far has ended up pretty reliant on the direct-damage AoE options; the Flame Wave, in particular, is especially good for quickly clearing out long, narrow corridors. I also leaned on the Sigil of Lethargy, which effectively slows down some of the more frenetic enemy swarms and gives you some time to gather your attack plan.

Combining these Chaos skills with the weapon-improving options in the Eldritch branch has made my time with the Diablo II Warlock feel like a bit of a “best of both worlds” situation. The mixture of ranged combat options, area-of-effect magic, and allies-summoning abilities ends up feeling like a weird cross between a Sorceress, Amazon, and Necromancer, without feeling like a carbon copy of any of those classes.

I haven’t yet gotten to the new late-game content in the “Reign of the Warlock” DLC, so I can’t say how well the Warlock holds up in the extreme difficulty of the Terror Zones. I also haven’t experimented with any of the truly broken Warlock builds that some committed high-level min-maxxers have been busy discovering.

As a casual excuse to revisit the world of Diablo II, though, the Warlock class provides just enough of a new twist on some familiar gameplay mechanics to make it worth the trip.</div>

            <h2>From chickens to humans, animals think "bouba" sounds round</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/newly-hatched-chickens-form-the-same-sound-association-we-do/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Does “bouba” sound round to you? How about “maluma”? Neither are real words, but we’ve known for decades that people who hear them tend to associate them with round objects. There have been plenty of ideas put forward about why that would be the case, and most of them have turned out to be wrong. Now, in perhaps the weirdest bit of evidence to date, researchers have found that even newly hatched chickens seem to associate “bouba” with round shapes.

The initial finding dates all the way back to 1947, when someone discovered that people associated some word-like sounds with rounded shapes, and others with spiky ones. In the years since, that association got formalized as the bouba/kiki effect, received a fair bit of experimental attention, and ended up with an extensive Wikipedia entry.

One of the initial ideas to explain it was similarity to actual words (either phonetically or via the characters used to spell them), but then studies with speakers of different languages and alphabets showed that it is likely a general human tendency. The association also showed up in infants as young as 4 months old, well before they master speaking or spelling. Attempts to find the bouba/kiki effects in other primates, however, came up empty. That led to some speculation that it might be evidence of a strictly human processing ability that underlies our capacity to learn sophisticated languages.

A team of Italian researchers—Maria Loconsole, Silvia Benavides-­Varela, and Lucia Regolin—now have evidence that that isn’t true either. They decided to look for the bouba/kiki effect well beyond primates, instead turning to newly hatched chickens, only one or three days old. That may sound a bit odd, but chickens have a key advantage beyond ready availability: unlike a 4-month-old human, newly hatched chicks are fully mobile and able to interact with the world.

Control experiments using silence or classical music showed that the young chicks are somewhat drawn to a rounded shape. But recordings of a person saying “bouba” caused 80 percent of the chicks to move to a rounded shape first. If a recording of “kiki” was played instead, that number dropped to just 25 percent, with the numbers going to a spiky shape rising. The effect is somewhat stronger in 3-day-old chicks, but it still showed up in the animals that were tested just one day after hatching.

The researchers attribute the bouba/kiki effect to what’s called a “crossmodal correspondence,” in which input from one sensory system influences our perception of another. Some of these make a degree of sense, such as associating high pitches with smaller objects, and low pitches with larger ones, something that’s generally consistent with how those pitches are produced. Beyond humans, that has been observed in animals as distant as dogs and tortoises—but not chickens. Other crossmodal correspondences are far less intuitive, such as associating high pitches with bright lighting, which has also been found in species as diverse as chimps and tortoises.

In any case, the results argue strongly that the bouba/kiki effect does not represent a capacity that’s distinct to animals that use complex language. They also suggest that the failure to find it in other primates is probably a product of doing the testing in adult primates, which probably have a complicated mixture of motivations that can override simple instinctual preferences.

            <h2>F1: Preseason tests show how different 2026 will be</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/02/f1-preseason-tests-shows-how-different-2026-will-be/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s just two weeks until F1 gets underway in Australia, and teams are currently in Bahrain, midway through their third and final preseason test. The 2026 season promises to be wildly different from those of the past few years, with all-new cars, engines, hybrid systems, and sustainable fuels entering the mix and shaking up the established order.

You shouldn’t read too much into times from preseason testing. The cars don’t have to conform to the in-season rules as teams test new components or fit-test rigs; for example, glowing brake discs could once again be seen on some cars that weren’t running wheel covers at an earlier test, something we’re unlikely to see during actual races.

You also don’t know how much fuel—and therefore extra weight—anyone is carrying. In the past, some teams have even made headlines by running too light to set more competitive lap times in an effort to impress potential sponsors. And as the name explains, it’s a test, so drivers will be following run plans devised with their engineers to learn specific things about their new cars. Or as one Internet wag once put it, the times mean as much as “a bacon briefcase.”

That said, the tests are far from meaningless, particularly this year. After 12 years of using the same hybrid power units, the sport has moved to an all-new design. The internal combustion engine is still a turbocharged 1.6 L V6, but that turbocharger no longer features the MGU-H hybrid system that both captured waste energy from the spinning turbine and also eliminated turbo lag. The remaining hybrid system—the MGU-K that harvests and deploys energy from and to the rear wheels—is much more powerful than before and is paired with a 4 Mj (1.1 kWh) battery pack. And like many hybrid road cars, that kinetic energy can come from braking or the engine.

Now, the V6 provides 400 kW (536 hp) and the MGU-K an additional 350 kW, as long as the battery has charge. Cars are allowed to deploy up to 8.5 mJ (2.4 kWh) of electrical energy per lap, so energy management—knowing when and how to harvest and when to deploy—will become as important to F1 drivers as it was during the LMP1h days at Le Mans, or currently in Formula E.

As a result, we’ve seen some drivers try out new techniques, downshifting to a lower gear than might otherwise be used in order to keep the engine revs up (and therefore charging the battery). There’s also a phenomenon called “superclipping” (previously known as derating), where cars slow toward the ends of a straight even as their engine revs rise—here, the cars are sending some of that engine power to the battery instead of the rear wheels to fill the battery so the MGU-K can help shove the car out of the next corner. And that isn’t always consistent lap to lap, as battery state of charge or track conditions change and the cars’ onboard computers juggle how much energy to deploy.

We may have to revisit that topic, as the teams have been asked to test a reduced power output of the MGU-K as a backup plan in case the fears of critics of the 2026 rules come to pass.

Interestingly, the MGU-K won’t be used at race starts—it only begins to contribute above 50 km/h (31 mph). That’s to prevent the danger of some drivers depleting their batteries and therefore slowing much faster than others in the approach to the first or second corner at the start as they superclip, and it has also exposed a potential performance differentiator this year. Ferrari, which also provides power units to Haas and Cadillac, opted for smaller turbochargers that spin up more quickly; the other OEMs all went for larger turbos that generate higher peak power. Ferrari has gambled that the smaller, faster turbos will give it an advantage at race starts and when its drivers have to rely solely on their V6s.

I’ll say this for the 2026 crop of cars: They sure look good. They’re a little shorter and narrower than last year’s cars, with slightly narrower tires and much greater diversity among the teams than in the tightly proscribed ground-effect era. Those rules, which ran from 2022 to 2025, gave such little leeway to the teams in design decisions that performance converged to within fractions of a percent across the entire grid. Now everyone looks quite different from one another.

The big thing to look out for this year is who can shed the most drag in straight-line mode. Each car’s front and rear wings are now active, with a raised position called corner mode that generates lots of downforce, and straight mode, which drops both wings to minimize drag (and therefore the energy the car needs to go fast). Ferrari tested an interesting approach to this in Bahrain at one point, with rear wing elements that flipped a full 180 degrees. I wonder if we’ll see that in-season.

The arguments about engine compression ratios are still ongoing. Briefly, Mercedes is believed to have used clever materials science to create an engine in which the compression ratio increases rather than decreases as the engine gets hot. For this year, engines are capped at a compression ratio of 16:1 but measured at ambient temperature. Next week, the teams and the sport’s organizers (the FIA) meet to discuss adding a hot test for compression ratios, which is unlikely to go Mercedes’ way. (For its part, Mercedes says there’s nothing illegal about its engines.)

The Mercedes-powered teams (Mercedes, McLaren, Williams, and Alpine), as well as Honda-powered Aston Martin, have another potential problem. Each power unit has its own sustainable fuel; Mercedes’ is provided by Petronas and Honda’s by Aramco. To ensure it is indeed fully sustainable, there’s a homologation process with an independent third party to verify compliance throughout the supply chain. Unfortunately for these five teams, neither Petronas nor Aramco have finished this homologation process, with a deadline of March 1 fast approaching. Should that not happen in time, we’ll still see those five teams race, but they’ll use a substitute fuel that won’t be optimized for the engines that will burn it.

I’m pretty sure the unbelievable reliability that’s been a feature of F1 for the last few seasons may be a thing of the past, at least for the first few races in 2026. Up and down the pit lane, teams have missed hours of practice sessions as they troubleshoot gremlins. Aston Martin looks particularly bad in this regard, even in comparison to brand-new Cadillac.

Finally, we’re starting to get a better idea of how F1 coverage will work with the move to Apple TV here in the US. Apple TV users will find an F1 tab in the Apple TV app, but you can also use the standalone F1TV app with your Apple credentials. We still have to wait until the first weekend in March to find out which F1 feed and commentary Apple will use, but the F1TV app remains an excellent way to follow the sport, with in-house commentary, alternate commentary from the UK’s Sky TV, in-car feeds for each driver, and an archive of F1 races going back decades.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Another day, another Google AI model. Google has really been pumping out new AI tools lately, having just released Gemini 3 in November. Today, it’s bumping the flagship model to version 3.1. The new Gemini 3.1 Pro is rolling out (in preview) for developers and consumers today with the promise of better problem-solving and reasoning capabilities.

Google announced improvements to its Deep Think tool last week, and apparently, the “core intelligence” behind that update was Gemini 3.1 Pro. As usual, Google’s latest model announcement comes with a plethora of benchmarks that show mostly modest improvements. In the popular Humanity’s Last Exam, which tests advanced domain-specific knowledge, Gemini 3.1 Pro scored a record 44.4 percent. Gemini 3 Pro managed 37.5 percent, while OpenAI’s GPT 5.2 got 34.5 percent.

Google also calls out the model’s improvement in ARC-AGI-2, which features novel logic problems that can’t be directly trained into an AI. Gemini 3 was a bit behind on this evaluation, reaching a mere 31.1 percent versus scores in the 50s and 60s for competing models. Gemini 3.1 Pro more than doubles Google’s score, reaching a lofty 77.1 percent.

Google has often gloated when it releases new models that they’ve already hit the top of the Arena leaderboard (formerly LM Arena), but that’s not the case this time. For text, Claude Opus 4.6 edges out the new Gemini by four points at 1504. For code, Opus 4.6, Opus 4.5, and GPT 5.2 High all run ahead of Gemini 3.1 Pro by a bit more. It’s worth noting, however, that the Arena leaderboard is run on vibes. Users vote on the outputs they like best, which can reward outputs that look correct regardless of whether they are.

To demonstrate the improvements in Gemini 3.1 Pro, Google focused on the model’s ability to generate graphics and simulations. The example SVGs shown in the comparison video above do seem much more elegant, but these are the examples Google has chosen to show. Big benchmark numbers and curated demos are all well and good, but will you feel any difference when using the model? If you’re asking abstract questions and expecting detailed, nuanced answers, Gemini 3.1 Pro will probably produce better outputs than 3.0. Developers using Gemini to create agentic workflows are likely to see an improvement—Gemini 3.1 Pro almost doubled its score in the APEX-Agents benchmark.

The updated model is coming to AI Studio and the Antigravity IDE in preview today. Enterprise users will see 3.1 Pro in Vertex AI and Gemini Enterprise. For regular users, Gemini 3.1 Pro is available for both the Gemini app and NotebookLM today. The API cost for developers has not changed ($2 input and $12 output per 1M tokens), nor has the context window (1M input and 64k output tokens). If Google’s pattern holds, there will most likely be a 3.1 update for its faster and cheaper Flash model in the near future.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In Formula One, grip is everything. The world’s best engineers devote their careers to designing cars that maximize downforce and grip to squeeze every bit of performance out of a set of four humble tires. These cars punish their drivers by slinging them at six Gs through corners and offer similar levels of abuse in braking.

It’s all wildly impressive, but I’ve long maintained that those drivers are not the ones having the most fun. When it comes to sheer enjoyment, grip is highly overrated, and if you want proof of that, you need to try ice racing.

Should you be lucky enough to live somewhere that gets cold enough consistently enough, all you need is a good set of tires and a car that’s willing and able. That, of course, and a desire to spend more time driving sideways than straight. I’ve been ice racing for well over 20 years now, and I’m here to tell you that there’s no greater thrill on four wheels than sliding through a corner a few inches astern of a hard-charging competitor.

There are certainly plenty of professionals out there who have dabbled in or got their start in ice racing, F1 legend Alain Prost and touring car maestro Peter Cunningham being two notable examples. And a European ice racing series called Trophée Andros formerly challenged some of the world’s top professionals to race across a series of purpose-built frozen tracks in Europe and even Quebec.

These days, however, ice racing is an almost entirely amateur pursuit, a low-temp, low-grip hobby where the biggest prize you’re likely to bring home on any given Sunday is a smile and maybe a little trophy for the mantel.

That said, there are numerous types of ice racing. The most common and accessible is time trials, basically autocrosses on ice. The Sports Car Club of Vermont ice time trial series is a reliable, well-run example, but you’ll find plenty of others, too.

Some other clubs step it up by hosting wheel-to-wheel racing on plowed ovals. Lakes Region Ice Racing Club in Moultonborough, New Hampshire, is a long-running group that has been blessed with enough ice lately to keep racing even as temperatures have increased.

At the top tier, though, you’re looking at clubs that plow full-on road courses on the ice, groups like the Adirondack Motor Enthusiast Club (AMEC), based in and around the Adirondack Park. Established in 1954, this is among the oldest ice racing clubs in the world and the one I’ve been lucky to be a member of since 2002.

AMEC offers numerous classes, providing eligibility for everything from a bone-stock Miata to purpose-built sprint cars that look like they made a wrong turn off a dirt oval. Dedicated volunteers plow courses on lakes throughout the ADK, tirelessly searching for ice of sufficient depth and quality.

Different clubs have different requirements, but most like to see a foot of solid, clean ice. That may not sound like much, but according to the US Army Corps of Engineers, it’s plenty for eight-ton trucks. That’s enough to support not only the 60 to 100 racers that AMEC routinely sees on any frigid Sunday but also the numerous tow rigs, trailers, and plow trucks that support the action.

How do you get started? All you need is a set of tires.

Tires are the most talked-about component of any car competing on the ice, and for good reason. Clubs have different regulations for what is and is not legal for competition, but in general, you can lump ice racing tires into three categories.

The first is unstudded, street-legal tires, such as Bridgestone Blizzacks, Continental WinterContacts, and Michelin X-Ices. These tires generally have chunky, aggressive treads, generous siping, and squishy compounds. Modern snow tires like these are marvelous things, and when there’s a rough surface on the ice or some embedded snow, an unstudded tire can be extremely competitive, even keeping up with a street-legal studded tire.

These tires, like the Nokian Hakkapeliita 10 and the Pirelli Winter Ice Zero, take the chunky, aggressive tread pattern of a normal snow tire and embed some number of metallic studs. These tiny studs, which typically protrude only 1 millimeter from the tire surface, provide a massive boost in grip on smooth, polished ice.

Finally, there is what is broadly called a “race stud” tire, which is anything not legal for road use. These tires range from hand-made bolt tires, put together by people who have a lot of patience and who don’t mind the smell of tire sealant, to purpose-built race rubber of the sort you’ll see on a World Rally car snow stage.

These tires offer massive amounts of grip—so much so that the feel they deliver is more like driving on dirt than on ice. Unless you DIY it, the cost typically increases substantially as well. For that reason, going to grippier tires doesn’t necessarily mean more fun for your dollar, but there are plenty of opinions on where you’ll find the sweet spot of smiles per mile.

The other major factor in finding success on the ice is driver skill. If you have some experience in low-grip, car-control-focused driving like rally or drift, you’ll have a head start over someone who’s starting fresh. But if I had a dollar for every rally maestro or drifter I’ve seen swagger their way out onto the ice and then wedge their car straight into the first snowbank, I’d have at least five or six extra dollars to my name.

Ice racing is probably the purest and most challenging form of low-grip driving. On ice, the performance envelope of a normal car on normal tires is extremely small. Driving fast on ice, then, means learning how to make your car do what you want, even when you’re far outside of that envelope.

There are many techniques involved, but it all starts with getting comfortable with entering your car into a slide and sustaining it. Learning to balance your car in a moderate drift, dancing between terminal understeer (plowing into the snowbank nose-first) and extreme oversteer (spinning into the snowbank tail-first), is key. That comfort simply takes time.

Once you figure out how to keep your car going in the right direction, and once you stop making sedan-shaped holes in snowbanks, the next trick is to learn how to read the ice.

The grip level of the ice constantly evolves throughout the day. The street-legal tires tend to polish it off, wearing down rougher sections into smoothly polished patches with extremely low grip. The race studs, on the other hand, chew it up again, creating a heavily textured surface.

If you’re on the less extreme sorts of tires, you’ll find the most grip on that rough, unused ice. In a race stud, you want to seek out smooth, clean ice because it will give your studs better purchase.

If you’re familiar with road racing, it’s a little like running a rain line: not necessarily driving the shortest path around, but instead taking the one that offers the most grip. Imagine a rain line that changes every lap and you start to get the picture.

Intrigued? The good news is that ice racing is among the most accessible and affordable forms of motorsport on the planet, possibly second only to autocrossing. Costs vary widely, but in my club, AMEC, a full day of racing costs $70. That’s for three heat races and a practice session. Again, all you need is a set of snow tires, which will last the full season if you don’t abuse them.

The bad news, of course, is that you need to be close to an ice racing club. They’re getting harder and harder to find, and active clubs generally have shorter seasons with fewer events. If you can’t find one locally, you may need to travel, which increases the cost and commitment substantially.

If cost is no issue, you certainly have more opportunities. We’ve already reported on McLaren’s program, but it’s not alone. Exotic brands like Ferrari and Lamborghini also offer winter driving programs, where you can wheel amazing cars in glamorous places like St. Moritz and Livigno. The cost is very much in the “if you have to ask” category.

Dirtfish, one of the world’s greatest rally schools, also offers an ice-driving program in Wisconsin, starting at about $2,000 for a single day. This is a great, if expensive, way to get a feel for the skills you’ll need on ice.

And if you just want the most seat time, look for programs like Lapland Ice Driving or Ice Drive Sweden. The northern wilds of Sweden and Finland are full of frozen lakes where clubs plow out full race courses, sometimes repeating Formula One circuits. If you have the funds, you can rent any manner of sports car and run it sideways all day long on proper studded tires.

Whatever it costs and whatever you have to do to make it happen, ice racing is well worth the effort. I’ve been lucky to drive a long list of amazing cars in amazing places, but nothing comes close to the joy of wheeling my 20-year-old Subaru around a frozen lake.</div>

            <h2>OpenClaw security fears lead Meta, other AI firms to restrict its use</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/openclaw-security-fears-lead-meta-other-ai-firms-to-restrict-its-use/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last month, Jason Grad issued a late-night warning to the 20 employees at his tech startup. “You’ve likely seen Clawdbot trending on X/LinkedIn. While cool, it is currently unvetted and high-risk for our environment,” he wrote in a Slack message with a red siren emoji. “Please keep Clawdbot off all company hardware and away from work-linked accounts.”

Grad isn’t the only tech executive who has raised concerns to staff about the experimental agentic AI tool, which was briefly known as MoltBot and is now named OpenClaw. A Meta executive says he recently told his team to keep OpenClaw off their regular work laptops or risk losing their jobs. The executive told reporters he believes the software is unpredictable and could lead to a privacy breach if used in otherwise secure environments. He spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly.

Peter Steinberger, OpenClaw’s solo founder, launched it as a free, open source tool last November. But its popularity surged last month as other coders contributed features and began sharing their experiences using it on social media. Last week, Steinberger joined ChatGPT developer OpenAI, which says it will keep OpenClaw open source and support it through a foundation.

OpenClaw requires basic software engineering knowledge to set up. After that, it only needs limited direction to take control of a user’s computer and interact with other apps to assist with tasks such as organizing files, conducting web research, and shopping online.

Some cybersecurity professionals have publicly urged companies to take measures to strictly control how their workforces use OpenClaw. And the recent bans show how companies are moving quickly to ensure security is prioritized ahead of their desire to experiment with emerging AI technologies.

“Our policy is, ‘mitigate first, investigate second’ when we come across anything that could be harmful to our company, users, or clients,” says Grad, who is cofounder and CEO of Massive, which provides Internet proxy tools to millions of users and businesses. His warning to staff went out on January 26, before any of his employees had installed OpenClaw, he says.

At another tech company, Valere, which works on software for organizations including Johns Hopkins University, an employee posted about OpenClaw on January 29 on an internal Slack channel for sharing new tech to potentially try out. The company’s president quickly responded that use of OpenClaw was strictly banned, Valere CEO Guy Pistone tells WIRED.

“If it got access to one of our developer’s machines, it could get access to our cloud services and our clients’ sensitive information, including credit card information and GitHub codebases,” Pistone says. “It’s pretty good at cleaning up some of its actions, which also scares me.”

A week later, Pistone did allow Valere’s research team to run OpenClaw on an employee’s old computer. The goal was to identify flaws in the software and potential fixes to make it more secure. The research team later advised limiting who can give orders to OpenClaw and exposing it to the Internet only with a password in place for its control panel to prevent unwanted access.

In a report shared with WIRED, the Valere researchers added that users have to “accept that the bot can be tricked.” For instance, if OpenClaw is set up to summarize a user’s email, a hacker could send a malicious email to the person instructing the AI to share copies of files on the person’s computer.

But Pistone is confident that safeguards can be put in place to make OpenClaw more secure. He has given a team at Valere 60 days to investigate. “If we don’t think we can do it in a reasonable time, we’ll forgo it,” he says. “Whoever figures out how to make it secure for businesses is definitely going to have a winner.”

Some companies concerned about OpenClaw are choosing to trust the cybersecurity protections they already have in place rather than introduce a formal or one-off ban. A CEO of a major software company says only about 15 programs are allowed on corporate devices. Anything else should be automatically blocked, says the executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal security protocols. He says that while OpenClaw is innovative, he doubts that it will find a way to operate on the company’s network undetected.

Jan-Joost den Brinker, chief technology officer at Prague-based compliance software developer Dubrink, says he bought a dedicated machine not connected to company systems or accounts that employees can use to play around with OpenClaw. “We aren’t solving business problems with OpenClaw at the moment,” he says.

Massive, the web proxy company, is cautiously exploring OpenClaw’s commercial possibilities. Grad says it tested the AI tool on isolated machines in the cloud and then, last week, released ClawPod, a way for OpenClaw agents to use Massive’s services to browse the web. While OpenClaw is still not welcome on Massive’s systems without protections in place, the allure of the new technology and its moneymaking potential was too great to ignore. OpenClaw “might be a glimpse into the future. That’s why we’re building for it,” Grad says.

            <h2>Skin-Crawlingly Awkward Video Shows Sam Altman and Dario Amodei Refusing to Hold Hands</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There’s no love being lost between Sam Altman and Dario Amodei.

At India’s AI Summit in New Delhi on Thursday, the respective CEOs of OpenAI and Athropic shared the stage with roughly a dozen other industry and political leaders, including the nation’s prime minister Narendra Modi. As they stood in a line facing the crowd, Modi beckoned them to join hands and raise them above their heads, presenting a united front.

Except Altman and Amodei, whose companies are bitter rivals, didn’t follow suit. Instead of holding hands, there’s only a brief moment of awkward eye contact as they largely avoid looking at each other, with Amodei searching around himself in a kind of “who, me?” gesture — which, had it been on a different kind of stage, would be hailed as a great bit of comic acting. In the end, both Altman and Amodei elected to raise a closed fist with the hands they should’ve been locking.

It was, as one Redditor described, a “cringe masterpiece.” Amodei did not look particularly thrilled. Altman, as he waited for Amodei’s final decision, held his free hand in front of his chest, seemingly confused.

It heightened what was already an absurd spectacle. The leaders of an industry that promises utopia on the horizon were smiling as they showed support for a prime minister who’s been widely criticized as authoritarian, all holding hands like they’re about to play ring around the rosie.

The rivalry between OpenAI and Anthropic goes deep. Anthropic was formed from a splinter group of former OpenAI employees, including Amodei, who left the company because of differences over its direction and to focus on safety.

But it’s recently reached new heights. This month, Anthropic piled pressure onto OpenAI with a new series of Super Bowl commercials that were a thinly-veiled dig at OpenAI’s decision to start shoving advertisements into ChatGPT.

And it clearly struck a nerve. Altman unbecomingly responded with a lengthy rant on X, accusing the Anthropic ads of being “deceptive” and suggesting that Anthropic was an “authoritarian company.” That’s while admitting he thought the ads were “funny,” as if to convince us that he could take a joke, and not be having the mini-meltdown that he was clearly experiencing.

The two companies are also poised to lock heads over shaping the industry’s regulation. Last week, Anthropic announced it would pour $20 million into a super PAC formed to combat another super PAC backed by key OpenAI figures and investors. Anthropic’s side is fighting for stronger AI regulation, while OpenAI’s favors a laissez-faire playing field. Among other things, the money will go to the campaigns of favored candidates ahead of the upcoming midterm elections.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Thanks to the rise of sports betting and prediction markets, gambling has turned from an activity sequestered to casinos and scratch tickets into something that practically anybody with an internet connection can dive into headfirst — something that has experts warning of a surge in gambling addiction, especially among young, impressionable minds.

Platforms like Polymarket mean that gamblers are no longer limited to betting their hard-earned cash on red or black during a game of roulette or mindlessly pulling the lever of a slot machine — now they can bet on whether Jesus Christ will return before the long-awaited release of the video game “GTA VI,” or by what date the United States will strike Iran.

And now, a new gambling game called Rush Hour CCTV on the crypto casino platform Roobet is taking the phenomenon to an even more ludicrous conclusion. As casino publication Win.gg points out, gamblers there are betting on how many cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles, or pedestrians are crossing a specific point within a predetermined time period on a street in live, licensed CCTV footage being streamed from big cities, including Tokyo, Bangkok, New York, and London.

It may sound banal — and it many ways it is — but instead of relying on traditional random number generator mechanics (RNG) that determine the outcome in slot machines, the new game relies on the real world instead.

The game is deceptively simple. Each round kicks off with a simple message: “How many vehicles?”

Gamblers can then bet on how many vehicles will cross a point within the next 55 seconds. They can also give a range as an answer, which will give a significantly lower payout than guessing the exact number.

It’s a dystopian glimpse into a largely unregulated crypto gambling world. Even in China, where online gambling — including crypto-based prediction markets like Polymarket — is illegal, the trend has surged in popularity. As Rest of World reports, the company has been hiring Mandarin-speaking staff, with trading volumes across Asia hitting “hundreds of millions” of dollars a month.

Crypto casinos like Roobet, which is hosting Rush Hour CCTV, have seen revenues surge despite widespread bans. Users have been using virtual private networks, mirror links, and redirecting URLs to get around restrictions.

Crypto gambling market reached an estimated $81 billion last year, according to Bitcoin.com, and analysts predict this year will be no different, in large part thanks to the proliferation of stablecoins, which are often pegged to far more stable fiat currencies.

Meanwhile, popular streamers are roping in new users, enticing them with simple crypto casino games. Even underage users can circumvent restrictions by using false identities, as the New York Times reported last year.

Online celebrities — including renowned music artists like Aubrey “Drake” Graham and Calvin “Snoop Dogg” Broadus — are gambling during livestreams, effectively encouraging fans to get hooked themselves.

Whether regulators will step up to the plate to ensure that trend won’t turn into a crisis remains unclear. The Trump administration has been particularly amenable, stacking regulatory committees with CEOs of prediction markets, crypto companies, and sports betting apps.

In other words, chances are that even more young people will be enticed to bet on how many vehicles will pass by in CCTV footage.

Worse yet, awareness of the risks of gambling addiction is lagging far behind.

“We can’t keep up with the most popular streamers that are on the internet,” Queens Problem Gambling Resource Center team leader Robin Singh told the NYT last year. “That’s the problem, unfortunately, that the issue spreads way faster than the solution does.”

            <h2>Amazon’s Shiny New Warehouse Robot Just Failed in Spectacular Style</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/robots-and-machines/amazon-warehouse-robot-failed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In October, Amazon proudly announced a new warehouse robot made up of multiple robotic arms called Blue Jay, which alongside an AI system would “reduce repetitive tasks, improve safety, and boost productivity — while speeding up delivery.”

“Visually, Blue Jay operates like a juggler who never drops a ball — only here, the ‘balls’ are tens of thousands of items moving at high speed,” the company rhapsodized at the time. “It’s also like a conductor leading an orchestra, with every motion in harmony.”

Now the whole thing has turned into an embarrassing debacle. As inside sources told Business Insider, the tech giant quietly pulled its Blue Jay robot just months after its announcement, undermining its claims of taking advantage of recent advancements in AI tech.

Spokesperson Terrence Clark told BI that the core tech of the multi-arm robot will be repurposed elsewhere. It remains unclear why exactly Amazon chose to mothball the robot.

“We’re always experimenting with new ways to improve the customer experience and make work safer, more efficient, and more engaging for our employees,” Clark said. “In this case, we’re actually accelerating the use of the underlying technology developed for Blue Jay, and nearly all of the technologies are being carried over and will continue to support employees across our network,” the spokesperson told TechCrunch in a separate statement.

Clark also said that Blue Jay was a prototype, although Amazon’s October press release didn’t mention anything about that.

The failed experiment highlights how difficult it is to carry over recent advancements in AI into the real world. Reality is far messier and more unpredictable than a digital environment, requiring algorithms to continually adjust.

Amazon’s response also underlines the company’s commitment to eventually automating its warehouses with robots. As the New York Times reported the day before the company showed off its Blue Jay robot, Amazon is secretly looking to eventually replace more than 600,000 jobs with robots.

There’s been immense buzz over the past few years about human-free “dark factories” — entirely automated facilities that don’t require lighting, heating, or air conditioning, that are starting to crop up in China.

Companies are also betting big on humanoid robots, which could eventually take over many tasks currently being fulfilled by humans.

But as the latest developments go to show, the tech needed to fulfill human jobs still needs plenty of work. Meanwhile, the pressure on companies to deliver on their lofty promises, especially when it comes to AI, continues to grow.

Amazon has committed to spending $200 billion to build out AI infrastructure this year alone, a lofty sum that had investors rattled earlier this month.

However, whether its failed robot will matter much in the long run is unlikely. Just earlier today, news emerged that Amazon had surpassed Walmart as the world’s largest company, measured by sales, a momentous occasion highlighting the e-commerce behemoth’s continuing dominance. Shares, however, remained steady following the news, suggesting a lingering wariness among investors.

            <div id="article-text">The immense hype surrounding AI has caused enormous data centers to crop up across the country, triggering significant opposition. It’s not just the loss of land: enormous power needs are pushing the grid into meltdown and driving up local electricity prices, catching the attention of politicians and their irate constituents.

One 86-year-old farmer in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, has heard enough. As local Fox affiliate WPMT reports, Mervin Raudabaugh, who has farmed the surrounding land for more than 60 years, turned down more than $15 million from data center developers in a package deal that involved three neighboring property owners as well.

The farmer was offered $60,000 per acre to build a data center on his property. But giving up his family legacy wasn’t in the cards for him.

“I was not interested in destroying my farms,” he told WPMT. “That was the bottom line. It really wasn’t so much the economic end of it. I just didn’t want to see these two farms destroyed.”

Instead, he sold the development rights in December for just under $2 million to a conservation trust, taking a significant loss but guaranteeing that it would stay farmland in perpetuity.

Users on social media called him a “legend,” and argued he had “more integrity than the whole government.”

“Now that is a real hero in these gutless times!” another user tweeted.

“$15M is huge, but clean water, quiet land, and legacy don’t have a price tag,” another user argued.

The sheer amount of land being earmarked to construct enormous energy and water-sucking data centers is remarkable. A data center in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, is set to take up 600 acres, which could cost local residents their land, as ABC News reported this week. Another octogenarian farmer, the 83-year-old Tom Uttech, who has lived on his 52-acre Wisconsin property for almost 40 years, told the broadcaster that he “couldn’t believe” that a local utility company was looking to build “power lines that are 300 or something feet tall, taller than apparently the Statue of Liberty,” through his land to power the data center.

Per ABC, there are more than 3,000 data centers in the US, a number that will soon grow by 1,200 more, which are currently being constructed.

But few, apart from salivating tech company executives, are particularly keen on the idea. And the growing backlash to the AI industry has gotten the attention of politicians. New York lawmakers recently announced a new bill that would impose a three-year moratorium on developing new data centers in the state, at least the sixth state to introduce such legislation, as Wired reported earlier this month.

Meanwhile, industry leaders are looking for an alternative, suggesting launching data centers into space instead. While it could certainly ensure that no more precious farmland is being used up, it remains to be seen whether it’s even remotely feasible, both physically and financially.

“It breaks my heart to think of what’s going to take place here, because only the land that’s preserved here is going to be here,” Raudabaugh told WPMT. “The rest of every square inch is going to get built on. The American farm family is definitely in trouble.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Investors have been rattled by the enormous amount of money AI companies are committing to spend on infrastructure buildouts. Amazon alone saw its share price drop precipitously earlier this month after announcing that it’s planning to spend $200 billion this year on AI. Microsoft’s shares also plummeted after stoking fears that a return on AI investment may be even further off than expected.

In total, big tech companies are predicted to spend a record-breaking $650 billion on AI in 2026 alone, astronomical commitments that have Wall Street seriously on edge.

Fears over an AI bubble continue to grow as analysts warn that companies are massively overinvesting. According to a new Bank of America survey of 162 fund managers, a significant 35 percent said corporations are overinvesting in capital expenditures — funds used by a company to acquire, upgrade, and maintain physical assets — at a record proportion compared to previous survey results spanning the last 20 years. Only 20 percent said they approved of increasing capital expenditures.

An AI bubble is a clear focus. A full 25 percent of survey respondents said they see the AI bubble as the largest risk — even more so than inflation and geopolitical conflict. And 30 percent said that AI expenditures were the most likely source of a credit crisis.

In short, the survey results paint a dire picture of the current state of the market, blinking warning signs that big tech companies are spreading themselves too thin by continuing to hemorrhage tens of billions of dollars each quarter.

Meanwhile, tech leaders continue to justify their enormous spending, with Google CEO Sundar Pichai touting the present moment as “extraordinary” and “transformational,” during the AI Summit in New Delhi, India, on Wednesday, comparing the AI boom to the industrial revolution, “but ten times faster and ten times larger.”

AI chipmaker Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also attempted to calm spooked investors this week, arguing AI investments are just the beginning.

“I would say clients are justified in being worried [about an AI bubble] because there’s a lot of uncertainty,” Orbis Investments advisor Ben Preston told the Financial Times.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">According to Elon Musk, xAI’s Grok chatbot has a new bona fide: blatantly lying about the history of America.

On Wednesday, the centi-billionaire culture warrior boasted that the “4.20” version of his is officially “BASED.” Why? Because it won’t “equivocate” when it’s asked if the US is built on stolen land. Instead, it gives an emphatic no as its answer, while other “weak sauce” models — in Musk’s words, at least — give a more nuanced response.

“No, the United States is not simply ‘on stolen land,&#39;” Grok says in a screenshotted conversation shared by its creator. “That framing is a modern rhetorical slogan that oversimplifies thousands of years of human history, layered claims to territory, legal doctrines, treaties, warfare, migration, and demographic collapse.”

The reality, of course, is that it’s hard to argue that the ruthless killing, enslavement, and displacement of Native Americans by European settlers doesn’t amount to their land being stolen. This pattern of behavior continued well after the colonies graduated into a full-blown nation: the Trail of Tears, Wounded Knee, plus countless other massacres, not to mention centuries of brutal residential schools. However complicated it might be, the answer to whether the US was built on stolen land can’t be boiled down to a simple “no.”

How competing chatbots approach the question varies. In Musk’s screenshot, ChatGPT, says the “short answer” is yes: “much of the land that is now the United States was taken through conquest, coercion, broken treaties, or forced removal of Indigenous peoples.” Claude 4.6 delicately approaches it by acknowledging that it’s a “contested question” and presents the case for both the yes and no arguments.

We don’t recommend using hallucination-prone AIs for research, but if he had to, we’d probably pick one of the chatbots that lay out the facts and debate, instead of subjecting ourselves to a moralizing rant from an AI best known for calling itself “MechaHitler” and generating nudes of people without their consent.

But Musk seems proud of his chatbot’s response, which is essentially providing ideologues with a comforting yet oversimplified version of history.

“Every square inch of habitable land on Earth has changed hands through conquest, migration, purchase, or displacement multiple times — long before 1492 and everywhere else on the planet,” Grok fumes, as you probably begin to imagine an Elon Musk-shaped claw puppeting its mouth.

This boast is the latest example of Musk’s commitment to tampering with Grok so that it reflects his personal worldview. He has repeatedly admonished Grok after he caught it citing mainstream news sources that didn’t align with his far-right beliefs. Last summer, the chatbot suspiciously began parroting talking points in response to completely unrelated posts about a supposed “white genocide” in South Africa, a racist conspiracy theory that Musk, a white South African, believes in. Months later, it suddenly began praising Musk to a preposterous degree, leading to declarations that he was a greater mind than Isaac Newton and better role model than Jesus Christ. Musk’s goal of rewriting reality reached its apotheosis with the launch of “Grokipedia,” an AI-generated and Grok-edited alternative to Wikipedia, which conspicuously defended the Cybertruck and cited actual Nazi websites.

But ironically, even Grok may not be “BASED.” When we asked it about the US being on stolen land, it gave a very different answer to the one Musk was gloating about.

“The United States, as it exists today, was indeed largely built on lands that were originally inhabited and controlled by Indigenous peoples,” Grok replied, “and much of that land was acquired through processes that many historians and legal scholars describe as theft, coercion, or violation of treaties.”

Last year, the phone hacking tool maker Cellebrite announced it had suspended Serbian police as customers, after human rights researchers alleged local police and intelligence agencies used its tools to hack into the phones of a journalist and an activist, and plant spyware.

This was a rare example of Cellebrite publicly cutting off a customer following documented allegations of abuse, citing Amnesty International’s technical report for its decision.

But following recent similar accusations of abuse in Jordan and Kenya, the Israeli-headquartered company responded by dismissing the allegations and declining to commit to investigating them. It’s unclear why Cellebrite has changed its approach, which appears contrary to its previous actions.

On Tuesday, researchers at The University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab published a report alleging the Kenyan government used Cellebrite’s tools to unlock the phone of Boniface Mwangi, a local activist and politician, while he was in police custody. In another report from January, the Citizen Lab accused the Jordanian government of breaking into the phones of several local activists and protesters using Cellebrite’s tools.

In both investigations, the Citizen Lab, an organization that has investigated abuses of spyware and hacking technologies around the world, based their conclusions on finding traces of a specific application linked to Cellebrite on the victims’ phones.

The researchers said that those traces are a “high confidence” signal that someone used Cellebrite’s unlocking tools on the phones in question, because the same application had been previously found on VirusTotal, a malware repository, and was signed with digital certificates owned by Cellebrite.

Other researchers have also linked the same application to Cellebrite.

“We do not respond to speculation and encourage any organization with specific, evidence-based concerns to share them with us directly so we can act on them,” Victor Cooper, a spokesperson for Cellebrite, told TechCrunch in an email.

When asked why Cellebrite is acting differently from the Serbia case, Cooper said “the two situations are incomparable,” and that, “high confidence is not direct evidence.”

Cooper did not respond to multiple follow-up emails asking if Cellebrite would investigate the Citizen Lab’s latest report, and what, if any, differences there are with its case in Serbia.

In both its Kenya and Jordan investigations, the Citizen Lab reached out to Cellebrite in advance of publishing the reports to provide the company with a right to respond.

In response to the Jordan report, Cellebrite said that “any substantiated use of our tools in violation of human rights or local law will result in immediate disablement,” but did not commit to investigating the case and declined to disclose specific information about customers.

For the Kenya report, however, Cellebrite acknowledged receipt of Citizen Lab’s inquiry but did not comment, according to John Scott-Railton, one of the Citizen Lab researchers who worked on the Cellebrite investigations.

“We urge Cellebrite to release the specific criteria they used to approve sales to Kenyan authorities, and disclose how many licenses have been revoked in the past,” Scott-Railton told TechCrunch. “If Cellebrite is serious about their rigorous vetting, they should have no problem making it public.”

Following previous reports of abuse, Cellebrite, which claims to have more than 7,000 law enforcement customers around the world, cut off relationships with Bangladesh and Myanmar, as well as Russia and Belarus during 2021. Cellebrite previously said it stopped selling to Hong Kong and China following U.S. government regulations restricting the export of sensitive technologies to the country. Local activists in Hong Kong had accused the authorities of using Cellebrite to unlock protesters’ phones.

Fewer bad actors are targeting Google Play with malicious apps, the company says, a shift that the tech giant credits with its increased investments in proactive security systems and AI technology.

In its latest Android app ecosystem safety report released on Thursday, Google said it prevented 1.75 million policy-violating apps from being published on Google Play in 2025, down from 2.36 million in 2024 and 2.28 million in 2023.

The annual report offers a look at how Google is keeping Android users safe by reviewing and monitoring apps to protect against malware, financial fraud, privacy invasions, sneaky subscriptions, and other threats.

For instance, Google says it banned more than 80,000 developer accounts in 2025 that had tried to publish these types of bad apps. That figure is also down year-over-year from 158,000 in 2024, and 333,000 in 2023.

Google touted how its investments in AI and other real-time defenses have helped fight these sorts of threats, but also how they served as a deterrent.

“Initiatives like developer verification, mandatory pre-review checks, and testing requirements have raised the bar for the Google Play ecosystem, significantly reducing the paths for bad actors to enter,” the company’s blog post explained, adding that its “AI-powered, multi-layer protections” have been “discouraging bad actors from publishing malicious apps.”

Google noted it now runs over 10,000 safety checks on every app it publishes and continues to recheck apps after publication. The company has also integrated its latest generative AI models into the app review process, which has helped human reviewers find more complex malicious patterns faster. Google said it plans to increase its AI investments in 2026 to stay ahead of emerging threats.

In addition, Google said it prevented more than 255,000 apps from gaining excessive access to sensitive user data, a figure that’s down from 1.3 million in 2024. The company also blocked 160 million spam ratings and reviews last year, and prevented an average 0.5-star rating drop for apps targeted by review bombing.

Meanwhile, Android’s defense system, known as Google Play Protect, identified more than 27 million new malicious apps, and warned users or blocked the app from running. That’s an increase from the 13 million non-Play Store apps identified in 2024 and five million seen in 2023. These increases seem to suggest that bad actors are now more often avoiding the Play Store when targeting users with their malicious apps.

A year ago, Redwood Materials didn’t have an energy storage business. Now, it is the fastest-growing unit within the battery recycling and materials startup — a reflection of an AI data center building boom.

The evidence of that growth, the company says, can be found at its R&D lab in San Francisco, which has expanded four-fold into a 55,000-square-foot facility and now employs nearly 100 people. Those are small figures compared to Redwood’s total workforce of 1,200 people and its sprawling campus at its Carson City, Nevada headquarters and another facility near Reno. But its value and recent expansion are tied directly to its burgeoning energy storage that launched in June 2025.

The San Francisco facility, which opened in April 2025, is where engineers integrate the hardware, software, and power electronics for energy storage systems that power data centers, AI computing, and other large-scale industrial applications.

The company said in a blog post Thursday the expansion will support a wave of energy storage deployments related to data centers. The company’s recent $425 million Series E raise will provide the capital needed to scale the business. Google, a new investor, as well as existing backer Nvidia, joined the round to support Redwood’s energy storage business venture.

“AI data centers have definitely been a pressing area of focus,” Claire McConnell, vice president of business development told TechCrunch in a recent interview, who added there are other use cases for its systems including supporting renewable projects like solar and wind.

Data centers have been around for decades, but advancements in AI have spurred a building spree and a need for reliable electricity.

“What data center developers are seeing is something that they hadn’t experienced before,” McConnell said. “When they’re trying to connect to the grid, they are being told it is going to take five-plus years to get that and at the same time, you’re seeing this massive demand to build more data centers and compete in the AI race.”

Redwood Materials was founded in 2017 by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel to create a circular supply chain for batteries. It initially focused on recycling scrap from battery production and consumer electronics, which was processed and then sold to customers such as Panasonic. The company also expanded into the battery materials business and today produces cathodes for battery cells.

The company opened Redwood Energy last summer to leverage the thousands of EV batteries it has collected as part of its battery-recycling business to provide power to companies. Redwood Energy’s first customer is Crusoe, a startup that, in 2021, Straubel invested in. Redwood setup an energy storage system that uses old EV batteries that are not yet ready for recycling. The system, which generates 12 MW of power and has 63 MWh of capacity, sends power to a modular data center built by Crusoe, a company best known for its large-scale data center campus in Abilene, Texas — the initial site of the Stargate project.

McConnell said customers that are in the pipeline include hyperscalers — companies that operate massive cloud computing data centers and consume hundreds of megawatts of power — that would far exceed the capacity of its project with Crusoe.

“We’re working on ones in the hundreds of megawatt hours, and we have ones in the pipeline that are multiple gigawatt hours,” she said.

As AI companies get bigger in valuation and usage, there is a constant debate about how AI is replacing humans in various jobs. Studies suggest that roles where AI can automate most tasks will be impacted, though some analysts believe that AI may also create jobs, with the displacement effect only transitional.

David Shim, CEO of meeting notetaker and intelligence company Read AI, told TechCrunch at Web Summit Qatar earlier this month that even with the rise of AI tools, it will ultimately be humans who decide the course of action, and their job will be important. He equated the technology with using maps in a car.

“I think there’s always going to be a human in the middle,” Shim said. “I think the job is going to get easier over time. But a good example would be like driving a car. When we first started, you used to have a map. And you’d pull out the map. And you’d go in and say okay I’m driving. I’m deciding what happens. Now everyone uses Waze or Google Maps, and the map is telling you where to go. And you’re just following that order. But you’re the human in the middle who can decide what happens.”

Shim acknowledged that AI would affect jobs, noting that advertising agencies may lose human roles in favor of automated tools. However, he noted that tech platforms would need jobs to oversee the automation process.

Abdullah Asiri, founder of AI-powered consumer support tooling startup Lucidya, said that he believes that AI will replace tasks but not roles. He said that when his company’s clients use Lucidya, customer support agents often take up different roles and responsibilities. He noted that some become supervisors who guide other humans and AI, while some take up relationship-building and business development responsibilities using the time they saved.

Read AI’s Shim noted that meeting notetakers have freed up humans from taking notes manually.

“Nobody here wants to sit down and take meeting notes, but as you start to take away that job, you have a little bit more time to do other things that you can go and focus on. You can send that report a little bit faster, or you can respond back to a customer and actually have better context to make better decisions, versus spending a bunch of time gathering all the information and having little time to make a decision,” he said.

As tech companies like Read AI and Lucidya are increasingly using AI tools, they want to keep their teams lean. Currently, Read AI’s customer service team consists of just five people, who serve millions of monthly users. Shim noted that the company is using AI tools to make a small team more productive and give them more context to help them do their job more quickly.

The companies are said to be reaping productivity gains. Read AI said that its sales tool helps predict the state of a deal using data from CRM systems like HubSpot and Salesforce. The startup said that it has seen deals worth $200 million approved through that system. Shim said Read AI captures 23% more context with each update, which could be used to evaluate what worked or what didn’t in a lead call.

Lucidya’s Asiri also noted that the company uses AI tools, including Read AI, for meetings and marketing asset creation. He said that the company wants “scale outcomes without scaling headcounts.”

“The goal for any company is to hire people who are AI native, who are very strong with AI, but we need to be realistic,” Asiri said. “Today, this skill is being developed. You cannot find a lot of people who have very strong AI capabilities, not building AI, but using AI.”

Asiri noted that people who would be able to build agents that can help them do their job would be more desirable to hire.

Shim noted that just a few years ago, many people were hesitant to have AI notetakers in meetings and didn’t understand why a bot was on the call. However, now people are more receptive to notetakers as long as you give them controls around recording, he said.

Asiri said that Lucidya discloses to users when it’s using a voice AI to communicate. He said that for users, issue resolution is more important than the fact that an AI bot is handling their calls.

“It’s all about resolving issues and finding customers’ problems and resolving them,” Asiri said. “As long as the AI agents are actually focusing on that part, customers are happy that their issues are being resolved. The customer really doesn’t care whether it’s fixed by AI or a human, as long as it’s fixed fast and accurately.”

The race to advance conversational AI in the living room is heating up, with YouTube being the latest to expand its tool to smart TVs, gaming consoles, and streaming devices.

This experimental feature, previously limited to mobile devices and the web, now brings conversational AI directly to the largest screen in the home, allowing users to ask questions about content without leaving the video they’re watching.

According to YouTube’s support page, eligible users can click the “Ask” button on their TV screen to summon the AI assistant. The feature offers suggested questions based on the video, or users can use their remote’s microphone button to ask anything related to the video. For instance, they might ask about recipe ingredients or the background of a song’s lyrics, and receive instant answers without pausing or leaving the app.

Currently, this feature is available to a select group of users over 18 and supports English, Hindi, Spanish, Portuguese, and Korean.

YouTube first launched this conversational AI tool in 2024 to help viewers explore content in greater depth. The expansion to TVs comes as more Americans now access YouTube through their television than ever before. A Nielsen report from April 2025 found that YouTube accounted for 12.4% of total television audience time, surpassing major platforms like Disney and Netflix.

Other companies are also making significant strides with their conversational AI technologies. Amazon rolled out Alexa+ on Fire TV devices, enabling users to engage in natural conversations and ask Alexa+ for tailored content recommendations, hunt for specific scenes in movies, or even ask questions about actors and filming locations.

Meanwhile, Roku has enhanced its AI voice assistant to handle open-ended questions about movies and shows, such as “What’s this movie about?” or “How scary is it?” Netflix is also testing its AI search experience.

Another way YouTube has tried to improve its TV experience with AI is the recent launch of a feature that automatically enhances videos uploaded at lower resolutions to full HD.

Additionally, the company continues to launch other AI features, like a comments summarizer that helps viewers catch up on video discussions and an AI-driven search results carousel. In January, the company announced that creators will soon be able to make Shorts using AI-generated versions of their own likeness.

Last week, YouTube launched a dedicated app for the Apple Vision Pro, too, letting users watch their favorite content on a theater-sized virtual screen in an immersive environment.

ChatGPT and food-delivery droids came to my campus at roughly the same time, in the 2022–23 academic year. My response—cranky, tweedy—was hopelessly on brand for a history professor. The chatbot and the droid appeared to be in league, robotic species on the vanguard of civilizational collapse. Both were premised on the idea of frictionless ease, liberating their users from outmoded toils. Because you couldn’t kick the chatbot, I had to resist the urge to kick the droids. I felt new and sudden sympathy with those English weavers who tried to smash the machines.

I’d like to think that my grievance was rooted in something beyond my own impending irrelevance. The product of too many years of humanities education, I wanted to defend the foundational exercise of writing. Going back to the late 19th century, writing instruction in the humanities has been premised on the idea of writing as both a craft and an art: a practical skill that could be taught and refined, and a creative practice through which sustained effort yielded insight. The formula went something like this: We read things, we had conversations about them to unravel their many levels, then we went and wrote. In that final part of the cycle—the writing part—were torments, perhaps even tortures, but good things happened. We became thinking people, mingling with complex ideas and perhaps coming up with some of our own. The advent of the chatbot raised an unsettling question: What if writing didn’t have to be hard? What if that noble ordeal was no more necessary than going to a well to fetch your water when you could just turn on a tap?

Combing through the archives of The Atlantic, one might reasonably conclude that both writing instruction and civilization have been in peril since roughly 1890. In 1893, James Jay Greenough argued that young minds had become impoverished by too many slang words to form anything but “narrow” ideas. By November of 1959, when the magazine had a special section on “The Teaching of Reading and Writing,” excessive emphasis on standardized testing had pushed writing instruction to the side—just at the moment when young people’s minds were becoming addled by modern media and the popularity of “illiterate expressions.”

Easy as it is to mock the melodrama of such pronouncements, I can understand them. Underlying the different diagnoses and prescriptions is the basic idea that animated my own efforts as a professor: that learning to write was vital to the formation of a mind. As Henry Chauncey put it in the magazine in 1959, the “art of written communication” was “clear thinking clearly expressed.” Something essential was happening in the hard work of trying to make your thoughts comprehensible to another human being (even if that human being was just your teacher). The sparks thrown off in the process could become the energy for better thoughts—for more complex and perhaps even original ideas.

The trouble was that thinking the thoughts, finding the words, and getting them down on the page could involve considerable discomfort. Writing in the magazine in 1912, soon after graduating from college, Randolph Bourne described the “hopeless labor of writing.” “One must struggle constantly,” Bourne lamented, “to warm again the thoughts that are cold or have been utterly consumed.”

Students didn’t turn to chatbots to warm their cold and consumed thoughts all at once, but the advent of AI tools sparked a disorienting reckoning for those of us reading their papers. At first, some of the work coming in was just a little weird. Certain papers appeared as Frankenstein monsters of machine-made and human text, some of it eloquent yet empty, some of it strained  and meandering in familiar ways.

But in the years to come, with updated models and the fuller integration of AI into people’s lives, I noticed a general smoothing out of student writing. The hard edges and rough parts were getting sanded down, and the arguments and ideas were more uniform. It was less common to see the kinds of errors I’d hoped to preempt on the guide to writing and history I gave the students. They didn’t refer to works of historical scholarship as “novels” much anymore, but they also didn’t find their way into some beautiful, odd idea in a convoluted sentence buried in the second paragraph on page 4.

By the end of last year, I had dusted off blue books for the first time in years and had the students sit for an in-class essay. Reading their tortured handwriting was a small price to pay to see their thoughts anew—messy, but alive.</div>

If you put any stock in the ability of IQ tests to assess intelligence, we humans have spent the past century steadily getting smarter. (And if you don’t put any stock in them, well, we humans have steadily gotten better at IQ tests.)

Because IQ is a standardized measure, humankind’s average score still sits at 100—but this isn’t your granddaddy’s 100. IQ tests are regularly recalibrated, and over the past many decades, when new subjects have taken an old test, they have almost always outscored their predecessors’ average; Grandpa’s generation might have hovered around 100, but the kids are scoring 115 … which then becomes the new 100.

This phenomenon is called the Flynn effect, and researchers still aren’t sure what causes it. Perhaps it’s due to more efficient education or better nutrition. The reason could be that modern environments contain more interesting stimuli or that modern gasoline no longer contains lead.

I haven’t seen anyone propose that trivia is to thank, but the growing popularity of quizzing tracks with the IQ trend line pretty well too. I think I speak for all of science when I say we shouldn’t rule it out quite yet.

And by the way, did you know that barcode scanning was initially greeted with a huge backlash? The first item ever scanned by barcode was a pack of Wrigley’s chewing gum at a supermarket in Troy, Ohio, in June 1974, but by the end of the ’70s, only about 1 percent of stores had adopted barcodes.

Consumers were worried that the tech would be used to rip them off. Advocacy groups mounted campaigns against the barcode, and protesters even picketed stores that used scanners. Others swore that the barcode was the biblical “mark of the beast.”

Obviously, it eventually caught on, and people got over their fears—though if you ever get rung up at $6.66, maybe offer to round to the next dollar, just in case.

And by the way, did you know that the University of Bologna is nearly a millennium old? It’s the world’s oldest university that was founded as such (at least one older university started as a madrasa), and its alumni include Copernicus, Dante, and more than one pope.

Imagine trying to write a halfway-decent poem for an assignment, and your classmate turns in the Divine Comedy. Then again, at least you’d have had a leg up on Copernicus, who probably got marked off plenty for insisting that the Earth actually orbits the sun.</div>

            <div id="article-text">In 1988, as the Reverend Jesse Jackson was making his second presidential bid, I left the campaign trail, where I was covering the eventual Democratic nominee, Michael Dukakis, to make a personal pilgrimage to Wichita, Kansas. I had come to see my sick grandfather, Ga-Ga, who was comatose in the hospital and seemed barely there.

Day and night, I held his hand hoping he would make it. I knew he had admired Jackson’s first presidential bid in 1984 and the courage—some called it audacity—required to run at all. So I told him about the huge, overwhelmingly white crowds Jackson was drawing in places like Iowa and Wisconsin. There was a refrain Jackson had been using in Iowa to convince audiences he really could win this time: “Great days just keep on coming.” I was not sure if Ga-Ga could hear me, but I repeated the refrain to him, trying anything I could to uplift him as he struggled to hold on to his life. “Great days just keep on coming.” And to my surprise, I glimpsed a thin smile, and he squeezed my hand.

Ga-Ga didn’t make it. But Jackson came much closer to winning the Democratic nomination than anyone had expected. He won 11 primaries and caucuses, doubled his 1984 combined-vote total to nearly 7 million, and finished as runner-up to Dukakis. His impact in that hospital room—and he wasn’t even there—eliciting a glimmer of life from my dying grandfather, has always stayed with me.

For many years, I watched firsthand how Jackson stirred to joy those “who catch the early bus” to work, as Jackson liked to say—cooks, janitors, housekeepers, construction workers, tenants in housing projects.

We see little of this gift now, the ability to project hope in a fractured country, to instill belief in those who’ve lost it. Our politics has become coarse and tawdry, and the highest levels of elected office seem no place to turn to for inspiration. Who can be counted on to convert gloom into optimism with a speech?

Adam Serwer: Do not be cynical about Jesse Jackson

Jesse Louis Jackson, who died Tuesday at 84, was one of the most consequential political figures of the 20th century and among the greatest orators America has ever seen. This goes well beyond his credentials as a civil-rights leader who participated in the sit-ins and marches of the 1960s. He was brilliant, voracious, provocative, and persuasive all at once, at times electrifying and at times confounding.

I interacted with Jackson, on and off, for 30 years—on private planes and in late-night phone calls, at diners and Black churches. I once watched Jackson dash to officiate a wedding for a friend between campaign stops.

Black political leaders of varying significance had been discussing running for president ever since Shirley Chisholm’s inspiring campaign in 1972, which became a feminist cause to rally around. Those conversations intensified after Harold Washington’s 1983 victory to become Chicago’s first Black mayor. But none of the likely Black politicians—including, notably, then–Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young—took the leap. Most thought it was a symbolic fool’s errand that at best would end in crushing defeat and at worst would damage relationships inside the Democratic Party. Only Jackson had the daring to go for it, urged on during a national voter-registration drive in 1983 by large crowds of supporters who’d chant: “Run, Jesse, run!”

Perhaps the most significant part of Jackson’s electoral success in 1984 and 1988 was how his campaigns opened up the Democratic Party to an influx of new field-workers, operatives, and volunteers, many of whom had never before participated in electoral politics. Jackson also pushed through a crucial change in party rules that later benefited Barack Obama’s historic candidacy in 2008. Because of Jackson, delegates in Democratic primaries and caucuses are now awarded proportionally according to the results in each state. Previously, some states used a winner-takes-all system. Twenty years later, Obama was able to build an insurmountable lead over his closest rival, Hillary Clinton. He continued to rack up delegates despite her winning nine of the last 16 contests. To say that the first Black president owes a lot to Jesse Jackson is an understatement.

Jackson’s mind was not like others’. He used to say, “If you need an alarm clock to wake up, you’re already behind.” How he managed to do so much, to keep such a vigorous schedule, which would often shift abruptly, was a marvel. I was in the middle of interviewing him once on his private jet headed to Iowa. He paused and said: “Buddy, I’m gonna close my eyes for about 20 minutes. I’ll get right back to you.” It was like he was taking a commercial break from the interview.

And sure enough, after 20 minutes of shut-eye, he awoke and resumed the interview like he had never left it.

His uncommon ability to create metaphor and imagery left audiences repeating lines and catchphrases, as though he were Kendrick Lamar on tour. “We who are giants must stop having grasshopper complexes and grasshopper dreams,” Jackson said during an Atlanta breakfast I attended in 2000. “We are not grasshoppers.”

I used to think Jackson was naturally blessed with the talent of combining words, that retention of complex ideas and cadence of delivery were just his superpowers. But I learned that he had a process, like athletes have—a pregame ritual. “I get up early and study,” Jackson told me. Sometimes before dawn. “To do what I do does require preparation. That must be the most underrated part of this work. If you ain’t on fire, you can’t give off heat.”

“The only way you can speak with authority,” he added, “is if you have command of your material.”

Having command of his material served Jackson well, except when it didn’t—when he hadn’t worked out all of the details and couldn’t answer all of the questions.

Peripatetic isn’t a big-enough word for Jackson’s rolling set of interests: school-board disputes, wars, poverty, voting rights, hostage negotiations, Wall Street, Silicon Valley. Nothing seemed to be off his plate, and thus there sometimes seemed to be too much on his plate. The chance to build a large movement, perhaps even a viable third party, seemed squandered. His promising multiracial National Rainbow Coalition, including farmers, laborers, youth, women’s-rights activists, never got organized into a true progressive electoral force. Sustained focus and infrastructure were not Jackson’s strengths.

Anyone who happened to be on Jackson’s radar—and the focus of that radar changed from year to year, sometimes from month to month—knew to expect a call from him at any time. He knew whom to call for what, whom to enlist and how to enlist them.

Bill Daley, who was the chairperson of Al Gore’s 2000 campaign, marveled at the pace Jackson kept. “The only problem,” he told me during that run, was that “he stays up too late. He calls in the middle of the night. Fortunately, I learned I had an ‘Off’ button on my cellphone. Though when I turn it back on in the morning, the first message is usually from Reverend Jackson.&quot;

Long before everyone had cellphones, Jackson would call me at home on my landline, typically at 10 or 11 p.m., sometimes midnight. These calls would be more like soliloquies than conversations. Jackson would do all the talking, letting me know about a particular injustice he was concerned about, briefing me on an issue campaign he was about to embark on, or railing about something in the news he thought was not right or fair. He would dish, but also educate.

Clint Smith: Those who try to erase history will fail

One day in February 2015, Jackson showed up in the lobby of The Washington Post and asked to speak with the managing editor. At the time I was one of two managing editors, and the first African American to hold the position in the Post’s history. The call from the security desk came to my assistant, who seemed shocked that the Jesse Jackson was downstairs in the lobby unannounced. I was not shocked; I had seen Jackson just show up to places many times, just as he made calls without giving notice.

Though I was busy at the time, I rearranged my schedule, and Jackson was escorted up. He had two or three aides with him. I don’t remember exactly what his business was that day—some new cause he was advancing. He seemed pleasantly surprised, and full of pride, that I had a big office and was overseeing daily coverage in the newsroom. We talked for about 20 minutes, and then I ushered him to the elevators and thanked him for dropping by.

About a week or so later, I got a package in the mail. It was a photo of Jackson and Martin Luther King Jr. during their young civil-rights-activism days. It was signed by Jackson with the inscription, “He would be proud of you.”

The photo, and an accompanying letter thanking me for adjusting my schedule, caught me off guard. I had never seen Jackson do anything like that.

The notion that King would be proud of me? That brought me to tears. I stared at the picture for a while. It was a reminder of how hard King, Jackson, and many others who are now gone worked to open the doors of opportunity throughout this country—including in newsrooms, where those doors had long been shut to people like me.</div>

            <h2>The Longevity Scam</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The quest to live forever has fascinated humans for millennia. The Epic of Gilgamesh, composed about 4,000 years ago, follows a king who searches the world for a plant that can restore youth, only to lose the plant to a thieving snake. The (likely apocryphal) story of Juan Ponce de León, who is said to have embarked on a search for the Fountain of Youth in the early 16th century, refuses to die—unlike its protagonist, who was killed along his journey.

Today’s longevity-medicine movement is driven by the same aggressive desire for eternal youth as the mythic stories of old. But whereas in earlier times ideas about wellness could travel only as fast as the people who held them, today just about anyone with an internet connection can use social media and AI-generated graphics to sell medical advice in seconds. Despite a decided shortage of placebo-controlled trials in humans to support that advice, the business of longevity is booming, thanks in large part to sleek direct-to-consumer marketing delivered by health influencers with far more confidence than evidence. By 2030, $8 trillion might be spent annually on longevity-related products.

As a sports-medicine physician, I see the consequences of the modern longevity obsession up close. Patients arrive at my office convinced that the right peptides, cold plunges, or lab tests can meaningfully extend their lives. They’re almost certainly headed for disappointment—if not harm.

In many ways, the American people owe a debt of gratitude to the early champions of longevity medicine. Throughout the 20th century, Western physicians focused primarily on treating disease rather than preventing it. But over the past 15 years or so, a new generation of longevity-focused clinicians began emphasizing lifestyle changes such as sleep, exercise, and healthy diet as first-line strategies for disease prevention—not necessarily to extend life, but to improve health. More recently, private investment has poured into the field in pursuit of flashier claims about staving off death. Many longevity-focused clinics and influencers have drifted from prevention toward profit, selling an expanding menu of unvalidated treatments.

Some of the new advice is relatively harmless. Protein loading, for example, is unlikely to meaningfully extend one’s lifespan, but it is also unlikely to cause serious harm. Other trends are more concerning. I have seen patients experiment with drugs like rapamycin, an immunosuppressant medication prescribed for those who have undergone organ transplantation. Some health influencers claim, without convincing human-subject data to prove their point, that rapamycin slows cellular aging. Whether true or not, these claims have yet to be validated, but scientists do know that the side-effect profile of rapamycin includes an increased risk of infection and disease.

Other longevity enthusiasts are injecting or swallowing peptides, chains of amino acids that have been used in medicine for decades but are now becoming popular in their unregulated form. When prescribed by a physician, FDA-approved peptides such as insulin and GLP-1s can be remarkably effective. But no placebo-controlled human trials support the use of, say, “Wolverine” (scientific name BPC-157), a peptide that some influencers claim ramps up collagen production and aids tendon and ligament healing. Like many of the other non-FDA-approved peptides, anyone can order Wolverine online.

Along with supplements and drugs, excessive testing has become another pillar of the longevity movement. Apps, blood tests, and wearable devices purport to estimate customers’ “biological age” using metrics such as heart-rate variability, sleep scores, body composition, and biomarkers in blood. This type of “health score” does not predict how long a person will live, but it can provide a helpful snapshot of one’s current state of physiologic health and inspire healthy behaviors.

The bigger issue is more intensive screenings, especially full-body MRI scans, which many longevity clinics have marketed as tools to detect disease early and thereby extend life. Although this sounds like a good idea, the availability of screening has outpaced its clinical relevance. MRI scans routinely reveal anatomical changes that are a normal part of the aging process. Research suggests that the overwhelming majority of adults past middle age have tears or cartilage changes in their knees, or tendon injuries in their shoulders. Similarly, liver and kidney cysts are commonly seen on MRI scans, especially in people over 50, and most are of no clinical significance; they’re common enough that researchers have dubbed them incidentalomas. But when such findings show up on an MRI, the risk of unnecessary surgery or other treatment increases drastically. Once a liver lesion is seen on MRI, for example, the patient will likely be advised to get a liver biopsy, a procedure with a 2.4 percent risk of major medical complication.

Recently, I treated a 48-year-old man for a routine sports injury. Almost as an aside, he mentioned that he had undergone a full-body MRI as part of a longevity program. The scan revealed a small lesion in his prostate. His PSA, the validated screening test for prostate cancer, was normal. Still, he was referred to a urologist, who felt compelled to biopsy the lesion because it appeared on the scan. The biopsy was benign, but the procedure left my patient unable to sit comfortably for weeks. “I wish I’d never done the MRI,” he told me.

The irony is that modern medicine has already succeeded at what the modern-day longevity movement claims to offer. Over the past 150 years, human life expectancy around the world has more than doubled, to numbers that Ponce de León could hardly have dreamed of. Clean water, sanitation, antibiotics, and vaccines have done more to extend human life than any supplement stack ever could. Cold plunges and red lights may feel empowering, but there is little evidence that today’s biohacking tools meaningfully extend the maximum human lifespan.

A better—and more achievable—goal would be to extend healthy longevity, adding life to years instead of years to life. Scientists and doctors, for the most part, already know how to do this. Daily exercise and maintaining skeletal muscle volume as you age are among the most potent forms of preventive health care.

From the January 2025 issue: America needs to radically rethink what it means to be old

After decades of prescribing exercise as medicine to my patients, I tell them this: Move your body every day, and build muscles with weights or bodyweight exercises three times a week. Eat foods that you can recognize in nature. Prioritize sleep. Stay socially connected with community activities. Such a regimen may not enable you to cheat death. But it’s free. It’s evidence-backed. And it will help you live well right now.</div>

On Tuesday, November 30, 2010, at 2:57 p.m., Prince Andrew—as he then was—received details of his upcoming trips as Britain’s official trade envoy: Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Vietnam, Singapore. At 3:02 p.m., he forwarded the entire email to Jeffrey Epstein.

At dawn today, that stupid and unethical decision—and many others like it—finally caught up with him. Police arrested Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor on the morning of his 66th birthday, on suspicion of misconduct in public office, and are now searching his homes. Prosecutors have not yet released specific charges, which are thought to relate to Andrew passing on sensitive government information to Epstein. The offense carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. His brother, King Charles III, was not officially informed in advance, but had signaled that the royal family would cooperate with any police inquiry.

Charles had already stripped Andrew of his title after the latest batch of Epstein files dropped, because the newly released emails proved beyond doubt that Andrew had lied about breaking off contact with Epstein, a convicted sex offender, in 2010. The disgraced former prince had also been evicted from his lavish residence in Windsor, just outside London, where he had lived effectively rent-free for many years. “Let me state clearly: the law must take its course,” Charles wrote in his statement on the arrest, adding: “Meanwhile, my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all.”

Elizabeth Bruenig: Circles of Epstein hell

In the United States, the Epstein affair is still seen primarily as a sex scandal. The financier was well known as a man who could easily find women—“no one over 25 and all very cute,” he told Elon Musk—to go on dates with his rich friends. (“Pro or civilian?” Steve Tisch, a co-owner of the New York Giants, asked about one such woman.) But here in Britain, this is a corruption scandal—and not just because Andrew sent Epstein confidential information about investment opportunities in Afghanistan. The police recently searched two addresses linked to Peter Mandelson, a former government minister and an ambassador to Washington who also lied about the extent of his friendship with Epstein.

During his time in government in the late 2000s, the files show, Mandelson forwarded market-sensitive emails to Epstein, on subjects such as the eurozone bailout of Greece, mixed in with laddish banter and discussions about how Mandelson might make money after leaving office. Mandelson has already been stripped of his seat in the House of Lords and his affiliation with the Labour Party; for a few hours, many in the press corps thought the scandal might bring down Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who had bafflingly appointed Mandelson as U.S. ambassador, despite his long record of other scandals. In the end, Starmer’s chief of staff, who had recommended Mandelson for the job, stepped down instead.

The allegations against Andrew date from a similar period, when he was a trade envoy for the British Foreign Office. That job turned out to involve flying around the world in high style—often to places run by oligarchs, dictators, and fellow royals, on the basis that they would be flattered to deal with a prince. Once there, he might also take the opportunity to watch, say, a Formula One race or have a few rounds of golf. Attractive young women seem to have been present at many of these events. Foreign intelligence services must have regarded Andrew’s appointment in 2001 as a gift from the heavens.

Everyone knew that this stank. At the time, I worked for the Daily Mail, a right-wing tabloid, which ran near-weekly stories on the latest questionable Andrew news. In 2007, for example, he sold his white elephant of a mansion, Sunninghill, which his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, had given him as a wedding present. A Kazakh oligarch paid millions over the asking price, and then never moved in.

The problem for the royal family was that Andrew and his then-wife, Sarah—known in Britain as “Fergie,” after her unmarried name—had no discernible talents but extremely expensive tastes. The journalist Andrew Lownie’s book on the couple, Entitled, recounts how Sarah used to run up room-service bills in hotels and then simply walk out. “She would just breeze out of the Four Seasons and The Palace in New York as if she was too important to pay,” one source told him. The couple separated in 1992, but Sarah continued to use her title, the Duchess of York, to boost her commercial ventures. In 1995, Buckingham Palace refused to pay off any more of her debts, and issued a statement saying that “the Duchess’s financial affairs are no longer Her Majesty’s concern.”

After this, despite making millions of dollars from her series of children’s books, Fergie went crawling to Epstein for loans. She wrote in 2010: “Is there any chance I could borrow 50 or 100,000 US dollars to help get through the small bills that are pushing me over. . Had to ask.” The files also contain a particularly grim exchange after Fergie denounced Epstein following his conviction, only to email him in a panic afterward, assuring him she never used the “P word”—pedophile. Both she and Andrew were tethered to Epstein by their greed and entitlement. They wanted millionaire lifestyles. More than that, they felt that they deserved them. Why? Because of an accident of birth in one case, and a fortuitous marriage in the other. The couple have been divorced for three decades but have never really moved on, possibly because they are mirror images of each other.

Entitled also makes a compelling case that Andrew is—to put it delicately—boorish and dim. It’s entirely possible that he never questioned why Epstein would work so assiduously to maintain their friendship. One was a good chap, wasn’t one? As trade envoy, Andrew became known for practical jokes and off-color remarks, which British diplomats had to tolerate because of his titles.

Until 2022, he also benefited from the protection of his mother. Andrew was widely perceived to be the late Queen’s favorite child: Charles was sensitive, unlike his parents, who had been raised as emotionally stunted aristocrats; Anne, a tougher, horse-mad child, was Prince Philip’s pet; Edward, like many youngest children, benefited from his parents softening with middle age. But no one really knew what to do with Andrew, who was nicknamed “Baby Grumpling” because of his temper. Like his nephew Prince Harry, he seems to have been most secure when in the tight-knit and hierarchical world of the military. Unlike Harry, though, he frequently reminded his peers of his royal status and was unable to make real friendships with people he considered below him.

Over the years, the late Queen had repeatedly smoothed Andrew’s way in life. But even she could not save him after his disastrous decision to give an interview to the BBC in 2019 about his connection with Epstein. He presented a portrait of blithe privilege, denying a deep connection with the financier by saying he had hosted him only for a “straightforward shooting weekend.” He claimed to have spent three days with Epstein in New York in 2010 for the sole purpose of breaking off their friendship. This was unbelievable at the time, and has now been debunked by the latest files. “Keep in close touch and we’ll play some more soon!!!!” a 2011 email from Andrew declares. The revulsion at his appearance on the BBC prompted his mother to strip him of his ceremonial titles and retire him as a “working royal.”

Charles has gone even further—supported by his son Prince William. Both the king and his successor believe that Andrew’s actions could destroy the royal family, and they are keen to amputate him from the Windsors and cauterize the wound. None of the statements from Buckingham Palace has carried the slightest hint that they believe Andrew has been wronged by a witch hunt. The king’s last statement before today included a telling line: “Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and sympathies have been, and remain with, the victims of any and all forms of abuse.” Private companies are said to throw employees under the bus when the reputational damage gets too great. Andrew has been thrown under the state carriage.

All this presents quite a contrast with the U.S., where the fallout from contact with Epstein has largely been restricted to second-tier names—some of whom are provably guilty only of being chummy with a sex offender, which is not itself a crime. Like Andrew, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also claimed to have broken off contact with Epstein—in his case, in 2005, after seeing Epstein’s massage room in New York—but the files revealed that the association continued for many years afterward. However, Lutnick has the fortune to work for Donald Trump. The president is unlikely to request that anyone resign for being friendly with Epstein, since that would apply to him, too.

The former Prince Andrew acted as he did because he lived in a world in which someone like him never faced consequences. That isn’t true anymore. “Nobody is above the law,” Starmer said in response to the news. In Britain, at least, that might actually be true.</div>

What happened to the communes in communism? Living with a group of like-minded agrarian coeds is the key to a life of happiness and abundance. Struggling against billions of strangers to succeed in a monetized, gamified, algorithmically controlled corporate wasteland is not a recipe for good health. There is, however an app for that, for a small monthly subscription.

They found stoicism late in life. And through questionable channels. What they believe in is broicsim.

Seems like after two days, the emergency services are going to come in and find a bad smell.  Would be better to have an app for your watch that detects loss of consciousness/heart rhythm and calls emergency services when it would actually be early enough to maybe do some good.

This concept has been around for a while [wikipedia.org]...

Probably similar to how multi-level (MLC) NAND flash memory works, but I didn&#39;t read the article either

Reminds me of a prototype laser storage system I saw in 1965 during a guided tour of the Bell labs in Murray Hill. It used lasers to burn spots on a slab of optical material, dont recall any performance or capacity specs -- been a long time. Sure any patents are long expired, but then so is the Murray Hill labs.

requiring zero energy to preserve.Uh huh.  Assuming we still have access to a medium reader even 100 years from now.  Much less 10,000.  Including the native knowledge the read it. What&#39;s it written in?  Wait don&#39;t tell me.  You ironically wrote data on glass in Rust, didn&#39;t you?  Nerds gonna nerd.

Presumably in 100 years our AI overlords will be able to take high resolution images of these slabs and instantly decode the contents regardless of the data format while picking through the bones of our collapsed civilization.

I&#39;ve been seeing stuff about storage tech like this since the Tamarak days in the 1990s with holographic storage.  Nothing ever pans out.  In fact, we have far less usable storage than the 1990s.  Back then, we had floppy, Travan, 4mm, 8mm, DLT, Ditto, HDD, flash (primitive), phase change, and optical.

Now, we have flash drives, HDD and SDD, with LTO being priced out of almost everyone&#39;s price range.  We have cloud storage, but that&#39;s someone else&#39;s HDD, SSD, tape or flash drive.

though the team believes adding more lasers is feasible
640k lasers should be enough for anyone. :-)

My (California) company had an action taken against us for paying straight-time overtime (vs time and a half) for exempt employees (employees not eoigible for statutory overtime). It is common practice in our industry; many projects are compensated hourly by our clients, and while we tried to avoid making people work extra it was sometimes necessary). We also pay annual bonuses.

In Denmark it&#39;s easy to fire people.  &quot;Flexicurity&quot; means that it&#39;s easy to fire somebody in Denmark but generous employment insurance and retraining programs means it&#39;s a much lower burden on employees if they are fired.

I wonder where does the money for the insurance and retraining comes. Hmmm...

I&#39;ll admit - I don&#39;t understand how companies haven&#39;t gone cat and mouse with this. For example, if a company wants to create a speculative product, couldn&#39;t they just fund a &quot;contracting company&quot; that hires people? If the bet is successful, the parent company buys out the &quot;contracting company&quot; - otherwise, they stop paying the other company and it just goes bankrupt.

I think it&#39;s basically &quot;tactical insolvency.&quot;

The essay points to Denmark, Austria and Switzerland as countries that have found a middle path -- generous unemployment insurance and portable severance accounts that protect workers without penalizing employers for taking risks.

Even better would be a universal basic income. Then companies wouldn&#39;t need to pay so much in severance. Also it would eliminate the need for the minimum wage and various forms of welfare, including Social Security unemployment and retirement benefits. And a lot more people would

The EU is probably too strict, while the US is too lax. Canada may be one country with a better balance. At the very least, the EU countries need to loosen the laws up a bit for business with less than 6 people, since one &quot;unfireable&quot; employee can end up taking down the whole company.

Can confirm as both a former employer and former employee, Canada has a good balance.  Also, healthcare insurance is not tied to employment here, so employees don&#39;t have to stick it out at a hateful job and companies don&#39;t have to spend massive amounts on health insurance.

And yes, there should be nuances in the law based on company size and maybe also on how long the company has been in existence.  A startup in its first year of operation, or a small business with 5 employees, should definitely have more

Kind of a silly thing for her to say.  How many non-Klingons do you see in the Klingon empire vs non-humans in the Federation?

Since it was Chekov saying that, then there were 0 Klingons in the Federation during TOS.

Exactly. It&#39;s not a question of &quot;why would someone do that?&quot;, but one of, &quot;What&#39;s the likelyhood of some non-insignificant number of people using it for that purpose?&quot; And it&#39;s not just people using it, cause it&#39;s being used to orchestrate all kinds of things and will likely need to create passwords as a matter of course when doing it&#39;s tasks.

It&#39;s obvious to me why these are the results, but LLM&#39;s fool most people into believing they&#39;re thinking on some level and likely being honest. They may ask, &quot;why woul

Why do you need an LLM ... ?
Could have stopped with that. /s

Even if you didn&#39;t know they were this weak, why would you want a LLM generating your passwords when a simple random number generator is guaranteed to do a better job of it?

Which could be seen as evidence that it isn&#39;t a bubble, but I&#39;m not making an argument about that.

I kind of agree, but think AI users will face a significant fall off when the bubble pops and a lot of folks walk away from it without critically thinking about it in the same way a lot of folks walk toward it without critically thinking about it, never having &#39;got it&#39; one way or the other and just following what the apparent mass opinion is.

Also, a bubble pop would likely come with price hikes for the surviving companies under more pressure to operate at a sustainable revenue instead of loss leading, and t

Tragically common to use a LLM to solve problems that existing simple solutions already solve. It&#39;s the tech equivalent of &quot;rolling coal&quot; - creating waste and harm just because you can.

...and how do you store said passwords, since they need to be different for everything. A memorable password that gives access to your keychain or equivalent is no more secure. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I use OpenSSL for mine, but I fully understand that if someone has time to brute-force my random four-character computer password they have full root. Sure, they need physical access, and my logic is that by that point there are plenty of easier ways to cause me pain.

I use Hashicorp Vault at home, because I tend to dogfood the services I run at work. But that&#39;s a bit ridiculous, I don&#39;t recommend it.

We also run a local Bitwarden installation at work, that&#39;s generally for nontechnical users and the dedicated programming staff (although I repeat myself).

For normal people, I recommend some password manager with local storage not tied to a browser, and ideally not tied to your OS. But it depend

A new technology comes out.  People immediately think it is the be-all, end-all solution to many things.  People apply it to numerous things because they can.

Eventually, many of the things they claim the technology will do don&#39;t pan out.  Then you head into the Trough of disillusionment [wikipedia.org].  People begin to ask questions like &quot;We can do this, but should we?&quot;  Many potential applications die off completely.  The few that remain survive, and gradually grow into becoming a useful solution.

So yes, of course people used an LLM to generate passwords.  Because they can.  Doesn&#39;t mean they should, but we&#39;re not quite at the &quot;should&quot; stage of LLM applications yet.

And for the bubble talk, yes AI is a bubble.  The reason it&#39;s a debate is because we talk about bubbles in binary terms, but when you look at it with the Gartner Hype Cycle, you&#39;ll see that it&#39;s not yet ready to fall, but applications like password generation and quite a few others show that it will.  It won&#39;t collapse completely, because there are good applications of LLM AI; it will climb out of the trough and find valuable, useful tools.  The debate about whether it&#39;s a bubble or not is irrelevant, what we should be discussing is when a contraction will happen (and it will), what it will look like when done.

Because so many people assume LLM is superseding *everything*, and need explicit reminders that not only is the &#39;old&#39; way so much more efficient and simple, it&#39;s even more effective than what an LLM would do.

I wounder what happens if you run local modes and turn the temperature way way up.  Of course if you make the LLM &#39;drunk&#39; enough to give truly random answers you could just grab a few bytes from /dev/urandom all by your self.

That was my initial thought as well, until I remembered they do contain RNGs in their fundamental logic - that&#39;s referred to as the temperature [ibm.com].

They found introducing an element of randomness into them made them seem more &quot;realistic&quot;. Although clearly there are only so many alternate pathways they can take even with randomness involved.

Yes, that is a real one I used to use.  No, I don&#39;t use it anywhere anymore.

Though maybe not, given just how many sites out there STILL won&#39;t take spaces in passwords, despite demands for &quot;special characters&quot;.

The worst part is that when you see something not take a &quot;$&quot; or &quot; &quot;, it&#39;s probably because their input sanitization is sub-par.  They know about SQL injection, but can&#39;t be assed to actually do something about it other than ban characters.  Leaving me feeling reaaaaal secure.

There was a story maybe 20 years ago where some state lottery nearly got broken because a fortune cookie company I think it was, printed a number that *almost* won. Something like 20 people won the second tier prize.

It would be utterly ridiculous if we saw 20 people win the lottery trusting ChatGPT to pick unique numbers for them.

I&#39;d bet literally thousands of people ask that every day.

There was also the rather peculiar thing that happened with the numbers from the show Lost.

If multiple people hit the Powerball jackpot, it is divided among the winners.  They don&#39;t all get the jackpot amount so that would not bankrupt the system.

That being said, other prizes have specific cash denominations.  And, others are multiplied by a PowerPlay multiplier by 1-5x (and, occasionally, 10x).

Still, it would take thousands if not millions of such winners to financially hurt the company.

And, I suspect there are rules that would trigger a fraud alert and render the drawing invalid.

In January 1995, the Â£16.3 million jackpot for the UK lottery was won by 133 tickets. Lots of winning tickets are already a thing.

All these studies and finding about &quot;weak&quot; passwords and cracking in seconds to hours.

But put these guys in the real world against a 16 character password or even vague complexity and tell them to call you when they hit it.

I guarantee that you&#39;ll never hear from them again. A vaguely complex 10 character password would take tens of years even if they got lucky and hot it in the first 25% of the keyspace.

You&#39;re working the wrong end of the problem. The wrong 16 character password can be cracked rather easily.

>>and 18 of the duplicates were the exact same string

How much do you want to bet that string appeared as an example of a secure password in some book or website that was part of the LLM&#39;s training data?

I set all my passwords to CorrectHorseBatteryStapler you insensitive Claude!

Gets you something fake, and if you are unlucky, something you do not easily recognize as fake. About the worst case possible.

There appears to be deep confusion, across the public in general (and dare I say the managerial class in particular) about what large language models actually *do*.  Nobody with any understanding of what these things actually are, how they would, would imagine getting one to generate a password would be a smart idea. Somehow (marketing? hype?) people have been convinced these are intelligent, do-anything machines, and I have no idea how we break that impression.

The term Orwellian is often trotted out as a cliché, but it suits the confluence of President Donald Trump’s two big actions today—holding the first meeting of his “Board of Peace” and finishing the mobilization of a massive military force on the flanks of Iran, ready to attack the Islamic Republic as soon as this weekend.

His Board of Peace, to which Trump said the U.S. would commit $10 billion (for what, it’s unclear), seems largely theatrical. The war in Gaza, which Trump claims to have ended, persists—Israel continues its demolitions, while Hamas is tightening its grip on the place and refusing to disarm—and the board’s larger goal of supplanting or overseeing the United Nations worldwide is fanciful, to say the least.

Meanwhile, the point of the armed buildup around Iran—the largest assembly of U.S. warplanes and warships in the region since the 2003 invasion of Iraq—is remarkably unclear. The U.S. armada mobilized to the region includes 18 warships (two of which are aircraft carriers) and many fighter jets, bombers, antimissile systems, and electronic jammers on nearby bases. This is enough to fight a weekslong battle, hitting targets related to any and all of those missions and disabling or intercepting most of the missiles that Iran might launch in response. But for what purpose—and with what chance of success, whatever the purpose might be—is another question.

Does Trump want to destroy Iran’s nuclear program, dismantle its ballistic missile sites, pull down the regime, or simply threaten a combination of all three to pressure the Iranians to make a “deal”—but a deal to do what?

In January, Trump threatened “strong” military action against Iran if its leaders killed any of the growing mass of anti-government protesters. Tehran canceled the execution of one protester, leading Trump to pronounce his demand satisfied. However, troops and police proceeded to mow down thousands, possibly tens of thousands, of protesters in the streets, to no objection from Washington. As was the case in Venezuela, democracy and human rights were pieces of Trump’s original war rhetoric—but not in his war policy.

Many were shocked when his real policy in Venezuela turned out to be abducting its criminal president, Nicolás Maduro, and compelling his successors—who had been deputies in Maduro’s Cabinet—to cede control of their country’s oil to the United States. Maria Corina Machado, the leader of Venezuela’s democratic opposition, who expected to take power if Maduro were overthrown, was pushed under the bus. (Her attempt to gain Trump’s favor—giving him the Nobel Peace Prize trophy that she won but that he thought he’d deserved—was a futile gesture.)

So what, exactly, is Trump up to in Iran?

Is he now going after its oil? Probably not, though keeping the oil from being traded to Iran’s biggest customer, China, might be part of the equation. Still, the assembled armada seems overkill for that goal.

Trump says his main concern is to keep Iran from building a nuclear weapon. The irony is that Trump claimed to “obliterate” the nation’s nuclear program in last June’s attack—known as Operation Midnight Hammer—on Iran’s mountain-buried enriched-uranium site. As many noted at the time, Trump exaggerated the extent of the damage; for one thing, Iranians might have removed much of the uranium in anticipation of the assault. However, the damage did significantly set back Iran’s program, perhaps by a few years. What is the rush now?

Iran’s ballistic missiles endanger Israel and U.S. bases in the region. In the brief Iran-Israel war last summer, 90 percent of Iran’s missiles were shot down or crashed before reaching their targets. But Iran launched 550 missiles, as well as 1,000 drones, and the 50 or so that pierced through the defenses inflicted considerable damage. It is not known how many missiles Iran has now—probably a few thousand. Manufacturing sites are concentrated and can be taken out fairly easily, but the missiles themselves are small and mobile. Many would survive an initial onslaught, and if Tehran’s leaders think their regime is about to be crushed, they might decide to launch a massive retaliation, bringing down their enemies along with themselves. In fact, in recent weeks, some Middle East leaders, notably the Saudis and other Sunnis (who have been fighting proxy wars against Iran on various fronts) urged Trump not to attack Iran, fearing that Iran would return fire against their lands too. They have barred U.S. planes from flying over their territory if Trump does decide to attack.

Here, then, is another irony. As a result of last summer’s missile exchanges, June’s Midnight Hammer, and a string of devastating attacks on Iran’s main proxy militias, Hamas and Hezbollah, Israel is now stronger and Iran is weaker than they have been in decades. Trump’s mobilization in the region underlines this disparity. Does Iran really pose a threat that justifies such a massive U.S. reaction?

Then again, from Israel’s perspective, Iran’s relative weakness is the point. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long pushed for regime change in Tehran. Though he never said so explicitly, his opposition to the Iran nuclear deal, which President Barack Obama and six other leaders signed in 2014, wasn’t so much fear of an Iranian bomb (the accord really did all but stop its development) as fear that the removal of Iran’s sanctions and its integration into the world economy—the rewards for dismantling its nuclear apparatus—would solidify the Islamic Republic’s position, strengthen its international standing, and thereby increase Israel’s vulnerability, if not to nuclear bombs, then to other forms of intimidation. During Trump’s first term, Netanyahu persuaded him to rip up the nuclear deal; with the president now in his second term, the prime minister is hoping to lasso him into finishing off the regime.

The Iranian government is a horror. It represses its own people, now more than ever; it assists terrorists; and it’s an economic disaster as well. But it’s worth asking: If the mullahs are toppled or lose their grip on power in one way or another, who replaces them? It’s extremely unlikely that the successors would be the Western-leaning urban youth who have been demonstrating in the streets. They lack leaders and organizers, mainly because the regime has imprisoned or killed rising potential leaders—and disabled or co-opted tools and technologies that could enable organization.

If the mullahs fell, power would likely be picked up by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. This is the Iranian army’s elite unit, with more than 150,000 personnel, who protect the regime, control much of the economy, and are no less hostile than the supreme leader and his mullahs toward Israel, Sunnis, and the West.

It’s possible that U.S. and Israeli intelligence agencies have made contact with certain IRGC officers, discussing terms of mutual support in the event of regime change. We now know that the CIA infiltrated the Venezuelan leadership, which helped the U.S. Special Forces track down Maduro. However, we don’t yet know whether or how long Venezuela’s old-new leaders will keep to their side of whatever long-term bargain they might have struck. It’s doubly uncertain whether any emerging IRGC strongmen—with whom the U.S. has had no aboveground relationship at all—would honor any deal. It’s a very poor bet to act on the assumption that they would.

Which leads to the final possibility: that Trump is amassing all this firepower to pressure the Iranians to make a deal. He has said that, to avoid dreadful consequences, Iran must agree to enrich no uranium, dismantle its ballistic missiles, and sever relations with Shiite militias in the region.

The problem is that these terms are untenable to Iran, and would be even if the country had more-pliant leaders.

In the early stages of negotiation toward the 2014 nuclear deal, Obama also pushed for a ban on enrichment but soon realized that this was a dead end. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (which is observed by 191 nation-states, including Iran) not only allows its signatories to enrich uranium to 3 percent purity, but it enshrines that level of enrichment as a right. This level is very low. “Highly enriched” uranium is defined as 20 percent, “weapons-grade” as 90 percent. The treaty further allows international inspectors to verify whether countries are abiding with this limit. Obama’s Iran nuclear deal had tight inspection procedures; Iran was declared in compliance.

For Iran to accept a ban on enrichment, when the rest of the world is entitled to some, would be tantamount to surrender before a shot has been fired. No leader, Islamist or otherwise, would accept this.

A ban on ballistic missiles is also unlikely, as they are Iran’s main source of deterrence. Iran’s support for radical militias—such as Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis—does clarify the regime’s nature: A government can legitimately observe a right to bear conventional arms and enrich uranium (a little bit, anyway) but not to arm havoc-wreaking militias. Still, the Iranians have relied so heavily on these militias for power in the region that they would need tangible benefits to cut the cord.

What is the Trump administration offering Iran in return for taking such extraordinary measures? The question is misleading. There is no “Trump administration” when it comes to such matters. There is only Trump and his two emissaries, fellow real-estate tycoon Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. They have supplanted, and for the most part ignored, the experienced experts in the State Department and the National Security Council who usually hammer out positions and handle negotiations.

Witkoff has no diplomatic experience whatever. Kushner did play a role in the Abraham Accords, which formalized diplomatic and economic relations between Israel and some Arab states (the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Morocco), but those nations already had informal relations, and they were not at all in a state of war.

Like Trump, they seem to believe that diplomacy requires no special knowledge and that dealmaking is dealmaking, whether you’re dealing with the Kremlin, the Islamic Republic of Iran, or the New York City Buildings Department. This blithe arrogance is naivete disguised as hardheadedness, and it goes a long way toward explaining the pair’s utter failure at settling the war in Ukraine. (There, they don’t grasp Russian President Vladimir Putin’s motive for war. If they did, they would realize that he doesn’t want peace without the complete subjugation of Kyiv.)

What happens these next few days in and around Iran? Who knows. It’s possible Trump himself doesn’t know. The Iranians will try to stretch out the negotiations, which they probably see as inherently fruitless. Trump may wait them out for a while, but perhaps not for long. If he starts a war, he may try to keep it limited at first, but the Iranians may escalate, anticipating their worst-case scenario, which Trump may then make a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Wars, once started, sometimes spiral out of control. This is why it’s smart for leaders to know what they want, and know how far they want to press things, before they make their first move. It’s also why, in negotiating a peaceful way out of a crisis, it’s good for them to know what the other side wants too—not necessarily to appease them but to scope out the boundaries of what’s possible without war and, given that, whether it’s better to modify peace terms or go to war.

At this point, it looks like Trump, pushed by Netanyahu, is rushing into conflict recklessly.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Sign up for Executive Dysfunction, a weekly newsletter that surfaces under-the-radar stories about what Trump is doing to the law—and how the law is pushing back.

On Jan. 26, U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz prohibited ICE from moving an immigrant, Baljinder Kumar, out of New Jersey while he challenged his unlawful detention. Five days later, Immigration and Customs Enforcement flagrantly defied that order, transferring Kumar to a detention center in … Texas. After his lawyers complained, federal officials returned Kumar to New Jersey. But Farbiarz was not inclined to let this disobedience go unpunished. He informed the New Jersey U.S. attorney’s office that he sought to craft a “remedy” for ICE’s defiance—and would require an “investigation” to assist him. He then ordered the office to investigate itself and to “enumerate each instance” in which it had “violated an order issued by a judge of this district” since Dec. 5.

Last Friday, Jordan Fox—an associate deputy attorney general and special attorney assigned to New Jersey—gave Farbiarz an answer: The office had violated at least 56 court orders since December alone, all related to the Trump administration’s unlawful policy mandating the indefinite detention of noncitizens legally entitled to a bond hearing. This confession, first reported by Politico’s Kyle Cheney, was accompanied by a letter stating that “we regret deeply all violations” but insisting that they were “unintentional and immediately rectified once we learned of them.” Fox, who is helping lead the New Jersey office after courts ousted Donald Trump’s first choice, Alina Habba, depicted these transgressions as relatively minor and rare. But Farbiarz did not buy it, noting that Kumar’s illegal transfer to Texas was far from an “outlier.”

On this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed this court-ordered investigation, its startling conclusions, and the possible consequences. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: I guess I have to give credit where it’s due. Jordan Fox took one for the team and laid out, chapter and verse, all the court orders this office had violated.

Mark Joseph Stern: Sort of. Fox actually excluded two categories of violations, missed status update deadlines and late docket notifications. When you include those, it’s 75 violations. So let’s dig into these numbers. At least 17 times, the government transferred a noncitizen to a different detention facility after a court unambiguously prohibited it from doing so. That means they were detained in another state, where it would be harder to reach their lawyers, and perhaps where judges are more inclined to rule for the government. At least 10 times, the U.S. attorney’s office failed to produce evidence ordered by the court. And at least one time, the government deported a noncitizen in direct contravention of a court order forbidding that deportation.

In some ways, this is a bigger deal than the ICE lawyer’s meltdown in court a few weeks ago. We now have the U.S. attorney’s office not going rogue here, but admitting under oath that it has breached court orders more than 50 times. And there were often dire consequences for the people whose rights were violated. Fox tried to paint this as a few errors around the edges, but to me it depicts a complete breakdown of the system. And it shows that if you sign up for this work—if you agree to work in a U.S. attorney’s office—you now know you will be violating court orders, maybe on the daily. Everybody is on notice: If you are assigned to handle these cases, you will violate court orders, and you may be held in contempt.

I’m old enough to remember Judge James Boasberg trying to ascertain whether his court order around the rendition flights to CECOT prison was flouted, and the lies and deceit that went into gaslighting him about that. And he’s still trying to get to the bottom of it! We talked about that story obsessively last spring. A year later, defiance of court orders doesn’t capture two weeks of a news cycle. We just say: Yeah, they do that now. They don’t care what judges think anymore. The American public has somehow normalized this.

All I can say is bless Boasberg for continuing to push that contempt case. I am glad to hear the rising chorus of other judges doing the same. We’ve seen Republicans in Congress say they want to impeach judges who hold Trump administration officials in contempt. Maybe this could be a Spartacus moment where you can’t impeach them all?

That takes us back to Minnesota, where Judge Laura Provinzino found Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Isihara in civil contempt during a Wednesday hearing for violating a court order. She said she’d fine him $500 a day until the government complied. One interesting piece of this story is that Isihara is a JAG attorney who was conscripted to help with the flood of habeas petitions in response to the mass detention policy as prosecutors continue to flee the Justice Department. And even he said he couldn’t handle the caseload.

This story illustrates the mix of incompetence and malice that is defining the administration’s mass detention campaign. The government arrested this individual, Rigoberto Soto Jimenez, at his workplace in January—even though he had lived here since 2018 and has no criminal record or a final order of removal authorizing his deportation. ICE then hustled him to Texas. His lawyers still managed to persuade Provinzino to issue a writ of habeas corpus ordering his immediate release in Minnesota and the return of all confiscated property.

The government did neither. It released him in Texas, not Minnesota, and withheld all of his property, including his driver’s license and other identification paperwork. So he was just dumped and abandoned. His lawyers had to go to Provinzino and tell her that her order had been flagrantly violated, which is when she scheduled the hearing. Soto Jimenez managed to make his way back from Texas, but as of Wednesday, ICE still hadn’t returned his identification cards. So Provinzino held Isihara, the JAG lawyer detailed to this case, in civil contempt until the cards were returned, with the $500 daily sanction. Fox 9 News reports that her order finally prompted the agency to mail back the ID cards. Which gives us the answer to the question we’ve been asking: What will it take to make ICE comply with the law? The answer is dragging JAGs into your courtroom and holding them in contempt.

The caseload is impossible. Nobody can do this volume of work. If you are a government lawyer thinking, Step aside, Mr. Isihara, because I can do this better next time, just know you’re being set up to pay $500 a day for the privilege.

            <h2>Trump Wants Veterans to Lose Benefits As Soon As Their PTSD Symptoms Are Treated. There’s One Problem With That.</h2>
            <p><strong>News and Politics - Slate Magazine | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2026/02/trump-veterans-affairs-ptsd-benefits-medicine-fail.html?via=rss">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Sign up for Executive Dysfunction, a weekly newsletter that surfaces under-the-radar stories about what Trump is doing to the law—and how the law is pushing back.

During the troop surge in Iraq, I learned to constantly scan for threats, how to distinguish the sharp crack of a gunshot pointed in my direction from one outgoing toward an enemy, and the myriad ways that explosives can be hidden on a roadside. I learned that hypervigilance can be the difference between life and death. What I didn’t learn was how to turn it off.

Now, I take three psychiatric medications every day, and I go to therapy every week. It’s taken a lot of work over the course of 15 years, but now I’m mostly functional. I raise my kids, go to work, and am part of my community. And I am among the nearly 5 million U.S. veterans who receive service-connected disability compensation, of whom roughly a quarter have a mental health condition such as post-traumatic stress disorder as their primary disability. That compensation is not charity, but compensation for harm incurred in service and a recognition that the government has a debt when the service it demands breaks bodies and minds.

But now, under a new interim rule issued by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the fact that medication helps me may also be used to reduce my disability compensation. The rule directs the VA to evaluate disabilities based on how veterans function with medication and treatment, rather than the underlying severity of their conditions. Essentially, if the pills work, good job staying alive; now move on without compensation for the inherent disability.

This issue was actually very recently litigated. Last year, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims decided Ingram v. Collins, a case that reaffirmed a rule first articulated in Jones v. Shinseki. The court was clear: When VA criteria for treatment do not explicitly mention medication-based improvements as a reason to discontinue disability benefits, the VA must discount the effects of medication and evaluate the disability as it would exist without treatment. That was not a radical interpretation but a straightforward application of the law. Treatment can mask symptoms, but it does not erase the harm. In response, the VA’s new rule asserts a blanket policy of considering the condition only as it presents under treatment, basically penalizing veterans like me for doing the work of staying alive.

The consequences of this shift are not abstract. Peer-reviewed research and VA data show that disability compensation is directly linked to real-life stability for veterans with mental health conditions. A long-term study following veterans who applied for PTSD disability benefits found that those who received benefits experienced meaningful reductions in PTSD symptoms over a decade, compared with veterans who were denied. Those who received compensation were far less likely to experience poverty, with rates around 15 percent, compared to 45 percent among those denied benefits, and their risk of homelessness was nearly half that of denied veterans. Even years later, these differences in socioeconomic stability persisted, despite ongoing impairment. Compensation does not erase the injury, but it gives veterans the resources to manage it and live with it.

I know the stakes personally. The medication I take does not erase the injury. When I have stopped my medication, the symptoms have surged back. I have found myself back in the dark place where I think that I would have been better off if the IED with my name on it that I had always been scanning for had actually gone off and killed me. I have buried too many friends whose treatment worked until it didn’t. Their medications stabilized them, and their therapy helped them, but the underlying injury remained. Now they are dead by suicide.

This is why Ingram mattered. It recognized that improvement through treatment should not cancel out evidence of injury. Symptoms managed by medication are still symptoms, and the underlying disability remains. The VA’s interim rule rejects this principle, allowing improved function to justify rejection of disability status.

The moral and legal logic of compensation is clear: It is not just about whether a veteran can work. It is about acknowledging permanent loss of quality of life that came as a result of their injuries. For example, in the civilian context, when construction workers fall off scaffolds and can’t walk until receiving surgery and physical therapy, their employers have to provide them workers’ compensation. It doesn’t matter if treatment can return them to full function and they can eventually return to work. The injuries occurred on the job, and the company has to provide compensation. “You break it, you buy it.” But for the Trump administration, despite its lavish spending on tax breaks for billionaires, military contracts, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement surges that are tearing the country apart, properly compensating veterans for sacrificing their well-being at the direction of the government is a waste of money that we don’t deserve.

The Trump administration’s interim rule fundamentally misunderstands both the law and the human cost of combat. Improvement does not equal cure, and functioning does not erase harm. VA disability compensation is not a paycheck. It is a recognition of veterans’ lives that will never be the same and a resource to help them pick up the pieces. The fact that symptoms can be controlled through daily maintenance medications is proof the injury is permanent and severe, not that medication can just make it go away. The law once recognized that distinction, and basic decency still should.

            <div id="article-text">For many of us, living in President Donald Trump’s America feels like a never-ending doom loop. Every day brings a fresh batch of headlines about the administration’s lawless attacks on independent federal agencies, the judiciary, and our democracy itself—and you can easily miss some important things. To help you sift through the noise, we’re launching a new newsletter: Executive Dysfunction. Each week, we will surface one important legal story that you may have overlooked amid all the ongoing chaos. We’ll be highlighting stories about how Trump is doing violence to the law, and stories about how people involved in shaping and upholding the law—judges, lawyers, lawmakers—are pushing back. And we’ll also keep you in the loop about what’s going on with our Slate Jurisprudence team, including Mark Joseph Stern and Dahlia Lithwick. Welcome to the first edition of Executive Dysfunction.

You may have missed it over the long weekend, but a partial government shutdown began on Saturday. After over a year of enduring President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda—as we’ve watched masked agents drag people through the streets, harass families in their homes, and even kill U.S. citizens in broad daylight—Democrats in Washington decided to use their power over federal funding to try to force change. Before signing off on any new dollars for the Department of Homeland Security, Democrats have put forth a list of 10 demands they want Republicans to meet in an effort to rein in a rogue Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.

One big question remains, though, as we wait to see if the partial shutdown begins to affect the day-to-day of Americans in travel and other parts of life: Would the Democratic demands, if met, actually do anything to stem ICE’s abuses? This question has already spurred fights on social media, where some progressives are excoriating the Democrats for not asking for nearly enough, and others are praising these proposals as pragmatic solutions that will make a real difference. The truth is probably somewhere in between.

“What these mostly require is for ICE to follow laws and return to practices and procedures that had been standard practice for a long period of time,” Scott Shuchart, former assistant director for regulatory affairs for ICE under the Biden administration, told me. “And so they’re not very ambitious.” ICE would not be completely transformed by this particular set of Democratic demands; rather, it would return to a pre-Trump status quo when we were not witnessing masked agents rampaging across the entire country, pepper-spraying children, ripping disabled people out of their cars, and gunning men and women down in the street.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries’ list of demands—unveiled in early February, shortly after Alex Pretti was shot to death by federal agents in Minneapolis—ranges from banning agents from wearing masks to outlawing racial profiling. Progressives want the party to go further, while activists have been pushing to simply abolish ICE completely. Voters want something to give, with polling consistently showing they are seriously concerned about the way the Trump administration is handling immigration enforcement.

When looking at Democrats’ list of demands, it’s important to consider that U.S. immigration law has not been significantly updated since Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act in 1996. Whatever the party manages to win in this government funding negotiation will likely be narrow and insufficient to solve our country’s biggest immigration challenges, but it could pare back some of the worst excesses and abuses of the current administration. Thus far, negotiations don’t seem to be going anywhere. It’s also hard to say whether ICE would even obey any new restrictions, given the administration’s persistent refusal to comply with congressional directives and the Supreme Court’s tolerance for such defiance. During a recent congressional oversight hearing, for instance, DHS leadership outright rejected a mask ban, one of Democrats’ key demands.

Let’s take a closer look at the list to try to assess whether the demands actually stand a chance of making a material difference in how ICE uses—and abuses—its vast power over immigration enforcement.

Democrats want to prohibit DHS officers from entering private property without a judicial warrant. This is something that’s technically already against the law, though the administration has attempted to circumvent that very basic right with little pushback. “That’s what the Fourth Amendment has always required,” Nayna Gupta, policy director at American Immigration Council, told me. “The hope here would be not just that Congress restates the law, but that they offer some consequences for the fact that officers don’t follow them, whether that’s dismissal of cases of anyone they arrest once they’re inside, or other disciplinary measures.” According to the public-facing list, there’s no real enforcement mechanism, though this may get sorted out in the writing of any legislation.

Also baked into this demand is a requirement that ICE officers verify that a person is not a U.S. citizen before holding them in immigration detention, as has reportedly happened countless times in recent months. This could be one of the harder things for Republicans to say no to. During congressional hearings last week, acting ICE Director Todd Lyons seemed to acknowledge how politically perilous it is for the agency to be detaining U.S. citizens, hemming and hawing when asked if ICE arrested and deported U.S. citizens, before saying that the agency did only “detain” Americans.

While this feels like a straightforward demand, Shuchart believes that Democrats not taking it further is a missed opportunity to rein in the indiscriminate detention of thousands of immigrants, whether or not they have any sort of criminal background or present any sort of flight risk. “I would like to see this Congress clarify the detention authority and undo this craziness that ICE is doing, where everybody is now subject to expedited removal and mandatory detention.”

Prohibiting immigration enforcement agents from wearing face coverings is something many states are already attempting to implement through legislation. However, these state efforts face challenges in court given broad federal authority to enforce U.S. immigration law and local officers’ fear of conflict with other armed law-enforcement agents. A federal judge recently blocked a new California law prohibiting federal agents from wearing masks, holding that it “unlawfully discriminates against the federal government” because it did not apply to all state officers as well. Although California could in theory address this defect, the ruling illustrates the constitutional challenges that states face when regulating a federal agency, and shows the need for a uniform, nationwide rule from Congress.

Congressional Democrats are also trying to compel immigration enforcement agents to display their agency, unique ID number, and last name. This would be a significant policy change, something Shuchart says would go beyond existing law. As Felipe De La Hoz recently noted in Slate, it wouldn’t reverse the fact that ICE is currently enrolling any and all federal law-enforcement agencies into a vast police “blob” as part of its immigration agenda. It would, though, allow people to at a minimum recognize who is taking part in any given enforcement action, leading to a greater potential for future accountability and a chance that agents will think twice before committing abuses.

Democrats want to prohibit DHS funds from being used to conduct enforcement near sensitive locations, including medical facilities, schools, child care centers, churches, polling places, and courts. If Republicans agree to this proposal, Shuchart said, it would be an enormous change in current policy.

This demand would revert back to the Biden administration’s position, and in theory would end the Trump administration’s strategy of arresting migrants who show up to court-mandated hearings. It could also stop ICE agents from entering hospitals and interfering with patients’ medical care, as was the case in Minnesota. Health care workers there reported an incident when ICE agents hovered over the bedside of a patient for more than 24 hours, at times shackling them to the bed and denying them privacy. In another encounter with ICE, agents remained present while a patient was being bathed.

Democrats also want to bar DHS officers from detaining people based on their ethnicity, spoken language, accent, or place of work. In September, the Supreme Court seemed to signal that these detentions—known as “Kavanaugh stops”—are permissible under the Fourth Amendment. But that decision does not prevent Congress from forbidding them by legislation. This would be a sea change in immigration policy if Democrats can get it.

However, as currently written, this proposal includes no penalty for DHS or individual officers if they were to violate such a ban. And if there is no way to hold agents or agencies accountable, then “it’s a meaningless restriction,” Gupta said.

This is a critical demand where, according to Shuchart, Democrats have fallen short. They are asking that DHS institute a “reasonable use of force policy, expand training and require certification of officers. In the case of an incident, the officer must be removed from the field until an investigation is conducted.” However, the demand does not define what a “reasonable” policy is, nor does it mention how this would be implemented.

It’s worth noting that last year, the Trump administration shut down DHS’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, an oversight agency that was responsible for investigating allegations against the agency from migrants, their families, and the public. Reinstating this office could play a critical role in upholding any use-of-force policy, according to Shuchart. It’s not in the list of Democratic demands, however. “I think the entire model of leaving the immigration agencies to their own devices and hoping for accountability on the back end just doesn’t work, and Congress needs to find a way to be much more prescriptive about what it expects,” Shuchart noted.

In light of the FBI stonewalling Minnesota prosecutors’ efforts to investigate the killing of Renee Nicole Good and withholding evidence from Alex Pretti’s death, Democrats are asking to codify a requirement that DHS “preserve the ability of state and local jurisdictions to investigate and prosecute potential crimes and use of excessive force incidents.” It also would require that evidence be preserved and shared with local jurisdictions. This issue flared up when the federal government appeared to allow the contamination of evidence from the scene of Pretti’s killing, then refused to let state investigators access that evidence in an alarming breach of protocol.

This reform could help states win federal court orders securing access to evidence when immigration agents commit violent crimes within their borders. But again, it does not create any new ways of holding immigration agents accountable for abuses, a weak spot across these demands. Until victims and their families can file claims against officers who violate their rights, there will be few disincentives against excessive use of force. “There are more meaningful reforms that could have been included, in particular ensuring that there is a way for people to individually sue federal officers who violate constitutional and civil rights,” Gupta said. Right now, it is almost impossible for victims to file such suits, thanks in part to a series of Supreme Court decisions shielding federal officials from accountability. But Congress has the power to effectively overturn these rulings and create liability for federal officials by statute.

Democrats want to hold DHS to a higher standard when it comes to immigration detention, as many of us have seen and read about the horrific conditions at detention centers, where illnesses are rampant, medical care is scarce, and access to clean water and food is limited.

Through this demand, Democrats are asking to standardize all buildings where people are detained, ensuring that each one abides by the same basic detention standards and requiring immediate access to a person’s attorney to prevent citizen arrests or detention. States would also be allowed to sue DHS for violating these requirements, and federal lawmakers would be allowed to inspect ICE facilities.

This demand, though, doesn’t address the specific sanitation issues at ICE detention centers, nor does it attempt to claw back the agency’s authority to set its own standards, where Shuchart believes that the real problem lies. “Congress needs to have enforceable detention standards in place, rather than letting ICE write its own detention standards and hoping that the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties will hold them to that,” Shuchart said. “Because guess what? The administration got rid of CRCL, and now nobody on the outside is holding ICE to its standards.”

Forcing federal agents to use body-worn cameras when interacting with the public has been a hotly debated issue, with some arguing it deters officers from misbehaving, while others feel it does little to inhibit abuses. (The agents who shot Pretti were reportedly wearing body cameras.) During that recent congressional hearing, acting Director Lyons confirmed that many federal agents are already using body cameras and the agency intends to roll them out to every agent.

Just last week, body-camera footage of a Border Patrol agent involved in the shooting of Marimar Martinez in Chicago was released, and it appeared to contradict DHS’s version of the incident. Body-cam footage from other violent incidents in Chicago demonstrated that federal agents were brazenly lying about protesters’ actions to justify excessive force against them. Shuchart said that policing experts tend to believe that body cameras are valuable, as they improve the quality of police interactions with the public. Especially considering the Trump administration’s lawless approach to immigration enforcement, where they have outright lied about what actually happened in high-profile ICE encounters, Shuchart thinks Democrats’ demand for body cameras is the right move.

Democrats also want to prohibit the footage from being used to track Americans in a database of people exercising their First Amendment rights, something that federal agents have threatened protesters with. This is a critical safety measure, as we’re seeing the administration abusing its powers to intimidate those who criticize it, and it seems to be surveilling dissenters.

The bottom line for this entire list of demands is that some of what Democrats are asking for would have a real impact in counteracting how ICE has been operating with impunity across the country, but it truly is a bare minimum. If they fold, though, without achieving many of these baseline limits on ICE’s ability to abuse citizens and noncitizens alike, Democrats will themselves be on the hook the next time ICE commits a high-profile atrocity like the ones we’ve seen so frequently in Minneapolis.

Dahlia Lithwick covered a number of these issues in the most recent episode of Amicus. Lithwick spoke with Linus Chan, a professor and lawyer in Minneapolis who has been working with clients caught in ICE’s snare during the recent surge, about the way ICE has been getting around the current restrictions that already exist on its detention authority.

In that same episode, she also spoke with journalist Andrea Pitzer about the Stephen Miller campaign to expand the Department of Homeland Security’s capacity for mass detention and how it already resembles some of the darkest periods in human history.

In the Slate Plus segment of that episode, Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed the various breadcrumbs that Supreme Court Justice Sam Alito has been leaving us that he intends to retire this summer, and what it would mean for the court for its staunchest partisan to step down.

Amherst College law professor and Slate contributor Austin Sarat wrote about another issue that seems destined soon to reach the Supreme Court: whether Texas will execute a likely innocent man, Charles Flores, or whether the high court will force the state to reconsider Flores’ case.

On Tuesday, Trump’s most vile spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, announced she would be departing her job at DHS. Stern explained how this is a bittersweet moment for immigration activists, who relied heavily on McLaughlin’s outlandish statements to disprove DHS lies in court.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">NASA has released the findings from its investigation of the ill-fated crewed Boeing Starliner mission of 2024, and while it still isn&#39;t sure of the root technical causes, it&#39;s admitted that trusting Boeing to do a thorough job appears to have been a mistake.

NASA administrator Jared Isaacman copped to leadership failures across the org during a press conference on Thursday, explaining that while there were definitely technical issues with Starliner during the manned flight that left astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams stranded on the International Space Station for months, those technical issues only arose because of leadership and oversight failures.

&quot;We returned the crew safely, but the path we took did not reflect NASA at our best,&quot; Isaacman said. The NASA chief added that it was down to flight controllers and crew making the right decisions that resulted in the astronauts arriving safely on the ISS.

&quot;Had different decisions been made ... the outcome of this mission could have been very different,&quot; Isaacman said.

NASA&#39;s 311-page report [PDF] on the issue references known technical issues with Starliner, but puts the mission failure, which NASA has declared a type-A mishap, [PDF] down to organizational issues.

Problems with the craft itself included inadequate testing of Starliner&#39;s propulsion system, low telemetry rates, and a lack of onboard data storage during two prior orbital flight tests resulting in insufficient flight data to properly diagnose anomalies, which in turn led to unexplained anomaly acceptance without root cause resolution.

As for cultural issues at NASA, the space org admitted it had limited insight into subcontractor-level data, leaving it unable to verify the readiness of Starliner&#39;s systems. In addition, schedule pressure &quot;dictated a restrictive risk reduction initiative,&quot; and the Commercial Crew Program&#39;s (CCP) shared accountability model &quot;was poorly understood and inconsistently applied,&quot; leading to a lack or ownership of critical issues.

&quot;You can see in the report that inadequately-applied insight and lack of oversight ... is because we had very high confidence in the manufacturer based on their past performance on other programs,&quot; Isaacman said. Oops.

NASA further said in the report that the CCP&#39;s emphasis on provider (i.e., Boeing) autonomy clashed with &quot;NASA&#39;s traditional culture of technical rigor,&quot; and that CCP and Boeing&#39;s leadership was perceived by NASA as &quot;overly risk-tolerant and dismissive of dissenting views.&quot;

Organizationally, NASA concluded, it was too hands-off on Starliner&#39;s development, Boeing was too reliant on subcontractors and had inadequate systems engineering, and the CCP was more focused on Starliner&#39;s success than ensuring that the craft was safe.

NASA didn&#39;t push back on those cultural clashes enough, as Isaacman explained, leaving two astronauts lucky to be alive.

&quot;NASA permitted overarching programmatic objectives of having two providers capable of transporting astronauts to-and-from orbit, influence engineering and operational decisions, especially during and immediately after the mission,&quot; Isaacman said. &quot;We are correcting those mistakes.&quot;

Neither Isaacman nor associate NASA administrator Amit Kshatriya answered questions about whether there would be actual penalties or leadership shakeups at NASA or Boeing as a result of the clash of cultures and systemic failures at both organizations. The pair did make clear that NASA intends to continue with Starliner, and Boeing&#39;s statement to The Register echoed the same.

&quot;In the 18 months since our test flight, Boeing has made substantial progress on corrective actions for technical challenges we encountered and driven significant cultural changes across the team that directly align with the findings in the report,&quot; Boeing told us. &quot;We&#39;re working closely with NASA to ensure readiness for future Starliner missions and remain committed to NASA&#39;s vision for two commercial crew providers.&quot;

The report, and criticisms of CCP as prioritizing &quot;provider success over technical rigor&quot; raise another question: Is the CCP the safest and most effective approach to the future of the US space program when there&#39;s a perfectly good, NASA-managed rocket in the form of the Space Launch System, which is preparing to eventually take astronauts back to the Moon?

We put those questions to Isaacman, and he was unequivocal: CCP isn&#39;t going anywhere.

&quot;CCP is a very successful program,&quot; Isaacman said. &quot;It helped return American spaceflight capability after more than a decade after the Space Shuttle was retired.&quot;

Isaacman said that NASA has been leveraging private industry expertise since the beginning of the space program. He didn&#39;t directly address the question of whether allowing private industry to do the work itself was the best approach in light of NASA&#39;s own admitted CCP culture failures.

&quot;Relying on industry to get us there is one of our strengths,&quot; Isaacman said, before adding that NASA has work to do, too. &quot;There are certainly things we can do better here to achieve our objectives, and step one is the conversation we&#39;re having today.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you want an even better AI model, there could be reason to celebrate. Google, on Thursday, announced the release of Gemini 3.1 Pro, characterizing the model&#39;s arrival as &quot;a step forward in core reasoning.&quot;

Measured by the release cadence of machine learning models, Gemini 3.1 Pro is hard on the heels of recent model debuts from Anthropic and OpenAI. There&#39;s barely enough time to start using new US commercial AI models before a competitive alternative surfaces. And that&#39;s to say nothing about the AI models coming from outside the US, like Qwen3.5.

Google&#39;s Gemini team in a blog post contends that Gemini 3.1 Pro can tackle complex problem-solving better than preceding models. And they cite benchmark test results – which should be viewed with some skepticism – to support that claim. On the ARC-AGI-2 problem-solving test, Gemini 3.1 Pro scored 77.1 percent, compared to Gemini 3 Pro, which scored 31.1 percent, and Gemini 3 Deep Think, which scored 45.1 percent.

Gemini 3.1 Pro outscores rival commercial models like Anthropic&#39;s Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6, and OpenAI&#39;s GPT-5.2 and GPT-5.3-Codex in the majority of cited benchmarks, Google&#39;s chart shows. However, Opus 4.6 retains the top score for Humanity&#39;s Last Exam (full set, test + MM), SWE-Bench Verified, and τ²-bench. And GPT-5.3-Codex leads in SWE-Bench Pro (Public) and Terminal-Bench 2.0 when evaluated using Codex’s own harness rather than the standard Terminus-2 agent harness.

&quot;3.1 Pro is designed for tasks where a simple answer isn&#39;t enough, taking advanced reasoning and making it useful for your hardest challenges,&quot; the Gemini team said. &quot;This improved intelligence can help in practical applications – whether you&#39;re looking for a clear, visual explanation of a complex topic, a way to synthesize data into a single view, or bringing a creative project to life.&quot;

To illustrate potential uses, the Gemini team points to how the model can create website-ready SVG animations and can translate the literary style of a novel into the design of a personal portfolio site.

In the company&#39;s Q4 2025 earnings release [PDF], CEO Sundar Pichai said, &quot;Our first party models, like Gemini, now process over 10 billion tokens per minute via direct API use by our customers, and the Gemini App has grown to over 750 million monthly active users.&quot;

Google is making Gemini 3.1 Pro available via the Gemini API in Google AI Studio, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, and Android Studio. Enterprise customers can access it via Vertex AI and Gemini Enterprise while consumers can do so via the Gemini app and NotebookLM.

The model is also accessible via several Microsoft services including GitHub Copilot, Visual Studio, and Visual Studio Code. ®

            <h2>Spending watchdog tells National Science Foundation CIO to up game on tech procurement</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-19</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The US Congress’ spending watchdog, the Government Accountability Office, has pressed the National Science Foundation’s CIO to improve how the agency plans, manages, and procures technology.

The “open recommendations” were outlined in a letter dated February 12 and sent to NSF CIO Clyde Richards before being published on Thursday.

It said: &quot;We identified recommendations that relate to the CIO’s roles and responsibilities in effectively managing IT.” Paying attention to them “will help ensure the effective use of IT at the agency.&quot;

Put bluntly, &quot;NSF needs to improve its acquisition of cloud services and its reviews of the agency’s IT portfolio.&quot;

This includes developing guidance &quot;regarding standardizing cloud service-level agreements.&quot;

The GAO believes that the NSF should &quot;consistently&quot; hold cloud service providers accountable for performance, with clear SLAs and remediation plans for non-compliance. The GAO wants to see an SLA with every cloud vendor, and recommends the CIO develop guidance standardizing such SLAs.

It also wants an overhaul of contracts for &quot;high value assets that are managed and operated in the cloud.&quot; And recommends that the agency complete &quot;annual reviews of its IT portfolio consistent with federal requirements&quot; to identify areas of duplication and ways of streamlining operations and optimizing resource allocation.

The letter also mentions &quot;multiple open recommendations in the area of cybersecurity,&quot; referring to the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014.

The letter was cc’d to the Federal CIO, Gregory Barbaccia of the OMB, who is on a mission to drive down costs and standardize procurement across the government.

Richards was named CIO at the foundation seven months ago, after serving in the role on an &quot;acting&quot; basis for five months. He originally joined as deputy CIO in March 2024, having previously worked at the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency, following various roles in and around the military.

The NSF manages a budget of around $9 billion – it just dodged a massive 60 percent round of cuts proposed by the Trump administration – which is directed to a range of scientific disciplines.

Needless to say, it has a sprawling IT infrastructure, and an ongoing transformation program.

It is currently transferring management of the NCAR-Wyoming Supercomputing Center to a third-party operator. Other projects include a plan for a National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource Operations Center.

Last year, it awarded a $20 million grant to expand its CloudBank initiative, designed to give researchers, especially at smaller institutions, access to commercial cloud computing.

According to GAO, CIO open recommendations are &quot;outstanding&quot; ones requiring CIO attention that, if implemented, could significantly improve government IT operations, including strengthening security, cutting costs, and ensuring compliance.

Last year, the GAO delivered over a dozen recommendations on the Department of Veterans Affairs&#39; health records upgrade program.

Some dated back to 2020, but it&#39;s worth remembering that the current upgrade program only began in 2017 – and was the fourth attempt to modernize the 30-year-old system. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Thieves stole more than $20 million from compromised ATMs last year using a malware-assisted technique that the FBI says is on the uptick across the United States.

They are doing this through ATM jackpotting - a cyber-physical attack in which crooks exploit physical and software vulnerabilities in ATMs to deploy malware that instructs the machine to dispense cash on demand without bank authorization. Of the 1,900 such incidents reported since 2020, more than 700 occurred in 2025 alone, according to a Thursday security alert [PDF].

Crims typically gain initial access via generic keys that open the ATM face, and then infect the machine with malware, either removing the ATM&#39;s hard drive and copying malware onto it before putting it back into the machine, or simply replacing the hard drive with one that&#39;s preloaded with ATM jackpotting code.

Ploutus malware, which is commonly used in these attacks, exploits eXtensions for Financial Services (XFS), an open-standard API that ATMs, POS terminals, and similar devices that run banking applications use. It allows the banking software to work across different vendors&#39; hardware and instruct the ATM what to do - for example, send this transaction to the bank for authorization, and then dispense cash to the customer.

The malware, however, allows the attackers to issue their own commands to XFS, bypass bank authorization, and instruct the ATM to dispense cash on demand.

While these attacks don&#39;t hurt banking customers - unlike skimming, which steals people&#39;s card data and PINs - ATM jackpotting does cost financial institutions tens of millions of dollars in losses. Plus, these incidents are difficult to detect until after the cash is withdrawn.

In its Thursday alert, the FBI lists several digital indicators of compromise on ATMs running Windows OS, so give those a read as they include multiple executables along with associated files and scripts. There are also several physical indicators, such as event IDs that may appear when USB storage devices are inserted into a compromised ATM, and things like no cash indicators, unauthorized devices plugged into the ATM, or removed hard drives.

As always, if you see suspicious activity or any indication of ATM jackpotting, report it to your local FBI field office at www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices or the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center at www.ic3.gov. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Some AI advocates claim that bots hold the secret to mitigating climate change. But research shows that the reality is far different, as new datacenters cause power utilities to burn even more fossil fuels to meet their insatiable demand for energy.

It has been a common refrain of late that, as the tech industry&#39;s single-minded focus hones in on AI, abandoning climate pledges in the process and embracing quick-to-build fossil fuel power plants to drive its datacenters, the AI being spun up in new mega facilities would simply solve the problem for them.

Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has pushed that line of reasoning, as has Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, both arguing that AI&#39;s long-term climate benefits could outweigh, or help offset, the emissions associated with the growing power demands of datacenters. Others, including the International Energy Agency, claim to have support for the same.

With funding from climate action groups, energy analyst Ketan Joshi, however, is suggesting that AI firms and research from groups that support their plans, like the IEA, aren&#39;t just wrong, but may be intentionally greenwashing the problem.

Joshi&#39;s report was published this week and funded by groups including Beyond Fossil Fuels, Climate Action Against Disinformation, and Friends of the Earth U.S. He reached two central conclusions after looking at 154 claims of AI climate benefits arising from eight sources (including the IEA, climate researchers, Microsoft, Google, and others).

First off, there&#39;s a serious problem with the conflation of traditional AI, like predictive models and computer vision, with generative AI tools that chat, create images, and make music.

&quot;This analysis found that the overwhelming majority of AI climate benefit claims relate to &#39;traditional&#39; forms of AI rather than generative AI,&quot; Joshi wrote in the report.

Across the eight sources and 154 claims examined as part of the research, only four of them in any way related to generative AI systems and their potential to help the environment. In the other 150 cases, the language used in the data pointed to the deployment of traditional AI models as a potential source of climate solutions.

&quot;At no point did this search or analysis uncover examples where consumer generative systems such as ChatGPT, Gemini or Copilot led to a verifiable and substantial level of emissions reductions,&quot; Joshi wrote. &quot;However, much of the projected energy consumption of AI will stem specifically from &#39;generative AI,&#39; rather than more traditional forms of machine learning.&quot;

By generalizing their use of AI, companies claiming their systems would benefit the world they&#39;re polluting are pulling the wool over people&#39;s eyes, the report concludes, citing the coupling of traditional and generative AI in this context to be &quot;illogical&quot; and &quot;false.&quot;

&quot;The benefits and harms exist in discrete technological domains; rendering the core &#39;net climate benefit&#39; defence of AI growth utterly implausible,&quot; the report concluded.

Along with conflating the potential climate benefits of using traditional AI with the far more energy-intensive and frequent deployments of generative AI datacenters, the report concludes that most of the evidence that even traditional AI would help with the climate crisis lacks support.

Of the 154 climate benefit claims that were examined in the study, only 26 percent cited published academic papers, and 36 percent lacked any citations for their claims at all. The remaining papers that included citations largely relied on corporate publications (29 percent), while the rest cited media reports, NGOs, institutions, and unpublished research papers.

Unsurprisingly, those corporate sources mostly &quot;did not include any primary assessable evidence or peer-reviewed and published academic work to support their claims,&quot; Joshi found.

All the while, the sources reviewed for the report (all of which are linked in the report for those curious) paint a picture of a future in which AI will solve the climate problems it is exacerbating.

&quot;Even the narrower, older forms of AI may be seeing an exaggeration and overstatement of their climate benefits, considering the lack of strong, peer-reviewed and verifiable evidence of their deployment in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the real world,&quot; Joshi noted. &quot;The narrative of a gigatonne-scale shift in global emissions that &#39;offsets&#39; the harm of generative AI is not supported by the results of this analysis.&quot;

If it&#39;s not claims that AI datacenters are going to be powered by next-gen nuclear followed immediately by admissions that all that current buildout is simply being powered by fossil fuels, it&#39;s just another form of greenwashing from the AI industry, it seems.

Joshi told The Register in an email that he was motivated to undertake this research after hearing Google persistently claim that its AI deployments would reduce emissions by 5 to 10 percent based on what he characterized as &quot;mind-bogglingly weak evidence&quot; that he considers &quot;one of the worst greenwashing claims I&#39;ve seen in a while.&quot;

As to what could be done to combat such widespread misinformation about the climate effects/benefits of AI, Joshi suggested those fighting to force honesty on the AI industry need to play the waiting game, to a degree.

&quot;The entire software class is leveraged on hype rather than effectiveness or usefulness and is arguably doomed either way,&quot; Joshi told us, echoing claims that AI is a bubble likely to burst at any time.

&quot;There is widespread public skepticism for what all of this is actually for, skepticism of the tech industry and bipartisan hostility towards destructive data centre developments,&quot; Joshi added. &quot;I would not underestimate how much public opinion is stacked on the side of us climate advocates and analysts.&quot;

Joshi said that the job of climate advocates in the current moment is to ensure that there&#39;s as little fossil fuel infrastructure built, and locked in to produce years of emissions, as possible.

He&#39;s not advocating action out of far left field, either: A growing number of US states are trying to pass moratoriums on new datacenter projects as activist demands pile up at the state and federal level. Elon Musk&#39;s xAI, which has earned public ire and a lawsuit over gas turbines being used to power a massive AI datacenter in Memphis, Tennessee, is now being looked at by state regulators unhappy with the situation.

In short, even with the AI industry claiming it&#39;s helping to solve a climate crisis of its own exacerbation, public opinion may be starting to turn.

We reached out to the IEA, Microsoft, and Google for comment on this story given how heavily they were featured in the report. The IEA didn&#39;t respond, Microsoft had no comment, and Google stood by its claims.

&quot;We stand by our methodology, which is grounded in the best available science. And we are transparent in sharing the principles and methodology that guide it,&quot; The Chocolate Factory told us. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Opinion Palantir CEO Alex Karp has a singular mission to stand out among tech CEOs. Big talk on sales, profits, and tech potential is not enough. His gift for edgy one-liners takes him to places where execs of the past would have scarcely dared to go. Say hello to allusions to goose-stepping and innate Western superiority that we assume have audiences rolling in the aisles.

To get that much attention, he also needs to get about – much more than leaders of companies ten times the size of Palantir, it seems. Keeping him on the front pages of the business and investor media means Karp flies on &quot;non-commercial aircraft beneficially owned by him (the &quot;Executive Aircraft&quot;) for business and personal travel,&quot; according to a recent regulatory filing.

&quot;During the years ended December 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company incurred expenses related to the use of the Executive Aircraft of $17.2 million and $7.7 million, respectively,&quot; it said.

Let&#39;s get that straight. Damn near $25 million on air travel in two years. That&#39;s enough to fly from London to New York and back about 44,000 times in an economy seat – depending on the commercial airliner – or every day for the next 100-plus years.

Karp has boasted that the company doesn&#39;t need to spend much on sales, as its products sell themselves once customers start playing around with them. Aside from this not being true – Palantir spent $1 billion on sales and marketing [PDF] in FY 2025 – the investment in Karp jetting around the globe to keep his mouth at the center of the action might yield significant ROI, even if his board would sometimes rather he remained a little less vocal.

An analyst from investment bank Jefferies put Palantir&#39;s investment in Karp&#39;s mobility into some perspective.

&quot;Assuming use of a mid‑sized jet with an estimated operating cost of ~$7K per hour, this implies roughly 2,457 flight hours, or about 28 percent of the year spent in the air,&quot; a recent note said, according to the FT.

Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, a $200 billion annual revenue biz, spends $1.8 million on air travel a year. Maybe meeting in the Metaverse makes it less necessary, though we doubt it. Palo Alto Networks&#39; CEO spends $2.4 million on private aircraft travel. His company&#39;s revenue generates $11 billion or so annually, compared to Palantir&#39;s $4.5 billion.

Perhaps, then, Karp is compensating for something. Or maybe, given his many extended flights of fancy, he just struggles to get down to Earth. ®

It’s hard to buy a bad pair of wireless earbuds these days, and with constant discounts and deals wherever you look, now is as good a time as any to splurge on the pair you’ve been eyeing. The market has come a long way since the early era of true wireless earbuds, when we had to deal with mediocre sound quality and unreliable performance, all for the sake of ditching cables. Things are much different now. After several product generations, companies like Sony, Apple, Bose, and others are releasing their most impressive earbuds to date.

You can get phenomenal noise cancellation and sound quality in the premium tier of earbuds if you’re willing to spend big. But those aren’t always the most important criteria for everyone: maybe you’re looking for the perfect fitness earbuds or for a set that works just as well for Zoom calls as for playing your favorite playlists and podcasts.

Tech companies are increasingly making their earbuds work best with their own products through exclusive features and functionality, so that’s another thing to consider as you shop around. If you want a perk like head-tracking spatial audio, you’ll need to use AirPods with an iPhone, Samsung buds with a Samsung phone, and so on.

Smaller, more comfortable designUpgrades to ANC and sound qualityMuch clearer voice call performance

Glossy texture can make them harder to remove from caseSony’s bonus features aren’t as seamless as those of its competitors

Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: LDAC, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Foam (XS, S, M, L)

Despite the recent arrival of Sony’s WF-1000XM6 earbuds, the last-gen WF-1000XM5 remain our top recommendation for the best noise-canceling earbuds overall. Thanks to their larger drivers, audio quality is more detailed and dynamic than before while still retaining the warmth and clarity that made the WF-1000XM4 so enjoyable. They also deliver fantastic active noise cancellation, even if it’s not quite as impressive as it is on the newer XM6 or Bose’s Ultra Earbuds gen 2. The XM5 do a terrific job of eliminating background noise, and battery life can stretch to eight hours with ANC turned on.

Some people found the XM4 bulky and uncomfortable, but Sony has managed to shrink the XM5 by 25 percent (the XM6 are longer and narrower). Like before, the company includes foam-style tips that expand in your ears to create an excellent seal — and there’s even a fourth (extra small) set of tips in the box.

On Android phones, the 1000XM5 support Sony’s LDAC codec for higher-quality music playback. And they’re capable of dynamic head tracking spatial audio through supported video apps like Netflix. But even if you’re not using LDAC (or have an iPhone), these are up there with the very best audio-focused premium earbuds — including Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 4, only with substantially better noise cancellation. They’re also capable of multipoint Bluetooth connectivity, so you can pair them with two devices at the same time.

None of that to say the newer XM6 are a bad choice — quite the contrary, actually. Sony’s latest flagships offer improved sound, handle ambient noise better during calls, and deliver some of the best ANC you can get in a pair of wireless earbuds. But they’re also bulkier and pricier than the XM5 given the latter can often be found on sale for around $250, making the last-gen model a better option for most people.

Standout color and designVery compact carrying caseGreat performer for the price

Limited retail availabilityPlastic case can show scuffs

Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 5.5 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: LDAC, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)

When looking at Nothing’s Ear (a) earbuds, it’s easy to focus all your attention on the catchy yellow color or their fun, super compact carrying case. But at their $99 price, the company’s entry-level earbuds provide a ton of features, including active noise cancellation, a low-latency mode for gaming, multipoint Bluetooth pairing, and a decent IP54 dust and water resistance rating.

And the sound quality you get outperforms my usual expectations for this price point, especially since they often can be found for as little as $60. They’re not quite on par with Nothing’s higher-end Ear 3, but you do get expressive, very enjoyable audio — and you can customize the EQ further in Nothing’s mobile app.

Exceptional ANCSecure fitWireless charging case

Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC, aptX Adaptive / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)

The name Bose has been synonymous with noise cancellation for decades, and it’s again proven why with the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2). They offer the best noise-canceling performance available in a set of earbuds, delivering the peace and isolation many of us crave throughout the day. The second-gen model bring some much-needed improvements to call quality, too, and while they don’t match the performance of our best call quality picks, the AirPods 4 or Samsung Galaxy Buds, the Bose handle noisy environments far better and allow you to sound like you in conversations.

Although Bose added wireless charging and there’s now a little screen in the ear tips to keep earwax out of the earbuds, there’s no visual upgrade to speak of. The second-gen earbuds maintain a chunky look that’s identical to the first-gen QC Ultra Earbuds, which were already extremely similar to 2022’s QC Earbuds II. They come with three ear tips and three stabilizer sizes, providing a variety of combinations and a secure fit for different ear shapes.

As with the design, the QC Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2) sound nearly identical to their first-gen counterpart. The bass and treble are boosted, providing more bass than competitors and a lively high-end — although it can get to be a bit much on some tracks. Bose continues to stick with its three-band EQ in the app, which doesn’t allow much meaningful adjustment, but most people will appreciate the stock sound. Bose also continues to offer Immersive Audio, first introduced with the Ultra Earbuds, which is similar to Apple’s spatial audio.

Huzzah! Wireless charging!Adds ANC, transparency modes, spatial audioSlimmer ear hook, smaller caseAdds heart rateGreat soundNo price hike

Case is still a chonkerHeart rate is not that useful for iOS users

Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L, XL)

After a long wait, Beats finally introduced the Powerbeats Pro 2 in early 2025. They carry forward the signature ear hook design of past Powerbeats earbuds, but improve upon the original Powerbeats Pro in several key ways. Beats added active noise cancellation and a natural-sounding transparency mode to the Pro 2; the first-gen pair lacked both. The earbuds themselves are lighter, too, and the charging case is noticeably smaller.

The Powerbeats Pro 2 also feature heart rate monitoring thanks to built-in sensors on each earbud. You might already have a fitness tracker, chest strap, or smartwatch for this purpose, but if not, you can use these with compatible apps like Nike Run Club, Runna, Ladder, Slopes, Open, Peloton, and YaoYao. The downside is that they can’t simultaneously play music and broadcast heart rate to gym equipment when paired to an iOS device, rendering the Pro 2 a better heart rate monitoring alternative for Android users than iPhone users.

The Powerbeats Pro 2 remain rated IPX4 for water resistance. While that’s not as robust as some other fitness-focused buds, it should be sufficient to survive sweat and outdoor runs in various conditions. The earbuds still offer easy-to-use physical buttons and a dedicated volume rocker, so it’s easy to control them in the middle of a workout.

If you’re an iPhone owner, the Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds include Apple-only features like dynamic head tracking for spatial audio, auto device switching, Find My integration, and more. For Android users, Beats has an app that packs in a smaller subset of these functions.

Improved ANC and soundLonger batteryStandalone workout trackingLive translationSame priceIP57Better fitCamera remote control is handy!

If you’re hoping for traditional foam ear tips, this isn’t that

Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XXS, XS, S, M, L)

Apple continually adds to the features of the AirPods Pro line — either with a new product like the second-gen AirPods Pro, or with a software update, such as the one that introduced the hearing health features at the end of 2024. The AirPods Pro 3 continue the trend, with improved noise-canceling performance, heart rate sensing, newly designed ear tips with an extra XXS size, and longer battery life. The splashiest update is Live Translation, which, unlike the other improvements, still needs some time to develop into a more streamlined experience.

The new foam-infused earbuds improve passive isolation and, when combined with better ANC performance, deliver the best overall noise cancellation in a pair of Apple earbuds yet. ANC performance is nearly identical to that of the Bose QC Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2), but the AirPods have a slight high-end hiss (though some people might not notice it). A redesign of the acoustic architecture gives the AirPods Pro 3 improved bass performance over the second-gen model, and its spatial audio delivers a wider, richer listening experience.

But what’s important for many Apple users is how well the AirPods Pro 3 fit into the Apple ecosystem. A new heart sensor, first seen with the Powerbeats Pro 2, enables heart rate tracking for 50 workout types from directly within the iOS Fitness app. And unlike the Powerbeats Pro 2, the AirPods can work in conjunction with the Apple Watch, providing a secondary heart rate stream to ensure you always have the most accurate data.

Terrific sound qualityCrisp, natural transparency / passthrough modeVoice commands are simple and so usefulGood voice calls

Uninspired designMidtier noise cancellation performanceNo true multipoint

Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro ditch the company’s more discreet designs of the past for a stemmed style that’s similar to AirPods and any number of other wireless earbuds. Boring? Maybe, but thanks to that change, we’ve found them to be more comfortable and provide better stability than the Buds 2 Pro. The sound quality is even better than before — and it was already excellent. These are right up there with Sennheiser and Technics from an audio fidelity standpoint.

The Buds 3 Pro are also a standout performer when it comes to call quality. And our favorite thing about these earbuds are the hands-free voice commands that don’t require you to say any specific wake phrase beforehand. You can just say “volume up” and / or “next song,” and it happens.

But they’re not perfect: the Buds 3 Pro lack multipoint connectivity, so they can’t connect to two devices at the same time. Just like Apple, Samsung prefers to automatically hop between products within its own walled garden ecosystem. Some people might consider this a dealbreaker, but we’ve still enjoyed the earbuds plenty without it.

Smaller and lighter design is supremely comfortableMore powerful noise cancellationCrystal-clear transparency modeVery pleasant and detailed sound quality

ANC can’t quite match BoseGoogle still refuses to add higher-quality Bluetooth codecs, limiting overall fidelityGemini Live feels more feeble than futuristic

With the Pixel Buds Pro 2, Google has addressed most of the downsides of the original pair. They’re far smaller and lighter than the chunky first-gen Pixel Buds Pro. And there’s a small nub on the buds to help keep them in place while performing various activities, including running and other forms of intensive exercise.

Google’s active noise cancellation still isn’t on the same tier as Bose, but the transparency mode on the Buds Pro 2 is among the very best you’ll find. It offers a crisp, natural passthrough for the outside world when needed. Multipoint support is included, and Google’s latest pair of premium earbuds eke out impressive battery life that surpasses most competitors.

Got a Pixel phone? With the Pixel Buds Pro 2, you can have lengthy conversations with Google’s Gemini AI while your phone stays in your pocket. Features like head-tracking spatial audio and Clear Calling are also exclusive to those within the Pixel ecosystem. If that’s you, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are a big step up from the previous buds in a much smaller package.

Better sound, ANC, and battery life than Studio BudsStandout translucent case optionImproved voice call performance

ANC and transparency fall short of the AirPods Pro 3Doesn’t offer all Apple ecosystem tricksNo wireless charging or in-ear detection

Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)

Beats’ Studio Buds Plus are an upgraded, better-performing revision of the Studio Buds released in 2021. This time, the company has made the noise cancellation more powerful while also improving the quality of the transparency mode and extending battery life. If you’re going for style points, it doesn’t get much cooler than the translucent color option. These earbuds are very tiny and rank among the best in terms of overall comfort.

What’s interesting about the Studio Buds Plus is that they use a proprietary chip that allows them to support native software features on both iOS and Android. Plenty of earbuds offer companion apps on each platform, but in the case of the Beats, they work with both Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find Hub networks. You also get simple one-tap pairing, no matter which operating system you’re using.

The drawback to this dual-ecosystem life is that Apple customers don’t get all the usual bells and whistles that come with AirPods or even the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2; you lose out on audio sharing, head tracking spatial audio, and other tricks. Wireless charging and an ear detection sensor (for auto-pause when a bud is removed) are also MIA, which stings a bit considering the price.

Fantastic sound qualityImproved day-to-day reliabilityAuracast-enabled

Too pricey for someNoise cancellation does the job, but isn’t anything specialLong-term durability remains to be seen

Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 7.5 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AptX Adaptive, AptX, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)

Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless earbuds have always sounded fantastic; that’s never been the issue. But previous models in the series have been tainted a bit by bugs, unsteady performance, and battery reliability problems. The fourth-gen pair finally gets that part right while continuing to offer tremendous, detailed sound quality that stands above nearly all competitors. They’re a joy to listen to. The active noise cancellation can’t compete with the likes of Apple, Sony, and Bose, but if you care more about lush, intricate sound, the MTW4 won’t disappoint in the slightest.

These earbuds come with optional wing tips to help keep them securely locked in your ears. That could prove helpful for running or when hitting the gym. Sennheiser allows for plenty of EQ customization using its mobile app, and the Momentum True Wireless 4 support a range of Bluetooth codecs, including AAC, SBC, AptX, and AptX Adaptive. They’re even LE Audio and Auracast-ready for when those features become more widespread.

Upgraded sound qualityVoice isolation can noticeably improve call clarityDeep Apple ecosystem integration

No wireless chargingNo built-in speaker on the caseNo proper multipoint

Noise cancellation: Optional / Battery life: 5 hours / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: None

Apple’s AirPods 4 come in two different versions, with a higher-priced option that includes active noise cancellation and wireless charging. But sound quality is identical on both sets, and equally as important in this case is that the same can be said of voice call clarity.

On the AirPods 4, there’s a new “voice isolation” feature — enabled by default — that uses machine learning both on the earbuds and your iPhone to eliminate distracting background noise on your end so that you come through clearly to whoever you’re speaking with.

Overall call quality is excellent with the AirPods 4. And beyond that, compared to the third-gen model, you can expect upgraded audio quality (with richer bass), new ways of interacting with Siri through head movements, and yes... there’s a USB-C connector on the included charging case, as opposed to a Lightning port.

The AirPods still have a one-size-fits-most hard plastic form factor, so we recommend trying them before committing to a purchase. However, Apple says it used more than 50 million data points to further refine the contours and overall stability of its latest earbuds. So, if previous models worked well for you, these seem like a safe bet. The only question is whether you feel like spending a little more to gain ANC, a transparency mode, wireless charging, and a built-in speaker for Find My location tracking.

Sony’s unconventional LinkBuds were our longtime pick for the clearest voice calls on Android, but we still haven’t had the chance to review their successors. For now, the aforementioned Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are an easy-to-recommend choice. The built-in “voice pickup unit” detects the movement of your mouth to help isolate your voice from background noise and keep conversations clear.

The Buds 3 Pro have proven dependable for us during video chats on Google Meet and Zoom, and people have been able to hear us without issue, even when answering a quick call on the street.

Whether you’re using earbuds to check out a newly-released album on Spotify, as motivation at the gym, or to tune out distractions around the office, they must deliver on the key metrics of sound quality, noise cancellation, voice call performance, and more. We spend many hours putting our picks through the paces. This includes quiet listening sessions that reveal their full detail, overall fidelity, and dynamics. We also take these buds out into the real world — on rush hour subway commutes, around busy cities, and in crowded cafes — to gauge their connection strength and determine how effectively they can quiet the world around you. We test them on video calls at work and by calling friends and family, who provide blunt feedback on how their mics sound. And importantly, because earbud makers often reserve certain software tricks for their preferred ecosystems, we see how the earbuds fare when used across multiple platforms.

No matter how they sound, what good are earbuds if you don’t enjoy wearing them? Ears come in all shapes and sizes, so the comfort factor is highly subjective. Most of our picks include several sizes of ear tips; usually they’re silicone, but some companies use foam (or both). Again, which you like better comes down to personal preference. Silicone tips are more common, but foam can expand to fill more of your ear for a better seal. The most important tip we can offer is to try different-sized tips in each ear: you might find that one ear needs a bigger or smaller tip than the other.

Just like with comfort, we all have our own inclinations for what we want from sound quality. Some people are bass-heads who can’t live without a thumping low end. Personally, we care more about dynamics, clarity, and definition from the music we’re listening to. We want vocals to ring through naturally and instruments to be well separated in the sound stage. We look for earbuds that can bring out the subtle details in our favorite songs.

What was once a luxury feature is now the status quo. Many of our top picks include active noise cancellation to help quiet the raucous outside world. Whether you’re trying to concentrate at the office or rest while traveling, noise cancellation can be a huge help. However, some people hate the “plugged up” feeling of earbuds and prefer open-style buds that help maintain full awareness of their surroundings.

Most earbuds these days offer between five and six hours of continuous battery life with ANC enabled. Some models can exceed that (and over-ear headphones tend to last much longer on a charge), but the convenience of being able to just pop your earbuds back into their case for more juice makes the tradeoff easier to live with.

Even if you don’t intend to use your earbuds for fitness purposes, there’s always a chance of getting caught out in the rain while wearing them. At a minimum, you should look for earbuds with IPX4 water resistance. This safeguards them from splashes of water (and sweat), so they should be cut out for the hazards of daily life.

Update, February 19th: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability and mention Sony’s newer WF-1000XM6 earbuds. Brandon Widder also contributed to this post.

            <div id="article-text">﻿Horizon Worlds is now going to be a platform that’s ‘almost exclusively mobile.’

﻿Horizon Worlds is now going to be a platform that’s ‘almost exclusively mobile.’

Meta, after laying off about 10 percent of its Reality Labs division, closing three VR studios, stopping new content for VR fitness app Supernatural, and discontinuing its metaverse for work, is announcing a major change for its Horizon Worlds metaverse platform. Instead of attempting to make the 3D social platform work for both VR and mobile, Meta is “explicitly separating” its “Quest VR platform from our Worlds platform” and “shifting the focus of Worlds to be almost exclusively mobile,” Samantha Ryan, Reality Labs’ VP of content, says in a blog post.

The new approach sets Meta up to better compete with platforms like Roblox and Fortnite, which also offer user-generated experiences that can be played on your phone. Horizon Worlds originally launched for VR, but “to truly change the game and tap into a much larger market, we’re going all-in on mobile.”

“We’re in a strong position to deliver synchronous social games at scale, thanks to our unique ability to connect those games with billions of people on the world’s biggest social networks,” Ryan says. “You saw this strategy start to unfold in 2025, and now, it’s our main focus.”

As for VR software, Ryan says Meta is focusing on supporting third-party developers. “While we’re proud of the world-class work from Oculus Studios over the years, among 1P and 3P apps, 86% of the effective time people spend in their VR headsets is with third-party apps.”

But Meta is still planning to make VR hardware; “we have a robust roadmap of future VR headsets that will be tailored to different audience segments as the market grows and matures,” according to Ryan. (That new hardware, which could include a new mainline Quest headset, might cost a higher price.)

Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth made similar comments about Meta’s shift in strategy in a recent episode of the Access podcast, which is hosted by former Verge staffer Alex Heath.

After the not-so-successful bet on the metaverse, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg now sees AI as the new social media, a vision that could include AI-generated games that users can share with others on their feeds. “There are 3D versions of that, and there are 2D versions of that and Horizon, I think, fits very well with the kind of immersive 3D version of that,” Zuckerberg said on the company’s latest earnings call.

Ring founder Jamie Siminoff has been on an “explanation tour,” as The New York Times puts it, following the fallout from its Super Bowl ad and the introduction of its Search Party feature.

In an interview with The Times this week, Siminoff explained that he understands people’s concerns and that “maybe people were ‘triggered’ by an image in the ad that showed blue rings radiating out from suburban homes. There will be fewer maps in any future ads, he said.”

Graphics in ads are not the problem. The problem is the potential for Ring’s vast network of AI-powered camera technology to be turned into a surveillance tool, one accessible to law enforcement and capable of creating a record of people’s movements that’s searchable by AI (which itself raises concerns around reliability and hallucination). Ring is the only home security camera company to have built a system — called Community Requests — that allows its users to share footage directly with local police.

Ring maintains that its cameras are not being used to create a mass surveillance tool. According to the company, its privacy protections are robust, and users are fully in control of their videos, including whether they share them with law enforcement. But the company still hasn’t fully addressed its users’ fears.

Rather than continue to push his narrative that cameras will solve crime, Siminoff needs to acknowledge the real concerns people have and make it clear how far Ring is willing to take this powerful technology. He needs to explain where — and how — he will draw the line. Will Search Party stop at tracking humans?

Instead, he’s doubling down on the ideas that more cameras are good and more video in the world is better — not surprising from someone who makes money by selling cameras. But he also told The Times that he thinks most people feel this way, even if they say otherwise.

“There’s been a lot of cases recently where if the video had not been there, I’m not sure if the story would have been told the same or we wouldn’t have known what happened,” he told The Times, adding that what Ring does is “not just like unfettered mass surveillance.”

The other concern is around what happens to its video after users share it with the police. While that’s arguably not Ring’s problem, the company has acknowledged that its mission “to make neighborhoods safer” carries significant responsibility. It created this technology and needs to ensure it’s used responsibly.

The argument that camera owners have complete control of how their footage is shared puts the onus on the user. But Ring turned Search Party on by default for everyone, demonstrating that it has the control. There’s also no guarantee that any current default settings will stay that way. Additionally, while the user can choose to share footage, the people captured by the cameras don’t necessarily have that choice.

Ring has cancelled its controversial partnership with Flock Safety, a law enforcement technology company linked with sharing footage with ICE, but its Community Requests tool is still going. As is its partnership with Axon, another law enforcement technology company, known for Tasers, whose digital evidence management system is widely used by law enforcement agencies, including Customs and Border Protection.

Siminoff confirmed to The Times that Ring will continue building out Search Party, saying that they’re looking to add searching for cats to its capabilities. But then, what comes next?

All this technology is coming together at lightning speed, and to many, it feels like it’s just one turn away from a dystopian surveillance system.

Sony purchased Bluepoint Games in 2021, but recently canceled its live-service God of War.

Sony is shutting down Bluepoint Games, the PlayStation studio behind well-received remakes of games like Shadow of the Colossus and Demon’s Souls, according to Bloomberg. The change was made “following a recent business review,” a spokesperson told the publication. About 70 staffers will be cut, and the studio will shut down in March.

“Bluepoint Games is an incredibly talented team and their technical expertise has delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community,” a spokesperson told Bloomberg. “We thank them for their passion, creativity and craftmanship.” Sony didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.

Sony acquired Bluepoint Games in 2021 following a string of successful updates to many PlayStation franchises, including remasters of the first three Uncharted titles and of Gravity Rush. But after Sony’s purchase, the company appears to have set the studio on a different course than the remakes and remasters that made it a powerhouse: it co-developed 2022’s God of War: Ragnarok, then spent years working on an unannounced live service God of War game that Sony canceled in January.

Bluepoint is just the latest PlayStation studio affected by major changes in recent years. Sony closed down Concord developer Firewalk Studios in 2024 shortly after the game’s disastrous launch. At that same time, it announced the shutdown of mobile studio Neon Koi, too. In 2024, Bungie also laid off 220 employees and moved others into Sony Interactive Entertainment.

A hacker tricked Cline’s Claude-powered workflow into installing OpenClaw on computers.

A hacker tricked a popular AI coding tool into installing OpenClaw — the viral, open-source AI agent OpenClaw that “actually does things” — absolutely everywhere. Funny as a stunt, but a sign of what to come as more and more people let autonomous software use their computers on their behalf.

The hacker took advantage of a vulnerability in Cline, an open-source AI coding agent popular among developers, that security researcher Adnan Khan had surfaced just days earlier as a proof of concept. Simply put, Cline’s workflow used Anthropic’s Claude, which could be fed sneaky instructions and made to do things that it shouldn’t, a technique known as a prompt injection.

The hacker used their access to slip through instructions to automatically install software on users’ computers. They could have installed anything, but they opted for OpenClaw. Fortunately, the agents were not activated upon installation, or this would have been a very different story.

It’s a sign of how quickly things can unravel when AI agents are given control over our computers. They may look like clever wordplay — one group wooed chatbots into committing crimes with poetry — but in a world of increasingly autonomous software, prompt injections are massive security risks that are very difficult to defend against. Acknowledging this, some companies instead lock down what AI tools can do if they’re hijacked. OpenAI, for example, recently introduced a new Lockdown Mode for ChatGPT preventing it from giving your data away.

Obviously, protecting against prompt injections is harder if you ignore the researchers who privately flag flaws to you. Khan said he warned Cline about the vulnerability weeks before publishing his findings. The exploit was only fixed after he called them out publicly.

Packing multiple charging adapters can quickly eat up space, which is why an all-in-one travel adapter like the Baseus EnerCore CG11 makes for a good investment. The travel-friendly accessory works in most countries and lets you charge several devices at once, and right now, Amazon is offering it for $24.95 ($45 off) — its lowest price to date — when you use promo code G76S8NVM at checkout.

Baseus’ versatile adapter features four sliding plug types — Type A, Type C, Type G, and Type I — which retract when not in use, making it easy to pack. Together, they support outlets in more than 200 countries and regions, including the UK, Europe, Australia, Asia, and South America. It features a USB-C and USB-A port, both of which deliver up to 60W of power, as well as a third 5W USB-A port for lower-power gadgets. That means you can charge a range of gadgets simultaneously, from smartphones and earbuds to the latest tablets. You can even charge beefier gadgets, including laptops, albeit at slower speeds.

Additionally, the universal travel adapter features a built-in, retractable USB-C cable with five preset lengths, which can extend up to 27 inches and deliver up to 70W of power. The palm-sized cube also weighs about half a pound, so it won’t add as much bulk to your bag as a bunch of chargers and adapters would. It lacks surge protection, too, so you can even safely bring it on board cruise ships.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/19/1133360/microsoft-has-a-new-plan-to-prove-whats-real-and-whats-ai-online/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI-enabled deception now permeates our online lives. There are the high-profile cases you may easily spot, like when White House officials recently shared a manipulated image of a protester in Minnesota and then mocked those asking about it. Other times, it slips quietly into social media feeds and racks up views, like the videos that Russian influence campaigns are currently spreading to discourage Ukrainians from enlisting.

It is into this mess that Microsoft has put forward a blueprint, shared with MIT Technology Review, for how to prove what’s real online.

An AI safety research team at the company recently evaluated how methods for documenting digital manipulation are faring against today’s most worrying AI developments, like interactive deepfakes and widely accessible hyperrealistic models. It then recommended technical standards that can be adopted by AI companies and social media platforms.

To understand the gold standard that Microsoft is pushing, imagine you have a Rembrandt painting and you are trying to document its authenticity. You might describe its provenance with a detailed manifest of where the painting came from and all the times it changed hands. You might apply a watermark that would be invisible to humans but readable by a machine. And you could digitally scan the painting and generate a mathematical signature, like a fingerprint, based on the brush strokes. If you showed the piece at a museum, a skeptical visitor could then examine these proofs to verify that it’s an original.

All of these methods are already being used to varying degrees in the effort to vet content online. Microsoft evaluated 60 different combinations of them, modeling how each setup would hold up under different failure scenarios—from metadata being stripped to content being slightly altered or deliberately manipulated. The team then mapped which combinations produce sound results that platforms can confidently show to people online, and which ones are so unreliable that they may cause more confusion than clarification.

The company’s chief scientific officer, Eric Horvitz, says the work was prompted by legislation—like California’s AI Transparency Act, which will take effect in August—and the speed at which AI has developed to combine video and voice with striking fidelity.

“You might call this self-regulation,” Horvitz told MIT Technology Review. But it’s clear he sees pursuing the work as boosting Microsoft’s image: “We’re also trying to be a selected, desired provider to people who want to know what’s going on in the world.”

Nevertheless, Horvitz declined to commit to Microsoft using its own recommendation across its platforms. The company sits at the center of a giant AI content ecosystem: It runs Copilot, which can generate images and text; it operates Azure, the cloud service through which customers can access OpenAI and other major AI models; it owns LinkedIn, one of the world’s largest professional platforms; and it holds a significant stake in OpenAI. But when asked about in-house implementation, Horvitz said in a statement, “Product groups and leaders across the company were involved in this study to inform product road maps and infrastructure, and our engineering teams are taking action on the report’s findings.”

It’s important to note that there are inherent limits to these tools; just as they would not tell you what your Rembrandt means, they are not built to determine if content is accurate or not. They only reveal if it has been manipulated. It’s a point that Horvitz says he has to make to lawmakers and others who are skeptical of Big Tech as an arbiter of fact.

“It’s not about making any decisions about what’s true and not true,” he said. “It’s about coming up with labels that just tell folks where stuff came from.”

Hany Farid, a professor at UC Berkeley who specializes in digital forensics but wasn’t involved in the Microsoft research, says that if the industry adopted the company’s blueprint, it would be meaningfully more difficult to deceive the public with manipulated content. Sophisticated individuals or governments can work to bypass such tools, he says, but the new standard could eliminate a significant portion of misleading material.

“I don’t think it solves the problem, but I think it takes a nice big chunk out of it,” he says.

Still, there are reasons to see Microsoft’s approach as an example of somewhat naïve techno-optimism. There is growing evidence that people are swayed by AI-generated content even when they know that it is false. And in a recent study of pro-Russian AI-generated videos about the war in Ukraine, comments pointing out that the videos were made with AI received far less engagement than comments treating them as genuine.

“Are there people who, no matter what you tell them, are going to believe what they believe?” Farid asks. “Yes.” But, he adds, “there are a vast majority of Americans and citizens around the world who I do think want to know the truth.”

That desire has not exactly led to urgent action from tech companies. Google started adding a watermark to content generated by its AI tools in 2023, which Farid says has been helpful in his investigations. Some platforms use C2PA, a provenance standard Microsoft helped launch in 2021. But the full suite of changes that Microsoft suggests, powerful as they are, might remain only suggestions if they threaten the business models of AI companies or social media platforms.

“If the Mark Zuckerbergs and the Elon Musks of the world think that putting ‘AI generated’ labels on something will reduce engagement, then of course they’re incentivized not to do it,” Farid says. Platforms like Meta and Google have already said they’d include labels for AI-generated content, but an audit conducted by Indicator last year found that only 30% of its test posts on Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, TikTok, and YouTube were correctly labeled as AI-generated.

More forceful moves toward content verification might come from the many pieces of AI regulation pending around the world. The European Union’s AI Act, as well as proposed rules in India and elsewhere, would all compel AI companies to require some form of disclosure that a piece of content was generated with AI.

One priority from Microsoft is, unsurprisingly, to play a role in shaping these rules. The company waged a lobbying effort during the drafting of California’s AI Transparency Act, which Horvitz said made the legislation’s requirements on how tech companies must disclose AI-generated content “a bit more realistic.”

But another is a very real concern about what could happen if the rollout of such content-verification technology is done poorly. Lawmakers are demanding tools that can verify what’s real, but the tools are fragile. If labeling systems are rushed out, inconsistently applied, or frequently wrong, people could come to distrust them altogether, and the entire effort would backfire. That’s why the researchers argue that it may be better in some cases to show nothing at all than a verdict that could be wrong.

Inadequate tools could also create new avenues for what the researchers call sociotechnical attacks. Imagine that someone takes a real image of a fraught political event and uses an AI tool to change only an inconsequential share of pixels in the image. When it spreads online, it could be misleadingly classified by platforms as AI-manipulated. But combining provenance and watermark tools would mean platforms could clarify that the content was only partially AI generated, and point out where the changes were made.

California’s AI Transparency Act will be the first major test of these tools in the US, but enforcement could be challenged by President Trump’s executive order from late last year seeking to curtail state AI regulations that are “burdensome” to the industry. The administration has also generally taken a posture against efforts to curb disinformation, and last year, via DOGE, it canceled grants related to misinformation. And, of course, official government channels in the Trump administration have shared content manipulated with AI (MIT Technology Review reported that the Department of Homeland Security, for example, uses video generators from Google and Adobe to make content it shares with the public).

I asked Horvitz whether fake content from this source worries him as much as that coming from the rest of social media. He initially declined to comment, but then he said, “Governments have not been outside the sectors that have been behind various kinds of manipulative disinformation, and this is worldwide.”

Backlash against ICE is fueling a broader movement against AI companies’ ties to President Trump.

How uncrewed narco subs could transform the Colombian drug trade

For decades, handmade narco subs have been some of the cocaine trade’s most elusive and productive workhorses, ferrying multi-ton loads of illicit drugs from Colombian estuaries toward markets in North America and, increasingly, the rest of the world. Now off-the-shelf technology—Starlink terminals, plug-and-play nautical autopilots, high-resolution video cameras—may be advancing that cat-and-mouse game into a new phase.Uncrewed subs could move more cocaine over longer distances, and they wouldn’t put human smugglers at risk of capture. And law enforcement around the world is just beginning to grapple with what this means for the future. Read the full story.

Google DeepMind wants to know if chatbots are just virtue signaling

The news: Google DeepMind is calling for the moral behavior of large language models—such as what they do when called on to act as companions, therapists, medical advisors, and so on—to be scrutinized with the same kind of rigor as their ability to code or do math.

Why it matters: As LLMs improve, people are asking them to play more and more sensitive roles in their lives. Agents are starting to take actions on people’s behalf. LLMs may be able to influence human decision-making. And yet nobody knows how trustworthy this technology really is at such tasks. Read the full story.

The building legal case for global climate justice

The United States and the European Union grew into economic superpowers by committing climate atrocities. They have burned a wildly disproportionate share of the world’s oil and gas, planting carbon time bombs that will detonate first in the poorest, hottest parts of the globe.Morally, there’s an ironclad case that the countries or companies responsible for this mess should provide compensation. Legally, though, the case has been far harder to make. But now those tides might be turning. Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On a bright morning last April, a surveillance plane operated by the Colombian military spotted a 40-foot-long shark-like silhouette idling in the ocean just off Tayrona National Park. It was, unmistakably, a “narco sub,” a stealthy fiberglass vessel that sails with its hull almost entirely underwater, used by drug cartels to move cocaine north. The plane’s crew radioed it in, and eventually nearby coast guard boats got the order, routine but urgent: Intercept.

In Cartagena, about 150 miles from the action, Captain Jaime González Zamudio, commander of the regional coast guard group, sat down at his desk to watch what happened next. On his computer monitor, icons representing his patrol boats raced toward the sub’s coordinates as updates crackled over his radio from the crews at sea. This was all standard; Colombia is the world’s largest producer of cocaine, and its navy has been seizing narco subs for decades. And so the captain was pretty sure what the outcome would be. His crew would catch up to the sub, just a bit of it showing above the water’s surface. They’d bring it to heel, board it, and force open the hatch to find two, three, maybe four exhausted men suffocating in a mix of diesel fumes and humidity, and a cargo compartment holding several tons of cocaine.

The boats caught up to the sub. A crew boarded, forced open the hatch, and confirmed that the vessel was secure. But from that point on, things were different.

First, some unexpected details came over the radio: There was no cocaine on board. Neither was there a crew, nor a helm, nor even enough room for a person to lie down. Instead, inside the hull the crew found a fuel tank, an autopilot system and control electronics, and a remotely monitored security camera. González Zamudio’s crew started sending pictures back to Cartagena: Bolted to the hull was another camera, as well as two plastic rectangles, each about the size of a cookie sheet—antennas for connecting to Starlink satellite internet.

The authorities towed the boat back to Cartagena, where military techs took a closer look. Weeks later, they came to an unsettling conclusion: This was Colombia’s first confirmed uncrewed narco sub. It could be operated by remote control, but it was also capable of some degree of autonomous travel. The techs concluded that the sub was likely a prototype built by the Clan del Golfo, a powerful criminal group that operates along the Caribbean coast.

For decades, handmade narco subs have been some of the cocaine trade’s most elusive and productive workhorses, ferrying multi-ton loads of illicit drugs from Colombian estuaries toward markets in North America and, increasingly, the rest of the world. Now off-the-shelf technology—Starlink terminals, plug-and-play nautical autopilots, high-resolution video cameras—may be advancing that cat-and-mouse game into a new phase.

Uncrewed subs could move more cocaine over longer distances, and they wouldn’t put human smugglers at risk of capture. Law enforcement around the world is just beginning to grapple with what the Tayrona sub means for the future—whether it was merely an isolated experiment or the opening move in a new era of autonomous drug smuggling at sea.

Drug traffickers love the ocean. “You can move drug traffic through legal and illegal routes,” says Juan Pablo Serrano, a captain in the Colombian navy and head of the operational coordination center for Orión, a multiagency, multinational counternarcotics effort. The giant container ships at the heart of global commerce offer a favorite approach, Serrano says. Bribe a chain of dockworkers and inspectors, hide a load in one of thousands of cargo boxes, and put it on a totally legal commercial vessel headed to Europe or North America. That route is slow and expensive—involving months of transit and bribes spread across a wide network—but relatively low risk. “A ship can carry 5,000 containers. Good luck finding the right one,” he says.

Far less legal, but much faster and cheaper, are small, powerful motorboats. Quick to build and cheap to crew, these “go-fasts” top out at just under 50 feet long and can move smaller loads in hours rather than days. But they’re also easy for coastal radars and patrols to spot.

Submersibles—or, more accurately, “semisubmersibles”—fit somewhere in the middle. They take more money and engineering to build than an open speedboat, but they buy stealth—even if a bit of the vessel rides at the surface, the bulk stays hidden underwater. That adds another option to a portfolio that smugglers constantly rebalance across three variables: risk, time, and cost. When US and Colombian authorities tightened control over air routes and commercial shipping in the early 1990s, subs became more attractive. The first ones were crude wooden hulls with a fiberglass shell and extra fuel tanks, cobbled together in mangrove estuaries, hidden from prying eyes. Today’s fiberglass semisubmersible designs ride mostly below the surface, relying on diesel engines that can push multi-ton loads for days at a time while presenting little more than a ripple and a hot exhaust pipe to radar and infrared sensors.

A typical semisubmersible costs under $2 million to build and can carry three metric tons of cocaine. That’s worth over $160 million in Europe—wholesale.

Most ferry between South American coasts and handoff points in Central America and Mexico, where allied criminal organizations break up the cargo and slowly funnel it toward the US. But some now go much farther. In 2019, Spanish authorities intercepted a semisubmersible after a 27-day transatlantic voyage from Brazil. In 2024, police in the Solomon Islands found the first narco sub in the Asia-Pacific region, a semisubmersible probably originating from Colombia on its way to Australia or New Zealand.

If the variables are risk, time, and cost, then the economics of a narco sub are simple. Even if they spend more time on the water than a powerboat, they’re less likely to get caught—and a relative bargain to produce. A narco sub might cost between $1 million and $2 million to build, but a kilo of cocaine costs just about $500 to make. “By the time that kilo reaches Europe, it can sell for between $44,000 and $55,000,” Serrano says. A typical semisubmersible carries up to three metric tons—cargo worth well over $160 million at European wholesale prices.

Off-the-shelf nautical autopilots, WiFi antennas, Starlink satellite internet connections, and remote cameras are all drug smugglers need to turn semisubmersibles into drone ships.

As a result, narco subs are getting more common. Seizures by authorities tripled in the last 20 years, according to Colombia’s International Center for Research and Analysis Against Maritime Drug Trafficking (CMCON), and Serrano admits that the Orión alliance has enough ships and aircraft to catch only a fraction of what sails.

Until now, though, narco subs have had one major flaw: They depended on people, usually poor fishermen or low-level recruits sealed into stifling compartments for days at a time, steering by GPS and sight, hoping not to be spotted. That made the subs expensive and a risk to drug sellers if captured. Like good capitalists, the Tayrona boat’s builders seem to have been trying to obviate labor costs with automation. No crew means more room for drugs or fuel and no sailors to pay—or to get arrested or flip if a mission goes wrong.

“If you don’t have a person or people on board, that makes the transoceanic routes much more feasible,” says Henry Shuldiner, a researcher at InSight Crime who has analyzed hundreds of narco-sub cases. It’s one thing, he notes, to persuade someone to spend a day or two going from Colombia to Panama for a big payout; it’s another to ask four people to spend three weeks sealed inside a cramped tube, sleeping, eating, and relieving themselves in the same space. “That’s a hard sell,” Shuldiner says.

An uncrewed sub doesn’t have to race to a rendezvous because its crew can endure only a few days inside. It can move more slowly and stealthily. It can wait out patrols or bad weather, loiter near a meeting point, or take longer and less well-monitored routes. And if something goes wrong—if a military plane appears or navigation fails—its owners can simply scuttle the vessel from afar.

Meanwhile, the basic technology to make all that work is getting more and more affordable, and the potential profit margins are rising. “The rapidly approaching universality of autonomous technology could be a nightmare for the U.S. Coast Guard,” wrote two Coast Guard officers in the US Naval Institute’s journal Proceedings in 2021. And as if to prove how good an idea drone narco subs are, the US Marine Corps and the weapons builder Leidos are testing a low-profile uncrewed vessel called the Sea Specter, which they describe as being “inspired” by narco-sub design.

The possibility that drug smugglers are experimenting with autonomous subs isn’t just theoretical. Law enforcement agencies on other smuggling routes have found signs the Tayrona sub isn’t an isolated case. In 2022, Spanish police seized three small submersible drones near Cádiz, on Spain’s southern coast. Two years later, Italian authorities confiscated a remote-­controlled minisubmarine they believed was intended for drug runs. “The probability of expansion is high,” says Diego Cánovas, a port and maritime security expert in Spain. Tayrona, the biggest and most technologically advanced uncrewed narco sub found so far, is more likely a preview than an anomaly.

Today, the Tayrona semisubmersible sits on a strip of grass at the ARC Bolívar naval base in Cartagena. It’s exposed to the elements; rain has streaked its paint. To one side lies an older, bulkier narco sub seized a decade ago, a blue cylinder with a clumsy profile. The Tayrona’s hull looks lower, leaner, and more refined.

Up close, it is also unmistakably handmade. The hull is a dull gray-blue, the fiberglass rough in places, with scrapes and dents from the tow that brought it into port. It has no identifying marks on the exterior—nothing that would tie it to a country, a company, or a port. On the upper surface sit the two Starlink antennas, painted over in the same gray-blue to keep them from standing out against the sea.

I climb up a ladder and drop through the small hatch near the stern. Inside, the air is damp and close, the walls beaded with condensation. Small puddles of fuel have collected in the bilge. The vessel has no seating, no helm or steering wheel, and not enough space to stand up straight or lie down. It’s clear it was never meant to carry people. A technical report by CMCON found that the sub would have enough fuel for a journey of some 800 nautical miles, and the central cargo bay would hold between 1 and 1.5 tons of cocaine.

At the aft end, the machinery compartment is a tangle of hardware: diesel engine, batteries, pumps, and a chaotic bundle of cables feeding an electronics rack. All the core components are still there. Inside that rack, investigators identified a NAC-3 autopilot processor, a commercial unit designed to steer midsize boats by tying into standard hydraulic pumps, heading sensors, and rudder-­feedback systems. They cost about $2,200 on Amazon.

“These are plug-and-play technologies,” says Wilmar Martínez, a mechatronics professor at the University of America in Bogotá, when I show him pictures of the inside of the sub. “Midcareer mechatronics students could install them.”

For all its advantages, an autonomous drug-smuggling submarine wouldn’t be invincible. Even without a crew on board, there are still people in the chain. Every satellite internet terminal—Starlink or not—comes with a billing address, a payment method, and a log of where and when it pings the constellation. Colombian officers have begun to talk about negotiating formal agreements with providers, asking them to alert authorities when a transceiver’s movements match known smuggling patterns. Brazil’s government has already cut a deal with Starlink to curb criminal use of its service in the Amazon.

The basic playbook for finding a drone sub will look much like the one for crewed semisubmersibles. Aircraft and ships will use radar to pick out small anomalies and infrared cameras to look for the heat of a diesel engine or the turbulence of a wake. That said, it might not work. “If they wind up being smaller, they’re going to be darn near impossible to detect,” says Michael Knickerbocker, a former US Navy officer who advises defense tech firms.

Autonomous drug subs are “a great example of how resilient cocaine traffickers are, and how they’re continuously one step ahead of authorities,” says one researcher.

Even worse, navies already act on only a fraction of their intelligence leads because they don’t have enough ships and aircraft. The answer, Knickerbocker argues, is “robot on robot.” Navies and coast guards will need swarms of their own small, relatively cheap uncrewed systems—surface vessels, underwater gliders, and long-endurance aerial vehicles that can loiter, sense, and relay data back to human operators. Those experiments have already begun. The US 4th Fleet, which covers Latin America and the Caribbean, is experimenting with uncrewed platforms in counternarcotics patrols. Across the Atlantic, the European Union’s European Maritime Safety Agency operates drones for maritime surveillance.

Today, though, the major screens against oceangoing vessels of all kinds are coastal radar networks. Spain operates SIVE to watch over choke points like the Strait of Gibraltar, and in the Pacific, Australia’s over-the-horizon radar network, JORN, can spot objects hundreds of miles away, far beyond the range of conventional radar.

Even so, it’s not enough to just spot an uncrewed narco sub. Law enforcement also has to stop it—and that will be tricky.

With a crewed vessel, Colombian doctrine says coast guard units should try to hail the boat first with lights, sirens, radio calls, and warning shots. If that fails, interceptor crews sometimes have to jump aboard and force the hatch. Officers worry that future autonomous craft could be wired to sink or even explode if someone gets too close. “If they get destroyed, we may lose the evidence,” says Víctor González Badrán, a navy captain and director of CMCON. “That means no seizure and no legal proceedings against that organization.”

That’s where electronic warfare enters the picture—radio-frequency jamming, cyber tools, perhaps more exotic options. In the simplest version, jamming means flooding the receiver with noise so that commands from the operator never reach the vessel. Spoofing goes a step further, feeding fake signals so that the sub thinks it’s somewhere else or obediently follows a fake set of waypoints. Cyber tools might aim higher up the chain, trying to penetrate the software that runs the vessel or the networks it uses to talk to satellite constellations. At the cutting edge of these countermeasures are electromagnetic pulses designed to fry electronics outright, turning a million-dollar narco sub into a dead hull drifting at sea.

In reality, the tools that might catch a future Tayrona sub are unevenly distributed, politically sensitive, and often experimental. Powerful cyber or electromagnetic tricks are closely guarded secrets; using them in a drug case risks exposing capabilities that militaries would rather reserve for wars. Systems like Australia’s JORN radar are tightly held national security assets, their exact performance specs classified, and sharing raw data with countries on the front lines of the cocaine trade would inevitably mean revealing hints as to how they got it. “Just because a capability exists doesn’t mean you employ it,” Knickerbocker says.

Analysts don’t think uncrewed narco subs will reshape the global drug trade, despite the technological leap. Trafficking organizations will still hedge their bets across those three variables, hiding cocaine in shipping containers, dissolving it into liquids and paints, racing it north in fast boats. “I don’t think this is revolutionary,” Shuldiner says. “But it’s a great example of how resilient cocaine traffickers are, and how they’re continuously one step ahead of authorities.”

There’s still that chance, though, that everything international law enforcement agencies know about drug smuggling is about to change. González Zamudio says he keeps getting requests from foreign navies, coast guards, and security agencies to come see the Tayrona sub. He greets their delegations, takes them out to the strip of grass on the base, and walks them around it, gives them tours. It has become a kind of pilgrimage. Everyone who makes it worries that the next time a narco sub appears near a distant coastline, they’ll board it as usual, force the hatch—and find it full of cocaine and gadgets, but without a single human occupant. And no one knows what happens after that.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The United States and the European Union grew into economic superpowers by committing climate atrocities. They have burned a wildly disproportionate share of the world’s oil and gas, planting carbon time bombs that will detonate first in the poorest, hottest parts of the globe.

Meanwhile, places like the Solomon Islands and Chad—low-lying or just plain sweltering—have emitted relatively little carbon dioxide, but by dint of their latitude and history, they rank among the countries most vulnerable to the fiercest consequences of global warming. That means increasingly devastating cyclones, heat waves, famines, and floods.

Morally, there’s an ironclad case that the countries or companies responsible for this mess should provide compensation for the homes that will be destroyed, the shorelines that will disappear beneath rising seas, and the lives that will be cut short. By one estimate, the major economies owe a climate debt to the rest of the world approaching $200 trillion in reparations.

Legally, though, the case has been far harder to make. Even putting aside the jurisdictional problems, early climate science couldn’t trace the provenance of airborne molecules of carbon dioxide across oceans and years. Deep-pocketed corporations with top-tier legal teams easily exploited those difficulties.

Now those tides might be turning. More climate-related lawsuits are getting filed, particularly in the Global South. Governments, nonprofits, and citizens in the most climate-exposed nations continue to test new legal arguments in new courts, and some of those courts are showing a new willingness to put nations and their industries on the hook as a matter of human rights. In addition, the science of figuring out exactly who is to blame for specific weather disasters, and to what degree, is getting better and better.

It’s true that no court has yet held any climate emitter liable for climate-related damages. For starters, nations are generally immune from lawsuits originating in other countries. That’s why most cases have focused on major carbon producers. But they’ve leaned on a pretty powerful defense.

While oil and gas companies extract, refine, and sell the world’s fossil fuels, most of the emissions come out of “the vehicles, power plants, and factories that burn the fuel,” as Michael Gerrard and Jessica Wentz, of Columbia Law School’s Sabin Center, note in a recent piece in Nature. In other words, companies just dig the stuff up. It’s not their fault someone else sets it on fire.

So victims of extreme weather events continue to try new legal avenues and approaches, backed by ever-more-convincing science. Plaintiffs in the Philippines recently sued the oil giant Shell over its role in driving Super Typhoon Odette, a 2021 storm that killed more than 400 people and displaced nearly 800,000. The case relies partially on an attribution study that found climate change made extreme rainfall like that seen in Odette twice as likely.

Overall, evidence of corporate culpability—linking a specific company’s fossil fuel to a specific disaster—is getting easier to find. For example, a study published in Nature in September was able to determine how much particular companies contributed to a series of 21st-century heat waves.

A number of recent legal decisions signal improving odds for these kinds of suits. Notably, a handful of determinations in climate cases before the European Court of Human Rights affirmed that states have legal obligations to protect people from the effects of climate change. And though it dismissed the case of a Peruvian farmer who sued a German power company over fears that a melting alpine glacier could destroy his property, a German court determined that major carbon polluters could in principle be found liable for climate damages tied to their emissions.

At least one lawsuit has already emerged that could test that principle: Dozens of Pakistani farmers whose land was deluged during the massive flooding events of 2022 have sued a pair of major German power and cement companies.

Even if the lawsuit fails, that would be a problem with the system, not the science. Major carbon-polluting countries and companies have a disproportionate responsibility for climate-change-powered disasters.

Wealthy nations continued to encourage business practices that pollute the atmosphere, even as the threat of climate change grew increasingly grave. And oil and gas companies remain the kingpin suppliers to a fossil-fuel-addicted world. They have operated with the full knowledge of the massive social, environmental, and human cost imposed by their business while lobbying fiercely against any rules that would force them to pay for those harms or clean up their act.

They did it. They knew. In a civil society where rule of law matters, they should pay the price.

            <div id="article-text">Google’s announcement that its Gemini app now writes music for you isn’t just one of those “blowing my mind” product updates. It feels like a symbolic surrender to a long-standing refrain from Big Tech: creative work is now just another checkbox for a machine.

If you don’t know what I am talking about, yesterday Google launched a new feature, Lyria 3, in the Gemini app, that allows us to cook up 30-second tracks complete with lyrics and cover art from a text prompt or a photo, of course, generated by Nano Banana; basically, no instruments, no experience, no pesky tactile skill required.

It’s essentially a LEGO set for “songs” that lasts about as long as a TikTok loop. They say it’s designed for YouTube Creators, and I tend to agree with them, because you can’t make to much with 30 seconds.

Still, the underlying problem is another one, as I am seeing different projects/songs made with AI, including AI artists. And this is what I want to highlight in this piece.

“Behind every beautiful thing, there’s some kind of pain, “ said Bob Dylan, and I could not agree more.

If we take a look at the history ( art, music, literature, poetry, and so on), the main fuel for creation was indeed pain.

Now, how should I put this? Probably the only pain that Lyria can feel is more like a faint server-overload alert than heartbreak.

Real songwriters know that soul isn’t born in a 30-second prompt, it’s extracted through years of mistakes, late nights, losses, and tiny revelations.

Call it a toy if you like. Google will, too.

They even watermark the outputs with a SynthID tag so the 30-second ditties are officially AI-generated, not “inspired.” That’s a nod to copyright concerns, but it also reads like an admission: these aren’t really art, they’re chemical by-products of pattern statistics.

What’s striking isn’t the novelty. Much of this has been possible in labs and APIs for years, and creators have been experimenting with generative music tools as collaborators.

What Lyria 3 does, and what makes this moment worth watching, is normalising the idea that anyone can “write” a song with a chatbot and a mood descriptor. That’s not empowerment; it’s a devaluation of craft.

Just because you pay a subscription to Suno, that’s another AI music generator, and that one is more complex, that doesn’t make you an artist or a singer. Just because you learn how to write a prompt for any LLM model and generates you pages, you are not a writer.

Imagine a world where every blog has AI-generated copy, not that we are not almost in the middle of this, and every company can churn out half-baked music for their ads or social posts.

In that economy, a professional songwriter’s unique skill becomes as optional as knowing how to use a metronome.

You could ask Gemini for an “emotional indie ballad about a lost sock,” and voilà, you have something. Whether it has actual coherence or soul is left to the listener to decide. It is fun to use it with your friends, shorts, to impress your date.

Still, Lyria 3’s music is capped at 30 seconds, and that’s no accident. It sidesteps deeper legal and ethical quarrels about training data and mimicry of existing works by keeping outputs short and legally fuzzy. That’s a thumbs up from me.

But even within that limit, it’s now possible for someone with no craft or cultural context to generate riffs, lyrics, and chord progressions that sound, to the casual ear, adequately musical. In an attention economy obsessed with shareability, “adequate” quickly becomes plenty.

This matters because real songs, the ones that endure, that carry human experience, aren’t just collections of musical atoms. They’re shaped by story, risk, cultural memory, and sometimes contradiction.

One of my favorite artists, Tom Waits, said, ”I don’t have a formal background. I learned from listening to records, from talking to people, from hanging around record stores, and hanging around musicians and saying, “Hey, how did you do that? Do that again. Let me see how you did that.”

This was the research and prompting before, and it’s not only about reducing time, or getting things faster, and “having more time for you.”

It’s about the entire process, the contact with other artists, humans, and IDEAS.

Those are qualities machines can mimic but not originate. When the machines own the first pass at creation, and the commercial ecosystem embraces that output because it is cheap and fast, the incentives shift. Not gradually. Suddenly.

The record industry is already grappling with AI. Streaming services, publishers, and even labels have begun experimenting with algorithmic playlists and automated composition.

What Gemini’s Lyria 3 does is extend that experiment to public perception. A whole generation may come to think that “making music” means typing a description and choosing a style. Songwriting becomes a UX problem, not a craft one.

That raises a serious question: in a world where AI can conjure up a half-decent hook on demand, what will distinguish professional artists?

If the answer is only brand story or marketing muscle, we aren’t celebrating creativity; we are monetising it out of existence.

Tech companies like Google will frame this as liberation. And in a literal sense, anyone who’s ever wanted to hear a short tune about a sock’s existential crisis now can. But liberation without value for the creator is just consumerism by another name.

Lyria 3 might be good for GIF soundtracks and social clips, and TikTok viral reels, but it doesn’t make professional musicians obsolete; it makes their work less necessary to the platforms that reward hyper-consumable content.

That’s a different threat from outright replacement: it’s obsolescence by trivialisation.

If AI is going to be part of musical creation, then let it be as an assistant to the composer,  someone who improves ideas, not replaces them. What we’re seeing with Gemini is not collaboration but outsourcing.

And the lesson for artists isn’t to fear the algorithm. It’s to insist on clarity about where AI replaces labour and where it augments human sensibility.

Because once the marketplace equates the two, the humans who do the work will be the ones left asking for royalties in a language no one else wants to speak.

And, as a personal recommendation, not sponsored, there are streaming platforms like Deezer that have built AI detection tools that flag and label AI-generated tracks, excluding them from recommendations and royalties so that human songwriters aren’t buried under synthetic spam, and consumers can make the difference between AI and human.

If you care about preserving real artistry in a world of text-to-tune generative models, start paying attention to how platforms handle AI-tagging and choose services that give you transparency about what you’re actually listening to.

Yet, I’m not here to throw shade at Lyria 3; if anything, the idea of letting people turn a photo or a mood into a short track sounds like fun for casual use and creative experimentation. It is what Google says it’s meant for.

Yet the reality is that as these models proliferate, we risk confusing novelty with art. And here, the big tech companies are not the ones to blame, but us.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Plato, a Berlin-based startup, has raised $14.5 million in seed funding to bring generative AI into wholesale distribution, a massive industry that rarely makes tech headlines but quietly moves a significant share of the world’s goods.

The round was led by Atomico, with Cherry Ventures, Discovery Ventures, and D11Z joining in.

Wholesale distribution accounts for roughly one-fifth of global production flows. Yet much of it still runs on aging ERP systems, Excel spreadsheets, and manual quoting workflows that haven’t meaningfully evolved in years.

While AI has flooded marketing, customer support, and coding, distribution sales teams are often still copy-pasting numbers between systems.

Plato’s thesis is simple: instead of adding another dashboard, embed AI directly into the operational core. The company connects to existing ERP systems and turns historical sales data into automated actions, flagging revenue opportunities, generating quotes, and identifying risks before they surface in quarterly reports.

The idea grew out of lived frustration. Co-founder Benedikt Nolte experienced the inefficiencies firsthand in his family’s distribution business. Generic CRM tools, he concluded, weren’t designed for the complexity of distributor operations. Plato was built specifically for that environment, not retrofitted from SaaS templates designed for startups.

Early traction suggests the industry is paying attention. Plato reportedly works with several large distributors on six-figure contracts, a sign that AI adoption in traditional sectors is less about hype and more about whether it can save time and unlock revenue.

The fresh capital will help Plato expand beyond sales intelligence into areas like procurement and customer service automation, while pushing into new European markets and eventually the U.S.

More broadly, the round highlights a shift in AI investing. The next wave isn’t just about bigger language models; it’s about embedding intelligence into industries that haven’t been rewritten by software yet. Wholesale distribution may not be glamorous, but it is structurally essential. If AI can modernize that layer of the economy, the impact will be far larger than another chatbot demo.

            <div id="article-text">David Silver, a British AI researcher known for his role at Google’s DeepMind lab, has helped build some of the most influential AI systems and is now leading his own ambitious start-up. He is in the middle of raising a $1 billion seed round for his new London-based venture, Ineffable Intelligence.

If the fundraising will be completed, would be the largest seed round ever seen in Europe.

The round is being led by Sequoia Capital, with titans such as Nvidia, Google and Microsoft reportedly in talks to participate, according to industry sources familiar with the deal.

The proposed investment would place Ineffable Intelligence’s pre-money valuation at around $4 billion, an eye-watering figure for a company that hasn’t yet shipped a product.

David Silver’s name is synonymous with some of the most memorable milestones in AI. During more than a decade at Google DeepMind, he helped develop AlphaGo, the first AI to defeat a world champion at the ancient game of Go, and later AlphaStar, which bested professional players in StarCraft II.

His work has shaped how modern AI systems learn and make decisions.

In late 2025, David Silver left DeepMind, where he also contributed to the development of the Gemini family of large language models, to launch Ineffable Intelligence. .

In the current days billion-dollar seed rounds are no longer unheard of, but they remain exceptionally rare, especially in Europe.

If Sequoia and its partners follow through on their commitments, the round would serve as both a vote of confidence in David Silver’s vision and a broader signal that venture capitalists are increasingly willing to fund ambitious, research-driven AI ventures well before traditional product milestone

The sheer size of the potential round also reshapes the narrative around Europe’s role in the global AI race.

Historically, most of the industry’s capital and rich technical talent have gravitated to Silicon Valley and other U.S. hubs. A £737 million-plus round led by a top U.S. investor shows that world-class AI ideas can still attract world-class capital in Europe.

David Silver’s dual role – as an entrepreneur and as a professor at University College London,  hints at a blend of academic ambition and commercial pressure that may define the next era of AI innovation.

His thesis suggests that the path to genuinely powerful AI may not be simply scaling up models, but teaching systems to learn and improve through real-world experience, a direction he believes could outpace approaches grounded solely in data accumulated from human interactions.

Whether Ineffable Intelligence ultimately delivers on its lofty vision remains to be seen.

But the enthusiasm around its fundraising reflects a broader trend: AI is entering a phase where conviction in founders and ideas can translate directly into unprecedented capital flows.

For Europe, a successful $1 billion cap table would be a milestone moment, not just financially, but symbolically,  in positioning the continent as a contender for the future of AI research and deployment.

            <div id="article-text">If you tuned in to China’s 2026 CCTV Spring Festival Gala looking for traditional lion dances and nostalgic tunes, you may have done a double-take when what greeted you was a squad of humanoid robots performing kung fu, synchronized moves, and comedy sketches with more precision than most of us manage during family reunions.

It was not just spectacle; it was industrial policy with flair

This year’s gala, which is China’s equivalent of the Super Bowl meets cultural heritage broadcast, featured everything from high-speed martial arts sequences to choreographed routines done by humanoid robots from leading local makers like Unitree Robotics, Galbot, MagicLab and Noetix.

Watching them flip, strike poses, and dance isn’t just futuristic entertainment; it’s a deliberate signal about where Chinese tech wants to sit at the global table.

Just last year, robot appearances were charming but clunky: think awkward “dances” that needed human help to keep upright.

Instead, this year, they executed complex actions; backflips, martial arts inspired routines, even comedic timing that was surprisingly sharp for machines. C

lips of the robots went viral almost immediately, flooding social platforms and dominating international tech feeds.

Chinese state media and commentators have leaned into the moment as proof of rapid progress in humanoid robotics, placing it squarely within China’s “AI+manufacturing” industrial ambitions.

While some viewers showered praise on the displays, others grumbled that the new lineup made the gala feel more like CES Lite than a cosy celebration of culture, and yes, robots “stealing the Year of the Horse thunder” is now a real complaint.

The optics are unmistakable. China’s robotics sector, already responsible for a lion’s share of worldwide humanoid robot production, is eager to tell a simple story: we don’t just build hardware in factories, we animate it with AI brainsthat can perform with finesse.

Whether it’s a crowd-pleasing kung fu sequence or a scripted comedy routine, these robots have become ambassadors of technological prowess on very prime cultural real estate.

But let’s not overstate their practical chops just yet. Despite impressive stage routines, robotics experts point out that most current humanoids are still best at pre-programmed movements and lack true autonomous adaptability in unpredictable environments.

In other words, they’re amazing performers on cue, not yet ready to be your personal caregiver or industrial line worker without a lot more training and development.

Still, the spectacle accomplishes something important: it thrusts humanoid robots into the public imagination while signalling to investors, startups and rival nations that robot development is now prime time tech theatre, not just a research lab curiosity.

Whether you see this as a fun blend of culture and innovation or a high-stakes display of national tech strategy, China’s robotics presence at the gala is now part of a broader conversation about where AI embodied in hardware might go next.

It’s less about whether robots will “replace us” and more about how they’re being introduced into narratives that billions of people watch together, shaping perceptions and expectations about the future.

China’s robots danced their way into billions of screens this Lunar New Year, and they did it with style, precision, and a well-timed cultural wink.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A Paris-based venture firm that has quietly shaped the quantum technology scenery is now making a much louder statement about Europe’s role in the future of computing, materials science, and sensing.

Quantonation Ventures has today announced the successful close of its second flagship fund at €220 million, more than double the size of its first vehicle and a clear signal that institutional capital is flowing into technologies grounded in physics, not just software.

Quantonation is not your typical venture capital firm. From its inception, it set out to invest in startups building real hardware and disruptive physics-based platforms, including quantum computing, sensing, communications, advanced materials, and what the industry calls “deep physics.”

The new Quantonation II fund attracted big names in institutional capital alongside strategic technology investors. Backers include the European Investment Fund, French public investor Bpifrance, Spanish construction and infrastructure group Grupo ACS, Denmark’s Novo Holdings, Japanese tech giant Toshiba, and Singapore-linked Vertex Holdings among others.

This mix of public and private capital reflects broader confidence in the potential of physics-based technologies to move beyond the research lab and into tangible commercial impact.

Where early quantum investing often centered on proof-of-concept breakthroughs, Quantonation’s strategy now emphasizes industrialization, scale, and products that customers, not just scientists, can use.

Quantonation’s expanded fund will target roughly 25 companies, writing larger checks and backing startups through earlier stages and scaling phases alike.

The portfolio already spans quantum computing hardware, advanced materials, sensing systems, and even components aimed at preparing infrastructure for widespread quantum deployment. Investments so far include:

This spread illustrates both a depth and a breadth of conviction: rather than betting on a single application, the fund’s investors are backing an ecosystem of physics-driven companies that could redefine multiple industries.

Despite this progress, Europe still trails the U.S. and China in private investment scale for quantum technologies, where large funding pools have helped local startups rapidly expand and commercialize.

The quantum revolution often gets discussed in terms of qubits and breakthrough physics. But investors and industry leaders increasingly see the future as one where quantum systems must integrate into real infrastructure, real supply chains, and real commercial stacks.

With €220 million under management, Quantonation is now one of the largest dedicated funds in its niche, a distinction that positions Europe more firmly in the global competition over next-generation computing and sensing.

What was once a cluster of scattered bets on niche technology now looks like a coherent wave of strategic investment. Europe isn’t just funding quantum anymore; it’s building a commercial ecosystem that might one day compete at scale with global rivals.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When European tech observers talk about AI ambition, the narrative often splits neatly in two: models and infrastructure. On one side are the clever bits of code that can write, reason, and generate text or images.

On the other is the gritty reality of making those bits run reliably, at scale, and in production. Today, Mistral AI made a move that bridges that divide.

The Paris-based AI upstart confirmed its first acquisition by agreeing to buy Koyeb, another French venture focused on serverless cloud infrastructure for AI workloads. The deal, terms were not disclosed, marks a clear signal: Mistral wants to own not just cutting-edge AI models, but also the infrastructure that delivers them to developers and enterprises.

Mistral has built momentum over the past two years with large language models that have put it in close competition with U.S. players. But for all the excitement around models, real-world adoption hinges on how those models are deployed and scaled.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Koyeb’s technology is built for exactly that: a serverless platform that lets developers run AI apps without managing the underlying infrastructure.

Think of it as giving Mistral not only the engine but also the transmission, the parts that take raw computational power and make it usable on demand. That’s a critical piece when companies want to ship AI solutions without hiring a team of DevOps experts.

This acquisition dovetails with a wider strategy playing out in Europe: build an AI stack that doesn’t depend on U.S. hyperscalers.

Mistral recently announced a €1.2 billion investment in data centers in Sweden and has been vocal about offering a homegrown alternative to cloud services from AWS, Microsoft, and Google.

By folding Koyeb’s team and platform into what they call Mistral Compute, the company is laying claim to a more complex AI offering – from model training to deployment and inference. In other words, it’s less about selling APIs and more about owning the full AI experience.

Koyeb’s roots are in serverless computing, scalable, managed infrastructure that lets developers forget about servers and focus on code. Its platform supports AI tasks across CPUs, GPUs, and specialized accelerators, with features like autoscaling and isolated environments for complex applications.

The founders and all 13 team members are joining Mistral’s engineering ranks, where they’ll shift focus toward embedding their technology into the Mistral Compute platform. For existing users of Koyeb’s services, the transition is designed to be smooth, with the platform continuing to operate as usual while integrating deeper over time.

In a market still heavily dominated by U.S. cloud providers, owning more of the AI value chain is both a business move and a geopolitical statement. This deal isn’t just about snapping up a smaller startup; it’s about signalling a shift in how European AI companies conceive of competition and capability.

One of the early questions about the future of AI wasn’t whether Europe could produce models that compete with those from Silicon Valley, it was whether it could build the platforms and systems those models truly depend on. With the Koyeb acquisition, Mistral is making a direct answer to that question.
