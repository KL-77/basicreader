            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Crew members traveling to the lunar surface on NASA’s Artemis missions should be gearing up for a grind. They will wear heavier spacesuits than those worn by the Apollo astronauts, and NASA will ask them to do more than the first Moonwalkers did more than 50 years ago.

The Moonwalking experience will amount to an “extreme physical event” for crews selected for the Artemis program’s first lunar landings, a former NASA astronaut told a panel of researchers, physicians, and engineers convened by the National Academies.

Kate Rubins, who retired from the space agency last year, presented the committee with her views on the health risks for astronauts on lunar missions. She outlined the concerns NASA officials often talk about: radiation exposure, muscle and bone atrophy, reduced cardiovascular and immune function, and other adverse medical effects of spaceflight.

Scientists and astronauts have come to understand many of these effects after a quarter-century of continuous human presence on the International Space Station. But the Moon is different in a few important ways. The Moon is outside the protection of the Earth’s magnetosphere, lunar dust is pervasive, and the Moon has partial gravity, about one-sixth as strong as the pull we feel on Earth.

Each of these presents challenges for astronauts living and working on the lunar surface, and their effects are amplified for crew members who venture outside for spacewalks. NASA selected Axiom Space, a Houston-based company, for a $228 million fixed-price contract to develop commercial pressurized spacesuits for the Artemis III mission, slated to be the first human landing mission on the Moon since 1972.

NASA hopes to fly the Artemis III mission by the end of 2028, but the schedule is in question. The readiness of Axiom’s spacesuits and the availability of new human-rated landers from SpaceX and Blue Origin are driving the timeline for Artemis III.

Rubins is a veteran of two long-duration spaceflights on the International Space Station, logging 300 days in space and conducting four spacewalks totaling nearly 27 hours. She is also an accomplished microbiologist and became the first person to sequence DNA in space.

“What I think we have on the Moon that we don’t really have on the space station that I want people to recognize is an extreme physical stress,” Rubins said. “On the space station, most of the time you’re floating around. You’re pretty happy. It’s very relaxed. You can do exercise. Every now and then, you do an EVA (Extravehicular Activity, or spacewalk).”

“When we get to the lunar surface, people are going to be sleep shifting,” Rubins said. “They’re barely going to get any sleep. They’re going to be in these suits for eight or nine hours. They’re going to be doing EVAs every day. The EVAs that I did on my flights, it was like doing a marathon and then doing another marathon when you were done.”

Rubins is now a professor of computational and systems biology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. She said treks on the Moon will be “even more challenging” than her spacewalks outside the ISS.

The Axiom spacesuit design builds on NASA’s own work developing a prototype suit to replace the agency’s decades-old Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMUs) used for spacewalks at the International Space Station (ISS). The new suits allow for greater mobility, with more flexible joints to help astronauts use their legs, crouch, and bend down—things they don’t have to do when floating outside the ISS.

Astronauts on the Moon also must contend with gravity. Including a life-support backpack, the commercial suit weighs more than 300 pounds in Earth’s gravity, but Axiom considers the exact number proprietary. The Axiom suit is considerably heavier than the 185-pound spacesuit the Apollo astronauts wore on the Moon. NASA’s earlier prototype exploration spacesuit was estimated to weigh more than 400 pounds, according to a 2021 report by NASA’s inspector general.

“We’ve definitely seen trauma from the suits, from the actual EVA suit accommodation,” said Mike Barratt, a NASA astronaut and medical doctor. “That’s everything from skin abrasions to joint pain to—no kidding—orthopedic trauma. You can potentially get a fracture of sorts. EVAs on the lunar surface with a heavily loaded suit and heavy loads that you’re either carrying or tools that you’re reacting against, that’s an issue.”

On paper, the Axiom suits for NASA’s Artemis missions are more capable than the Apollo suits. They can support longer spacewalks and provide greater redundancy, and they’re made of modern materials to enhance flexibility and crew comfort. But the new suits are heavier, and for astronauts used to spacewalks outside the ISS, walks on the Moon will be a slog, Rubins said.

“I think the suits are better than Apollo, but I don’t think they are great right now,” Rubins said. “They still have a lot of flexibility issues. Bending down to pick up rocks is hard. The center of gravity is an issue. People are going to be falling over. I think when we say these suits aren’t bad, it’s because the suits have been so horrible that when we get something slightly less than horrible, we get all excited and we celebrate.”

The heavier lunar suits developed for Artemis missions run counter to advice from former astronaut Harrison “Jack” Schmitt, who spent 22 hours walking on the Moon during NASA’s Apollo 17 mission in 1972.

“I’d have that go about four times the mobility, at least four times the mobility, and half the weight,” Schmitt said in a NASA oral history interview in 2000. “Now, one way you can… reduce the weight is carry less consumables and learn to use consumables that you have in some other vehicle, like a lunar rover. Anytime you’re on the rover, you hook into those consumables and live off of those, and then when you get off, you live off of what’s in your backpack. We, of course, just had the consumables in our backpack.”

NASA won’t have a rover on the first Artemis landing mission. That will come on a later flight. A fully pressurized vehicle for astronauts to drive across the Moon may be ready sometime in the 2030s. Until then, Moonwalkers will have to tough it out.

“I do crossfit. I do triathlons. I do marathons. I get out of a session in the pool in the NBL (Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory) doing the lunar suit underwater, and I just want to go home and take a nap,” Rubins told the panel. “I am absolutely spent. You’re bruised. This is an extreme physical event in a way that the space station is not.”

Barratt met with the same National Academies panel this week and presented a few hours before Rubins. The committee was chartered to examine how human explorers can enable scientific discovery at sites across the lunar surface. Barratt had a more favorable take on the spacesuit situation.

“This is not a commercial for Axiom. I don’t promote anyone, but their suit is getting there,” Barratt said. “We’ve got 700 hours of pressurized experience in it right now. We do a lot of tests in the NBL, and there are techniques and body conditioning that you do to help you get ready for doing things like this. Bending down in the suit is really not too bad at all.”

Rubins and Barratt did not discuss the schedule for when Axiom’s lunar spacesuit will be ready to fly to the Moon, but the conversation illuminated the innumerable struggles of spacewalking, Moonwalking, and the training astronauts undergo to prepare for extravehicular outings.

I spoke directly with Rubins after her discussion with the National Academies. Her last assignment at NASA was as chief of the EVA and robotics branch in the astronaut office, where she assisted in the development of the new lunar spacesuits. I asked about her experiences testing the lunar suit and her thoughts on how astronauts should prepare for Moonwalks.

“The suits that we have are definitely much better than Apollo,” Rubins said in the interview. “They were just big bags of air. The joints aren’t in there, so it was harder to move. What they did have going for them was that they were much, much lighter than our current spacesuits. We have added a lot of the joints back, and that does get some mobility for us. But at the end of the day, the suits are still quite heavy.”

You can divide the weight of the suit by six to get an idea of how it might feel to carry it around on the lunar surface. While it won’t feel like 300 pounds, astronauts will still have to account for their mass and momentum.

Instead of kind of floating in microgravity and moving your mass around with your hands and your arms, now we’re ambulating. We’re walking with our legs. You’re going to have more strain on your knees and your hips. Your hamstrings, your calves, and your glutes are going to come more into play.

I think, overall, it may be a better fit for humans physically because if you ask somebody to do a task, I’m going to be much better at a task if I can use my legs and I’m ambulating. Then I have to pull myself along with my arms… We’re not really built to do that, but we are built to run and to go long distances. Our legs are just such a powerful force.

So I think there are a lot of things lining up that are going to make the physiology easier. Then there are things that are going to be different because we’re we’re now in a partial gravity environment. We’re going to be bending, we’re going to be twisting, we’re going to be doing different things.

It’s an incredibly hard engineering challenge. You have to keep a human alive in absolute vacuum, warm at temperatures that you know in the polar regions could go as far down as 40 Kelvin (minus 388° Fahrenheit). We haven’t sent humans anywhere that cold before. They are also going to be very hot. They’re going to be baking in the sunshine. You’ve got radiation. If you put all that together, that’s a huge amount of suit material just to keep the human physiology and the human body intact.

Then our challenge is ‘how do you make that mobile?’ It’s very difficult to bend down and pick up a rock. You have to manage that center of gravity because you’re wearing that big life support system on your back, a big pack that has a lot of mass in it, so that brings your center of gravity higher than you’re used to on Earth and a little bit farther backward.

When you move around, it’s like wearing a really, really heavy backpack that has mass but no weight, so it’s going to kind of tip you back. You can do some things with putting weights on the front of the suit to try to move that center of gravity forward, but it’s still higher, and it’s not exactly at your center of mass that you’re used to on the Earth. On the Earth, we have a center of our mass related to gravity, and nobody ever thinks about it, and you don’t think about it until it moves somewhere else, and then it makes all of your natural motion seem very difficult.

Those are some of the challenges that we’re facing engineering-wise. I think the new suits, they’ve gone a long way toward addressing these, but it’s still a hard engineering challenge. And I’m not talking about any specific suit. I can’t talk about the details of the provider’s suits. This is the NASA xEMU and all the lunar suits I have tested over the years. That includes the Mark III suit, the Axiom suit. They have similar issues. So this isn’t really anything about a specific vendor. These are just the difficulties of designing a spacesuit for the lunar environment.

NASA trains astronauts for spacewalks in the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, an enormous pool in Houston used for simulating weightlessness. They also use a gravity-offloading device to rehearse the basics of spacewalking. The optimal test environment, short of the space environment itself, will be aboard parabolic flights, where suit developers and astronauts can get the best feel for the suit’s momentum, according to Rubins.

Axiom and NASA are well along assessing the new lunar spacesuit’s performance underwater, but they haven’t put it through reduced-gravity flight testing. “Until you get to the actual parabolic flight, that’s when you can really test the ability to manage this momentum,” Rubins said.

Recovering from a fall on the lunar surface comes with its own perils.

“You’re face down on the lunar surface, and you have to do the most massive, powerful push up to launch you and the entire mass of the suit up off the surface, high enough so you can then flip your legs under you and catch the ground,” Rubins said. “You basically have to kind of do a jumping pushup… This is a risky maneuver we test a whole bunch in training. It’s really non-trivial.”

The lunar suits are sleeker than the suits NASA uses on the ISS, but they are still bulky. “If you’re trying to kneel, if you’re thinking about bending forward at your waist, all that material in your waist has nowhere to go, so it just compresses and compresses,” Rubins said. “That’s why I say it’s harder to kneel. It’s harder to bend forward because you’re having to compress the suit in those areas.

“We’ve done these amazing things with joint mobility,” Rubins said. “The mobility around the joints is amazing… but now we’re dealing with this compression issue. And there’s not an obvious engineering fix to that.”

The fix to this problem might come in the form of tools instead of changes to the spacesuit itself. Rubins said astronauts could use a staff, or something like a hiking pole, to brace themselves when they need to kneel or bend down. “That way I’m not trying to compress the suit and deal with my balance at the same time.”

The Moonwalker suit can comfortably accommodate a wider range of astronauts than NASA’s existing EMUs on the space station. The old EMUs can be resized to medium, large, and extra large, but that leaves gaps and makes the experience uncomfortable for a smaller astronaut. This discomfort is especially noticeable while practicing for spacewalks underwater, where the tug of gravity is still present, Rubins said.

“As a female, I never really had an EMU that fit me,” Rubins said. “It was always giant. When I’m translating around or doing something, I’m physically falling and slamming myself, my chest or my back, into one side of the suit or the other underwater, whereas with the lunar suit, I’ve got a suit that fits me right. That’s going to lead to less bruising. Just having a suit that fits you is much better.”

Mission planners should also emphasize physical conditioning for astronauts assigned to lunar landing missions. That includes preflight weight and endurance training, plus guidance on what to eat in space to maximize energy levels before astronauts head outside for a stroll.

“That human has to go up really maximally conditioned,” Rubins said.

Rubins and Barratt agreed that NASA and its spacesuit provider should be ready to rapidly respond to feedback from future Moonwalkers. Engineers modified and upgraded the Apollo spacesuits in a matter of months, iterating the design between each mission.

“Our general design is on a good path,” Rubins said. “We need to make sure that we continue to push for increasing improvements in human performance, and some of that ties back to the budget. Our first suit design is not where we’re going to be done if we want to do a really sustained lunar program. We have to continue to improve, and I think it’s important to recognize that we’re going to learn so many lessons during Artemis III.”

Barratt has a unique perspective on spacesuit design. He has performed spacewalks at the ISS in NASA’s spacesuit and the Russian Orlan spacesuit. Barratt said the US suit is easier to work in than the Orlan, but the Russian suit is “incredibly reliable” and “incredibly serviceable.”

“It had a couple of glitches, and literally, you unzip a curtain and it’s like looking at my old Chevy Blazer,” Barratt said. “Everything is right there. It’s mechanical, it’s accessible with standard tools. We can fix it. We can do that really easily. We’ve tried to incorporate those lessons learned into our next-generation EVA systems.”

Contrast that with the NASA suits on the ISS, where one of Barratt’s spacewalks in 2024 was cut short by a spacesuit water leak. “We recently had to return a suit from the space station,” Barratt said. “We’ve got another one that’s sort of offline for a while we’re troubleshooting it. It’s a really subtle problem that’s extremely difficult to work on in places that are hard to access.”

Harrison Schmitt, speaking with a NASA interviewer in 2000, said his productivity in the Apollo suit “couldn’t have been much more than 10 percent of what you would do normally here on Earth.”

“You take the human brain, the human eyes, and the human hands into space. That’s the only justification you have for having human beings in space,” Schmitt said. “It’s a massive justification, but that’s what you want to use, and all three have distinct benefits in productivity and in gathering new information and infusing data over any automated system. Unfortunately, we have discarded one of those, and that is the hands.”

Schmitt singled out the gloves as the “biggest problem” with the Apollo suits. “The gloves are balloons, and they’re made to fit,” he said. Picking something up with a firm grip requires squeezing against the pressure inside the suit. The gloves can also damage astronauts’ fingernails.

“That squeezing against that pressure causes these forearm muscles to fatigue very rapidly,” Schmitt said. “Just imagine squeezing a tennis ball continuously for eight hours or ten hours, and that’s what you’re talking about.”

Barratt recounted a conversation in which Schmitt, now 90, said he wouldn’t have wanted to do another spacewalk after his three excursions with commander Gene Cernan on Apollo 17.

“Physically, and from a suit-maintenance standpoint, he thought that that was probably the limit, what they did,” Barratt said. “They were embedded with dust. The visors were abraded. Every time they brushed the dust off the visors, they lost visibility.”

Getting the Artemis spacesuit right is vital to the program’s success. You don’t want to travel all the way to the Moon and stop exploring because of sore fingers or an injured knee.

“If you look at what we’re spending on suits versus what we’re spending on the rocket, this is a pretty small amount,” Rubins said. “Obviously, the rocket can kill you very quickly. That needs to be done right. But the continuous improvement in the suit will get us that much more efficiency. Saving 30 minutes or an hour on the Moon, that gives you that much more science.”

“Once you have safely landed on the lunar surface, this is where you got to put your money,” Barratt said.</div>

            <div id="article-text">A decade is a long time for a TV series; no single iteration of Star Trek has made it that far.

But “a Star Trek podcast by two guys just a little bit embarrassed to have a Star Trek podcast” has now passed the milestone. January 25, 2026, marks a full decade since The Greatest Generation, my favorite podcast, debuted. Like a bottle of Château Picard, the show has only improved with age. (I interviewed the guys behind the show back in 2016 when they were just getting started.)

The podcast helped me rediscover, and appreciate more fully, Star Trek: The Next Generation—which is also my favorite TV show. The Greatest Generation continues to delight with its irreverent humor, its celebration of the most minor of characters, and its technical fascination with how a given episode was made.

Over the last decade, hosts Ben Harrison and Adam Pranica have both moved to Los Angeles and become full-time podcasters. They have completed an episode-by-episode recap of all of The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager, and they’re now nearing the end of Enterprise. When finished, they’re threatening/promising to start over again.

The podcast has spawned its own (sometimes NSFW!) lexicon (a “friend of DeSoto” means a listener to and fan of The Greatest Generation), its own recurring and hilarious segments (“Drunk Shimoda,” “Bad Bit Moment,” and “Polo? Polo? Or Pollo?”), and most importantly, its own delightful fandom. It’s the coolest and dorkiest secret club that I will ever be a part of.

In 2016, the podcast was folded into the Maximum Fun organization. Harrison and Pranica formed their own company, Uxbridge-Shimoda LLC, that takes its name from two obscure TNG-era characters.

Like the original Star Trek, the podcast even spawned its own 2017 spinoff—now called The Greatest Trek—entirely devoted to the newer series in the Star Trek universe.

Harrison and Pranica also produce two irregularly released, members-only podcasts called Santa Monica Mountains (about the 1980s and 1990s TV show Baywatch) and Factory Seconds (where they eat at various Cheesecake Factory restaurants). Last year, they also started—in conjunction with YouTube cooking star Adam Ragusea—yet another podcast, called Wholesome, which is only available to Patreon subscribers.

In a world replete with chaos and awfulness, I’m just here for the hang.

(This interview, which was conducted earlier this month, has been lightly edited for clarity and flow.)

Ars: When I first spoke to you guys back in 2016, Adam was living in Seattle. Ben, I believe you were living in New York. You guys were still working in film production. As best as I could tell, this was just a fun little side project. Who knew how long it would run?

Ben: I think that us talking to you has a lot to do with it taking over our lives.

Ars: Sorry, not sorry? I don’t know! [laughs]

Adam: Your Ars article was one of the reasons we catapulted into the sort of audience we got afterward. It’s an audience that has meant we’ve been able to do the show professionally for 10 years.

Ben: Yeah. And when we meet people—all the time—people will say: “Oh, I’ve been listening to you guys since the beginning. Like, I was on at episode five because of that Ars Technica article.”

Ars: Do you feel like you are over it? It’s been a decade now. Is Greatest Gen as we know it going to continue?

Adam: I think the thing that’s changed is that in the beginning, it felt like a fun hobby. But when you professionalize a thing and you hire employees and you are depended on for the thing that you make in a way that you’ve never been before, it’s serious business.

This is the best job I’ve ever had, but it’s also the most seriously I’ve ever taken a job because it means so much to our well-being, but also the folks who appreciate what we do.

Ben: Yeah, one thing that Adam has said many times is we’re going to die in these chairs.

And I think also, as we come toward the end of Enterprise and have sort of run out of the well of Old Trek, as it were, I have been thinking about [what] if I hadn’t had this show? I would still be about ready to start my next TNG rewatch.

Loving Star Trek is a lot about watching it over again, you know? In the same way that I’ll put on an old rerun of The Simpsons or Seinfeld. And I love rewatching those shows. I love rewatching Star Trek.

I think Adam and I have grown as both a comedy duo but also as observers of Star Trek and what it means on an ongoing basis. So I feel like it would be unfair for us not to go back and start painting the bridge from the beginning.

Adam: I think one of the things that we’ve learned from doing the show, especially live in front of people, is that we are told by the people who enjoy this show that it’s about Star Trek, sure, but that’s not the thing that people love the most about the show.

And I think that’s what makes a return to the beginning of it make so much sense in the way Ben’s describing. It’s about the hang and your life as it relates to a Star Trek rerun that you’re watching in that moment.

Ars: I have watched zero minutes of Baywatch in my life. But I have listened to every single episode of the Santa Monica Mountains. I enjoy hearing you guys talk about it.

I think you’ve hit on a format: “Let’s talk about a thing in the way that we like to talk about it and make jokes in the way that we like to make jokes about it.” Which for me really resonates more than the format of a podcast that’s like: “Let’s get comedians to talk about a thing.”

Adam: Or let’s get celebrities in a room to talk about anything and have that be good enough.

Ben: The format that our shows tend to follow is something that I think just kind of was an emergent property of the way Adam and I talked to each other, much more so than it was us attempting to create a show that was our version of anything else.

I don’t really listen to other recap podcasts. It’s kind of a funny thing, but we weren’t really inspired by any recap podcasts in particular. I guess the Flop House a little bit for me, but what they do is so different and such its own thing.

It’s hard to feel like we are connected to the universe of recap podcasts. Like when we go to add our show to a podcast service like iTunes or Apple Podcasts, you have to pick the category that you’re going to be in, and we’ve always picked comedy.

Properly, I guess we probably would be in the television recap podcast section. We just never really thought of ourselves as being that. We were just doing what we wanted to do.

You know, we’re just making a show that makes us laugh. Making each other laugh has always been the primary goal of the show.  So it’s very funny to me that we’re in a category that we’ve never really aspired to be in or compared ourselves to in any way.

Ars: Any favorite moments, perhaps at live shows, that have happened to you over the last 10 years?

Ben: Getting to do live shows at all has been a total shock to me. When we talked to you for that first article, we barely knew what we were doing as entertainers. And I’ve taken improv classes and stuff but never really had any personal aspirations to be someone who gets up on a stage and does something. And I found that I fucking love it!

I really love doing the show in front of an audience! And we just have had so many amazing adventures getting to go all over the country doing that.

And all over the world—we’ve done the show in Canada and London now. That was a total surprise to me.

Like, if you grabbed me on the street 15 years ago and said, “Hey, you’re going to have a show that you get to travel around and do in front of audiences of 300 people someday!” I would have said, “Get the hell out of here! That’s not possible. That’s not something I am working toward in any way.”

Adam: There’s an unexpected quality to the type of—I mean, barf, right? I’m going to say the word “celebrity.” But David Letterman said that when you achieve a certain amount of notoriety, the world becomes a neighborhood to you.

A week ago, I was at a bar with friends, and a stranger came up and told me that they really like our show and they thanked me for making it. And that is something that happens in my life in a way that I never could have anticipated at all.

It’s those little moments that you have with people. Those perfect interactions where it’s just like: “I like what you do and thanks for doing it.”

That makes my life seem meaningful in a way that any previous job did not create the conditions for, you know? You do the work and you think it matters and it’s important, and largely it is in its own way, in its own ecosystem.

But to have a broad interest from folks in what you do and that it matters to them and what they do in their lives? That’s the very best part of this entire thing: knowing that the times that I can make Ben laugh are also the times that I can make 500 people laugh in a room or 25,000 people laugh on a Monday when the episode drops, you know?

That’s really powerful stuff! And it keeps me on my best behavior when I’m out in public in case an FOD is out there watching what I’m doing.

Ben: Oh, yeah. You don’t want to see all the videos of Adam on Worldstar.

Ars: You try really hard to make the show sound great, which it does. It is well-engineered. It is well mixed. You guys put a lot of care into the production of the show.

But also, to my knowledge, you have never missed a show’s publish date. I’m curious about how you balance all of that with whatever else is going on in your lives. Ben, you have two young kids. I know Adam has martinis to drink and golf to play.

Ben: I think the best thing that has happened to us as a duo over the years has been all of the people who have been here to help us along the way.

You know, for a while, we were working with a producer named Rob Schulte, who was really great. And we’re now very fortunate to have a full-time producer named Wynde Priddy, who is so good at anticipating things that are coming up and keeping our minds on what we need to be prepping for the future. And also taking all of the stuff off of our plate that involves the day-in, day-out of editing and producing the shows.

So when it’s all running as it should be, which is most of the time—Adam and I get to focus on prepping, sitting down and recording, and then listening back to basically finished episodes. At that point, we’re just pitching jokes. Like: “Hey, we could add a little audio here to illustrate this point or whatever.” But 90 percent of the time we listen to an episode that’s pretty much ready to go and are just signing off on it for Wynde.

I think that the logistics of making this are complex in some ways. But at its core, it’s just me and Adam having to watch a TV show and then talk to each other about it. And that period of the day, that period of the week where I’m talking to my buddy about a thing we both really love is still the best part of my week.

Adam: We’ve been doing this for 10 years. If you need to take some time off, we know about it usually a month before, and we prepare for it. We know that we record two or three or four episodes a week, every week.

We know that if one of us gets sick, we will have to record more than that in a given week. And I think part of it is if you know that’s what your life is, it’s not stressful or disappointing when that’s your responsibility. That’s just what it takes.

We were both in alignment right away initially that you cannot miss a week doing this because people depend on it for the rhythm of their own weeks. But also, be a fucking professional! Are you telling me you don’t have an afternoon in a given week to do the thing that you’re doing professionally? Get out of here. Of course you do! Find a way.

And this is why, when people over the years have told us, “I really want to do a podcast,” the first advice is: “The same time, the same day, every week. Forever.” And that’s the only advice I give because if you can do that for a year and you ask me what else you need to do, then we can have that conversation.

But if you’re not willing to be a pro like that, good luck. I doubt your ability to get traction with an audience, because I think so much depends on that.

Ben: The podcasts that I listen to throughout the week are something I really look forward to—those shows being there at that time when I do the thing that I do when I listen to them. And so we’ve been very lucky to burrow under the skin of a lot of people—

Adam: I wonder if that’s how we know, Ben? Like, we’re not just the president of Hair Club, we’re also the clients? I think we know what’s meaningful to a podcast listener because we are them ourselves. In a way, I feel like nouveau podcasting right now is often made up of hosts who are doing it because it’s lucrative in their niche, you know?

Ben: Wait, this can be lucrative? Shit, what have we been doing?

Ars:  I’m at a place in my life right now—and maybe you guys are, too—where I find it very hard to emotionally engage with the news. I find myself turning off the news on the radio, on my phone, in ways that I didn’t three years ago, five years ago. I used to be hyper-on: all the news, all the things, all the time. And I just can’t now. I just want to hear some guys talk about martinis.

Ben, you mentioned earlier that this is a show about the hang, and it’s sort of loosely anchored around the thing that you love, Star Trek.

Do you have that same feeling when it’s chatting with Adam Pranica about Baywatch? Does the subject for you, both of you, matter at all? Or does Star Trek have a particular emotional resonance in a way that, you know, lawns don’t?

Ben: I think that the Trek of it all is still really important to the show. And I think that we’re in an era where the news is devastating and exhausting in equal measure, and, you know, Trek has a lot of politics in it.

Adam and I share a lot of politics, but we also, I think, are pretty conscious of this being a place where the horrors of the world aren’t the center of attention.

So we’ve been pretty intentional about trying to make a thing that is a refuge and not a giant bummer.

And I think in its own way, that is an act of defiance. Still being able to have the hang despite all of the horrific shit going on is a sort of powerful statement—no, we’re not going to be ground into bummer pulp.

Adam: Yeah, I agree. I mean, I’m not interested in introducing that into our programs at all. I think a person’s politics is largely their behavior, and I don’t want to compare the things that I’m watching to the things that are happening in the real world generally.

But I think I might take a different side than Ben, about how Star Trek-located the project needs to be for it to be—I don’t know—fun or enriching.

I think those other projects, whether they’re about Baywatch or food or whatever—I’m interested in interesting conversations that are challenging or comedically interesting to me. It largely doesn’t matter what the subject is at its core. I want to be the sort of person that could make anything funny in conversation and through our various other types of shows, that’s become the truth, I hope.

Ben: That’s very fair. I still sort of think it’s the on-ramp for a lot of people. Like, oh, yeah, I like Star Trek. I’ll give that a try. And then it becomes about more than that.

Ultimately, I couldn’t make a show with Adam Pranica and Adam Ragusea if I wasn’t delighted by their perspective on things on an ongoing basis. The thing that’s amazing about this is we’ve made 600-something episodes of The Greatest Generation and 300-something episodes of Greatest Trek and dozens and dozens of episodes of Wholesome, and Adam says stuff every single time we sit down that surprises and delights me. That’s a complete magic trick.

Adam: You can’t do this for 10 years if it’s a bummer-hate show with a bunch of politics in it. That would have been exhausting nine years ago, you know? I don’t listen to any news or politics podcasts. Why would you? Look for the light where you can find it.

Ars: Going back to our original interview, you guys didn’t have very much in the way of established bits and jokes in the way that you do now.

I’m looking here at the Wikia and there’s a long list of bits and phrases: 50-year-old Ensign. Anybody Canyon. Bangers. Ball-kicking machine. Big Rod. McLaughlin Group. Miriam. Mount Armis. Natural Yeager.

Do you feel like any bits are played out? As I read through this, I’m like, “Oh yeah, I totally forgot about ‘Fuck Bokai.’ That’s pretty funny!”

Ben: Oh man, Fuck Bokai. That may have been the high-water mark! I think that one of the cool things about some of these is that they sort of ebb and flow depending on what we’re covering, you know?

There were things that were kind of jokes that stayed within the confines of Deep Space Nine or Voyager that sometimes you get an idea and you can pull one out of the cold storage.

But often the group of active working runners is very influenced by what we are actively covering. I think it’ll be very interesting to see how that long list of old inside jokes interacts with the show when we start going back through the second time.

Because I’m kind of tempted to not reference any of that stuff. I don’t know. I will have to see what happens when we start doing it.

Adam: I feel the same way, Ben. I think we don’t do a bit just because it’s “time to do the bit.” I have felt for a long time that it’s not funny if you’re trying to be funny. If we choose to turn it around and go back from the beginning—these are going to be new experiences for the time that we record them.

And they’re going to feel brand new. I wouldn’t expect a retread of much of anything. Because that doesn’t sound funny to me.

Ben: Well, also 10 years older. Our lives are different. Our world is different.

We will see new things in the show. And that’s one of the things that’s so cool about Star Trek: I feel like I experience it in new ways each time I watch it. So I think it’s kind of inevitable that it will get something that is really different and novel. And maybe some of those old runners will find their way back because they happen to be the funny thing at that moment.

But generally speaking, I’m really excited for crumpling up the paper and throwing it away and writing something fresh, you know?

Adam: Cyrus, you mentioned the Wiki, and I just want to say, one of the best things that’s happened to us over the 10 years of making the show has been the community that formed around it to do things, like making the wiki, making the Discord, that have formed groups where they watch movies together and date each other and marry each other and whatever.

This is a thing that we didn’t intend—imagine doing a thing so important that a large audience would enjoy it—but this large audience has their own lives, and they’re enjoying this thing that we do completely separate from us in their own way.

In a way, that’s great. Neither Ben nor I have the time or the inclination to make a wiki about our show, for example. And yet the folks that put in the effort here to make the experience of listening to the show better for everyone—that’s selfless and good and appreciated.

Ars: Given that there’s such a large body of work that you guys have produced, do you ever get people asking: “You guys have done a thousand episodes. Where do I start?”

I’ll give my answer first. I always tell people who are Star Trek fans but who have maybe not listened to Greatest Gen, “Choose a Star Trek episode that you love or that is memorable to you in some way and listen to the podcast episode about that episode.”

Ben: I like that, too. I also get the question “Oh, you know a lot about Star Trek. I want to get my kid into it. Where should we start?” And I don’t really think that there’s a right answer to that kind of question. Like, going back to the beginning doesn’t necessarily work for me or doesn’t necessarily work as an answer for everybody.

So I like the suggestion to jump in somewhere where you feel like you’ve got some fluency, but I also think it’s totally cool to jump in midstream on the show now or, you know, start at the beginning of one of the series that you really like or jump around. We hear from people that do it all different kinds of ways.

We’ve heard from people who got into the Greatest Generation because of Greatest Trek. We’ve heard from people who started listening to the Greatest Generation and were like: “Well, there’s a lot of references to old stuff in here. So I better go back and listen from the beginning.”

And then they binge the entire thing in three months. And I’m concerned that there may be some kind of exposure toxicity!

Adam: It’s an interesting quality to consider because a lot of the podcasts I listen to are about sports, and the sports that just happened over the weekend. No one listens to that show a month after it comes out.

But 10 years of our conversations are still being listened to in a way that I feel [isn’t the case] if you’re podcasting about the football game.

Ben: As many things as we’ve done in the past of the show, they stay in the present for a lot of people—I think more than half of our downloads in a given week are old episodes.

So that is a place where people hang out, and I think a lot of people that have jobs where they’re working with their hands but they don’t need to be processing language—[they] love podcasts. So we hear from a lot of graphic designers and truckers who like the show.

And that huge back catalog is such a boon to them because by the time you’re on your second listen through, you’re not going to remember exactly how the bit went from episode 324. So the comedy works again for that person.

Ars: I presume you guys have received screeners for Starfleet Academy. How are you feeling about Starfleet Academy as a show? And how are you guys feeling about doing it for your own show?

Ben: I’ve watched two episodes now. And I remain pretty optimistic about Starfleet Academy as a show. I think that there is some melancholy to it being the only one that’s actively being made now of any of the shows. I think they’ve wrapped on Strange New Worlds, even though they haven’t released season four. And none of the others are, like, in production at this point.

Adam: I’m also two episodes in—two very long episodes. I think that one of the qualities to Starfleet Academy that’s been surprising is the hour-long nature of it.

I think many years ago I coined the phrase “Star Trek is a place.” And what that means definitionally is that it’s not a ship or a particular captain or a planet or a federation. It’s a place to tell stories.

That’s just my way of saying that Starfleet Academy at this point, two episodes in, feels like the expression of that idea. Like, Starfleet Academy exists in a place that is Star Trek.

So I don’t hate it because they put out a cheesy poster. I don’t hate it at all! I am enjoying what I’ve seen so far. It’s interesting and new. I think the feeling that I have about it is something that Ben touched on a little bit there, which was like, are we getting near the end of it? Are we going to go back into the desert of ten years without Star Trek?

I hope not because I think my preference is going to always be that I would rather have Star Trek even if it’s difficult or disliked by folks or whatever, than to go without it at all because it provokes thought. I mean, even when it’s not your Star Trek, I think it’s still fun to talk about.

Ars: One of your greatest wishes—maybe the greatest wish of your lives—is to be blown out of an airlock in a new episode of Star Trek. How close are we to seeing that on screen?

Ars: Have you actually pitched this to somebody who could make it happen?

Ben: There are people inside the walled garden that are aware that a lot of people are invested in this idea. And yeah, it’s happened in comics, it’s happened in fan productions several times now.

We leap at every opportunity we have to get blown out of an airlock. If and when the call comes from inside the Star Trek house, it will be the thrill of a lifetime. That remains the overarching goal of the show, I would say.

We’ve gone so far as to say that if the offer is made, we will fly ourselves to Toronto. If [Paramount is] obligated by some kind of agreement with the union to pay us, we will donate that money to a charity.

This is not about fame or fortune for us. It is about getting blown out of an airlock, which…

Adam: It’s about finally experiencing the sweet, sweet peace of death.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/wiper-malware-targeted-poland-energy-grid-but-failed-to-knock-out-electricity/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Researchers on Friday said that Poland’s electric grid was targeted by wiper malware, likely unleashed by Russia state hackers in an attempt to disrupt electricity delivery operations.

A cyberattack, Reuters reported, occurred during the last week of December. The news organization said it was aimed at disrupting communications between renewable installations and the power distribution operators but failed for reasons not explained.

On Friday, security firm ESET said the malware responsible was a wiper, a type of malware that permanently erases code and data stored on servers with the goal of destroying operations completely. After studying the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in the attack, company researchers said the wiper was likely the work of a Russian government hacker group tracked under the name Sandworm.

“Based on our analysis of the malware and associated TTPs, we attribute the attack to the Russia-aligned Sandworm APT with medium confidence due to a strong overlap with numerous previous Sandworm wiper activity we analyzed,” said ESET researchers. “We’re not aware of any successful disruption occurring as a result of this attack.”

Sandworm has a long history of destructive attacks waged on behalf of the Kremlin and aimed at adversaries. Most notable was one in Ukraine in December 2015. It left roughly 230,000 people without electricity for about six hours during one of the coldest months of the year. The hackers used general-purpose malware known as BlackEnergy to penetrate power companies’ supervisory control and data acquisition systems and, from there, activate legitimate functionality to stop electricity distribution. The incident was the first known malware-facilitated blackout.

ESET said the attack targeting Poland occurred on the 10th anniversary of that event. The security firm provided few other details about the attack other than the malware used has been dubbed DynoWiper.

Custom wipers have long been a preferred tool for Russian hackers. In 2022, government attackers used wiper malware dubbed AcidRain to knock out 270,000 satellite modems in Ukraine in an attempt to disrupt communications. At the time, it was the seventh wiper Russia had used since invading the neighboring country. ESET said last year that Sandworm had unleashed multiple wipers on universities and critical infrastructure in Ukraine.

The best known case of Russia’s use of wipers came in 2017 with the release of NotPetya. The destructive worm was intended to target only Ukraine, but quickly spread around the world and wreaked havoc as it disrupted computer operations. The event is estimated to have cost governments and businesses $10 billion, making it likely the most expensive computer intrusion in history.

There is no indication how or why DynoWiper failed to take out power. It’s possible Russia planned it to do so in an attempt to send a message without provoking Polish allies. Another possibility is that cyber defenses prevented the wiper from working as intended.</div>

            <h2>Did Edison accidentally make graphene in 1879?</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/did-edison-accidentally-make-graphene-in-1879/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Graphene is the thinnest material yet known, composed of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice. That structure gives it many unusual properties that hold great promise for real-world applications: batteries, super capacitors, antennas, water filters, transistors, solar cells, and touchscreens, just to name a few. The physicists who first synthesized graphene in the lab won the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics. But 19th century inventor Thomas Edison may have unknowingly created graphene as a byproduct of his original experiments on incandescent bulbs over a century earlier, according to a new paper published in the journal ACS Nano.

“To reproduce what Thomas Edison did, with the tools and knowledge we have now, is very exciting,” said co-author James Tour, a chemist at Rice University. “Finding that he could have produced graphene inspires curiosity about what other information lies buried in historical experiments. What questions would our scientific forefathers ask if they could join us in the lab today? What questions can we answer when we revisit their work through a modern lens?”

Edison didn’t invent the concept of incandescent lamps; there were several versions predating his efforts. However, they generally had a very short life span and required high electric current, so they weren’t well suited to Edison’s vision of large-scale commercialization. He experimented with different filament materials starting with carbonized cardboard and compressed lampblack. This, too, quickly burnt out, as did filaments made with various grasses and canes, like hemp and palmetto. Eventually Edison discovered that carbonized bamboo made for the best filament, with life spans over 1,200 hours using a 110 volt power source.

Lucas Eddy, Tour’s  grad student at Rice, was trying to figure out ways to mass produce graphene using the smallest, easiest equipment he could manage, with materials that were both affordable and readily available. He considered such options as arc welders and natural phenomena like lightning striking trees—both of which he admitted were “complete dead ends.” Edison’s light bulb, Eddy decided, would be ideal, since unlike other early light bulbs, Edison’s version was able to achieve the critical 2,000° C temperatures required for flash Joule heating—the best method for making so-called turbostratic graphene.

Plus, Eddy had access to Edison’s original 1879 patent describing the invention process. Eddy recreated Edison’s experiment, attaching light bulbs to a 110-volt power source and switching it on for 20 seconds at a time to rapidly heat the carbon-based material to between 2,000° to 3,000° C. (Switch it on for any longer and you get graphite rather than graphene.) Then he examined the results using a modern optical microscope.

His first attempt didn’t work out because the bulbs he bought turned out to use tungsten rather than carbon filaments. “You can’t fool a chemist,” said Eddy. “But I finally found a small art store in New York City selling artisan Edison-style light bulbs.” Those artisan bulbs used bamboo filaments, with diameters a mere 5 micrometers larger than Edison’s original filaments.

This time, Eddy noticed that the carbon filament turned to a “lustrous silver.” Raman spectroscopy revealed that parts of the filament had turned into turbostratic graphene. The team also took before and after images using transmission electron microscopy. Eddy and his co-authors acknowledge that this is not definitive proof that Edison produced graphene. The inventor lacked the means to detect it even if he had been aware that such a material existed. And even if one were to analyze Edison’s original bulb, any graphene would have long since turned into graphite.

The authors concluded by noting the research potential of revisiting other early technologies using the tools of modern materials science, such as vacuum tubes, arc lamps, and early X-ray tubes. These also may have accidentally produced unusual materials or reactions that weren’t analyzed or even noticed at the time. “Innovation can emerge from reinterpreting the past with fresh tools and new questions,” they wrote. “In the case of ‘Edison graphene,’ a 140-year-old invention continues to shed light not just literally but scientifically.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A 20-year-old man in Taiwan went to a dermatology clinic for a strange rash that had developed across his shoulders and chest. The raised, red, and itchy condition had been bothering him for a full month. By this point, he had also developed patches of pigmented skin interlaced with the red rash.

According to a case report in the New England Journal of Medicine, a skin biopsy showed swelling between his skin cells and inflammation around blood vessels, but testing came up negative for other common signs of skin conditions, leaving doctors with few leads. The doctors ultimately came to a diagnosis not by analyzing his skin further but by hearing about his diet.

The man told doctors that two months prior to his clinic appointment—a month before his rash developed—he had switched to a ketogenic diet, which is a high-fat but very low-carbohydrate eating pattern. This diet forces the body to shift from using glucose (sugar derived from carbohydrates) as an energy source to fat instead.

When this happens, the body can go into ketosis. This starts with fat tissue breaking down, leading to the release of free fatty acids. These fatty acids are transported to the liver, where they’re metabolized to acetyl-CoA. Excessive amounts of this molecule gum up metabolic processes and lead to the formation of ketone bodies, primarily acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate. (A ketone is a specific chemical structure that includes a single bond to two CH3 or R groups with a double bond to an oxygen molecule.) Ketone bodies made in the liver can enter the circulatory system and be used as a source of energy for tissues around the body, particularly the brain.

Ketogenic diets have clinical uses—they’ve proven useful for managing drug-resistant epilepsy and some rare genetic metabolic diseases. Studies have looked at them as possible ways to manage obesity and type 2 diabetes, and there’s interest in their use in cancer metabolism and neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease.

Otherwise, the keto diet is popular among people trying to lose weight, particularly those trying to lose visceral fat, like the man in the case study. Anecdotal reports promote the keto diet as being effective at helping people slim down relatively quickly while also improving stamina and mental clarity. But robust clinical data supporting these claims is lacking, and medical experts have raised concerns about long-term cardiovascular health, among other things.

There are also clear downsides to the diet. Ketones are acidic, and if they build up too much in the blood, they can be toxic, causing ketoacidosis. This is a particular concern for people with type 1 diabetes and for people with chronic alcohol abuse. For everyone else, there’s a list of common side effects, including nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, bad breath, headache, fatigue, and dizziness. Ketogenic diets are also linked to high cholesterol and kidney stones.

But there’s one side effect that’s well established but little known and still puzzling to doctors: the “keto rash” or prurigo pigmentosa. This rash fits the man’s case perfectly—red, raised, itchy bumps on the neck, chest, and back, with areas of hyperpigmentation also developing.

The rash was first identified in Japan in 1971, where it was mostly seen in women. While it has been consistently linked to metabolic disorders and dietary changes, experts still don’t understand what causes it. It’s seen not only in people on a keto diet but also in people with diabetes and those who have had bariatric surgery or are fasting.

In a review this month, researchers in Saudi Arabia noted that a leading hypothesis is that the high levels of ketones in the blood trigger inflammation around blood vessels driven by a type of white blood cell called neutrophils, and this inflammation is what causes the rash, which develops in different stages.

While the condition remains poorly understood, effective treatments have at least been worked out. The most common treatment is to get the person out of ketosis and give them an antibiotic in the tetracycline class. Antibiotics are designed to treat bacterial infections (which this is not), but they can also dampen inflammation signals and thwart the activity of neutrophils.

In the man’s case, doctors gave him a two-week course of doxycycline and told him to ditch his keto diet. A week later, the rash was gone.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/tr-49-is-interactive-fiction-for-fans-of-deep-research-rabbit-holes/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you’ve ever fallen down a Wikipedia rabbit hole or spent a pleasant evening digging through college library stacks, you know the joy of a good research puzzle. Every new source and cross-reference you find unlocks an incremental understanding of a previously unknown world, forming a piecemeal tapestry of knowledge that you can eventually look back at as a cohesive and well-known whole.

TR-49 takes this research process and operationalizes it into an engrossing and novel piece of heavily non-linear interactive fiction. Researching the myriad sources contained in the game’s mysterious computer slowly reveals a tale that’s part mystery, part sci-fi allegory, part family drama, and all-compelling alternate academic history.

The entirety of TR-49 takes place from a first-person perspective as you sit in front of a kind of Steampunk-infused computer terminal. An unseen narrator asks you to operate the machine but is initially cagey about how or why or what you’re even looking for. There’s a creepy vibe to the under-explained circumstances that brought you to this situation, but the game never descends into the jump scares or horror tropes of so many other modern titles.

Your only real form of interaction with the world of TR-49 is through a sepia-toned tube display on the left and a four-character split-flap on the right that serves as the computer’s only input. You quickly discover that entering specific sequences—each with two letters followed by two numbers, as suggested by the game’s name—brings up library catalog-style entries referring to a vast web of literary works that form the core of the game’s wider fiction.

While the catalog contains short excerpts from each of these discovered works, it’s the additional notes added to each entry by subsequent researchers that place each title in its full context. You’ll end up poring through these research notes for clues about the existence and chronology of other authors and works. Picking out specific names and years points to the codes and titles needed to unlock even more reference pages in the computer, pushing you further down the rabbit hole. Picture something like Her Story, but replace the cinéma vérité surveillance video clips with a library card catalog.

You’ll slowly start to unravel and understand how the game world’s myriad authors are influencing each other with their cross-pollinating writings. The treatises, novels, pamphlets, and journals discussed in this database are full of academic sniping, intellectual intrigue, and interpersonal co-mingling across multiple generations of work. It all ends up circling a long-running search for a metaphysical key to life itself, which most of the authors manage to approach but never quite reach a full understanding.

As you explore, you also start to learn more about the personal affairs of the researchers who collected and cataloged all this reference material and the vaguely defined temporal capabilities of the information-synthesis engine in the computer you’ve all worked on. Eventually, you’ll stumble on the existence of core commands that can unlock hidden parts of the computer or alter the massive research database itself, which becomes key to your eventual final goal.

Through it all, there’s a slowly unfolding parallel narrative involving Liam, the unseen voice guiding you through the research process itself. Through occasional voice clips, Liam eventually hints at the existence of a powerful and quickly encroaching threat that wants to stop your progress by any means necessary, adding a bit of dramatic tension to your academic pursuits.

I’m being intentionally vague about the specifics here because I think TR-49‘s subtle and well-crafted sci-fi world-building is best experienced by exploring the game for yourself. There’s a real satisfaction in staring at a once impenetrably obtuse research note, recalling a bit of information from a recent cross-reference, and feeling your understanding suddenly click into place. And while the vocal performances can verge on cheesy, the writing captures the monomaniacal intensity of truly obsessive academics to a tee.

One of the game’s best features is a “Notes” sub-menu, which automatically outlines relevant facts (and potential facts) about various authors, groups, and publications as you discover them. This means you don’t have to take page after page of hand-written notes to keep track of the game’s complex connections (and potential connections), as you do in games like Blue Prince or Lorelei and the Laser Eyes. It makes for a much smoother puzzle-solving experience, even if the automatic notes sometimes pick up on things you may have missed while skimming.

TR-49 also benefits from being relatively compact compared to some other narrative deduction games. A diligent investigator can reach a conclusion in four or five hours, depending on how thorough they want to be. That makes it relatively easy to keep the broad outlines of the game’s dense but parsable world in your head over a couple of evening play sessions.

There are bound to be some people who see TR-49 as akin to a homework simulator, with painful flashbacks to all-nighters spent desperately researching a last-minute college term paper. For anyone who knows the inherent appeal of diving deep into a previously unknown world, though, TR-49 is an engrossing work of world-building fiction presented in a truly memorable way.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Adult content has never been as accessible as it is now, thanks to the internet. Hell, online smut played a major role in the rise of the web itself in the 1990s.

With that glut of porn, some have voiced concerns that some people are consuming too much of the stuff or even becoming addicted, which they claim could have consequences like regulating emotions or impaired sexual functioning.

But as PsyPost reports, these concerns may be overblown. Researchers at the University of Pécs in Hungary have found that it doesn’t matter how frequently one watches porn; the reasons why somebody indulges in the stuff are far more predictive of their sexual health.

As detailed in a new paper published in the International Journal of Sexual Health, the researchers found that positive motivations, such as “enhancing sexual pleasure, exploring fantasies, or deepening intimacy,” were “associated with frequent but non-problematic pornography use and with adaptive sexual regulation.”

However, those with “negative motivations,” such as “stress reduction, emotional escape, or avoidance of discomfort,” were strongly linked to “sexual system hyperactivation, emotion regulation difficulties, and impaired relational functioning.”

The study involved  890 adult participants in Hungary, including 600 individuals assigned female at birth and 290 assigned male at birth. The participants submitted answers anonymously through an online survey.

“A major gap in the literature is that pornography use is often evaluated mainly by how frequently people use it, even though frequency alone tells us very little about whether use is actually harmful,” University of Pécs psychology professor Norbert Meskó told PsyPost.

“We were interested in whether these different motivations are linked to different patterns of sexual and emotional functioning,” he added.

Most strikingly, the researchers found that participants who reported frequent pornography use were less likely to experience problematic outcomes. However, those who primarily used it for coping and managing stress were more likely to experience symptoms of problematic use, indicating that frequency isn’t the main indicator of whether it’s actually harmful.

“One somewhat surprising finding was that frequent use, when driven by positive motivations, was linked to less sexual deactivation — meaning less emotional withdrawal from sexuality,” Meskó told PsyPost. “In contrast, only problematic use — not frequent use — was associated with these kinds of disengaged or avoidant sexual patterns.”

“Importantly, problematic use showed much stronger links to difficulties in sexual and emotional functioning than simple frequency did,” he added. “This suggests that from a practical standpoint, it is more useful to look at whether someone feels out of control or distressed by their use than at how often they watch pornography.”

Of course, as the researchers note in their paper, there are some limitations to their research. For one, the self-reported nature of their data may not be reliable, as it relies on memory. It also may not be generalizable to a broader population as a result.

Multiple motivations for pornography use may also overlap — for instance, seeking pleasure while also distracting from stress — meaning that some cases may not neatly fit into either positive or negative motivations. One category may also quickly shift to another, further complicating the picture.

“We would caution against thinking of pornography as either simply ‘good’ or ‘bad,&#39;” Meskó told PsyPost. “For some people, it may be part of healthy sexual expression, while for others it may function as a way to avoid emotional problems or relationship difficulties.”

            <div id="article-text">Thanks to scores of competing AI systems clogging up online application portals, applying for a new job in 2026 can feel more like applying for a bank loan than seeking a job.

At least, that’s what a group of disgruntled job seekers is claiming in a lawsuit against an AI screening company called Eightfold AI. According to the New York Times, the plaintiffs allege that Eightfold’s employment screening software should be subjected to the Fair Credit Reporting Act — the regulations protecting information collected by consumer credit bureaus.

The reason, they say, can be found deep within Eightfold’s AI algorithm, which actively trolls LinkedIn to create a data set of “1 million job titles, 1 millions skills, and the profiles of more than 1 billion people working in every job, profession, industry, and geography.” That data set, in turn, is used in marketing material to help sell its services to potential clients.

Using an AI model trained on that data, plaintiffs say, Eightfold scores job applications on a scale of one to five, based on their skills, experience, and the hiring manager’s goals. In sum, their argument is that it’s not at all unlike the opaque rules used to govern consumer credit scores.

In the case of Eightfold, however, applicants have no way of knowing what their final score even is, let alone the steps the system took to come up with it. That creates a “black box”: a situation where the people subjected to an algorithmic decision can only see the system’s outcome, not the process that led to it. And if Eightfold’s AI starts making things up on the fly — an issue AI models are infamous for — the job seeker has no way of knowing.

There’s also the issue of data retention. With no way to take a peek under the hood, there’s no telling how much data from job applicants’ résumés Eightfold collects, or what the AI company and its clients are doing with it.

“I think I deserve to know what’s being collected about me and shared with employers,” Erin Kistler, one of the plaintiffs told the NYT. “And they’re not giving me any feedback, so I can’t address the issues.”

Kistler, who has decades of experience working in computer science, told the publication she’s kept a close score of every application she’s sent over the last year. Out of “thousands of jobs” she’s applied for, only 0.3 percent moved on to a follow-up or interview, she said.

It all underscores the sad state of the job market, which has become the stuff of dystopian nightmares thanks to AI hiring tools. Whether the lawsuit can gain enough momentum to challenge the massive legal grey area of AI hiring remains to be seen. If it does, it could bring relief to throngs of despondent job seekers whose careers quite literally hang in the balance.

Eightfold AI didn’t respond to the NYT‘s request for comment.

            <div id="article-text">It’s a plant! It’s a fungus! It’s… an entirely new type of lifeform hitherto unknown to science?

That appears to be the case for a puzzling, spire-shaped organism that lived over 400 million years ago, according to a new study published in the journal Science Advances. After analyzing its internal structures, the authors argue that the mystifying ancient beings known as prototaxites don’t belong to any of the existing biological kingdoms.

“It feels like it doesn’t fit comfortably anywhere,” Matthew Nelsen, a senior research scientist at the Field Museum of Natural History who wasn’t involved in the work, told Scientific American. “People have tried to shoehorn it into these different groups, but there are always things that don’t make sense.”

The name Prototaxites means “early yew” or “first yew,” a misnomer that captures the debate that has surrounded its nature for over a century. With its resemblance to a tree trunk, scientists initially suspected it was some kind of extinct tree when its fossils were first unearthed in 1855.

This assumption would probably offend the prototaxites were they still alive to hear it. In reality, the peculiar pillars likely emerged before the first trees appeared on Earth some 400 million years ago, and at an estimated height of around 26 feet, would’ve absolutely towered over other land organisms at the time.

What was the nature of these colossi? Scientific speculation abounded once it became clear that it wasn’t a plant. In the decades that followed its discovery, the consensus flipped to it being a kind of algae. In more recent decades, the suspicion became that it was some kind of giant fungus, because it appeared that they contained carbon isotopes typically found in such organisms.

Boldly, the authors of the new paper — which we’ve been following since back before it was peer-reviewed — say that everyone’s got it all wrong. The tubelike structures in the fossils are wild and varied, unlike the structures in modern fungi, which are more ordered, SciAm noted. There were also no detectable traces of chitin, a chemical that makes up the cell walls of all known fungi.

“It doesn’t seem to have any of the characteristic features of the living fungal groups,” co-lead author Laura Cooper, a researcher at the University of Edinburg, told SciAm, adding that many facets of its biology elude our understanding, not just its taxonomy. “How it actually works energetically is still a complete mystery.”

Some argue that Prototaxites represent a completely extinct lineage of fungus, which, if true, means it would have had to independently evolve into a new form of complex life, according to Kevin Boyce, a paleobotanist at Stanford University who coauthored a 2022 paper with Nelsen on the organisms — something that would be astounding in its own right. “No matter what,” Boyce told SciAm, “it’s something weird doing its own thing.”

Cooper, however, remains adamant that the Prototaxites are too “fundamentally different” to shove it into the category of fungi. Science doesn’t like outliers, so if it is something entirely new, chances are there’s something else like it out there that we haven’t stumbled on yet. And so, according to Vivi Vajda, a paleobiologist at the Swedish Museum of Natural History, the “next step would be to find other fossil life forms with similar chemical fingerprints to trace this enigmatic life form through the tree of life,” she told Science.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The headlines of 2025 painted a portrait of America in chaos, driven by the financial logic of America’s media ecosystem. It’s number one product isn’t news, but fear.

“NYC youth crime doubled since controversial state Raise the Age Law kicked in,” exclaims one hysterical New York Post headline from September. “Business owners express frustration over crime surge in Federal Hill,” reads a banner from FOX45 News, a local outlet in Baltimore. “Office shooter’s rampage shows terrifying rise of motive-free violence, experts warn,” goes a Fox News heading from August.

The scary headlines were all underscored by inflammatory rhetoric from the Trump administration, which continued to insist that America’s cities are crime-ridden hell holes well into the new year.Selective media coverage of crime certainly isn’t a new phenomenon, though it’s worth revisiting — especially because new data suggests 2025 was actually one of the least violent years for the US in over a century.

According to fresh Council on Criminal Justice crime statistics, Axios reports, murder rates fell 21 percent last year across the 35 largest cities in the US. It’s the single largest one-year-drop ever, the publication reports, and possibly the lowest homicide rates we’ve seen as a nation since the year 1900 — when the last generation of frontier outlaws were still robbing train cars.

Homicide wasn’t the only crime that fell in 2025. Out of 13 crimes tracked by the Council on Criminal Justice, 11 of them were lower last year than in 2024. Aggravated assaults, for example, fell by 9 percent across the 35 cities, while gun assaults and robberies dropped off by 22 and 23 percent, respectively. (The only category that increased was drug crimes, up 7 percent — and which are nonviolent.)

To sum up it all up: the sensationalized crime coverage dominating the evening news stands in stark, frustrating contrast to the actual data. In 2026, American media is dominated by just six billion-dollar media conglomerates, an arrangement which has held for well over a decade.

Under this system, news becomes commodified — clicks and views drive revenue, the core function of any business. Media companies have a financial incentive to churn out hysterical headlines and “Nightcrawler”-esque violence porn over rational breakdowns of actual statistics, nevermind the social and financial conditions that give rise to crime.

With so many Americans reliant on the commercialized news cycle for information about the world, it’s no wonder our politics are still steeped in debates over “law and order,” driven by a crisis that doesn’t seem to exist.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Magic mushrooms, an informal group of fungi that contain the naturally occurring psychedelic substance psilocybin, are known for inducing powerful hallucinations. They can induce feelings of euphoria, a sense of belonging in the world, and distort reality by messing with the brain’s visual cortex, turning the world into a trippy, shimmering pocket dimension full of pulsating geometric patterns.

Now we’re hearing about a lesser-known species, known for its umami-forward flavor in China, which can induce far more specific hallucinations — when not prepared correctly by a chef, that is.

As the BBC reports, the mushroom, Lanmaoa asiatica, can cause you to see countless tiny people everywhere you look. Doctors in the Yunnan province of China are treating hundreds of cases a year of people having visions of small, “pint-sized, elf-like figures” crawling around and climbing up walls.

“At a mushroom hot pot restaurant there, the server set a timer for 15 minutes and warned us, ‘Don’t eat it until the timer goes off or you might see little people,&#39;” University of Utah doctoral candidate in biology Colin Domnauer told the broadcaster.

“It seems like very common knowledge in the culture there,” he added.

The hallucinations can last a very long time, up to three days after a 12-to-24-hour onset, and often result in hospitalizations. That’s considerably longer and more severe than the average psilocybin trip.

“One elder tribesman in Papua New Guinea describes this effect, explaining how ‘he saw tiny people with mushrooms around their faces. They were teasing him, and he was trying to chase them away,&#39;” Donmauer wrote in a November piece for the University of Utah.

“When I lifted the tablecloth higher, the heads came off and stuck to the bottom of the cloth and the bodies kept marching in place… I did this many times, at two-minute intervals, and each time they were there, marching and grinning… I measured them, too… they were [one inch] high,” a professor in Yunnan told Donmauer, recounting his own trip.

Domnauerhas been trying to hunt down the origins of the mushroom and investigate how it affects the brain, producing such surprisingly similar hallucinations in different people.

“It sounded so bizarre that there could be a mushroom out there causing fairytale-like visions reported across cultures and time,” he told the BBC. “I was perplexed and driven by curiosity to find out more.”

The appearance of tiny humans after ingesting the mushrooms does appear in academic literature, describing them as “liliputian hallucinations,” or “elusive little people.”

Even Albert Hofmann, the Swiss chemist known for being the first to synthesize, ingest, and learn about the effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), failed to identify the molecules that caused the mysterious hallucinations.

The mushrooms got their formal Latin name in 2015, yet many questions remain about their psychedelic qualities, a gap Donmauer is hoping to fill with his research.

In experiments involving mice, he found that the animals fell into a stupor after being administered extracts of the mushroom.

Donmauer has also determined that the L. asiatica mushrooms do not contain psilocybin, the substance that gives magic mushrooms their hallucinogenic qualities.

The main thing that sets it apart is that trips don’t vary greatly depending on the individual, unlike those triggered by psilocybin which can differ greatly.

The “perception of little people is very reliably and repeatedly reported,” Donmauer told the BBC. “I don’t know of anything else that produces such consistent hallucinations.”

The researcher has yet to eat the mushroom himself. Given the length of the trips and the chances of being hospitalized, we can’t blame him.

“While many questions remain, one thing is for certain: Lanmaoa asiatica reminds us that the world of mushrooms, even those found in markets and on dinner plates, conceals mysteries and wonders we’ve yet to imagine,” Donmauer wrote in his piece for the University of Utah.

“Somewhere between traditional folklore and modern biology, between the wild forest floor and the sterile scientific laboratory, lies a story still unfolding, a story that may begin with something as seemingly innocuous as a bowl of mushroom soup,” he added.

            <div id="article-text">Something strange is happening with ManyVids, an OnlyFans-like porn platform with millions of users. For roughly the past half-year, its official account on X and on its own website have been posting bizarre, feverishly spiritual rants on topics ranging from aliens to numerology, along with absurd AI-generated images and videos that depict its CEO Bella French, 404 Media reports,

What’s more, many of the adult content creators on the platform suspect that the cryptic posts are a sign that French is suffering from some kind of delusional episode brought on by her addiction to AI, a phenomenon that psychiatrists are labeling AI psychosis. And it’s leaving them feeling pretty uneasy about the site’s future.

“If something were to happen to MV (or to my account there) due to what can only be described as AI psychosis, I would lose upwards of 14k per year — a not insignificant amount of income,” one of these creators told 404. “It concerns me that access to my earnings, and more importantly my personal information, is in the hands of someone seemingly out of touch with reality.”

The posts first started appearing on X, formerly, Twitter, in mid-2025. As 404 tells it, instead of promoting creators and other stuff relevant to the platform, the ManyVids account started “posting cryptic quotes, phrases, and images, many seemingly generated by or about AI.” The account would also interact with obvious bots, or post nonsensical, bullet-pointed and emoji-bedecked rants that are the exact kind of drivel you’d expect to see from AI spammers.

The posts have stopped on X. But they continue on the ManyVids website itself, which has a dedicated feed for official posts.

At some point during the AI posting spree, the site’s owner French appeared to have a concerning change of heart. A former cam model, she has long championed the rights of sex workers and launched ManyVids over a decade ago to provide a platform where they could monetize their content and be treated fairly by the site owners, according to 404.

But now she appears to be crusading against the very thing she created. As recently as last November, French updated her website to state that her new personal mission is to “transition one million people out of the adult industry and do everything we can to ensure no one new enters it,” 404 noted.

The dramatic shift in beliefs, paired with the bizarre rambling posts on cultish topics, show the hallmarks of AI psychosis, a term some experts are using to describe episodes in which users are led down mental health spirals by an AI chatbot. Some extreme cases end with explosions of violence, including suicide and murder. But more common cases see someone drawn down a delusional rabbit hole, leading them to believe they’ve had divine experiences, or discovered game-changing scientific advances, or possess supernatural powers like the ability to bend time.

ManyVids content creators agree that there’s something AI-related afoot. Almost all of the platform’s creators who 404 spoke to brought up “AI psychosis” unprompted, observing the bizarre and AI-generated characteristics of the rants and videos. And it’s leaving them insulted and unnerved.

“Ethical dilemmas about AI aside, the posts are completely disconnected with ManyVids as a site,” another ManyVids creator told 404 Media. “Their customers and their creators are not served in any way by these. When faced with backlash, MV removed the ability to comment on posts.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">British startup Synthesia, whose AI platform helps companies create interactive training videos, has raised a $200 million Series E round of funding that brings its valuation to $4 billion — up from $2.1 billion just a year ago.

Unlike some other AI startups that are still a long way from turning a profit, Synthesia has found a lucrative business in transforming corporate training thanks to AI-generated avatars. With enterprise clients including Bosch, Merck, and SAP, the London-based company crossed $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) in April 2025.

This milestone explains why Synthesia’s venture backers are literally doubling down. The Series E that nearly doubled its valuation was led by existing investor GV (Google Ventures), with participation from several other previous backers — including Series B lead Kleiner Perkins, Series C lead Accel, Series D lead New Enterprise Associates (NEA), NVIDIA’s venture capital arm NVentures, Air Street Capital, and PSP Growth.

Aside from ongoing support, this round will bring both new and departing investors. On one hand, Matt Miller’s VC firm Evantic and the secretive VC firm Hedosophia are joining the cap table as new entrants. On the other hand, Synthesia will facilitate an employee secondary sale in partnership with Nasdaq, TechCrunch has learned.

To be clear, Synthesia isn’t going public just yet — Nasdaq isn’t acting as a public exchange in this operation, but as a private markets facilitator that will help early team members turn their shares into cash. These employee stock sales often happen outside of this framework, but usually at prices either below or above the company’s official valuation, and are sometimes frowned upon by other shareholders. With this process, all sales will be tied to the same $4 billion valuation as Synthesia’s Series E, while the company keeps an element of control.

“This secondary is first and foremost about our employees,” Synthesia CFO Daniel Kim told TechCrunch. “It gives employees a meaningful opportunity to access liquidity and share in the value they’ve helped create, while we continue to operate as a private company focused on long-term growth.”

For Synthesia, this long-term growth involves going beyond expressive videos and embracing the AI agents trend. According to a press release, the company is developing AI agents that will let its clients’ employees “interact with company knowledge in a more intuitive, human-like way by asking questions, exploring scenarios through role-play, and receiving tailored explanations.”

The company said early pilots have received positive feedback from customers, who reported higher engagement and faster knowledge transfer compared to traditional formats. This positive response explains why Synthesia now plans to make agents a “core strategic focus” to invest in, alongside further product improvements to its existing platform.

While it didn’t disclose revenue forecasts, the company hopes its platform will offer a welcome answer to the struggles of enterprises in keeping their workforce adequately trained despite rapid changes. “We see a rare convergence of two major shifts: a technology shift with AI agents becoming more capable, and a market shift where upskilling and internal knowledge sharing have become board-level priorities,” Synthesia’s co-founder and CEO Victor Riparbelli said in a statement.

Seeing boards care more about employees as a result of AI wasn’t on anyone’s bingo card, except perhaps Riparbelli. Together with his cofounder, Synthesia COO Steffen Tjerrild, Riparbelli took the initiative of conducting a secondary sale so that employees could share in the success of the unicorn company. Founded in 2017, Synthesia now has more than 500 team members, a 20,000-square-foot HQ in London, and additional offices in Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Munich, New York City, and Zurich.

While unusual for a British startup, this coordinated secondary sale isn’t a first and likely not a last, Synthesia’s head of corporate affairs and policy, Alexandru Voica told TechCrunch. “My guess is that as [U.K.-based] private companies stay private longer, this type of structured, cross-border employee liquidity may become increasingly common, so I wouldn’t be surprised to see others do it, either with Nasdaq or others,” he predicted.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Sunny Sethi, founder of HEN Technologies, doesn’t sound like someone who’s disrupted an industry that has remained largely unchanged since the 1960s. His company builds fire nozzles — specifically, nozzles that it says put out fires up to three times faster than earlier products while conserving two-thirds of the water. But Sethi is matter-of-fact about this achievement, more focused on what’s next than what’s already been done. And what’s next sounds a lot bigger than fire nozzles.

His path to firefighting doesn’t follow a tidy narrative. After nabbing his PhD at the University of Akron, where he researched surfaces and adhesion, he founded ADAP Nanotech, an outfit that developed a carbon nanotube-based portfolio and won Air Force Research Lab grants. Next, at SunPower, he developed new materials and processes for shingled photovoltaic modules. When he landed next at a company called TE Connectivity, he worked on devices with new adhesive formulations to enable faster manufacturing in the automotive industry.

Then came a challenge from his wife. The two had moved from Ohio to the East Bay outside San Francisco in 2013. A few years later came the Thomas Fire — the only megafire they’d ever see, they thought. Then came the Camp Fire, then the Napa-Sonoma fires. The breaking point came in 2019. Sethi was traveling during evacuation warnings while his wife was home alone with their then three-year-old daughter, no family nearby, facing a potential evacuation order. “She was really mad at me,” Sethi recalls. “She’s like, ‘Dude, you need to fix this, otherwise you’re not a real scientist.’”

A background spanning nanotechnology, solar, semiconductors, and automotive had made his thinking “bias free and flexible,” as he puts it. He’d seen so many industries, so many different problems. Why not try to fix the problem?

In June 2020, he founded HEN Technologies (for high-efficiency nozzles) in nearby Hayward. With National Science Foundation funding, he conducted computational fluid dynamics research, analyzing how water suppresses fire and how wind affects it. The result: a nozzle that controls droplet size precisely, manages velocity in new ways, and resists wind.

In HEN’s comparison video, which Sethi shows me over a Zoom call, the difference is stark. It’s the same flow rate, he says, but HEN’s pattern and velocity control keep the stream coherent while traditional nozzles disperse.

But the nozzle is just the beginning — what Sethi calls “the muscle on the ground.” HEN has since expanded into monitors, valves, overhead sprinklers, and pressure devices, and is launching a flow-control device (“Stream IQ”) and discharge control systems this year. According to Sethi, each device contains custom-designed circuit boards with sensors and computing power — 23 different designs that turn dumb hardware into smart, connected equipment, some powered by Nvidia Orion Nano processors. Altogether, says Sethi, HEN has filed 20 patent applications with half a dozen granted so far.

The real innovation is the system these devices create. HEN’s platform uses sensors at the pump to act as a virtual sensor in the nozzle, tracking exactly when it’s on, how much water flows, and what pressure is required. The system captures precisely how much water was used for a given fire, how it was used, which hydrant was tapped, and what the weather conditions were.

Why it matters: Fire departments can run out of water otherwise, because there’s no communication between water suppliers and firefighters. It happened in the Palisades Fire. It happened in the Oakland Fire decades earlier. When two engines are connected to one hydrant, pressure variations can mean that one engine suddenly gets nothing as a fire continues to grow. In rural America, water tenders, which are tankers shuttling water from distant sources, face their own logistical nightmares. If they can integrate water usage calculations with their own utility monitoring systems to optimize resource allocation, that’s a giant win.

So HEN built a cloud platform with application layers, which Sethi likens to what Adobe did with cloud infrastructure. Think Individual à la carte systems for fire captains, battalion chiefs, and incident commanders. HEN’s system has weather data; it has GPS in all devices. It can warn those on the front lines that the wind is about to shift and they’d better move their engines, or that a particular fire truck is running out of water.

The Department of Homeland Security has been asking for exactly this kind of system through its NERIS program, which is an initiative to bring predictive analytics to emergency operations. “But you can’t have [predictive analytics] unless you have good quality data,” Sethi notes. “You can’t have good quality data unless you have the right hardware.”

If building a predictive analytics platform for emergency response sounds daunting, Sethi says actually selling it is tougher, and he’s proudest of HEN’s traction on that front.

“The hardest part of building this company is that this market is tough because it’s a B2C play when you think of convincing the customers to buy, but the procurement cycle is B2B,” he explains. “So you have to really make a product that resonates with people — with the end user — but you still have to go through government purchasing cycles, and we have cracked both of those.”

The numbers bear this out. HEN launched its first products into the market in the second quarter of 2023, lining up 10 fire departments and generating $200,000 in revenue. Then word started to spread. Revenue hit $1.6 million in 2024, then $5.2 million last year. This year, Hen, which currently has 1,500 fire department customers, is projecting $20 million in revenue.

HEN has competition, of course. IDEX Corp, a public company, sells hoses, nozzles, and monitors. Software companies like Central Square serve fire departments. A Miami company, First Due, which sells software to public safety agencies, announced a massive $355 million round last August.  But no company is “doing exactly what we are trying to do,” insists Sethi.

Either way, Sethi says that the constraint isn’t demand — it’s scaling fast enough. HEN serves the Marine Corps, US Army bases, Naval atomic labs, NASA, Abu Dhabi Civil Defense, and ships to 22 countries. It works through 120 distributors and recently qualified for GSA after a year-long vetting process (that’s a federal seal of approval that makes it easier for military and government agencies to buy).

Fire departments buy about 20,000 new engines each year to replace aging equipment in a national fleet of 200,000, so once HEN is qualified, it becomes recurring revenue (is the idea), and because the hardware generates data, revenue continues between purchase cycles.

HEN’s dual goal has required building a very specific team. Its software lead was formerly a senior director who helped build Adobe’s cloud infrastructure. Other members of HEN’s 50-person team include a former NASA engineer and veterans from Tesla, Apple, and Microsoft. “If you ask me technical questions, I would not be able to answer everything,” Sethi admits with a laugh, “but I have such good teams that [it] has been a blessing.”

Indeed, it’s the software that hints at where this gets interesting, because while HEN is selling nozzles, it’s amassing something more valuable: data. Highly specific, real-world data about how water behaves under pressure, how flow rates interact with materials, how fire responds to suppression techniques, how physics works in active fire environments.

It’s exactly what companies building so-called world models need. These AI systems that construct simulated representations of physical environments to predict future states require real-world, multimodal data from physical systems under extreme conditions. You can’t teach AI about physics through simulations alone. You need what HEN collects with every deployment.

Sethi won’t elaborate, but he knows what he’s sitting on. Companies training robotics and predictive physics engines would pay handsomely for this kind of real-world physics data.

Investors see it, too. Last month, HEN closed a $20 million Series A round, plus $2 million in venture debt from Silicon Valley Bank. O’Neil Strategic Capital led the financing, with NSFO, Tanas Capital, and z21 Ventures participating. The round brought the company’s total funding to more than $30 million.

Sethi, meanwhile, is already looking ahead. He says the company will return to fundraising in the second quarter of this year.

            <div id="article-text">Information from the conservative-leaning, AI-generated encyclopedia developed by Elon Musk’s xAI is beginning to appear in answers from ChatGPT.

xAI launched Grokipedia in October, after Musk had been complaining that Wikipedia was biased against conservatives. Reporters soon noted that while many articles seemed to be copied directly from Wikipedia, Grokipedia also claimed that pornography contributed to the AIDS crisis, offered “ideological justifications” for slavery, and used denigrating terms for transgender people.

All that might be expected for an encyclopedia associated with a chatbot that described itself as “Mecha Hitler” and was used to flood X with sexualized deepfakes. However, its content now seems to be escaping containment from the Musk ecosystem, with the Guardian reporting that GPT-5.2 cited Grokipedia nine times in response to more than a dozen different questions.

The Guardian says ChatGPT did not cite Grokipedia when asked about topics where its inaccuracy has been widely reported— topics like the January 6 insurrection or the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Instead, it was cited on more obscure topics, including claims about Sir Richard Evans that the Guardian had previously debunked. (Anthropic’s Claude also appears to be citing Grokipedia to answer some queries.)

An OpenAI spokesperson told the Guardian that it “aims to draw from a broad range of publicly available sources and viewpoints.”

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-25</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/25/humans-thinks-coordination-is-the-next-frontier-for-ai-and-theyre-building-a-model-to-prove-it/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI chatbots are getting better at answering questions, summarizing documents, and solving mathematical equations, but they still largely behave like helpful assistants for one user at a time. They’re not designed to manage the messier work of real collaboration: coordinating people with competing priorities, tracking long-running decisions, and keeping teams aligned over time.

Humans&, a new startup founded by alumni of Anthropic, Meta, OpenAI, xAI, and Google DeepMind, thinks closing that gap is the next major frontier for foundation models. The company this week raised a $480 million seed round to build a “central nervous system” for the human-plus-AI economy. The startup’s “AI for empowering humans” framing has dominated early coverage, but the company’s actual ambition is more novel: building a new foundation model architecture designed for social intelligence, not just information retrieval or code generation.

“It feels like we’re ending the first paradigm of scaling, where question-answering models were trained to be very smart at particular verticals, and now we’re entering what we believe to be the second wave of adoption where the average consumer or user is trying to figure out what to do with all these things,” Andi Peng, one of humans&’s co-founders and a former Anthropic employee, told TechCrunch.

Humans&’s pitch centers on helping usher people into the new era of AI, moving beyond the narrative that AI will take their jobs. Whether or not that’s just marketing speak, the timing is critical: Companies are transitioning from chat to agents. Models are competent, but workflows aren’t, and the coordination challenge remains largely unaddressed. And through it all, people feel threatened and overwhelmed by AI.

The three-month-old company, like several of its peers, has managed to raise its startling seed round off the back of this philosophy and the pedigree of its founding team. Humans& still doesn’t have a product, nor has it been clear about what exactly it might be, though the team said it could be a replacement for multiplayer or multi-user contexts like communication platforms (think Slack) or collaboration platforms (think Google Docs and Notion). As for use cases and target audience, the team hinted at both enterprise and consumer applications.

“We are building a product and a model that is centered on communication and collaboration,” Eric Zelikman, co-founder and CEO of humans& and former xAI researcher, told TechCrunch, adding that the focus is on getting the product to help people work together and communicate more effectively — both with each other and with AI tools.

“Like when you have to make a large group decision, often it comes down to someone taking everyone into one room, getting everyone to express their different camps about, for example, what kind of logo they’d like,” Zelikman continued, chortling with his team as they recalled the time-consuming tedium of getting everyone to agree on a logo for the startup.

Zelikman added that the new model will be trained to ask questions in a way that feels like interacting with a friend or a colleague, someone who is trying to get to know you. Chatbots today are programmed to ask questions constantly, but they do so without understanding the value of the question. He says this is because they’ve been optimized for two things: How much a user immediately likes a response they’re given, and how likely the model is to answer the question it receives correctly.

Part of the lack of clarity around what the product is could be that humans& doesn’t exactly have an answer for that yet. Peng said humans& is designing the product in conjunction with the model.

“Part of what we’re doing here is also making sure that as the model improves, we’re able to co-evolve the interface and the behaviors that the model is capable of into a product that makes sense,” she said.

What is clear, though, is that humans& isn’t trying to make a new model that can plug into existing applications and collaboration tools. The startup wants to own the collaboration layer.

AI plus team collaboration and productivity tools are an increasingly hot field — for example, the startup AI note-taking app Granola raised a $43 million round at a $250 million valuation as it launched more collaborative features. Several high-profile voices are also explicitly framing the next phase of AI as one of coordination and collaboration, not just automation. LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman today argued that companies are implementing AI wrong by treating it like isolated pilots and that the real leverage is in the coordination layer of work — that is, how teams share knowledge and run meetings.

“AI lives at the workflow level, and the people closest to the work know where the friction actually is,” Hoffman wrote on social media. “They’re the ones who will discover what should be automated, compressed, or totally redesigned.”

That’s the space where humans& wants to live. The idea is that its model-slash-product would act as the “connective tissue” across any organization — be it a 10,000-person business or a family — that understands the skills, motivations, and needs of each person, as well as how all of those can be balanced for the good of the whole.

To get there requires rethinking how AI models are trained.

“We’re trying to train the model in a different way that will involve more humans and AIs interacting and collaborating together,” Yuchen He, a humans& co-founder and former OpenAI researcher, told TechCrunch, adding that the startup’s model will also be trained using long-horizon and multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL).

Long-horizon RL is meant to train the model to plan, act, revise, and follow through over time, rather than just generate a good one-off answer. Multi-agent RL trains for environments where multiple AIs and/or humans are in the loop. Both of these concepts are gaining momentum in recent academic work as researchers push LLMs beyond chatbot responses toward systems that can coordinate actions and optimize outcomes over many steps.

“The model needs to remember things about itself, about you, and the better its memory, the better its user understanding,” He said.

Despite the stellar crew running the show, there are plenty of risks ahead. Humans& will need endless large sums of cash to fund the expensive endeavor that is training and scaling a new model. That means it will be competing with the major established players for resources, including access to compute.

The top risk, though, is that humans& isn’t just competing with the Notions and Slacks of the world. It’s coming for the Top Dogs of AI. And those companies are actively working on better ways to enable human collaboration on their platforms, even as they swear AGI will soon replace economically viable work. Through Claude Cowork, Anthropic aims to optimize work-style collaboration; Gemini is embedded into Workspace so AI-enabled collaboration is already happening inside the tools people are already using; and OpenAI has lately been pitching developers on its multi-agent orchestration and workflows.

Crucially, none of the major players seem poised to rewrite a model based on social intelligence, which either gives humans& a leg up or makes it an acquisition target. And with companies like Meta, OpenAI, and DeepMind on the prowl for top AI talent, M&A is certainly a risk.

Humans& told TechCrunch it has already turned away interested parties and is not interested in being acquired.

“We believe this is going to be a generational company, and we think that this has the potential to fundamentally change the future of how we interact with these models,” Zelikman said. “We trust ourselves to do that, and we have a lot of faith in the team that we’ve assembled here.”

            <div id="article-text">In recent months, some of the major players in science fiction and popular culture have been taking firmer stances against generative AI.

Separate decisions by San Diego Comic-Con and the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association (SFWA) illustrate the depth of AI opposition within some creative communities — though they’re certainly not the only ones, with music distribution platform Bandcamp also recently banning generative AI.

Back in December, when SFWA announced that it was updating its rules for the Nebula Awards. Works written entirely by large language models would not be eligible, while authors who used LLMs “at any point during the writing process” had to disclose that use, allowing award voters to make their own decisions about whether that usage would affect their support.

As Jason Sanford reported in his Genre Grapevine newsletter, this change drew immediate backlash for seemingly opening the door to work partly created by LLMs. SFWA’s Board of Directors issued an apology a few days later, writing, “Our approach and wording was wrong and we apologize for the distress and distrust we caused.”

The rules were revised yet again, now stating that works that are “written, either wholly or partially, by generative large language model (LLM) tools are not eligible” for Nebula Awards and that work will be disqualified if LLMs were used at any point in its creation.

In a follow-up post, Sanford said he was pleased to see SFWA listen to its members, and he said he refuses to use gen AI in his own fiction writing — “not only because of this theft but also because the tools are not actually creative and defeat the entire point of storytelling.” Still, he wrote that important questions need to be answered about how broadly LLM usage will be defined, especially as “these generative AI products are being forced down everyone’s throats by major corporations.”

“If you use any online search engines or computer products these days, it’s likely you’re using something powered by or connected with an LLM,” Sanford said. “Because of that, we must be careful that writers who use word processing and research tools with LLM components aren’t unfairly disqualified from awards like the Nebulas or attacked by readers and other writers. “

The massive annual San Diego Comic-Con faced a similar controversy this month after artists noticed rules allowing AI-generated art to be displayed — but not sold — at the convention’s art show. After artists complained, the rules were quietly changed to say, “Material created by Artificial Intelligence (AI) either partially or wholly, is not allowed in the art show.”

While Comic-Con’s apology was less public than SFWA, some artists shared emailed responses from art show head Glen Wooten, who apparently said the previous rules had been in place for “a few years” and that they’d been effective as a deterrent, since no one had entered AI-generated art in the show.

“But the issue is becoming more of a problem, so more strident language is necessary: NO! Plain and simple,” Wooten reportedly said.

It’s probably safe to that assume other organizations will be announcing similarly hard-line stances this year — and that these communities will continue debating the larger issues.

A quick bit of breaking news that hit just as we were about to send this newsletter out. The National Transportation Safety Board has opened an investigation into Waymo after its robotaxis have been spotted illegally passing stopped school buses numerous times in at least two states. Read the full story here.

Tesla made a couple of moves this week — and just before its quarterly earnings drops — designed to show its progress, and even dominance, in automated driving technology. But, hold up, there is more to it than mere optics.

The week started with Tesla offering passengers robotaxi rides in Austin without a human safety driver in the front seat. If you recall, Tesla launched a limited service in Austin last year with a fleet of modified Tesla Model Y vehicles running a more advanced version of the company’s driving software known as Full Self-Driving Supervised (this one being “unsupervised”). Human safety operators have been riding in the front passenger seat as a precaution since the rollout.

Not all of Tesla’s fleet in Austin will be fully driverless, and there is apparently a chase vehicle behind those that are. Still, it is notable and suggests Tesla is moving toward a broader ramp-up.

Meanwhile, Tesla has killed Autopilot, the advanced driver-assistance system that was initially introduced to its vehicles in 2014. Autopilot has gone through several software and hardware iterations over the years with new capabilities.

Autopilot was instantly popular and controversial, in part because the name implied the system was more capable than it actually was. (Drivers are responsible and are supposed to have their hands on the wheel when Autopilot is engaged.)

Tesla eventually made a basic Autopilot system standard in all of its vehicles, while launching and charging for a more robust system known now as Full Self-Driving (Supervised). The basic version, which is now dead, included traffic-aware cruise control, in which the vehicle maintains a set distance with cars ahead, and Autosteer, a feature that centers the vehicle in the lane and steers it.

Its decision to kill what was standard ADAS comes one week after Tesla said it would stop charging a one-time $8,000 fee for the FSD software and move all customers to a monthly subscription.

These decisions when taken together offer a simple enough explanation: Tesla wants to recognize more revenue from FSD as it positions itself as an AI and robotics company.

But there is another possible reason. The company is facing a 30-day suspension of its manufacturing and dealer licenses in California after a judge ruled in December that Tesla engaged in deceptive marketing by overstating the capabilities of Autopilot and FSD.

The ruling has been stayed for 60 days to allow Tesla to comply. Dropping the Autopilot name while cashing in on FSD is a rather bold move. But perhaps Tesla believes this is enough to satiate the DMV.

Zipline, the autonomous drone-delivery and logistics startup, has been around for more than a decade, starting in Rwanda delivering blood. Its progress has been slow and steady, notching wins in other African countries and expanding to the United States. That trajectory sped up after it launched a new drone platform in 2025 called P2 that focuses on home delivery of food and other goods.

Now, fueled with $600 million in new funding, its expansion ambitions have grown. The company, which is now valued at $7.6 billion, is bringing its service to Houston and Phoenix and plans to expand to at least four more U.S. states in 2026.

Fidelity Management & Research Company, Baillie Gifford, Valor Equity Partners, and Tiger Global participated in the funding round.

ABZ Innovation, a Europe-based maker of heavy-duty agricultural and industrial drones, raised $8.2 million in a funding round led by Vsquared Ventures, with participation from Assembly Ventures and Day One Capital.

Ethernovia, a San Jose, California-based startup that makes Ethernet-based systems for autonomous vehicles, raised $90 million in a Series B funding round led by Maverick Silicon — an AI-focused fund created in 2024 by hedge fund Maverick Capital.

Serve Robotics, the sidewalk delivery robot company backed by Nvidia and Uber, acquired Diligent Robotics in a deal that values the common stock at $29 million. Diligent builds robots named Moxi that are designed to assist in hospitals by delivering lab samples, supplies, and other tasks. Note: Watch for more autonomous vehicle tech-robotics crossovers in the coming year.

Terralayr, a German grid-scale battery storage company, raised €192 million in a round led by Eurazeo. RIVE Private Investment, Creandum, Earlybird, Norrsken VC, and Picus Capital also participated.

TrueCar founder Scott Painter reacquired the company in a $227 million deal through his firm Fair Holdings, and partners AutoNation, PenFed Credit Union, Zurich North America, and others. TrueCar will no longer be publicly traded, and Painter has returned to the CEO spot.

Austin Russell, the founder and former CEO of bankrupt lidar company Luminar, agreed to accept an electronic subpoena for information on his phone pertaining to the company. The subpoena is related to Luminar’s ongoing bankruptcy proceeding.

Chinese automaker Geely Holding Group released its five-year blueprint, and among its many goals is a section on robotaxis. The company said that by 2030 its Cao Cao Mobility ride-hailing unit will operate a fleet of 100,000 robotaxis covering major cities in China. It also hinted at plans to expand beyond China “in the future.”

General Motors is moving production of two gas-powered vehicles away from China and Mexico and to a U.S. factory in Kansas. That change will also mean the end of its rebooted Chevrolet Bolt EV, the only vehicle currently built at the Fairfax Assembly Plant in Kansas. Read more to learn when production of the Chevy Bolt EV will end.

Tesla aims to restart work on Dojo3, the company’s previously abandoned third-generation AI chip. Dojo3 won’t be aimed at training self-driving models. Instead, CEO Elon Musk says it will be dedicated to “space-based AI compute.”

Waymo has opened its robotaxi service in Miami. Riders will be accepted on a rolling basis, to the nearly 10,000 local residents on its waitlist.

Alex Roy, who co-hosts the Autonocast with me and Ed Niedermeyer, just traveled from Los Angeles to New York in a Tesla Model S, in which the vehicle’s Full Self-Driving Supervised software handled all of the driving. This “Cannonball Run” route is one Roy is familiar with; he set the transcontinental driving record in 2007 when he traveled the route in 31 hours and 4 minutes. He has gone on to make other Cannonball Run records in EVs. Others have followed and since beaten those records.

According to Roy, who captured the entire run on video, the FSD (version 14.2.2.3) drove 100% of the 3,081-mile journey. That included exiting the highway and parking at EV chargers. The time was 58 hours, 22 minutes.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Pity Chris Summerlin, the dean of students at the University of Florida. He’s being sued by an anti-Semite, and that’s not the worst of his predicament. So far, judges who have ruled on the case have given mixed verdicts on whether he is likely to win or lose at trial. Summerlin deserves to lose on the merits: He expelled a law-school student for speech that, while morally degenerate, is properly protected by the First Amendment. And––this is the pitiable part––it’s easy to see how he might have concluded that giving a bigot grounds to win a civil-rights lawsuit was his best option.

College deans and administrators keep confronting the same dilemma: They face intense pressure to punish speech that elicits fear or moral disgust on campus. They also have legal obligations—and face countervailing pressure—to refrain from violating the free-speech rights of students. They cannot always do both. The result is cases such as Damsky v. Summerlin—cases that might be avoided under a better approach to fighting anti-Semitism and other hateful ideas.

Preston Damsky was a law student at the University of Florida who was open about his belief that America was founded by and for the white race and that its racial character should be preserved, by force if necessary. According to court documents, he wrote in one assignment that “the founding generations” fought, killed, and died for their sovereignty, and argued, “We are not yet so outnumbered and so neutered that we cannot seize back what is rightfully ours.” To survive “as masters in the ancestral lands of their ancestors,” he wrote in another paper, “the People” must exercise “their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow” the government, “a process which no deskbound jurist can gleefully look forward to; for it will be a controversy decided not by the careful balance of Justitia’s scales, but by the gruesome slashing of her sword.”

Neither passage was initially deemed to violate school rules, however much they upset Damsky’s peers. But they informed the way that administrators reacted when Damsky went on X on March 21 and posted the following:

My position on Jews is simple: whatever Harvard professor Noel Ignatiev meant by his call to “abolish the White race by any means necessary” is what I think must be done with Jews. Jews must be abolished by any means necessary.

Ignatiev, who died in 2019, was a factory worker who entered academia late in life as a Marxist and gained minor notoriety with his 1995 book, How the Irish Became White. A few years prior, he co-founded a journal called Race Traitor. He believed that whiteness and white privilege were social constructs that impeded working-class solidarity and that people ought to renounce their privilege and become “unwhite,” thus abolishing whiteness. “Without the privileges attached to it, the white race would not exist, and white skin would have no more social significance than big feet,” he once said.

After Damsky invoked Ignatiev in his X post, a Jewish law professor replied, “Are you saying you would murder me and my family? Is that your position?” To which Damsky retorted, “Did Ignatiev want Whites murdered? If so, were his words as objectionable as mine? If Ignatiev sought genocide, then surely a genocide of all Whites would be an even greater outrage than a genocide of all Jews, given the far greater number of Whites.”

The exchange troubled many observers inside and outside the university, though they differed on what to make of it. Should Damsky’s statement that “Jews must be abolished by any means necessary” be received as a portent of murderous violence? Was it the hateful rhetoric of a contemptible but presumably nonmurderous anti-Semite? Or, given the reference to a leftist academic who wanted to abolish whiteness, was it the snide trolling of a shitposter mocking a double standard? No one knew for sure. Even the closest readers of the post could trouble themselves wondering if Damsky’s words implied something more than a call for members of that group to voluntarily abjure their own identity.

Soon, Damsky was suspended, then expelled. In suspending Damsky, the school asserted that he’d “created a material and substantial disruption to the academic operation of the UF College of Law.” When it expelled him, it cited provisions in its student code that prohibit “disruptive conduct” and “harassment”––but both provisions state that whatever they prohibit does not include “conduct protected by the First Amendment.”

In subsequent legal proceedings, the University of Florida would defend the expulsion of the student, arguing that Damsky’s words constituted “true threats,” which are not protected by the First Amendment, and were disruptive. Though public schools can prohibit some speech that is “substantially disruptive to learning,” even if, outside of schooling, the same speech would be protected, there is disagreement about whether and how that precedent applies to higher education. “UF cannot hold its adult students to a standard created for students as young as five years old,” the ACLU stated in an amicus brief supporting Damsky as he sought a preliminary injunction to reverse his expulsion. “That is especially true when the adult is engaging in speech off-campus.”

To win at that preliminary stage, Damsky had to show a substantial likelihood that he would prevail in the case overall. He cleared that high hurdle, according to Judge Allen Winsor. “Some may assume that anyone uttering such commentary is more likely to act violently than someone who does not,” he wrote in his U.S. District Court opinion, but “the test is whether Damsky’s posts constituted a ‘serious expression’ that he meant ‘to commit an act of unlawful violence.’” Acknowledging that “many would not love the idea of attending school with someone who burns crosses, marches in Nazi parades, or engages in countless other forms of offensive expression,” Winsor noted—quoting Justice William Brennan’s landmark First Amendment ruling in Texas v. Johnson—it is still the case that “the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.” Nor, the judge ruled, did the university meet the burden for showing the speech to be disruptive in a way that rendered it unprotected.

But the judge’s order to reinstate Damsky was paused pending appeal. And the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that in its estimation, the University of Florida was likely to prevail, because under the precedent set in Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, “the First Amendment does not protect speech that ‘materially disrupts classwork or involves substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of others.’” The trial court, and perhaps future appeals-court judges and the Supreme Court, will decide if they agree with the panel’s ruling that “UF students, faculty, and staff could reasonably interpret Damsky’s posts as threatening violence on UF’s campus,” and that the community “could reasonably interpret Damsky’s posts as promoting extralegal violence, and schools can regulate at least some speech that calls for illegal conduct.” (I hope other judges disagree: Such a precedent would suggest that college students can be expelled for political speech as common as “abolish whiteness,” “globalize the intifada,” and “no justice, no peace.”)

When a college decisively loses at any stage of free-speech litigation, civil libertarians typically point to the loss as a powerful case for honoring the First Amendment if only out of self-interest: Don’t expel a student like that dean did, or your school will get sued and lose too. But colleges are caught between conflicting incentives right now. Few in higher education have forgotten the 2023 congressional hearings in which Representative Elise Stefanik questioned the presidents of Harvard, MIT, and the University of Pennsylvania about anti-Semitism on campus. Each leader was asked, “Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate your rules, conduct codes, or harassment policies?” All attempted nuanced answers. For example, was the call for genocide targeted at an individual, thus amounting to harassing conduct, or was it mere vile speech?

Their answers, though legally sound, elicited a furious backlash. Stefanik called on the presidents to resign. The House passed a resolution calling the presidents “evasive and dismissive” and condemning “their failure to clearly state that calls for the genocide of Jews constitute harassment and violate their institutions’ codes of conduct.” Kathy Hochul, the governor of New York, wrote a letter to college presidents asserting that calls for genocide violate New York’s Human Rights Law, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, and SUNY’s code of conduct; she threatened “enforcement action” if colleges and universities were found not in compliance. In Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis said that he wanted the college presidents to lose their jobs (the fate that befell Liz Magill, who resigned as Penn’s president because of that viral congressional hearing on anti-Semitism). Donald Trump and his administration would later target those same universities with anti-Semitism probes and regulatory actions that threatened billions of dollars in federal funding while severely constraining their autonomy.

For administrators at the University of Florida, who declined to comment while this litigation is ongoing, the message was presumably clear: If a student calls for the genocide of Jews, deciding whether to punish them based on whether the First Amendment technically protected the speech would be seen as suspect by federal and state officials––and might, if history repeated itself, result in job loss and significant funding losses.

Then along came Damsky with a social-media post that concluded, “Jews must be abolished by any means necessary.”

“Confronting the fact pattern in his case, an institution might well ask their legal advisers if they could justify punishing the speech,” Jackie Gharapour Wernz, an attorney who advises educational institutions about complying with nondiscrimination laws such as Title VI and Title IX, told me. And she could imagine a legal adviser signing off on a punishment, despite its risks. “If they act, they may get sued for violating free-speech rights,” she explained. “If they don’t act, they may face complaints or lawsuits from students or employees claiming they’re ignoring or contributing to a hostile environment. In a very real sense, the institution is choosing which lawsuit it wants.” Institutions may decide to consider a range of risks, she said, “including political pressure, federal attention, and backlash from different parts of the community, and sometimes those pressures drive decisions as much as the legal merits.” An institution might even want to lose in court, she said, “because that gives them cover later to say, We actually can’t punish this speech.”

Damsky’s lawyer, Anthony Sabatini, believes that the political climate is affecting what would normally be a simple case about unambiguously protected speech. “UF clearly tried to use heightened political concerns about antisemitism (or what gets called antisemitism) to pressure the district judge, as you’ll see in their pleadings,” he told me via email. “The Trump administration is clearly using Title VI to unlawfully attempt to stop lawful criticism of Israel by equating it with antisemitism and will lose in court on that.”

Of course, college administrators might also punish speech of the sort Damsky deployed out of a desire to oppose anti-Semitism or to protect the educational experience of Jews. Kenneth L. Marcus, the founder and leader of the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law, a legal organization focused on fighting anti-Semitism, argues that anti-discrimination law is a vital tool for protecting the rights of Jewish students and any others targeted on the basis of their race, color, or national origin. “Whenever we take seriously our civil-rights laws, there will be questions about conduct that falls in a gray area between protected speech and unprotected activity,” he told me. “Just because there are some tough cases doesn’t mean that we should throw out the rules altogether.”

It is dangerous, he argued, “to minimize threats and to assume that persons involved in threatening communications don’t mean what they’re saying seriously.” In the Damsky case, “administrators simply cannot wait for apparently violent threats to turn lethal before they take action,” he argued. “Can you imagine if the university had done nothing and then the speaker actually followed up on his apparent threat by making an actual effort to abolish Jews by any means necessary? The university would at a minimum be held liable for its failure to exercise due care, and it should be.”

While I agree with Marcus that “the world that we’re living in since October 7, 2023, is one in which Jewish Americans and others face continuing and real threats,” and that anti-Semitism must be fought in any healthy and morally decent society, there is no simple correlation between acts of violence and rhetoric of the sort Damsky spewed. His words clearly don’t meet the long-standing Supreme Court threshold for “true threats,” and insofar as a student is secretly planning violence, expulsion presumably wouldn’t stop them. I also doubt that compelling colleges to punish students like Damsky, despite the lack of a strong legal case, is an effective way to fight anti-Semitism.

While no one, least of all Jews, deserves to live in a world with anti-Semites, nonviolent ones included, we do live in such a world. In a country where Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens expose massive audiences to the most nonsensical conspiracy theories, and as vile an anti-Semite as Nick Fuentes has more than 1 million followers on X, insulating schools from anti-Semitism is impossible. Administrators cannot make it disappear. They can, however, help students improve at countering bad ideas.

The academic philosopher Dan Williams recently argued that establishment institutions “have clung to a set of habits and norms—most fundamentally, an aversion to engaging with illiberal ideas to avoid ‘platforming’ and ‘normalising’ them—adapted to a world that no longer exists.” From his perspective, which I find persuasive, the modern internet makes this sort of aversion unwise: Gatekeepers don’t exist in the digital era, and “once established institutions lost the privilege to control the public conversation, they acquired an obligation to participate within it.” I’d feel more hopeful about the ability of American institutions to adapt if universities prepared the rising generation to rebut history’s worst ideas rather than trying to suppress them.

If Damsky returns to law school, some classmates will treat him as a social pariah who deserves scorn. Some will fear for his everlasting soul as he transgresses morality by indulging hatred. To forbear bigots is no easy thing, and it is not for me to judge how others do it. But I hope some of his classmates would use the presence of an anti-Semitic white nationalist to hone the strongest and most persuasive arguments against his views. I hope some would study the example of Daryl Davis, the Black musician who has successfully talked multiple members of the Klu Klux Klan into giving up their hoods, and that others would follow the example of the New College of Florida students who converted a white-nationalist classmate into an anti-racist activist.

Anti-discrimination laws have a role to play in academia: College administrators have an obligation to ensure that no student is denied educational opportunities on the basis of their race, religion, ethnicity, or national origin, and that, insofar as their student bodies include bigots, they don’t harass or bully Jews or anyone else. But the policing of speech that is protected by the First Amendment is both unlawful and insufficient. Perhaps, in a world where hateful speech can be distributed to mass audiences more easily than ever before, it’s even counterproductive.</div>

            <h2>How the Bernie Goetz Shootings Explain the Trump Era</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Without Trumpism, Democrats and anti–Donald Trump conservatives tell themselves, America can once again be the nation it always was. This political moment, many feel certain, is an aberration, an unfortunate detour from who we are and what we stand for. Surely, they hope, if the MAGA Republicans can just be unseated in this fall’s midterm elections, then once Trump leaves office, this country can get back on track.

But the political space we inhabit has deep roots. It did not erupt out of nowhere in 2016. The racialized rage and contempt for the rule of law that so thoroughly mark the present are the products of a longer political project set in motion during the 1980s, when the Reagan Revolution—itself anchored in white resentment—recast racial violence as necessary and defensible, restoring to it a legitimacy that had not been seen since the Jim Crow era and the Gilded Age.

Clint Smith: Those who try to erase history will fail

One particularly notorious event, which took place four decades ago on a New York City subway car just three days before Christmas, both reflected and fueled this dramatic political shift. On December 22, 1984, a downtown-bound 2 train rattled out of the 14th Street station, its walls layered in graffiti, its riders reading newspapers or staring silently in the exhausted intimacy of a city still struggling to rebound from a major fiscal crisis in the 1970s—and finding this new decade even more challenging.

On the subway car that day were four Black teenagers who lived in the same housing project in the heart of the South Bronx—Darrell Cabey, James Ramseur, Barry Allen, and Troy Canty. This neighborhood had been especially ravaged in recent years: recreational opportunities ended, public libraries closed, streets left grim by an illegal economy of drugs and sex that had become one of the few remaining ways to make money. With little else to do on what was an unseasonably balmy afternoon, this group of friends decided to head into Manhattan. Their plan for the day was modest and desperate at once—to stop at a video arcade, jimmy open a few coin receptacles, and come away with at least a few stolen dollars in their pockets.

Seated in the same car, directly across from two of the teenagers, was a white loner named Bernie Goetz. A 37-year-old single, self-employed electronics nerd living in Greenwich Village, Goetz was also trying to simply live his life in a city coming apart at the seams. He still had a decent income and a roof over his head, but Goetz’s own material security did not temper the growing resentment he felt every time he stepped outside his apartment and onto city streets. Disconcerting numbers of unhoused people were in Union Square Park, and visibly ill men—gaunt, with lesions and ragged coughs—streamed each day into the emergency room at the nearby St. Vincent’s Hospital. Meanwhile, trash littered the sidewalks and piled up on stoops, and the illicit economy seemed to occupy every corner.

Goetz understood this disorder not as the product of scant civic resources or state retreat but rather as the result of liberal misrule—do-gooder bureaucrats, failed social programs, and a city that had coddled the undeserving and the criminal. He had long since concluded that ordinary men like him would just have to look out for themselves.

When he took his seat on the 2 train that Saturday, Goetz had just spent a frustrating morning working on a piece of electrical equipment and had decided to head downtown for a bit. As he now regularly did, he was carrying a loaded .38-caliber Smith & Wesson hidden in a quick-draw holster inside his waistband.

Canty took in the white guy who had boarded at Union Square, paused the fooling-around that he had been doing with his friends—slapping at the plastic straps that hung from the ceiling of the train car, joking loudly—and greeted the man. Encouraged when he got a terse “Fine” after a “How are you?” Canty asked if the man had $5. He didn’t mind panhandling. That had become a way of life for the city’s poorest residents, young and old alike.

Allen was even more encouraged when this man stood slowly, turning as if he might be getting his wallet. But then Goetz swung back around, assumed a combat stance, and began firing.

Within seconds, Goetz shot Canty in the chest and Allen, who had been standing nearby, in the back as he tried to flee. Goetz next aimed his weapon at Ramseur and then Cabey, who sat farther down the car. He hit Ramseur, who was also trying to run. The bullet pierced Ramseur’s arm and entered his chest through his side. But Goetz’s fourth bullet missed Cabey, and the shooter was, as he later made clear, determined to take every one of the kids out.

As Cabey cowered in his seat, Goetz walked over to him and said, “You seem to be all right. Here’s another,” before shooting at him again from point-blank range.

Goetz didn’t kill these teenagers, but not because he hadn’t tried. He later said, “If I had more bullets, I would have shot ’em all again and again. My problem was I ran out of bullets.”

Yet this man, who then disappeared into the tunnels of the NYC subway system and remained on the lam for nine days, was not reviled as a vicious and violent criminal by a stunning number of New Yorkers, particularly white ones. Goetz became an overnight celebrity, heralded as a real-life “Death Wish Vigilante,” a reference to the blockbuster movies of this era, in which Charles Bronson plays a regular white guy who chooses to meet urban threats with lethal force. Here was a man who had had enough, who had done what others wished they could.

Goetz’s victims were, in turn, villainized and bombarded with hate mail. No matter that these young people were all only 18 or 19, and also unarmed and slight, the tallest of them only 5 feet 6 inches. No matter that Goetz had severed Cabey’s spinal cord and permanently paralyzed him from the waist down. No matter that Ramseur was found dead, likely from suicide, on an anniversary of this horrific event, and that Allen would descend into drug addiction.

They were deemed thugs and animals, and were said to symbolize all that was wrong with America’s cities as well as with the liberals who had enabled the city’s poor, lazy, and criminal elements. They were proof that hard-working Americans were under siege. These teens had gotten exactly what they deserved.

But the public’s reaction to the subway shooting was neither obvious nor inevitable; it was actively cultivated. Doing much of the work to normalize hatred and violence after the event were conservative, misinformation-driven media that were themselves aggressive and ascendant. The Goetz case was a long-awaited opportunity, particularly for the conservative Australian media mogul Rupert Murdoch, who dreamed of making his paper the New York Post the dominant tabloid in NYC and then taking over the entire U.S. news-media market.

From the moment that Goetz pulled the trigger on Cabey, Ramseur, Allen, and Canty, columnists from both the New York Post and the other major New York tabloid trying to hold its own, the Daily News, framed the case as a referendum on self-defense rather than an act of attempted murder. Even though the teens were the ones in ICUs and Goetz had been carrying an illegal weapon on the train that day, they were the “predator” and he was the “prey.”

During the 1980s, both tabloids pandered to the racial resentments and fears of white New Yorkers when covering all of the city’s ills. The New York Post seemed to practically invite readers to cheer for acts of white rage—in the Goetz case and the brutal white-mob killings of Black New Yorkers in Howard Beach and later in Bensonhurst—as well as to steadfastly ignore the civic wreckage that had paved the way for such acts of lawlessness in the first place.

Facts had begun to matter less and less. For example, even though it was fiction, a story that the teenagers Goetz shot were wielding sharpened screwdrivers soon became gospel in tabloid and mainstream press alike. This very much mattered to how the public felt about the case.

But what mattered more was a political shift that was taking place, one that had made it possible for the right-leaning media to profit so handsomely off the resentment and rage of ordinary people.

In 1980, Ronald Reagan took the White House. He insisted that government was bloated and inefficient, that liberal social programs bred only dependency and crime, and that law-abiding citizens, implicitly white, had been abandoned in favor of a lazy “underclass,” often marked explicitly as Black. The Reagan administration counted on Murdoch’s newspapers to hammer away at these messages on its behalf.

According to Reagan Republicans, America’s problems could be solved by cutting federal spending, slashing taxes, and gutting regulations on business. If the rich thrived, their argument went, the benefits would trickle downward to the nation as a whole.

The desire to do all of these things was not new—it had long animated the ambitions of the country’s wealthiest Americans. Ever since the New Deal had constructed a meaningful social safety net in response to the devastation of the Great Depression, the rich had sought to weaken labor, shrink the public sector, delegitimize redistributive social policies, deregulate finance and industry, and drive taxes lower. They had long insisted that private control of public life simply made sense.

Yet it was politically risky for any administration to openly slash the tax base that funded public schools, affordable housing, city services, and public-health systems. As jobs disappear, wages fall, housing and health care grow scarce, and education becomes an engine of debt, people might not only be left poorer; they also might demand accountability and redress.

Reagan Republicans fully understood the political risks of dismantling more than 50 years of public policy, yet—more effectively than any of their predecessors—they succeeded in manufacturing the popular consent needed to do precisely that. The key to this achievement was a simple but devastating insight: The most effective way to discredit liberal social policy was to starve it of resources and then point to its inevitable failure. As the Reagan aide James Cicconi explained in an internal memo, the era of “decreasing governmental resources” would make  the “liberal approach” to governance “impossible to sustain financially.” This would force the adoption of “alternatives.”

With each passing year of the 1980s, this engineered collapse was recast as proof that the nation’s problems flowed from liberal social, political, and racial policies, and from the supposed moral failures of people who, it was claimed, simply did not want to work. Inequality was framed as meritocracy.

As the Reagan Revolution matured, taxes were slashed and regulations rolled back; in turn, the social programs and city services upon which ordinary Americans depended were devastated. And as the rich grew richer and the lives of ordinary people grew more difficult, the narratives emanating from the White House down continued to blame the deepening crisis—the rise in homelessness, the AIDS epidemic, the garbage-strewn streets, the turn to illegal economies—not on policy choices but on bad people. Crime, disease, and addiction were cast as moral failures rather than as the predictable consequences of political decisions.

Arguments such as these distracted the public from rethinking the true cost of stripping public coffers and actively widening the country’s income gap. In this sense, politicians interested in remaking the economy in ways more favorable to the rich did not merely rely on racialized resentment; they also helped ensure that anger would be directed downward, toward those even less fortunate than themselves.

White Americans in particular were offered a Faustian bargain during the Reagan ’80s: accept a thinner safety net, a harsher economy, and a more unequal society—but in return, receive the emotional satisfaction of seeing the “right” people punished by an ever-expanding criminal-justice system, and the tacit assurance that if they happened to visit their own frustrations on someone who did not look like them, that same system would protect them.

Ultimately, the fueling of racial fear did extraordinary political and cultural work, fixing public attention on crime rather than wage theft, on disorder rather than deregulation, on punishment rather than the public good. The Goetz saga proved just how effectively narratives of crime, and outright misinformation, could be used to discredit government, justify inequality, and legitimize extrajudicial violence—all while claiming the mantle of common sense.

When he was finally apprehended, Goetz claimed that he had no regrets for what he did. He made no apologies for wanting “to kill those guys; I wanted to maim those guys; I wanted to make them suffer in every way I could”—not because his victims were armed (they were not), but because he felt besieged and abandoned, and thus justified in striking back. He railed at the assistant district attorney who took his statement: The subway system was “a disaster,” crime in the city was “a disaster,” and the government in charge of all of it was “a disgrace.”

Goetz’s journey through the justice system reinforced the idea that his worldview had merit. A grand jury was convened despite extraordinary public pressure to simply let him skate, and then it declined to indict Goetz on attempted-murder charges. However, word got out that Goetz had confessed to gunning down the teens, had told detectives that “robbery had nothing to do [with] it,” and, what is more, had admitted to shooting Cabey a second time. A second grand jury was convened that indicted Goetz for a range of serious charges, including attempted murder. In the trial that followed, however, a jury of Goetz’s peers decided that, despite the evidence mounted against him, he was guilty of only the most minor gun charges he faced.

Goetz served eight months in jail. The message sent to the American public was unmistakable: It is perfectly okay for at least some people to take the law into their own hands.

Goetz’s case helped build the early architecture of conservative tabloid media and inflammatory talk radio. This seeded the ecosystem of social media and Fox News coverage that, together, perfected the art of viral outrage and the mobilization of economic anxiety for political ends. And although mainstream news outlets did not openly revel in—or explicitly justify—the Goetz shootings, they did privilege coverage of urban crime and disorder over careful, sustained attention to the structural conditions and policy choices that made cities less safe and eroded the material security of ordinary people.

Equally significant was the fact that the economic and cultural transformation that this country had undergone since the 1980s was never a project confined to conservative politicians. Politicians across party lines contributed to the steady dismantling of America’s social safety net and the stoking of resentment and rage, even as they worked to channel these for their own partisan ends. Bill Clinton would deliver the most devastating blow to welfare; Trump would perfect the art of turning fear into fury.

We are still living today through the long Reagan Revolution: A teenager crosses state lines with an assault rifle and is hailed as a patriot for killing protesters; a mob storms the Capitol, convinced that violence is necessary to “save” democracy, and is pardoned; an ICE agent shoots and kills a mother and is said to have acted in self-defense, despite all evidence to the contrary; politicians denounce crime while simultaneously cutting the very social programs that ordinary people need to survive and that help sustain safe communities.

Gal Beckerman: Minnesota had its Birmingham moment

Trump did not invent these dynamics; he inherited them. He did not create the legitimacy of white grievance. And he did not usher in a new age of white racial violence or escalating income inequality; he has merely decided to unabashedly incite the former and defend the latter.

As the country moves toward the 2026 midterms, the temptation will be to treat our current racial, political, and economic crisis as a sharp break from the past; to search for singular villains; and to imagine that a return to normalcy is just one election away. But political cultures do not change course simply because their most flamboyant representatives enter or exit the stage.

The hard and necessary task now is to reckon with how past moments such as the Bernie Goetz shootings of 1984 helped remake the boundaries of how much racial violence, inequality, hatred, and indifference we as a society are willing to quietly endorse or even embrace. Only by confronting our history honestly can we begin to understand why appeals to fear remain potent, why calls for punishment eclipse demands for justice, and why the promise of democracy has been so unevenly realized.</div>

            <h2>What I Saw in Mashhad</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/01/what-i-saw-mashhad-iran/685746/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On January 9, anti-regime protests gripped Iran, and President Trump declared that the northeastern city of Mashhad had “fallen” to the opposition.

I happened to be in Mashhad from December 26 to January 14. What I witnessed in those weeks was far more complex—certainly more complex than the American president’s pronouncement, but also than the narratives originating either with state propaganda or opposition media.

Mashhad has never felt foreign to me. I come from Herat, in the west of Afghanistan, which is part of the same historic region of Persia. For me and millions of my compatriots, Mashhad is a cultural, linguistic, and emotional center that feels very much like home.

This trip was for the research institute I direct, the Afghan Institute for Strategic Studies. In preparation for our international conference, I was there to discuss developments in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan with representatives of the Iranian government, think tanks, and universities. Part of my mission was also to reach out to the Afghan diaspora.

Mashhad is Iran’s second-largest city and the spiritual capital of the Islamic Republic. It encompasses the burial place of Shiite Islam’s eighth imam, Imam Reza. It also houses the tomb of Ferdowsi, the epic poet who preserved the Persian language and imagination through the “Shahnameh,” and is the hometown of the current supreme leader. For these reasons and others, what happens in Mashhad reverberates across Iran, perhaps second only to events in Tehran itself.

The protests began in Mashhad in mid-December, and they appeared to be an expression of economic grievance. The government had enacted reforms that triggered a sudden spike in the prices of basic commodities and placed immense pressure on ordinary households. Official figures already suggested that nearly 30 percent of Iranians lived below the poverty line. The Iranian president, a heart surgeon by training, framed the painful new measures as a necessary “surgery” on an ailing economy—an attempt to excise corruption and restore the patient’s long-term health. Iranian media abounded with debates among economists and market analysts, weighing the costs and benefits of the reforms.

The news media reported merchants’ strikes in several cities—most notably in Tehran’s Grand Bazaar—and scattered political protests alongside them. The official channels emphasized a distinction between economic-driven, “legitimate” protests and “opportunistic,” externally organized, anti-regime riots. The president’s spokesperson referred to all protesters as her “grieving children,” insisting that they must be heard rather than suppressed.

In Mashhad during these early days, I encountered some small protests in relatively affluent areas, such as along Ahmad Abad Street and Vakil Abad Boulevard. Young people, their faces covered by masks, circulated through traffic and on sidewalks, chanting political slogans. They easily could have been mistaken for agitated sports fans, and their actions were small and diffuse enough that they could be quickly dispersed. On January 6, I saw a gathering of several dozen merchants in the commercial district of Bazaar Reza. These protests were modest in scale and short-lived, befitting a spontaneous expression of frustration rather than a national rebellion.

The situation escalated dramatically on the evening of  January 8. Former Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi issued a video calling for nationwide protests at 8 p.m. local time. This message coincided with provocative posts from U.S. officials, including one by former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who insinuated that Mossad agents were interspersed among the demonstrators. By about 6 p.m., internet access and all mobile and landline services had been shut down. At first, the shutdown was strangely liberating: I would find out what was happening by speaking to and watching real people, rather than through the filters of partisan news agencies and social media.

From my room I could hear occasional gunshots echoing across the city. Just after midnight, a friend and I drove to Ahmad Abad Street and then to Vakil Abad Boulevard. The scenes were startling: burning buses and cars, destroyed footbridges, and shattered traffic lights. My friend told me that protests had also raged in working-class areas along Tabarsi Boulevard, on the other side of the city, and in the suburbs of Sakhtaman and Sayedi. So we drove to Tabarsi Boulevard too, and saw even more severe damage—public buildings vandalized, streets littered with debris. The protesters, however, were gone. Riot police still patrolled these areas on motorbikes, and the city’s fire brigade and municipal workers were out cleaning streets and extinguishing fires. We didn’t see or hear any ambulances.

The next day was Friday, and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei gave a stern speech in Tehran, warning that the regime would no longer tolerate “agitators.” The state media abruptly changed the tenor of its coverage: What it earlier described as a social and economic crisis was now termed an armed insurrection. Protesters were now terrorists, Islamic State affiliates, and American or Zionist agents.

Mashhad was tense but calm during the day. Everyone I spoke with anticipated renewed unrest at 8 p.m., again in response to Pahlavi’s call. At about 2 a.m. on Saturday, I went back to Ahmad Abad, Vakil Abad, and Tabarsi. The streets were completely deserted—even the riot police and municipal workers were gone—and the scale of the destruction was even more shocking than it had been the previous night.

That day, Trump claimed that more than a million people were demonstrating in Mashhad and that the city had fallen under protesters’ control. His second claim was partially accurate, insofar as riot police and plainclothes security forces, very much in evidence the night before, did appear to have temporarily withdrawn. But the first claim, about the number of the protesters, seemed to me highly implausible. I visited four of what I’m told were about 10 protest locations around the city (the remaining ones were located in nearby neighborhoods). These were confined areas, and the protests within them lasted no more than three to five hours. To imagine tens of thousands of protesters in these urban pockets is already a stretch, and far shy of a million. This does not negate the existence of hundreds of thousands of angry and disillusioned Mashhadis, but anger does not automatically translate into street mobilization.

On Saturday, January 10, the city was quiet. Security forces were far more visible than during past days of protests—and more heavily armed. The riot police I’d seen on Thursday night had shotguns; now I saw some carrying AK-47s and even heavy machine guns. From Thursday onward, long queues formed outside bakeries, pharmacies, and grocery stores as people prepared for the worst. Pahlavi shifted his call to action from 8 p.m. to 6 p.m., and starting in the early afternoon, entire neighborhoods emptied, resembling the eerie calm of COVID lockdowns. That night, the protests were reportedly smaller and less violent.

The state organized pro-government demonstrations throughout the country for Monday, January 12. In Mashhad, these took place near the Imam Reza Shrine—the city’s focal monument and a center of pilgrimage and religious observance—during daylight hours. I happened to be visiting a museum within the shrine complex when thousands of people surged onto Imam Reza Boulevard. Pilgrims, tourists, and demonstrators were swept up together in the crowd. The event included a public burial for 20 security personnel reportedly killed during the unrest. Unlike the anti-government protesters, who had reason to fear recognition and reprisal, those carrying pro-government placards showed their faces. Still, uncertainty, bewilderment, and fear were palpable.

That day marked the beginning of a new phase. Life in Mashhad gradually returned to normal, with the so-called national internet (not connected to the outside world) and phone services partially restored. The opposition media and some of my local contacts began reporting mass casualties and mass arrests. I asked my Mashhadi acquaintances if they personally knew people who had been killed or injured: Two-thirds said they did. The city’s Rezvan cemetery and morgue were set aside for the victims, and three people I knew who went there told me that they saw hundreds of bodies awaiting identification. A few days later, state media quoted a senior security official who acknowledged that about 400 people had been killed in Mashhad and nearby towns, but asserted that 80 percent of them had been “martyred” by anti-regime elements. So many people had been arrested that a major police station was allocated for families seeking missing relatives.

Read: The online world where Iranians were free

Because of the limitations that remained on outside communication and the internet, most of us in Mashhad were still getting our information from state media, opposition satellite channels, and word of mouth. In the days following January 12, state media assured viewers that order had been restored to Iranian cities after an outburst of “anti-Islamic” unrest. The opposition outlets—most notably Iran International, a satellite channel based in London—reported that Iran was in the throes of a full-scale revolution, led by Reza Pahlavi, and that it was on the brink of victory. Both narratives seemed like exercises in cognitive dissonance for those of us on the ground.

Speculation about Iran’s future has since gone global. Four broad scenarios seem to hold sway. The first is stagnation under the continued rule of a supreme leader who is disinclined to bargain with protesters or foreign powers. The second is transformational reform from within, akin to China under Deng Xiaoping. The third is the eventual victory of a grassroots, nonviolent movement, as in East Germany, Poland, or South Africa. And the fourth is externally supported, violent regime change.

Each scenario has plausible foundations. The Islamic Republic has demonstrated an extraordinary capacity to project and absorb pain. Like many revolutionary regimes, it is more tolerant of violence—both inflicted and endured—than its opponents assume. And so this cycle of protest and repression, too, could pass.

But it is also true that for more than a century, popular movements in Iran have repeatedly sought more accountable governance. These groundswells have had some success. The Women, Life, Freedom movement of 2022 achieved a major cultural victory by effectively challenging the state’s enforcement of women’s dress codes. In Mashhad in January, I saw many young women in public without hijab, and they did not appear to face reprisals from either the government or the conservative segments of society. Khamenei is likely in his final years, and his succession could present a moment for transformative change from within. Some voices within the system have long called for this. Fatemeh Sepehri, a political prisoner from Mashhad, has openly advocated for removing the supreme leader and holding free elections to draft a new constitution.

The final scenario, violent regime change, has a precedent in the 1979 revolution. But unlike then, some of those calling for a revolution today are also pleading for American or Israeli intervention to help achieve it. Supporters of Pahlavi were particularly vocal in Mashhad this month, as attested by the prevalence of pro-monarchy graffiti on city walls, and the regime’s propaganda devoted particular attention to discrediting the former crown prince. During the state-orchestrated demonstration, Khamenei’s representative in Mashhad mocked Pahlavi by recalling how the shah, despite decades as “America’s puppet,” had been denied entry to the United States in the last days of his life.

Iranians can and will chart their country’s destiny. For the moment, however, the country is mourning its thousands of dead—their precise numbers, identities, and circumstances still unclear. Justice and accountability for these victims are not a peripheral issue; they are the foundation of any scenario for the future.

The scene at the Mashhad airport the day I left, January 14, was profoundly emotional. Only a small number of passengers had been fortunate enough to secure tickets for the day’s last flight to Istanbul. The departure lounge felt less like a transit space than a place of mourning. Passengers and their accompanying relatives wept openly. Not only grief but also anxiety infused the room, amid media reports of imminent U.S. military strikes that could usher in an uncertain and violent future.

As my plane ascended, I looked out at the light beams emanating from the Goharshad Mosque at the Imam Reza Shrine below. The historic region from which both Mashhad and Herat take their identity is Khorasan—literally, “where the sun rises.” I found this consoling in that moment, reminded of the dawn and its fragile but persistent promise.</div>

            <h2>Why Is Trump Cozying Up to China?</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-26</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As President Trump has charged into a conflict with American allies over Greenland in recent weeks, he has also been pursuing an unlikely new friend: Communist China. Even for a politician known for erratic policy shifts, this swap—of longtime democratic partners that have sacrificed much for America’s benefit in exchange for an authoritarian regime intent on undermining it—is bizarre. It also highlights the risks that Trump’s personalized form of diplomacy presents to American national security and the balance of global power.

Although a hard line on China was a centerpiece of Trump’s first term, he has gone soft in his second. The president has removed nearly all of the tariffs that he imposed on Chinese imports last year, and he has loosened controls on the sale of advanced American semiconductors to China—over the objections of national-security experts—on the condition that Nvidia coughs up a cut of its sales to the U.S. government. Trump also hailed his October 2025 summit with China’s leader, Xi Jinping, as a meeting of the “G2,” or “Group of 2,” a flattering nod to the idea that the United States and China are the two most powerful countries in the world.

Trump has also lately seemed to take Beijing’s side regarding Taiwan, which China continues to claim as its own. The Trump administration has scaled down its interactions with Taiwan’s government, and in November, the president reportedly asked Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi to not escalate a dispute with Beijing over comments she had made about China’s threat to Taiwan. That conversation took place shortly after Trump had spoken with Xi, who reinforced Beijing’s position on Taiwan.

Even the most well-connected China experts in Washington are left guessing about what Trump hopes to achieve by placating Xi. One possibility is that Trump’s pivot is a strategic feint to secure a truce in a trade war that has revealed significant American vulnerabilities. Given China’s dominance of rare earth materials, which are vital to advanced manufacturing, Xi’s restrictions on exports in response to Trump’s tariffs had harmed U.S. industries. In negotiations with Washington, Xi pledged to restart supplies and temporarily suspend some of China’s export controls on these metals, but he could easily resume these measures if tensions escalate again.

Trump may be appeasing Xi to buy some time as he seeks alternative sources of rare earths—in Greenland and elsewhere. But considering that securing these commodities could take years of U.S. investment, Trump may be pacifying Xi for longer than he expected.

Trump’s approach to China may have changed with his political calculations. His earlier attacks shored up his appeal with blue-collar voters who had been hurt by international trade and the export of manufacturing jobs overseas. Trump entered office in 2017 vowing to right the injustices caused by liberal globalists. Now he seems to think that he has more to gain from cozying up to China. At his meeting with Xi in October, Trump secured a crackdown on China’s exports of the chemicals used to make illicit fentanyl, and a promise that China would buy significant quantities of soybean imports from American farmers—a key Republican constituency.

Trump’s softer touch seems to have won Beijing’s consent for an arrangement to keep TikTok operating in the U.S.—allowing him to fulfill a political promise. The deal, finalized this month with ByteDance, the Chinese internet company that owns TikTok, hands control of the U.S. operation to a consortium of investors that includes Larry Ellison of Oracle, a Trump ally. Xi further rewarded Trump’s shift in tone by inviting him to visit Beijing in April, appealing to the U.S. president’s penchant for high-profile diplomatic summits.

Trump has also always had a thing for autocrats. He has praised Xi as “highly respected”—a description he has also used for Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and others. Trump’s diplomacy is often guided by his preference for strongmen over more trustworthy, democratically elected allies. And like any schoolyard bully, Trump prefers to pick on countries that can’t fight back. Yet Xi’s potent response to Trump’s trade war has shown that the Chinese leader can fight back—and will.

Despite his fiery rhetoric in his first term, Trump spent a great deal of time negotiating a trade pact with Beijing, which both sides signed in 2020. This time around, Trump seems to have gone rogue. A rare issue on which Republicans and Democrats agree is that China presents a real threat to the United States—economically, militarily, and otherwise. But Trump has been reluctant to press China on issues of urgent national interest. Although he imposed extra tariffs on India last year to curb the country’s purchase of Russian oil, which helps fund Putin’s war in Ukraine, he has largely given a pass to China, the biggest consumer of Russian crude. Earlier this month, the president green-lighted a bill imposing tariffs on countries that buy Russian oil, but the White House has insisted that the legislation grants Trump some latitude in how he applies these sanctions.

Anyone hoping to ascribe a grand strategy to these moves must reckon with the inconsistency of Trump’s approach to China. Following its capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, his administration has reportedly pressured Venezuela to expel advisers from China. This, together with Trump’s threats to Greenland, seem to be part of a larger effort to push Beijing out of the Western Hemisphere. Such unpredictability drives home just how personal—and erratic—foreign policy has become under Trump. In a recent analysis of the administration’s new National Security Strategy, a group of Brookings Institution scholars noted just “how much U.S. foreign policy now hinges on one mercurial leader.”

From the March 2026 issue: America vs. the world

With this, China and the U.S. have something in common. In Beijing, Xi has centralized policy making in his own hands—and to a greater extent than Trump can ever hope for, given China’s authoritarian political system. Whereas Trump is a flip-flopper, Xi has proved relentlessly committed to a fixed agenda. Nearly everything he does is meant to expand China’s global power and advance its technological and industrial dominance. Although Trump’s desire for Greenland is ostensibly about reducing China’s influence in the Arctic, the president’s conflict with NATO allies must delight Xi because it precludes international coordination to contain China.

Some in China see Trump’s softening as a great opportunity for Xi to press for more concessions. Da Wei, the director of the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University, in Beijing, recently suggested in Foreign Affairs that the U.S.-China relationship was at an “inflection point,” making this an opportune moment to further reduce tensions and move “toward a more normal relationship.” To help things along, he recommended that the U.S. curb its “politically provocative” naval missions near China. Although he didn’t say so explicitly, he likely meant operations in the South China Sea, which is officially international waters, but Beijing claims it as its own. Da also counseled Trump to declare U.S. opposition to Taiwanese independence—which would mark a radical change in U.S. policy. Both steps, if Trump were to take them, would be cause for alarm among American allies. In return, Da wrote, China should scale back military exercises around Taiwan and “increase cross-strait exchanges”—neither of which are really concessions to Washington.

China has a strong incentive to push for these compromises now, given how Trump’s fickle nature could suddenly shut the window of opportunity. Beijing is also well aware that American democracy is inherently prone to flip-flops and that the hard-line Washington consensus on China is likely to return with the next election. At this point, only one thing is certain: In what has become a contest between two men, victory will go to the leader who operates strategically and with discipline, not erratically and on impulse.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The six-car ICE convoy came to a stop and instantly dozens of people swarmed it, cellphones in hand, while others ran out of nearby houses—I saw a woman in gym shorts in the 20-degree weather—and began surrounding the masked and heavily armed agents who had spilled out of their black SUVs. The fury in the crowd felt almost like a physical force, as real as the cacophony of whistles and honking cars and angry chants: “ICE out! Fuck you! Go home!”

The officers threw a protester to the slushy asphalt and piled on top of him, then cuffed him and dragged him away. The screaming only got louder. With their escape route blocked by protesters and their cars, the agents tossed out tear-gas canisters, the white clouds billowing up into the winter air. An injured man stumbled past me and vomited repeatedly into the snow.

From where I stood, a few yards back from the scrum last Wednesday afternoon, it looked, at best, to be a savage caricature of our national divide: on one side, militarized men demanded respect at the butt of a gun; on the other, angry protesters screamed for justice.

But behind the violence in Minneapolis—captured in so many chilling photographs in recent weeks—is a different reality: a meticulous urban choreography of civic protest. You could see traces of it in the identical whistles the protesters used, in their chants, in their tactics, in the way they followed ICE agents but never actually blocked them from detaining people. Thousands of Minnesotans have been trained over the past year as legal observers and have taken part in lengthy role-playing exercises where they rehearse scenes exactly like the one I witnessed. They patrol neighborhoods day and night on foot and stay connected on encrypted apps such as Signal, in networks that were first formed after the 2020 killing of George Floyd.

Again and again, I heard people say they were not protesters but protectors—of their communities, of their values, of the Constitution. Vice President Vance has decried the protests as “engineered chaos” produced by far-left activists working in tandem with local authorities. But the reality on the ground is both stranger and more interesting. The movement has grown much larger than the core of activists shown on TV newscasts, especially since the killing of Renee Good on January 7. And it lacks the sort of central direction that Vance and other administration officials seem to imagine.

At times, Minneapolis reminded me of what I saw during the Arab Spring in 2011, a series of street clashes between protesters and police that quickly swelled into a much larger struggle against autocracy. As in Cairo’s Tahrir Square, Minneapolis has seen a layered civic uprising where a vanguard of protesters has gained strength as many others who don’t share progressive convictions joined in feeling, if not always in person. I heard the same tones of outrage from parents, ministers, school teachers, and elderly residents of an affluent suburb. Some of the quarrels that divided Minneapolis city leaders only a few weeks ago, over policing or Gaza or the budget, have faded as people have come together to oppose ICE.

“Overall, this community has exercised enormous restraint,” Allison Sharkey, the executive director of the Lake Street Council, which represents many minority-owned businesses that have been hit hard by the ICE raids, told me. “But we have been pushed, probably intentionally, towards civil unrest.”

And as with the Arab uprisings, there is profound unease about where it is all leading—especially now that two people have been shot dead in scenes like the one I witnessed—alongside an undertow of hope that Minnesota can provide the rest of the country with a model of democratic resistance.

Over the past year, a three-story brick building in south Minneapolis has become a magnet for people who feel they—and their neighbors—need protection from their own government. The nonprofit that runs training sessions there asked me not to identify its location. When I visited, an ebullient labor organizer named Emilia Gonzalez Avalos was standing onstage in front of a packed auditorium, talking about the facial-recognition technology used by ICE agents, who routinely photograph protesters. “Everyone is at risk now,” she said. Behind her, a screen offered bullet points on how to legally observe ICE raids.

Avalos told me that 65,000 people have received the training, most of them since December. “We started in a very different tone; it was preventive,” she said. Now, after Good’s death, “people are understanding the stakes in a different way.”

I went upstairs to see breakout sessions where people were being trained for direct confrontations with ICE. Inside a classroom, several dozen people ranging in age from 14 to about 70 faced off against three trainers playing ICE agents, in a loud fracas that lasted several minutes. Afterward, the trainers offered the volunteers a critique. One gray-haired lady said she had found the exercise difficult, “not being a ‘Fuck you’ person.” Others got tips on how to brace themselves more effectively so that the agents could not easily knock them down.

Before I left, I watched the trainers put the group through two more simulations: an unexpected ICE raid on a neighbor’s home and a planned demonstration at an airport that ICE is using to deport people. The second scenario appeared to come to life a few days later, when about 100 clergy members were arrested for protesting at the Minneapolis–St. Paul International Airport.

The participants I spoke with did not seem like typical protest types. One of them, a driver’s ed teacher who asked me to identify him only as Dave, told me, “I do not like confrontation at all, and that’s another reason that it’s weird I went to the training.” But in light of what is happening around him, he felt he needed what the trainers had to offer. His 14-year-old daughter, who attended the training with him, told me, “It was kind of overwhelming. But I don’t think it could be too much, because they’re just being realistic.”

The nonprofit groups that run these training sessions are not organizing or directing the anti-ICE protests taking place in the Twin Cities. No one is. This is a leaderless movement—like the Arab Spring protests—that has emerged in a spontaneous and hyperlocal way. The people who follow ICE convoys (they call themselves “commuters,” a verbal gesture that is part joke and part effort to elude government surveillance) have organized on a neighborhood basis, using Signal groups. The man who drove me to the ICE raids I witnessed—a lawyer, activist, and social-media figure named Will Stancil—had a cellphone fixed above the windshield of his car, and I could hear people tracking the location of the ICE convoy as it passed through their neighborhoods on a Signal audio chat. It was like being inside a police car that is getting updates by radio from a dispatcher.

You do not have to get tear-gassed to observe all of this self-organization; it is visible to anyone walking through Minneapolis. One bitterly cold morning, I approached a man standing across the street from an elementary school, a blue whistle around his neck. He told me his name was Daniel (he asked not to be identified further, because his wife is an immigrant) and that he stood watch every morning for an hour to make sure the kids got into school safely. Other local volunteers come by regularly to bring him coffee and baked goods, or to exchange news. These community watches take place outside schools throughout the Twin Cities, outside restaurants and day-care centers, outside any place where there are immigrants or people who might be mistaken for them.

“It’s kind of unorganized-organized,” Daniel said, when I asked how the school monitoring worked. “George Floyd connected everybody.”

The local networks that formed after Floyd’s killing were not just about fighting racism. During those febrile weeks in May and June of 2020, there were looters and provocateurs of all kinds on the streets, and so much anger had been directed at the police that they pulled back from parts of the city. Many neighborhoods began organizing local watches simply to defend themselves.

I had been talking with Daniel for only a few minutes when a tall man walked up, said he was a parent observer for the school we stood across from, and asked me to identify myself. When I showed him my press badge, he seemed friendlier, but still wary. He explained that he had heard reports of ICE agents impersonating journalists. I asked about the parent patrol, and he apologized, saying he couldn’t give out any information.

Inside the schools, many administrators have been making their own preparations over the past year. Amanda Bauer, a teacher at a Minneapolis elementary school that has a large portion of immigrant students, told me that administrators informed parents last fall about their emergency plans for ICE raids by phone or in person, because they were already concerned about leaving email chains that could be mined by a hostile government.

Bauer, who is 49, struggled to maintain her composure as she described the day early this month when ICE showed up in force outside her school. Agents had been circling the school since December, seemingly learning its routines, and they arrested some parents just before the winter break. But this time, agents leapt out in riot gear and began entering the apartments just across from the school, where many students live.

“We had to lock down and keep the kids inside, and parents linked arms to block the school entrance,” Bauer said. “We had a student who was looking out the window and saw them break into his apartment and just sobbed, ‘That’s my house. That’s my home.’ And we shut the blinds, but it was too late.”

Bauer has been a teacher for 25 years, a period that has included a rise of school shootings and the drills that have become common to protect against them. “But I never thought it would be our own government we had to protect the kids from,” she told me. “We kept them physically safe, but they saw what happened.”

As she spoke, Bauer’s hands were trembling. She held them up and smiled weakly. “I don’t think I’ve stopped shaking for two weeks,” she said.

Children were a moral fault line for many of the people I met in the Twin Cities—not just the children of immigrants, who are at risk of losing their parents or being deported themselves, but also their white peers in schools and day-care centers.

I met a couple in their 70s who told me they had never considered joining a political protest until ICE came to town, and they realized that their granddaughter was at risk of witnessing a violent immigration raid just by going to school. Dan and Jane (like many others, they asked that I shield their full names) live in a large house in a comfortable suburb, where they welcomed me with tea and cookies.

“When a child witnesses violence or crime, it’s profoundly different from adults,” Dan said. “It leaves scars.”

Dan and Jane resisted the idea that they had become political. A better word, Jane said, was humanist. Their anger was unmistakable as they told me that the Trump administration was violating basic Christian principles. “It became clear very quickly that ICE is the Proud Boys, the Boogaloo boys. They’ve given them uniforms and let them run wild,” Dan said. He attended a legal-observer training—which happened to have been on the day Good was killed—and now the couple delivers groceries regularly to immigrant families in Minneapolis. This past Friday, Dan joined thousands of others at a protest in Minneapolis, where his fingers were frostbitten in the –9 degrees Fahrenheit weather.

I arrived in Minneapolis 11 days after an ICE agent shot Good in the face. Her picture was hanging like a religious icon on windows and walls all over the city. To many who had not already become involved, her death was a call to action.

One of those latecomers was a 46-year-old documentary filmmaker named Chad Knutson. On the morning after Good was killed, he was at home with his two hound dogs, watching a live feed from the Whipple Building, where ICE is based, a five-minute drive from his house. A protester had laid a rose on a makeshift memorial to Good. As Knutson watched, an ICE agent took the rose, put it in his lapel, and then mockingly gave it to a female ICE agent. They both laughed.

Knutson told me he had never been a protester. It seemed pointless, or just a way for people to expiate their sense of guilt. But when he saw those ICE agents laughing, something broke inside him.

“I grab my keys, I grab a coat, and drive over,” Knutson told me. “I barely park my car and I’m running out screaming and crying, ‘You stole a fucking flower from a dead woman. Like, are any of you human anymore?’”

His voice was so thick with emotion that it felt almost as if he were telling a story of religious conversion. It reminded me again of the Tahrir Square protests in 2011, when so many people seemed to have reached a moral and political turning point.

Knutson now goes to the Whipple Building almost daily, bringing thermoses of hot coffee for the people who hold up signs and bellow at the ICE agents and convoys as they drive in and out. He has been tear-gassed so many times, he said, his voice has gone hoarse. When I met him at his house in St. Paul, a row of megaphones was on the counter. He hands them out along with the coffee. He once brought an ice-fishing clam, a portable shelter, to the Whipple to help the protesters withstand the subzero temperatures.

Knutson mentioned in passing that his neighbor had “an adopted brown kid down there; they hid her in the basement yesterday.” This kind of thing no longer sounds weird in Minneapolis. Many people are hiding indoors—so many that, in a city with a substantial minority population, I hardly saw any Black or Latino faces on the street.

All this sheltering has created an economic crisis that has grown worse by the day. Many immigrant-owned businesses have seen their sales drop by as much as 80 percent, said Allison Sharkey, of the Lake Street Council. Large numbers have shut their doors entirely, fearing for themselves or their employees. Sharkey called it “an assault on our entire Main Street.”

The Karmel Mall, a maze-like shopping hub for tens of thousands of east African immigrants in the Twin Cities, is usually packed with people drawn to the aromas of stewed goat and coffee and sambusa pastries, but when I visited, the place was silent, and most of the stalls were empty. At the far end I found some businesses still open, with a handful of customers. Several people looked frightened when I tried to ask questions, saying they didn’t speak English well or that the owner would be back in an hour.

One man willing to chat, a 42-year-old named Ziad who was sipping coffee by himself, quickly showed me his passport card, saying he had come to the United States from Somalia decades ago. He has a master’s degree in public health and was working in a community center, he said, but now it’s closed. “Nobody’s being paid,” he said. “Everybody is scared.” His children are attending school online, as they did during the coronavirus pandemic, and his wife almost never leaves home. The visits to the mosque and to family members and friends that sustained their emotional lives are on hold.

But Donald Trump “will go and we will stay,” he said. “We Somalis know how to survive. We’ve been through a lot—civil war, refugee camps.”

The Somali refugees who began coming to the Twin Cities in the early 1990s did so with the help of religious organizations and churches, especially Lutheran and Catholic parishes, that have a history of welcoming people fleeing war and famine. Those groups have been at the forefront of the resistance to ICE, and some of their leaders have been asking difficult questions: When does protest cross the line into violence? When is it morally acceptable to break the law? How do you retain the trust of people who are uncomfortable defying the authorities?

“We’re going to have to live with our discomfort in making other people uncomfortable,” Ingrid Rasmussen, the lead pastor at Holy Trinity Lutheran Church, who has been one of the most outspoken clergy members in the city, told me.

Last June, federal agents raided a taqueria near her church. She ran to the scene, she told me, and found a crowd of protesters facing off against heavily armed agents being protected by local police. Rasmussen was wearing her clerical robes and was thrown to the ground by a sheriff in plainclothes. Some in the crowd threw trash, bottles, and tires at the federal agents, according to a local news report. Video footage spread of Rasmussen shouting at the Minneapolis police chief: “You stand in my church … You promised me a better relationship.”

“It was like nothing I had ever seen before in Minneapolis,” Rasmussen told me.

That was a remarkable thing to hear, because Rasmussen’s church was near the center of the riots that took place after the killing of George Floyd in 2020. “Everything to the west of our building burned,” she told me. During that period, her church became a medical site for injured people. She and her congregation worked for years to help rebuild the neighborhood.

The new round of ICE raids has struck even closer to home for the church, whose congregation includes a large number of immigrants. Rasmussen, who has young children, has continued to put herself in harm’s way. She was among the 120 clergy members who took part in a sit-in at the corporate headquarters of Target on January 15, in an effort to get the company to take a stronger stand against the federal raids. And on January 23, she was among those arrested during the protest at the Minneapolis airport.

On the morning of January 24, Rasmussen got word that a man had been shot by ICE agents. She put on her warmest winter clothes and went to the scene, on Nicollet Avenue and West 26th Street, figuring she might be outside for hours.

By the time she got there, Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse, was dead. The federal agents who had wrestled him to the ground and then shot and killed him were throwing tear gas and flash-bangs at a crowd of furious protesters chanting “Shame!”

Rasmussen attended another protest that afternoon. When we spoke hours later, her voice sounded weary, as if she wasn’t sure what such gestures of defiance would accomplish. She found it “almost unbearable” to witness such brutality from her government day after day, she told me. And it was galling to hear people in power say that they were acting in defense of freedom. The streets still looked like a war zone, with flash-bangs detonating and clouds of tear gas in the air.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Chances are, you’ve seen Richard Tsong-Taatarii’s photo. Taken Wednesday in Minneapolis, it shows an unidentifiable protester face down on the ground; two Border Patrol agents are on top of him, holding him there, while a third unloads pepper spray into his face from just inches away.

Tomorrow’s front page of the Minnesota Star Tribune: Jan. 23, 2026  [image or embed]

The photo ran on the front page of The Minnesota Star Tribune on Friday and already feels like a defining image of the long ICE incursion in Minneapolis—a powerful illustration of how the agency has acted, in broad daylight, with excessive force and impunity.

This is just one example of federal agents terrorizing people in the city. There’s also the photo of a 5-year-old boy being detained outside his home. There’s the video of an agent chasing a teenager through the snow on a residential street as the boy yells “I’m legal” in Spanish. And yesterday, the world saw footage of Alex Pretti, a nurse who worked in the ICU of a Veterans Affairs hospital, as agents pepper-sprayed him, knocked him down, appeared to remove a legally permitted gun from his person, and fired at least 10 bullets into his prone body. (Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino has claimed that the agents were the “real victims” and suggested that they were acting in self-defense.)

There are still unknowns in this case, as there are in many of the chaotic moments that have come out of ICE’s recent surge in Minneapolis. But there are basic facts: Pretti was helping a woman when agents swarmed him. He did not have a gun in his hand. In the past 18 days, agents have used excessive force against numerous people in Minneapolis and killed two of them—first Renee Good, now Pretti. We know about this violence—we can see it ourselves from numerous angles—largely because of video and photographic evidence taken by everyday citizens, many of whom have purposefully set out to make sure that they are recording what is happening for the world to see.

Tsong-Taatarii credits these volunteers, many of whom are trying to protect their neighbors, for his now-famous shot. On Wednesday, Tsong-Taatarii had been following Bovino but realized that was “a wild goose chase,” and was alerted by a group to an escalating situation in South Minneapolis. He drove over and got the photo. When I spoke with him on Friday, he told me that protest observers have set up Signal group chats, which help track agents’ movements across the city. He uses the chats to make sure he can be in the right place at the right time to document what is happening.

If it still is not clear why this matters, compare the documented reality with the Trump administration’s blatant propaganda. The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement yesterday that Pretti “wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.” Similarly, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller called Pretti a “would-be assassin” who “tried to murder federal law enforcement.” Video footage directly contradicts these claims. It shows Pretti holding a phone in his hand, pointing it at an agent after another shoved a woman. He was shot again and again while on the ground.

The full evidence around Pretti’s death has not yet been released. If he was indeed filming agents before he was shot, there is likely first-person footage on his phone. But Pretti’s last seconds were captured from multiple angles, in sickening footage widely distributed on social media and by news organizations. It is able to be seen and dissected online precisely because of the observers who were there to document it, who watched as federal agents piled atop Pretti and who did not drop their phones when the gunshots rang out.

The work of observers and photographers in Minneapolis right now is as dangerous as it is crucial, because ICE’s presence in Minneapolis is provoking not only physical conflict but an informational conflict. Agents themselves are pulling out their phones during altercations with protesters. According to The Washington Post, the White House has urged ICE to “produce videos for social media of immigrant arrests and confrontations to portray its push for mass deportation as critical to protecting the American way of life.” Last week, President Trump posted on Truth Social that ICE must “start talking about” the people they’re arresting in Minnesota, writing: “Show the Numbers, Names, and Faces of the violent criminals, and show them NOW.” When the footage doesn’t suit the administration, it seems to have no issue doctoring images to suit its alternate reality, as it did on Thursday. Agents had arrested an attorney who was protesting at a local church, and the White House posted a photo of this woman that was altered, presumably by AI, to make it look like she was crying.

A dark irony of our current age is that there is more video and photographic evidence than ever before, and yet propagandists can coerce or convince others to not believe what they can see with their own eyes. (See also: January 6, 2021.)

If the truth is ever to win out over propaganda, it can only do so in the face of overwhelming evidence, the collection of which has become ever more treacherous in the second year of Trump’s second presidency. But the news and footage of Pretti’s death seems to have broken through the usual informational chaos—at least to some extent. On Reddit, Instagram, and Facebook pages, the videos of Pretti’s last moments appear to have galvanized people who don’t normally engage or post about politics. And it is thanks to the bystander videos of Pretti’s killing that people are trying to hold the administration accountable. This morning, the CNN host Dana Bash referenced the footage in an interview with Bovino, asking him why Pretti was shot after being disarmed. “We’re not going to adjudicate that here on TV in one freeze frame,” Bovino replied. “It’s not a freeze frame,” Bash said. “We’re showing a video of one of your agents taking the gun away. And that happened before Pretti was shot.”

Minneapolis residents are risking their lives to document what is happening to their city. In Pretti’s case, doing so cost him everything. We should believe what we can see with our own eyes. One can only imagine what Miller and the administration might have said about the shooting and Pretti if there weren’t an abundance of footage. Thankfully, because of the observers, the world can see for itself.</div>

He advocates for ignoring copyright law, which is fine, but on the other hand, copyright law is the basis of how the GPL actually has meaning.

If he advocated for everything always being public domain, that&#39;s a consistent stance.  However, it&#39;s a bit weird to say that people shouldn&#39;t respect copyright, unless it&#39;s respecting the copyright as it pertains to GPL software.

He advocates for ignoring copyright law, Based on the summary he didn&#39;t advocate ignoring copyright law. In the link in the summary, he advocated changing copyright law. I didn&#39;t watch the video in the summary, but it&#39;s summarized in the summary. 
Where are you quoting him that he advocated ignoring copyright law?

Probably to do with his age. At some point your cognitive functions go into decline so much, that you can no longer think logically and just start repeating what you remember from your life. That&#39;s how all those old grandads who always tell the same stories come to be.

Interesting question. GPL forces people to share their modifications, and disallows tivoization (using technical means to prevent running modified software). It&#39;s a contract, but I&#39;m not sure you could force people to enter into it without copyright.

Nah, it&#39;s not the realisation about the cost at all. I couldn&#39;t give a flying fuck about the cost.

It&#39;s about convenience. If $15 a month saves me hours searching for and downloading pirated films, it&#39;s money well spent.

Piracy is more convenient. I use the TV calendar site to track shows I&#39;m interested in, and Greasemonkey to inject some Javascript that adds links directly to The Pirate Bay searches for each episode. After a few clicks I have a DRM free file that just works, and I can use Kodi rather than some crappy app that is little more than a wrapper around a broken website.

I wouldn&#39;t mind buying Bluray discs, except that they keep trying to stop me ripping them into a more convenient format. So I just buy other merch

When I was young or a young adult, both the young and the old were copying music and videos (reel-to-reel or cassette tapes, VHS cassettes) for personal use among friends and the wider family all day long.

Are hundreds of millions of dollars, the least of which, by the way, find their way to the ground personnel in such productions, well spent in making a movie, of all things? I, for one, don&#39;t think so.No it wasn&#39;t legal at any time. It was just not enforced heavily as people were still buying records and it required physical interaction to make EACH copy. However when digital copying became possible, record industry became really scared. ;)

Regarding costs, yes, they are overblown. In part due to inflation too. But making those lifelike visual effects takes time and effort and that needs money to pay for expertise and resources. Plus actor payments also have been inflated to the high orbit...

What you describe makes perfect sense if costs represented effort and everybody got paid what they deserve. That&#39;s not the case for a lot of things, especially movies, so I don&#39;t think your example is great.

72 year old male arrested on suspicion of piracy and wire fraud after a warrant was executed at his home. (they always throw in wire fraud as a bonus, regardless of the actual crime).

We all have strong opinions about rms. Some of his ideas are wacky. Some of his ideas are brilliant. I think this is one of his more insightful takes.

Copyright law has a distinction between commercial for-profit infringement, which is regarded as a criminal offense [cornell.edu] vs. noncommercial infringement which is regarded as a civil offense.

I think this distinction is useful, but it&#39;s one degree too severe. For-profit infringement should be the civil offense, and noncommercial infringement (consumer copying) should be fully legal [freepubliclibrary.org], just as rms is saying.

Why? Because copyright wasn&#39;t created to allow authors to impose a toll on every individual consumption of every individual work, otherwise libraries wouldn&#39;t have been widespread alongside early copyright laws.

Instead, copyright law was created to make sure the author of a work was the only one who had any right to make any profit at all off of their work.

People often forget this, but the origin of copyright law is important to remember. The Statute of Anne [american.edu] was passed to address the growing problem of people making and selling copies of books they were not the author of, an activity which became much more common once the printing press was invented. The law was passed with the intention of protecting London&#39;s publishing business from this unfair competition and in the centuries that followed, other countries passed similar laws. Notably absent from this law: a ban on libraries or noncommercial sharing of books.

That&#39;s why file sharing should be legal, and business models should adapt to the decades-old reality that file sharing is widespread and inevitable. Some businesses have adapted rather well. While it&#39;s unfortunate that DRM is widespread, things like streaming services aren&#39;t that bad an adaptation. They just need a bit more adapting to truly embrace the 21st century.

Also, as a fun aside, one thing that baffles me is if for-profit copyright infringement is a criminal offense, as described above, then why aren&#39;t the major AI companies who commit mass copyright infringement with a profit motive in the training and development of their models being held criminally liable for their actions? The courts are currently twisting themselves into pretzels to try to invent some kind of fair use exception for them out of whole cloth because it feels wrong to charge them all with criminal behavior. But the truth is the law is not being interpreted in good faith, in part because the law itself is horrifyingly outdated and needs to be updated and modernized.

But the modernization we need is simple: Reduce for-profit infringement to a civil offense and reduce noncommercial infringement to being legal. We don&#39;t need to tinker with copyright terms, we don&#39;t need a vast expansion of the public domain, none of that. Just make file sharing legal.

People have always overlooked the fact Stallman is a nut because he also advocated for linux and did a pretty good job of it in the early days. But then I think he did a lot to sideline himself by appearing too extreme. When someone can see themselves in you, you can lead by example. But, people stopped seeing anything they had in common with Stallman.

The fact he always tries to coin juvenile little catch phrases doesn&#39;t help his case any: &quot;internet of stings&quot;, &quot;forbidden sharing&quot;, etc. Of course, the whole

Lord, you went off the rails in your second sentence!

Why can&#39;t you stick to the topic, cooling data centers? This has nothing to do with vibe coding, the stock market, or the Fed...

It has the rarer form with 18 atomic weight oxygen which is another stable isotope so is slightly more efficent...ok that&#39;s bullshit it&#39;s just regular co2 but just think of them using that $1600 a liter tank stuff for snooty investors who use gold plated monster cables

It doesn&#39;t matter if you use water to cool in a closed loop system.   The problem is only if you&#39;re using fresh water and just heating it up and dumping it and pulling in more fresh water.

So in this case, it&#39;s completely irrelevant.

The radiators get awful big at MWs of power and only 25 or so degrees C relative to ambient. So you spray water on them and they work a lot better.

Or rather you just spray the hot water into the air, I forgot how they worked.

Actually it&#39;s a combination of both. Most cooling systems have a closed loop and an evaporative one with heat exchangers involved moving heat from one to another. The reason being you want to carefully control the chemistry of the liquid required to get heat from a concentrated area (such as the fins on a waterblock on your CPUs), but don&#39;t want the expense of blasting that expensive liquid into the air.

they use the heat of evaporation of water to cool the hot refrigerant and release that to the atmosphere, because it&#39;s more efficient than just air cooling.

it&#39;s somewhat like setting up a small water sprayer on your AC condenser outside.  (they actually sell kits... and iirc they&#39;re cost effective, though I&#39;ve never tried one).

Directly? I find that hard to believe. Are you sure you&#39;re not running two loops with a heat-exchanger between? That would be how nearly every other datacentre in the world works regardless if the actual cooling element is liquid or air via a chiller. My mind would be blown if the actual liquid hitting your servers isn&#39;t running in a closed loop as you would expose yourself to a world of hurt with water chemistry having to have that continuously replaced and bio controlled. It&#39;s hard enough to prevent growt

Many, many cooling systems use direct evaporation. Especially, but not only, in drier environments.

There are maintenance concerns, but the operating and initial capital costs are lower for those systems, so they are attractive on that level.

It doesn&#39;t matter if you use water to cool in a closed loop system.The closed part of the closed loop system only moves heat from one area to another. There&#39;s a whole different part of the system involved in actually moving that heat out to the environment, that system is open. The water consumption being discussed is usually due to evaporative cooling - which is still the cheapest way to run a cooling system unless you have a specific environment that allows for some other alternative (e.g. dumping heat into a river).

Bigger facilities pass cold liquid through tubes near the chips to absorb the heat. This hot liquid is sent outside to a cooling yard, where sprawling networks of pipes use as much water as a city of 50,000 people to remove the heat. And from the cooling yard the water goes where? Oh, yeah, back into the cooling system. The water is not &quot;used,&quot; it is &quot;re-used&quot; - yes, some evaporates, but not 50,000 people worth of water (BTW, how much water does &quot;one people&quot; use?)

The system uses a special type of carbon dioxide...As far as I can tell, the only way CO2 can be &quot;special&quot; is if it&#39;s in a liquid state. (Normally, it transitions between solid and gas with no intermediate liquid state, but it does become liquid at about a little over 5 bars). But liquid CO2 is commonly used for preserving food and in other industries, so I&#39;m confused as to what might be special about the stuff they plan to use for cooling data centres.

I saw that in a motion picture once - Return of the Jedi.

&#39;Carbonite&#39; was used as a liquid solution for cryostasis.

Some gasses work better than others for given temperatures in heat-pumps. CO2 is best suited to very high temperatures, like increasing the temp from say 50C coming from the GPU to say 90C.

It&#39;s sometimes used for domestic hot water heat pumps, mainly in Japan because they do love their baths and hotter water means it can use a smaller tank to fill the tub.

I think it&#39;s just an article written by a generalist  so I think he means to say &quot;special refrigerant&quot;as in different from what&#39;s used in normal HVAC  and is probably unfamiliar that, as you say, it&#39;s existing technologye.g. https://www.scmfrigo.com/en/bl...  [scmfrigo.com]

the only new thing mentioned is maybe using some snake faster compressors... but it&#39;s not mentioned of those are more efficient somehow.

&quot;Special&quot; here means supercritical, because apparently the editors at the LA Times don&#39;t trust their readers with words of more than four syllables.

Apart from that, I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve seen press releases disguised as news before but this one really takes the biscuit. I think they&#39;re plugging some kind of pump, because engineers are always coming up with ways to use supercritical CO2 for seemingly random things (I read an article about thirty years ago for using it in industrial dishwashers) and the idea of

When it&#39;s hot outside, you could probably get the radiator temp difference to ambient around 2x higher with the heatpump at good COP. If radiator cooling requires too much radiator volume with normal liquid cooling, 2x is unlikely to make the difference.

Cooling towers with evaporation are used because of the far higher power density they allow.

Cooling towers with evaporation are used because of the far higher power density they allow.Yup. This is why we swapped out our traditional refrigerant HVACs. Denser, and cheaper. Though part of that reduced cost is the fact that we get too good of a price on the water we use.

Brax has already created an open thread with preliminary design specs.  &quot;The planned retail price is 599$ for the base version and 799$ for the Pro version,&quot; they write.  &quot;We will be offering open_slate (both versions) at a discount during our pre-order campaign, starting as low as 399$ for the base version and 529$ for the Pro version for limited quantities only which may sell out in a day or two from launching pre-orders...  

&quot;Pre-orders will open in February, via IndieGoGo. Make sure to subscribe for notifications if you don&#39;t want to miss the launch date.&quot; 
Thanks to long-time Slashdot reader walterbyrd for sharing the news.

I saw Rob&#39;s video earlier today. Very impressive tablet. The multiple physical kill switches are a nice touch, as is the replaceable battery and M2 slot. The claimed 20 hour battery life is impressive as well. I had a few Asus B121 Slate tablets years ago. While those were clunky and had disappointing battery life I do miss the convenience they offered. This Brax tablet may be the reason to try again.

I have a Star Labs StarLite. It&#39;s getting a bit long in the tooth but I&#39;m pretty happy with it. It&#39;s not perfect of course, few 2-in-1 computers are. I&#39;m not a fan of keyboard cases for tablets in general, this one tends to pop loose easily so I prefer using a simple stand and mechanical keyboard. The main difference with what I have is it&#39;s just an x86, so pretty easy to deal with and pretty decent performance across the board. For my purposes it has decent stylus support, so I can use an off-the-shelf gen

Agreed about the boot thing.  If Google is to be believed the modern term is now &quot;SystemReady.&quot; That means UEFI and ACPI, and supports the various ARM system standards, and can boot generic distros with stock, unmodified kernels without needing devicetree.

ARM is currently a bit of wasteland when it comes to proprietary kernels and downloading OS images from dodgy download sites.  Sadly RISC-V is no better currently.

There are ARM systems out there that meet these requirements, but they are expensive.  System

>ARM is probably the future. But I won&#39;t tough another ARM tablet unless it has UEFI or u-boot. And the chip vendor&#39;s support absolutely has to be upstream before considering it. Else you will be stuck on some old distro and it will be a real struggle to upgrade.

Agree 100%. There&#39;s a disturbing lack of realization of this fact in the official forum for this tablet... people are focused on  requesting luxury features such as built in cellular instead of making sure the base is solid.

We&#39;re working directly with Linux integrators and chipset partners to ensure proper mainline Linux support, rather than one-off ports that break over time.

So it&#39;s essentially a crowd-funded Android tablet that they&#39;re hoping will gain enough traction for upstream Linux. Who does the programming legwork is unclear.

If they&#39;re serious they would throw a few free ones to free software communities such as Mobian and postmarketOS as Pine64 has done with various bits of hardware such as the

I want my phone to support a full desktop with at least two full-size, external screens.

I would love a cheap Linux tablet (maybe running Android apps via Waydroid? Or having the ability to multi-boot between Linux and, say, LineageOS) available at a normal retailer. Sadly, this tablet is neither cheap nor at a place I&#39;d want to buy from (remember that Indiegogo projects can take all your money up front and either deliver nothing with no refunds or deliver it potentially years later). Wake me up when it&#39;s half the price on Amazon or somewhere equivalent.

            <div id="article-text">It is now official. Netcraft has confirmed: BSD is dying 

One more crippling bombshell hit the already beleaguered BSD community when IDC confirmed that BSD market share has dropped yet again, now down to less than a fraction of 1 percent of all servers. Coming on the heels of a recent Netcraft survey which plainly states that BSD has lost more market share, this news serves to reinforce what we&#39;ve known all along. BSD is collapsing in complete disarray, as fittingly exemplified by failing dead last [samag.com] in the recent Sys Admin comprehensive networking test. 

You don&#39;t need to be the Amazing Kreskin [amazingkreskin.com] to predict BSD&#39;s future. The hand writing is on the wall: BSD faces a bleak future. In fact there won&#39;t be any future at all for BSD because BSD is dying. Things are looking very bad for BSD. As many of us are already aware, BSD continues to lose market share. Red ink flows like a river of blood. 

FreeBSD is the most endangered of them all, having lost 93% of its core developers. The sudden and unpleasant departures of long time FreeBSD developers Jordan Hubbard and Mike Smith only serve to underscore the point more clearly. There can no longer be any doubt: FreeBSD is dying. 

Let&#39;s keep to the facts and look at the numbers. 

OpenBSD leader Theo states that there are 7000 users of OpenBSD. How many users of NetBSD are there? Let&#39;s see. The number of OpenBSD versus NetBSD posts on Usenet is roughly in ratio of 5 to 1. Therefore there are about 7000/5 = 1400 NetBSD users. BSD/OS posts on Usenet are about half of the volume of NetBSD posts. Therefore there are about 700 users of BSD/OS. A recent article put FreeBSD at about 80 percent of the BSD market. Therefore there are (7000+1400+700)*4 = 36400 FreeBSD users. This is consistent with the number of FreeBSD Usenet posts. 

Due to the troubles of Walnut Creek, abysmal sales and so on, FreeBSD went out of business and was taken over by BSDI who sell another troubled OS. Now BSDI is also dead, its corpse turned over to yet another charnel house. 

All major surveys show that BSD has steadily declined in market share. BSD is very sick and its long term survival prospects are very dim. If BSD is to survive at all it will be among OS dilettante dabblers. BSD continues to decay. Nothing short of a miracle could save it at this point in time. For all practical purposes, BSD is dead.

They stopped supporting BSD and any linux that doesn&#39;t support Systemd, Microsoft&#39;s infiltration of the Linux ecosystem.

It&#39;s also likely not a priority. People forget that login managers exist, and they work independently of the desktop environment. I mean, you log into any non-Linux machine graphically and it asks you for a  username, password, and what environment you want to boot into - you can often have basic ones like twm or fvwm, full fat KDE and GNOME, even ones like CDE and Java (on Solaris).

You picked when you logged into your machine, not when you installed the OS (e.g., Ubuntu, Kubuntu, etc). Generally speaking t

People forget that login managers exist, and they work independently of the desktop environment.I can&#39;t speak to KDE, but I recently found that Gnome wasn&#39;t particularly happy if I tried using something other than GDM - some things simply didn&#39;t work (like screen locking, IIRC).

There isn&#39;t really a whole lot of choice on login managers. I used to use slim for X11 which worked fine for i3. If SDDM was the old KDE login manager, it&#39;s future is probably uncertain. When I switched to sway/wayland, I tried lightdm but it at that time, it didn&#39;t work for FreeBSD/Wayland. For now, I just put a few lines in my `.zprofile` so that if I switch to a particular one of the virtual consoles to login, it&#39;ll start sway manually. Would be nice to have something really basic like slim (or good old

Out of curiosity I looked up what desktops are on BSD.

Even without Plasma there are several to choose from. I&#39;m not seeing a problem here if you are simply trying to get work done.

Modern desktops have so many inter-dependencies that  it makes total sense to develop for a single init system, and have tight integration with it. Otherwise it&#39;s just compromise after compromise, and some of those compromises have security implications. I can see a world where each DE targets a single init system, and you use a DE based on what init system your OS has.what interdependencies do you have in mind?   it&#39;s not something I&#39;ve thought deeply about, but I can&#39;t think of any dependency on the init system beyond don&#39;t interface to shutdown and reboot stuff.  maybe some sleep related things?

Starting and stopping services, login/automounting come to mind.You&#39;re right! It was never possible to do any of that before systemd was invented.

2036 is the year of the GNU/HURD desktop!

yes since at year 10K we&#39;ll just drop the leading digit and roll over. It&#39;s like 2 digit years but the timespan is long enough to not ever be an issue and the GNU inability to write a kernel will get solved within a ten thousand year span just by throwing random ideas at the wall and seeing what sticks.

PulseAudio is Poetterings garbage that sits on top of ALSA which is a low level kernel interface, it doesn&#39;t replace it. I&#39;ve written code that uses alsa directly, its not too hard though frankly opensound was a LOT more intuitive and simpler to use but sadly its long gone. Haven&#39;t bothered with PA, anything LP wrote I avoid like the plague - eg I run slackware which is systemd free.

I tried to hold out on apluse but it it just isn&#39;t feasible anymore.What is your dependency problem? I still use apulse. Though I had to install pipewire due to using kde-spectacle, but I could choose to not install spectacle.

Nothing is forced into anything. logind isn&#39;t even a required part of systemd. It&#39;s a question of what makes sense for you the maintainer to implement and what functionality it provides. ALSA is still around but god damn I&#39;m glad I don&#39;t actively see that piece of shit anymore. I don&#39;t use my computer like it&#39;s 1995 anymore so I don&#39;t have a requirement for a sound subsystem that has 1995 level of functionality and can&#39;t even cope with the fact that something as mindblowing as a bluetooth headset is turned

Sure ALSA is still around but good luck finding any project that will support it. I tried to hold out on apluse but it it just isn&#39;t feasible anymore.No, now you use pipewire, pipewire-pulse, and wireplumber. Just launch them in that order and it all works fine.

perhaps you can write a  Boot Script that also is a login manager, and also a UI.

I will always recommend KDE Plasma as the best desktop environment ever, hands down.But I deeply regret this instance of systemd creep into it, excluding not only the xBSDs, but all other Unices and even systemd-clean distros such as Slackware (the oldest continously maintained Linux distribution). Even more so when it was some time ago where the KDE homepage asked the question: is UNIX ready for the desktop?  [archive.org] and described itself as:

before you know it the dependencies are so intertwined with this exclusive functionality that the downstream project can no longer support any other init system.(I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s good, but) it is already the case that we need some Poettering code for KDE on an openrc (non-systemd) system. For this reason the Gentoo devs have extracted elogind (part of systemd) as a standalone package for non-systemd configurations, as the minimum requirement. Otherwise, it would already not be possible to have KDE on a gentoo without systemd (kde apps depend on solid, which depends on udisks, which depends on polkit, which depends the systemd-logind).

There are tons of desktop environments and a lot of them are better than KDE (or Gnome).

Can you name some of those &quot;tons of desktop environments&quot; that aren&#39;t niche products that you need to be a masochist to use, and aren&#39;t just forks of GNOME?  MATE is a GNOME 2 fork.  Cinnamon is a GNOME 3 fork.  Xfce and Budgie are GTK-based, which means GObject and the rest of that bullshit, so it may as well be GNOME.  LXDE is based on GTK2, but confusingly has forks based on GTK3 and Qt, so it&#39;s a mess of incompatible options.

There&#39;s a lot of masochistic idiots here who love to forget everything Microsoft has done as soon as they have done it. To them Halloween is just a time to see some tits. But TBF, there have always been Microsoft fanboys here, so at least this is not new. There have always been tons of Slashdotters happy to punch themselves in the balls.

FreeBSD, the Unix-like operating systemJebus, who wrote this stuff?  FreeBSD came from 386BSD which was an offshoot of BSD without the SYSV gunk.  It&#39;s one of the original Unixes, and the one that most of the good stuff we enjoy today came from.

plasma-login-manager exists since march 2025. &quot;Drops support&quot; is a big headline for a project that exists for less than a year.

yes it was forked from SDDM. Yes BSD support might have been already there.  logind helps support the login process, why not use it? It&#39;s a dbus API, BSD can have its own implementation. Same as it uses the Linux DRM stack for video drivers.

Here&#39;s why it exists: https://blog.davidedmundson.co...  [davidedmundson.co.uk]

FreeBSD users can still run the KDE Plasma desktop environment and continue using SDDM, the current login manager that works just fine on such systems.I stopped using SDDM on Devuan because it was causing me login problems. I switched to slim, and am not having any of those problems any more. Fuck SDDM and fuck anyone who makes their software depend on systemd on purpose even harder.Now, anyone know how to make slim launch a specific DE when you don&#39;t select one? Because it&#39;s shit too, it doesn&#39;t even remember which DE I selected last time.

Yeah, and I&#39;d like to know how they&#39;re going to regulate interstate travel in that regard, as far as ordering a 3D printer from China and expecting it to have this restriction.

The thing with so many of these gun laws is they&#39;re going after more &quot;exotic&quot; or esoteric things, when the vast majority of gun deaths are from run of the mill pistols that are everywhere.

It&#39;s not just a thing with firearms, it&#39;s a thing with any kind of &quot;weapon&quot;. And I quote that because, for example. look at the way California regulates the balisong. They are and always have been utility knives. Hollywood created the fantasy that they&#39;re some kind of macho weapon that they&#39;re not, mostly because the way they open looks flashy and nice for photography. But in a tactical situation, any knife that opens that way is a liability. But for non-tactical, i.e. strictly utility, they&#39;re pretty nice

for example. look at the way California regulates the balisong.Never did understand the butterfly knife thing. Such a stupid thing to ban.
Many states have regulated those damn things, including the conservative sweetheart of Texas until 2017(IIRC?).
Cool for tricks, but ultimately a pretty shitty weapon.Hollywood also created the myth that silencers make bullets whisper quiet, which is physically impossible, in fact they&#39;re still loud as fuck, just far less likely to permanently damage your hearing if your earplugs fall out on the range, but here we are.Most bullets are- mostly due to the sonic boom they create, which the silencer obviously can&#39;t do shit about.
However, my buddy and I made a silencer for a .22LR in highschool... loaded with subs- silent, except for the click of the action.
We&#39;d fill a balloon with ace

In soviet Russia, the law makes an example of YOU.

They could mandate closed source, internet connections, signed bootloaders, and microcontroller fuses which prevent erasure of the bootloader.

Of course, there is plenty of open source 3D printer firmware out there which could be run on  a homebuilt 3D printer, so all of those technical measures would be ineffective against 3D printers built by the people who want to print gun parts.

For that matter, you&#39;d need to license lathes, milling machines, and sheet metal stamping machines as well.

Can&#39;t control software either. A large portion of 3D printers out there run or are capable of running completely open source software.

That said this exists to stop an incidental idiot. Just like your door lock doesn&#39;t stop me yeeting a brick through the window there&#39;s a bigger chance someone will steal something if you don&#39;t have a lock on your door at all.

Likewise this won&#39;t stop any pre-meditated murder. This may stop some moron 14 year old playing around and building something dangerous for the LULZ.

That&#39;s not the point. The idea is to stop little Timmy 3D printing a gun, or someone printing one in anger. At the very least, the delay while they figure out how to bypass the restrictions gives them time to think twice and calm down.

I&#39;d say the bigger issue is likely to be false positives being a pain.

What is possible is we can investigate the sale and transport of firearms. And prosecute people who do this at a large scale for organized crime.

Pretty standard practice in my state to bust groups that are known to be selling firearms in the area. Bust the people who are caught committing crimes with them, and work your way up the supply chain. In a way the ability for small operations is very limited to hide a very local presence when it is within the jurisdiction of state and local agencies.

There will certainly be new challenges. But we already have gun dealers in every city that resell stolen fire arms. The same channels are going to be selling g

Maybe they&#39;re well meaning, but they&#39;re not going to be able to put the genie back in the bottle.You certainly know that professional printers (e.g. bizhub) refuse to scan or print banknotes. Many countries have laws that say print shops cannot copy books. None of that stops organised crime (which can be done at home using consumer equipment), but they are still necessary. Like &quot;murder is not allowed&quot; law, which does not stop motivated murderers but it still necessary to have in the book.

My point is that it is normal and expected that laws get voted in to restrict what printers can print, such as in the case of banknotes. If &quot;guns&quot; is the new bad stuff now identified that printers can produce, then it is expectable that technical restrictions will be voted in. The fact that one can find ways to bypass technical restrictions isn&#39;t a concern (it is already the case for banknotes).

Murder is an example of undesirable behaviour that we prohibit despite being easy to bypass. I should have taken a

This proposal requires that the printers have an active network connection. What&#39;s going to happen when the printer isn&#39;t connected to the network, or isn&#39;t allowed access beyond the local network? I consider blocking printers and other devices not intended for remote use from having Internet access a minimum precaution against botnets searching for devices to compromise.

A free network connection with the purchase of every 3D printer!

I&#39;m just... absolutely fascinated by the kind of thinking that imagined that this was something that was possible in any meaningful way.

What can I say, you&#39;re not wrong... It&#39;s a really weird approach in a country where it&#39;s legal to machine your own gunbarrels on a lathe provided you don&#39;t intend to sell them.

Pistol barrels, which are the most likely to be use in crimes.

Making pistol-calibre barrels at home is a solved problem. This is why the rebels in Burma use 3D-printed semi-auto 9mm carbines when they can&#39;t acquire anything better.

You&#39;d be surprised to find out just how ignorant the average Representative or Senator is, especially Representatives.

These are people who for the most part couldn&#39;t manage regular gainful employment so they ended up going into preaching or politics- the two jobs where you can be as dumb as a bag of hammers and still succeed beyond your wildest dreams.

Many of them are genuine idiots but they can be glib and charming when it&#39;s needed, and often that&#39;s enough.

It&#39;s an utterly stupid pretense that&#39;s being used as the opening move to regulate, tax, and control a broad range of hobbies.

Eventually it&#39;ll subject you to FFL-style rules. If you have an FFL (a Federal Firearms License), the BATF has the right to show up at any time of day or night and search the premises, go over the books, tear the place apart, etc. That includes your home, cars, etc as well as any store or business.

The one thing I don&#39;t see being discussed is that it&#39;s 100% LEGAL to make your own guns at home, no license or permission needed. You can&#39;t sell or transfer your basement boomtube, but it&#39;s completely legal to cobble some parts together and make a working firearm.

They can&#39;t limit speech or religion, so make it both.

&quot;Thou shalt not kill&quot;Perhaps with an asterisk against the &quot;not&quot;.

Perhaps with an asterisk against the &quot;not&quot;.

* For sufficiently loose definitions of &quot;not&quot;.

I mean, if you look at the actual numbers, approximately 0.00% of firearms in the US have been used to kill someone, so that goes without saying.

The Hebrew word is closer to &quot;murder&quot;, which is distinct from &quot;kill&quot;.  Specifically, it was about unjust killing, and also includes what we would not call manslaughter (carelessness or negligence).  Not long after the 10 commandments were sent down, a bunch of laws were also issued, some of which required the death penalty, which would have been hard to carry out if the commandment was actually against &quot;killing&quot;.

Older English translations seem to prefer &quot;kill&quot;, more recent ones seem to prefer &quot;murder&quot;.  ESV

The Hebrew word is closer to &quot;murder&quot;, which is distinct from &quot;kill&quot;.No, it&#39;s not. But contextually, it&#39;s more likely to mean murder in that commandment.
The same verb is used to describe being put to death (Numbers), and manslaughter (Deuteronomy).

The tense and person (first or third) strongly influences the inferred meaning in Hebrew.
But you are otherwise correct that Murder is the better translation for the commandment.

Just about anything you can think of, from lunch trays to toenail clippers, can be misused by bad actors to cause real world harm.

Even your bare hands can be instruments of death. Amputations for all!

It&#39;s worth noting that the first really-usable 3D-printed gun was developed in Europe despite all those regulations. The developer couldn&#39;t acquire barrels, bolts or ammunition legally but found ways around all of it.

Neither feasible nor if it were feasible, enforceable. Blithering idiots at work.

...intelligence tests for lawmakersThey always failThey falsely believe that all problems can be solved by passing a law

You failed as well.  You think laws are supposed to be obeyed.  Lots of times laws are not passed because the politicians believe the law will be followed.

The reality is that often laws are created to:

1) Make it easier to convict criminals of crimes.2) Increase the punishment for crimes.3) Raise money for the municipality (traffic laws in particular)

A prime example of this is the &#39;gun free zone&#39; laws.  Most politicians never expected them to remove guns from the areas.  That was a myth spread by republican idiots (the smart republicans knew better).

Instead, they were originally passed to make it easier to convict drug dealers.  The adult dealers hung around schools with guns to protect their employees.  Their customers give money to child (a) in order to get drugs from child (b).  Because they never touched the money or drugs, cops had a hard time arresting the adult drug dealers.  Until they made the schools gun free zones so they could arrest the adult drug dealers merely for having the gun they used to protect their business.

Now, gun free zones have expanded beyond schools, and the original explanation is not always as relevant. But that was the original reason why gun free zones were created.

In case the government goes rogue on the people.Just in case that ever happens.

We already saw from example that the &quot;2nd amendment&quot; isn&#39;t about gun rights at all.

Not one gun-toting nut came out in defense of your freedumbs when a carrying member was shot in the back. Quite the opposite, individuals from the 2nd amendment cohort turned out to massively blame the dead guy for the shooting despite massive evidence of him not doing anything illegal.

The 2nd amendment today is about toy privileges for people with various inferiority complexes.

Which doesn&#39;t make the proposed legislation any

Not one gun-toting nut came out in defense of your freedumbs when a carrying member was shot in the back.To be accurate, they took away his gun before they shot him.

I&#39;m surprised those sadistic fuckwads didn&#39;t decide to shoot him with his own gun.

Did they pry it from his hands? I have heard that they took it out of the holster where it wasn&#39;t doing any harm to or threatening anyone.

I am struggling to envisage how this would ever work reliably.

The only protocol that the device speak is GCode, and that&#39;s so low-level it means you could rejig the same final print in a million different ways without compromise.  I&#39;m not sure how you&#39;d ever detect that reliably.

If it&#39;s on the software then... wow... all someone has to do is keep an old &quot;STL to GCode&quot; slicer around that defeats that too.

Early Saturday morning in downtown Minneapolis, 37-year-old Alex Pretti was killed by federal agents in full public view. Within hours, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection officials released a familiar statement: an agent, they said, had acted in lawful self-defense against an armed and violent agitator. According to this narrative, Pretti instigated the violence that led to his death. A multitude of videos filmed by witnesses from multiple angles show this to be a lie.

They show Alex Pretti holding up his phone, filming as masked ICE and CBP agents shoved demonstrators and sprayed pepper spray into the crowd. They show an agent shoving a woman in the street. They show Pretti stepping forward, without striking anyone or reaching for a weapon, attempting to shield the woman from the agent’s blows. They show an agent spraying Pretti directly in the face with chemical irritant. They show Pretti being tackled to the ground. They show six or seven agents piling on top of him, striking him while he lay immobilized. And then, they show one agent removing Pretti’s licensed handgun—which he was carrying in compliance with state law—from his waistband.

Then, while he remained pinned to the pavement, helpless beneath a mass of armed bodies, gunshots rang out. Agents scattered, and one of them appeared to clap. Pretti did not get up. This is not self-defense. It is much more akin to an execution.

Pretti was a licensed, law-abiding gun owner, registered nurse, and worked at a veteran’s hospital.

The sequence of events matters, not only because it starkly contradicts the official account, but because it exposes how the language of self-defense has been distorted to the point that it now functions as a near-automatic exoneration for state violence. When authorities invoke “self-defense” today, they rarely describe a factual necessity. They are deploying a rhetorical shield with deep historical roots and devastating contemporary consequences.

Just weeks earlier, on Jan. 7, Renee Good was shot three times and killed by an ICE agent as she attempted to flee in her car. In that case, too, officials framed the killing as justified and necessary, as self-defense rather than aggression. In that case, too, video evidence and eyewitness accounts—including an agent muttering “fucking bitch” after the shooting—raised serious questions about the agents’ alleged “fear for their lives.” There is little to suggest that lethal force was unavoidable in this case, and yet Donald Trump’s Department of Justice is refusing to investigate the killing as a homicide. Instead, they are investigating Good’s widow. The pattern should be clear: use an empty claim of self-defense to exonerate the shooter, and then frame the victim as the perpetrator.

What we are witnessing is not a series of isolated tragedies. We have reached the logical endpoint of a political and legal culture that has long distorted claims of vulnerability, of “reasonable fear,” in the service of power, conflating aggressive, state-sanctioned violence with necessary self-protection.

From the nation’s founding, claims of self-defense have been used to justify extraordinary brutality. Systematic colonial violence against Indigenous nations was routinely rationalized as necessary to the protection of settler families and communities. Entire Indigenous communities were eradicated under the guise of lawful defense, with Indigenous resistance labeled “Savage Wars,” as a confrontation among equals rather than a genocidal onslaught.

After the Civil War, the Ku Klux Klan organized itself “to maintain forever the supremacy of the white race.” At the center of their mission lay the claim that white society required urgent protection from formerly enslaved people. Their founding documents emphasized “the sacred duty of protecting [white] womenhood” from sexual violence, with violence as necessary.

This mandate of protection congealed into widespread racial terror, claiming the lives of thousands of Black men, women, and children between Reconstruction and the mid-twentieth century. The Equal Justice Institute estimates that 4,400 lynchings took place during this time period, which was also characterized by legalized segregation, mass disenfranchisement, economic coercion, and sexual violence perpetrated against Black women. And yet, when anti-lynching bills appeared before Congress—again and again—white leaders defended ritualized, spectacular acts of racial terror as a regrettable but necessary response to generally false claims of sexual violence by Black men against white women.

This “rape-lynch” mythology, “that Negro men rape white women” was a “threadbare lie,” as journalist Ida B. Wells painstakingly documented in 1892, and she was almost murdered for speaking the truth. But truth was never the point. The claim of self-defense functioned as a form of camouflage to shroud the economic, political, and social project of keeping Black Americans subordinate under a blanket of legitimacy. It worked because enough people were willing to accept it, to pretend that racial terror was necessary to (white) public safety.

A similarly pernicious logic has insulated law enforcement from legal accountability for generations. Police violence, no matter how extreme, is routinely reframed as a defensive reaction to a threat rather than aggression. “The officer feared for his life.” “The suspect was reaching…for something.” “The situation escalated quickly, and the officer had no choice but to shoot.” The language is reflexive, ritualized, and remarkably effective. It is baked into our nation’s DNA to frame the victims of state-sanctioned violence as perpetrators.

In recent decades, that logic has been codified into law and expanded to select citizens through “Stand Your Ground” laws and permissive gun regulations that collapse the distinction between defense and dominance. These laws encourage armed confrontation while removing the legal duty to retreat or de-escalate. They transform subjective fear into legal justification while inviting ordinary citizens to imagine themselves as lone sentinels in a hostile world, as heroic “good guys with guns,” and as “Armed Citizens” exercising their Second Amendment rights. The laws reward those who act on that fantasy with legal immunity.

But only when they are acting in the service of repressive power. By all accounts, including the video evidence, Alex Pretti was a law-abiding, good guy with a gun, who stepped in to protect an unarmed woman from an assault. He did not draw his weapon, nor did he attack the agents who disarmed him before shooting him multiple times while he was pinned to the ground.

What is new today is not the twisted rhetoric of self-defense, but its escalation, and its targets. Masked federal agents, many of them poorly trained, now patrol public streets with military-grade weapons and broad discretionary authority. They detain, assault, and, increasingly, kill people based on vague or erroneous claims of public safety. They do so while invoking the same exonerating language that has long enabled state violence.

For generations, public state violence has been normalized precisely because it was disproportionately inflicted on non-white people, immigrants, low-income and other marginalized individuals. Many learned to look away or to justify this violence as the necessary price of “law and order.” Part of race and class privilege was the capacity to see such violence as a regrettable but necessary byproduct of maintaining order and keeping “us” safe.

We are now witnessing—some of us in incredulous horror—what happens when a society confuses authority with innocence and violence with virtue. We have built legal doctrines that reward escalation. We have granted weapons to institutions without demanding restraint. We have taught ourselves that “good guys” with guns will keep us safe from “bad guys.” Maybe now we are learning that the boundary separating the two was never clear in the first place.

            <h2>In Minnesota, the Fight Against ICE Is Also the Fight Against Authoritarianism</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is part of a series of on-the-ground reports from Minneapolis.

On Thursday, I ended my day on daycare patrol as the windchill crept close to 25 degrees below zero. The patrols began after ICE appeared at my son’s daycare two weeks ago; that same day, a daycare worker for the same provider was taken by agents at a nearby location while trying to get in to work. During my recent patrol, ICE agents were spotted in the neighborhood, as they nearly always are, but everybody made it out of the building safely.

As I write this, a helicopter is circling over my neighborhood, as happens most days now. My phone is pinging near constantly with alerts from Signal groups that exist to defend and support our community. A friend texted to ask how concerned we should be that the president will invoke the Insurrection Act and send the military into our city; my husband just learned that workers at a nearby small business were taken by the government; a friend’s school went on lockdown today because ICE was nearby.

Our neighborhood has never been more united, but you wouldn’t know it from how few people are out on the streets. Nobody opens their door anymore, knowing that the next knock might be a federal agent demanding to know where the Brown people live in your neighborhood. People are making a point to support immigrant-owned restaurants, but you have to check if they’re open before you go, because so many aren’t. Folks are out delivering food and essentials to neighbors who are unable to leave their homes for fear, but they have to be careful to use a different car than they drive when they’re observing ICE, because the government is tracking license plates.

Earlier this week, students in our city lost  two days of learning because schools closed—the teachers needed time to shift to the virtual learning model which began on Thursday. This time, it’s not because of an unknown and deadly illness; it’s because the government is attacking our students. People are being shipped out of the state so fast that their families don’t have time to get to their holding cell with the paperwork proving they’re legally authorized to be here before they’re gone.

The horrors have not ceased since Renee Good’s death, instead they have increased. Protestors are being attacked and shot. On Tuesday, a five-year-old was detained by ICE and used to bait his family into leaving their home. The preschooler and his father have now been sent to Texas, and it is unclear if or when they’ll return. On Thursday, multiple civil rights leaders, including Saint Paul Public School board member Chauntyll Allen, were arrested for exercising their First Amendment right to protest, in a DOJ action that the NAACP has said was a likely violation of First Amendment rights. And on Saturday, Alex Pretti was killed by ICE agents, shot multiple times at close range. Every day, there is a new horror to process, a new way in which the federal government inflicts irreparable harm on our community.

I serve as a Saint Paul City Councilmember, and our community is under a violent attack at the hands of the federal government. And so we are fighting back in all the ways we know how.

On January 12th, Saint Paul announced a joint lawsuit with the city of Minneapolis and the state of Minnesota against the Department of Homeland Security, seeking to end this unconstitutional operation. Our City Council is working to strengthen our separation ordinance and develop other legal tools to make certain that our city resources—including our police department—cannot and will not support the work of immigration enforcement. We are calling on the governor to declare a state of emergency and enact a state-wide eviction moratorium to ensure that nobody loses their home because the federal government is making it impossible for them to earn a living. Every elected official in our city is working to connect our residents with whatever support they need right now. We are also demanding that Congress act—that our representatives and senators use every tool at their disposal to end this occupation—because neither cities nor states alone have enough tools to protect our people from the federal government.

None of this feels like enough. Individually, none of it is. But what we know from other countries that have successfully defeated authoritarianism is that democratic resurgence is possible. Over the last 30 years, 52 percent of “autocratization episodes” were followed by democratic resurgence. In 90 percent of those cases, countries were ultimately as or more democratic than they were previously.

In Saint Paul and across Minnesota, we’re showing that we have what it will take to win. We are cultivating solidarity and pushing back through every channel that we have—and building more capacity to fight for our community every day. We are demonstrating our commitment to nonviolence, even in the face of incredible levels of violence being used against us. We might get tired, but we are not succumbing to despair. Our civil resistance movement is strong, and it is growing.

Most importantly, we know what we’re fighting for, because we’ve already lived it. Saint Paul has always been at its strongest when we’ve embraced our immigrant neighbors. Minnesota has always been at its best when we’ve built structures that allow everybody in our state to flourish, whether they’ve been here for months or for generations. This is a place where we take seriously Paul Wellstone’s immortal words that “we all do better when we all do better.” The cruel, painful world that Donald Trump is trying to force on us is not one that we will ever, ever settle for. The path ahead is not clear, but we will continue to put one foot in front of the other until the day we win.

Shortly after 9 a.m. Saturday morning, my wife Julia woke up from a nightmare that federal agents were trying to break into our home, one of many nightmares she’s had since I was arrested by ICE, detained for 8 hours, then released without charges. I had been peacefully observing ICE when it happened, like so many Minnesotans have over the past weeks and days. That morning, she instinctively checked our neighborhood group chat. For the third time this month, someone in Minneapolis has been shot by federal agents. This time it had happened a mile from our home, to a man I would learn was Alex Pretti.

We haphazardly dressed in our cleanest warm clothes. As we opened our car doors we saw neighbors of ours, who we’ve never spoken to, doing the same. The entire neighborhood was converging. As we approached the intersection where Alex was shot 10 times, we heard chants of “ICE out” ringing out on Nicollet Ave, known locally as ‘Eat Street’ because of its dozens of globally minded restaurants.

What normally would have been an intersection full of chilly Saturday morning brunch-goers had become something akin to a warzone, as federal agents tried to break up the protestors gathered around the site of the shooting, at the intersection of Nicollet and 26th Street. Our presence, our bodies, were the only sign of solidarity and resistance we could offer, so that’s what we did. Agents assembled with weapons of war, and all we had was our outrage and our cameras.

We stood in the cold for a couple of minutes as the crowd swelled. At one point, someone threw a snowball at an agent. Two agents started chasing the man who’d tossed it westbound down 26th St. I tried to follow, but then heard an explosion from behind me. Flashbangs and chemical weapons were being shot or thrown into the crowd. I fled.

My sister-in-law, Eva Rose, who also lives nearby and also came to the intersection separately, described to me the moment the agents’ anger was unleashed a second time as she arrived 15 minutes later. Without warning, agents in tactical gear started throwing chemical weapons and chasing down protestors.

“The four of us ended up in a loading dock, in front of us were 10 agents and three things of tear gas, blowing in our faces.” Panicked and hardly able to see through the thick fog of chemical weapons, Eva and her friends wanted to escape, but they didn’t know how. In front of them, they saw a man getting randomly tackled by agents, his arms pinned behind his back, his face pressed inches from a billowing tear gas canister.  “We had nowhere to go, if we go straight we’ll get arrested or tackled, if we stay we’ll get gassed,” she told me later. As the tear gas filled their lungs and vision, they eventually decided to bolt. One of Eva’s friends threw up in the snow. Eva spit, and her saliva was neon orange.

“We were blindly running, I couldn’t breathe, I was choking on tear gas. My eyesight went black and I collapsed on the snow.” Eva’s fiancee helped her up, and they were able to make it home safely.

I was separated from Julia, and as my phone battery drained in the subzero air as I tried to reconvene with her. We found each other eventually, and went back to Nicollet to try to document what was happening. I watched as agents started rushing towards us with weapons drawn.

As I backed up, a short middle aged woman opened the door of a restaurant. “Come in, come in!” she yelled in a panic. She ushered in people on the street to save them from the chemical weapons.

We crowded into the restaurant. The owner paced back and forth in tears. Outside her window we saw a scene out of a warzone.

Over the next two hours, a pattern emerged. ICE agents would launch an assault down Eat Street, launching countless chemical weapons and flashbangs at protestors, then they would tackle and arrest people, seemingly at random. Then, they would retreat back to the intersection of 26th and Nicollet to resupply. Protesters would reconverge at the intersection, and the spectacle would repeat through the restaurant window.

We stayed in the restaurant, which became a makeshift refuge site. “I just wanted people to be safe,” the owner told me later. “I want businesses to do what I do, give water, let people come in.”

People did keep coming in, between the spurts of dispute. “I saw three [arrests],” a young woman told me, she was documenting on her phone. “One man looked unconscious when they dragged him in.” A backpack was brought in, the owner had been arrested. We searched it for identifying information, but found nothing.

Each time terrified people rushed into the restaurant, the owner would offer bottled water or hot water in plastic glasses. There were phone chargers, food, hugs. She waved away any attempt to pay her. It was in that restaurant I learned that Alex Pretti had died.

During yet another skirmish outside, a woman came in sobbing. We witnessed from the window her partner being tackled and snatched by ICE. Julia started making calls to lawyers to help, as she had when I had been arrested the week before. Today, the lawyer’s first question was: Were they a witness to the shooting? One woman who had seen it later said in a sworn affidavit that she heard ICE was looking for her.

Gas victims kept being brought to the restaurant, “like a field hospital,” as I overheard a passerby describe it. Their heads were tilted back and bottled water poured into their eyes. I watched a medic spray a man with saline solution, while another medic treated a man with frostbite, at tables that would normally be set for lunch.

A man whose eye was swollen shut was brought to a chair. He had to wait for a medic because they were busy. I offered him water and waited with him. He told me he’d only been on the scene for 10 minutes when he was sprayed from close range. If Alex, the 37-year-old ICU nurse had still been alive, if he had made it into this restaurant, he probably could have offered real help. All I could offer was water.

Later, outside, I talked to another volunteer medic who had helped two protestors that were having a severe allergic reaction to the gas. And I asked how many people he treated.

Around 12:40 p.m., someone came into the restaurant and told us, “ICE are gone, it’s safe now.” There was a palpable diffusion of tension.

Outside, Minneapolitans were cleaning up the gas canisters ICE left behind and hugging each other. A man was trying to put up some trash bins that had been knocked over, and re-string police tape to form a perimeter. I started to help him, only then realizing we were blocking off the site of Pretti’s shooting. He told me ICE had knocked over the police tape during one of their advances, and no police or first responders remained. I wasn’t sure if it was a crime scene or not, and no officials remained. We did our best to cordon off the area so no one would walk through.

Believe your federal government, not your own eyes. If you are big on the right to bear arms, make an exception this time. These are the Trump administration’s messages after a horrible Saturday in Minnesota.

Homeland Security agents shot 37-year-old Minneapolis ICU nurse and researcher Alex Pretti dead on Saturday morning in broad daylight. A few things are already clear from the best video angle out now: Pretti was directing traffic on a Minneapolis street. He was filming agents out in public, as is his undisputed right. An agent approached Pretti and then shoved a woman, hard, into a snowbank. Pretti put his hand up as he went to assist the woman. The masked agent who threw the woman to the ground draped himself over Pretti, then was joined by several of his colleagues. They got Pretti to the ground, struggled for a moment, and shot him until he was dead. Was this death sentence the result of sheer incompetence by agents who had no idea how to handle conflict? Was it a summary execution? Or, as the Trump administration would have you believe, did the dead man have it coming?

Pretti had a gun on him. An administration that once wrapped Kyle Rittenhouse in a loving embrace after he brought a rifle to a protest and killed two men took an interesting view of that fact. “This looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement,” an unsigned Homeland Security post said. “An assassin tried to murder federal agents,” Stephen Miller said. (JD Vance, the heir apparent to the Republican presidential nomination, reposted Miller.)  And what about the man who is nominally still running the country? Donald Trump pointed to a picture of Pretti’s handgun, confiscated by the agents, and noted it was loaded and “ready to go – What is that all about?”

Perhaps we will learn more in the coming days about what exactly happened when. But the early videos are already quite clear, as is what Trump and Miller and Vance are not saying. Nobody argued that Pretti brandished the gun before agents shot him several times. Moreover, no one argued that Pretti wasn’t allowed to have the gun. Minnesota allows people to carry a gun if they have a permit, and the Minneapolis police chief told reporters that Pretti had one. He had no criminal history beyond traffic tickets.

But the Trump administration has already told you what happened. One, the man had a gun, which is bad now. Two, the man was out to kill federal agents, which is obvious, because he had a gun.

We all have to decide for ourselves what we’ll believe about this case.

On the one hand, Pretti was a nurse who worked at the Veterans’ Administration. (If there’s one job that screams “disrespect for federal officers,” it’s “nurse at the VA.”)  Pretti was reaching for a woman whom an anonymous federal agent had just launched into a snowbank in frigid weather. It even looks like if anyone fired Pretti’s gun, it was a federal agent who had disarmed him and accidentally shot it into the pavement. And, fine, the physical altercation was initiated entirely by the agents, who put the woman on the ground and mobbed Pretti before shooting him to death.

But on the other hand, Stephen Miller says the man was an assassin. Would Stephen Miller lie?

Then there’s the matter of the gun itself. As Trump noted, the gun was “ready to go.” Pretti, though, had a legal right to carry that gun, thanks in large part to the gun-rights movement that has been part of Trump’s base for his entire political career. And most people who carry guns also carry bullets for those guns, as bullets are the primary projectile that guns send flying through the air.

But on the other hand, Alex Pretti had a gun. And would any American carry a gun in public without the intention to murder federal agents in cold blood? Remember, the sum total of violent crimes this ICU nurse had been charged with in his life was zero.

Miller says Pretti was a “domestic terrorist,” a label the administration also applied to the also-37-year-old Renee Good after one of its agents shot her through her car’s side window. The feds left their victim’s body splayed out on the road after taking the life from it, but they were at least a bit more dignified with him in one way. Nobody appears to have called Pretti a “fucking bitch,” as Good’s killer did right after shooting her.

You might get the impression from this series of federal killings that the real crime against this administration is opposing it in any way. But can you really trust yourself?

            <h2>EU looking into Elon Musk's X after Grok produces deepfake sex images</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/26/ec_open_new_investigation_into/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The European Commission has launched an investigation into X amid concerns that its GenAI model Grok offered users the ability to generate sexually explicit imagery, including sexualized images of children.

The executive branch of the EU said it begun the new probe under the Digital Services Act (DSA), introduced to regulate illegal content, disinformation, and other systemic risks on online platforms, and assess whether the company properly assessed and mitigated risks associated with the deployment of Grok&#39;s functionalities into X in the EU.

Enacted in 2022, the DSA includes powers to prevent the dissemination of illegal content in the EU, such as manipulated sexually explicit images, including content that may amount to child sexual abuse material.

In a statement, the Commission said risks from Grok appear to have exposed citizens in the EU to serious harm.

&quot;Sexual deepfakes of women and children are a violent, unacceptable form of degradation. With this investigation, we will determine whether X has met its legal obligations under the DSA, or whether it treated rights of European citizens - including those of women and children - as collateral damage of its service,&quot; said Henna Virkkunen, Commission executive vice-president for tech sovereignty, security and democracy.

X referred to a previous statement, telling The Register: &quot;We remain committed to making X a safe platform for everyone and continue to have zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation, non-consensual nudity, and unwanted sexual content.

The company added: &quot;We take action to remove high-priority violative content, including Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) and non-consensual nudity, taking appropriate action against accounts that violate our X Rules. We also report accounts seeking Child Sexual Exploitation materials to law enforcement authorities as necessary.&quot;

Officials said that since they began discussions with X over how Grok was implemented, the platform had made changes to the system, including turning off the image-generation tool for users who don&#39;t pay subscriptions.

While the Commission recognized X had already taken some measures related to the intimate images, it said its investigation was much broader than the specific incident which hit the headlines earlier this month.

The DSA gives the EU the power to fine digital platforms up to 6 per cent of their total annual worldwide turnover, which in X&#39;s case might be $174 million, based on an estimate of $2.9 billion turnover. X, formerly known as Twitter, was taken private in 2022 and no longer has to report figures.

Separately, the EC has extended the proceedings it initiated against X in December 2023 to determine whether the platform assessed and mitigated all systemic risks as set out in the Act. The extension includes the impact of the decision to switch X to Grok-based recommendations.

The Commission has already used the DSA to fine X €120 million for breaching the rules on ad transparency, data access for researchers, and its revamped blue-checkmark system.

The EU has said it would stand firm against American demands to tone down the regulation of US tech giants. Late in 2025, the US Trade Representative, a government body for trade and economic policies, slammed the EU for pursuing policies that restrict, limit, and deter the competitiveness of US tech giants through discriminatory means. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/26/data_thieves_claim_nike_data_haul/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nike says it is probing a possible breach after extortion crew WorldLeaks claimed to have lifted 1.4TB of internal data from the sportswear giant and posted samples on its leak site.

In a listing seen by The Register, WorldLeaks alleges it has stolen 188,347 files from Nike&#39;s systems. The group has published the data with filenames pointing toward design and manufacturing workflows, rather than customer databases.

Examples include directories labeled &quot;Women&#39;s Sportswear,&quot; &quot;Men&#39;s Sportswear,&quot; &quot;Training Resource – Factory,&quot; and &quot;Garment Making Process,&quot; suggesting the alleged haul centers on product development and production processes.

Nike confirmed it&#39;s looking into the matter but stopped short of validating the criminals&#39; claims. &quot;We always take consumer privacy and data security very seriously,&quot; a spokesperson told The Register. &quot;We are investigating a potential cybersecurity incident and are actively assessing the situation.&quot;

When asked, the company declined to say what data was stolen and whether it planned to pay a ransom demand.

There&#39;s nothing so far to suggest customer or employee records were involved, which keeps regulators at arm&#39;s length for now. That said, design files, factory training notes, and process documentation are the sort of internal plumbing companies don&#39;t expect to lose control of, even if they don&#39;t trigger formal breach notices. It doesn&#39;t take much imagination to see how copycats or grey-market factories might make use of it.

Crews like WorldLeaks aren&#39;t bothering with ransomware theatrics anymore and are going straight for whatever files they can grab. The crew is said to be a rebrand of Hunters International, a ransomware gang that&#39;s been around since 2023. These days they don&#39;t bother encrypting anything; they just take the data and start leaning on victims with the threat of leaks. With police pressure up and fewer companies paying for decryptors, that&#39;s where the leverage is now.

WorldLeaks claims hundreds of victims so far, with manufacturers and industrial firms cropping up again and again. Dell made the crew&#39;s hitlist in July last year, but claimed WorldLeaks didn&#39;t make off with any important data.

The Nike claim lands just weeks after another US sportswear heavyweight was forced into cleanup mode. Under Armour disclosed a breach following an attack by the Everest ransomware gang. According to Have I Been Pwned, the extortion crew exposed the details of 72.7 million Under Armour accounts, including names, email addresses, dates of birth, genders, geographic locations, and purchase information.

As with most extortion claims, the true size and value of the haul is hard to judge without Nike putting more on the record. What does seem clear is that fashion and sportswear firms, with messy global supply chains and a steady stream of new designs moving between partners, have become a target for data thieves who don&#39;t need customer databases to cause real damage. ®

            <h2>Microsoft probes Windows 11 boot failures tied to January security updates</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/26/microsoft_probes_windows_11_boot/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft is investigating reports that its January 2026 security updates are leaving some Windows 11 machines stuck in a boot loop, adding another entry to this month&#39;s bumper post–Patch Tuesday borkage list.

The issue affects a &quot;limited number&quot; of physical Windows 11 devices that fail to start after installing the January security updates and later patches, instead showing an &quot;UNMOUNTABLE_BOOT_VOLUME&quot; stop code and a black screen offering little more than a restart prompt.

&quot;Your device ran into a problem and needs a restart. You can restart,&quot; the message reads, according to a Microsoft advisory spotted by Ask Woody. At this stage, Microsoft says, the system cannot complete startup and needs manual recovery steps to get going again.

According to Redmond&#39;s own incident note, the problem has been observed on Windows 11 versions 24H2 and 25H2, with no server editions affected and no reports of the same behavior on virtual machines.

The first signs of trouble appeared in user forums, where people reported that machines which had been working fine suddenly wouldn&#39;t boot after the January updates were installed. Security-focused updates are supposed to be among the least exciting parts of Windows maintenance, but for those hit by the bug, they have resulted in downtime and hands-on repair work rather than a quiet reboot.

Microsoft says it has received only a small number of reports so far and is still trying to determine whether the failures are definitely caused by a regression introduced by the January updates. Customers experiencing the issue are being told to contact business support or submit reports through the Feedback Hub while the investigation continues. The company says it will update its documentation once more details are confirmed.

While this particular problem appears limited in scope, it lands in the middle of a rough January for Microsoft&#39;s update machinery. Earlier this month, Redmond was already dealing with fallout from a Secure Launch bug that could prevent systems from shutting down cleanly, separate Windows app credential failures that broke sign-ins for some users, and an Outlook issue that causes the app freeze when saving files to cloud storage services.

The boot failure issue is the latest reminder that January&#39;s patches have been unusually good at introducing new headaches alongside their promised security fixes. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Opinion AI-integrated development environment (IDE) company Cursor recently implied it had built a working web browser almost entirely with its AI agents. I won&#39;t say they lied, but CEO Michael Truell certainly tweeted: &quot;We built a browser with GPT-5.2 in Cursor.&quot;

He followed up with: &quot;It&#39;s 3M+ lines of code across thousands of files. The rendering engine is from-scratch in Rust with HTML parsing, CSS cascade, layout, text shaping, paint, and a custom JS VM.&quot;

That sounds impressive, doesn&#39;t it? He also added: &quot;It *kind of* works,&quot; which is not the most ringing endorsement. Still, numerous news sources and social media chatterboxes ran with the news that AI built a web browser in a week.

Too bad it wasn&#39;t true. If you actually looked at Cursor engineer Wilson Lin&#39;s blog post about FastRender, the AI-created web browser, you won&#39;t see much boasting about a working web browser. Instead, there&#39;s a video of a web browser sort of working, and a much less positive note that &quot;building a browser from scratch is extremely difficult.&quot;

The thing about making such a software announcement on GitHub is that while the headlines are proclaiming another AI victory, developers have this nasty trick. They actually git the code and try it out.

Developers quickly discovered the &quot;browser&quot; barely compiles, often does not run, and was heavily misrepresented in marketing.

As a techie, the actual blog post about how they tried and didn&#39;t really succeed was much more interesting. Of course, that Cursor sicced hundreds of GPT-5.2-style agents which ran for a week to produce three million lines of new code, to produce, at best, a semi-functional web browser from scratch, doesn&#39;t make for a good headline.

According to Perplexity, my AI chatbot of choice, this week‑long autonomous browser experiment consumed in the order of 10-20 trillion tokens and would have cost several million dollars at then‑current list prices for frontier models.

I&#39;d just cloned a copy of Chromium myself, and for all that time and money, independent developers who cloned the repo reported that the codebase is very far from a functional browser. Recent commits do not compile cleanly, GitHub Actions runs on main are failing, and reviewers could not find a single recent commit that was built without errors.

Where builds succeeded after manual patching, performance was abysmal, with reports of pages taking around a minute to load and a heavy reliance on existing projects like Servo, a Rust-based web rendering engine, and QuickJS, a JavaScript engine, despite &quot;from scratch&quot; claims.

Lin defended the project on Y Combinator, saying, for instance: &quot;The JS engine used a custom JS VM being developed in vendor/ecma-rs as part of the browser, which is a copy of my personal JS parser project vendored to make it easier to commit to.&quot; If it&#39;s derived from his personal JavaScript parser, that&#39;s not really from scratch, is it? Nor is it, from the sound of the argument, written by AI.

Gregory Terzian, a Servo maintainer, responded: &quot;The actual code is worse; I can only describe it as a tangle of spaghetti... I can&#39;t make much, if anything, out of it.&quot; He then gave the backhanded compliment: &quot;So I agree this isn&#39;t just wiring up of dependencies, and neither is it copied from existing implementations: it&#39;s a uniquely bad design that could never support anything resembling a real-world web engine.&quot; Now that&#39;s a burn.

From where I sit, what makes the Cursor case more dangerous than just a failed hack‑week project is that the hype is baked into its methodology. The &quot;experiment&quot; wasn&#39;t presented as what it really was: an interesting, but messy, internal learning exercise. No, it was rolled out as a milestone that conveniently confirmed the company&#39;s long‑running autonomous agent advertising. Missing from the story were basics any senior engineer would demand: passing Continuous Integration (CI), reproducible builds, and real benchmarks that show the browser doing more than limping through a hello-world page.

Zoom out, and CEOs are still predicting that AI will write 90 percent of code in a year, while most enterprise AI pilots still fail to deliver meaningful return on investment.

We&#39;re now in a kind of AI uncanny valley for developers. Sure, tools like Cursor can be genuinely helpful as glorified autocomplete and refactoring assistants, but marketing keeps insisting junior engineers can take whole projects from spec to shipping. When you start believing your own sizzle reel, you stop doing the tedious validation work that separates a demo from a deliverable.

Enough already. The hype has grown cold. Sarah Friar, OpenAI&#39;s CFO, recently blogged that in 2026, its focus would be on &quot;practical adoption.&quot; Let&#39;s see real-world practical results first, and then we can talk about practical AI adoption. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Russia was probably behind the failed attempts to compromise the systems of Poland&#39;s power companies in December, cybersecurity researchers claim.

ESET attributed the attack with &quot;medium&quot; confidence to Russia&#39;s GRU-run Sandworm unit, after it investigated the attack and its use of wiper malware.

The attackers, believed to be state-backed, deployed DynoWiper malware on Poland&#39;s national energy systems. Energy minister Milosz Motyka said they attempted to disrupt communication between renewable hardware and power distribution operators, but were unsuccessful.

The use of wiper malware is one of the telltale signs of Sandworm&#39;s likely involvement - the group has an extensive history of using wiper strains against the critical infrastructure of adversarial countries.

Mandiant previously linked blackouts in Ukraine to Sandworm&#39;s deployment of CaddyWiper in 2023, and the same group is thought to have executed WhisperGate wiper malware to coincide with its on-the-ground invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

ESET believes the DynoWiper attack on Poland was timed to mark the ten-year anniversary of Sandworm&#39;s 2015 attack on Ukraine&#39;s energy sector, which researchers suspect was the first case of malware-related blackouts.

&quot;We continue to investigate the incident and broader implications,&quot; said ESET Research via social media. &quot;As new evidence or links to additional Sandworm activity emerge, we will share further updates to help defenders protect critical sectors.&quot;

Poland, a NATO member and supporter of Ukraine, naturally has a fractious relationship with Russia, although it is one that was never truly friendly.

Officials have not linked the latest aggression to any specific event between the two countries, although it&#39;s somewhat of a take-your-pick situation if you look for reasons in the months preceding the attack.

Polish Prime minister Donald Tusk announced in November that he was closing Russia&#39;s last consulate in the country after tying Moscow to an explosion that destroyed part of a key rail line used for transporting resources into Ukraine.

In October, Poland confirmed new sanctions on steel companies it suspected were circumventing international sanctions to export goods to Russia.

Various instances of Russia probing military tolerances also focused on Poland, such as recon planes approaching Polish airspace, although Russia tends to push its luck in this regard with most of its adversaries.

Since the attempted cyberattack, which officials described as the strongest the power grid has faced in years, Poland arrested a slew of individuals suspected of playing key roles in Russian espionage rings.

Recent reports also suggest Poland is working with NATO to establish an Eastern Flank Deterrence Line along the eastern border with Belarus. The initiative will reportedly set up a largely unmanned border security system, complete with autonomous weapons systems and AI-powered monitoring tools, which Russia will no doubt view as an act of military aggression. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Opinion The Net is born free, but everywhere is in chains. This is a parody of Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#39;s 1762 book The Social Contract where he said the same about humans, but it&#39;s nonetheless true. The Net is built out of open, free protocols and open, free code. Yet it and we are bound by the rulemakers who build the services and set the laws of the places we go and the things that we do, not to our advantage.

Enshittification everywhere, and whatcha gonna do about it?

The ground rules of &quot;open&quot; are like any basic technology. Unintended consequences can make enemies of good ideas. One such is &quot;Like it or fork it.&quot; There&#39;s lots in modern browsers that people don&#39;t like, which is unsurprising with all that tasty personal data flowing through them. So people fork them. They remove the parts they don&#39;t like and bolster the bits that they do. Which is such a good idea, there are now hundreds of them. Who wrote them, how different they are, how secure, how buggy, how often updated, how popular? This is not a solution to what ails us.

Taking things away rather than adding yet more of them seems preferable. That&#39;s the philosophy behind Just the Browser, a new approach based on the observation that browsers which are part of an enterprise strategy must enforce obey policies. This subservience means turning off behaviors which enterprises might find objectionable, which includes much that individuals don&#39;t like either — if only they could get at the controls. Just the Browser makes that happen. A mainstream browser that respects your space. Imagine that. Less is more has never been truer.

Applying that principle more widely is much harder. Data harvesting, AI perversity, misdirection and hoop-jumping make the swamp deeper every day, and that&#39;s just from entities that claim legitimacy, the stuff we can see. The sense of overwhelm is ever more pressing, and when that happens there&#39;s a standard human response. Nostalgia.

This is where the Small Web comes in, or at least where it would like to. As a conscious reaction to corporate power running amok where innocent, enthusiastic human exploration once ruled, this goes back to at least the far off days of 2020, where the notion of the Web Revival was promulgated. Drawing parallels with the folk revival of the 20th century, it promised the Web Unplugged, an independent state of small pages, small servers and human-scale peer-to-peer interaction.

This idea has never prospered, neither has it died. The Small Web concept has seen various codifications of what it means, what it&#39;s trying to do, and how it should be built. The original pre-web pioneers who built the first tools for the first pioneer users are largely still out there, as are those tools. Gopher, the leading content explorer and protocol before it got eaten by Tim Berners-Lee&#39;s pet Tyrannosaurus rex, is running just fine through proxies or, for the hardcore, applications — never apps, of course.

You can quickly get a feel for how things really were by dipping a toe in that way, or check on the latest ambitions of the Small Webbers. On the plus side, text pages delivered over gigabit networks to multicore gigahertz 64-bit processors are intoxicatingly fast and ridiculously easy to navigate. There are no distractions. There&#39;s also not much else.

The Small Web is a monastic commune out in the country, proof that you can live free of the modern world, but not that you&#39;d want to. Proponents talk of self-hosting and peer-to-peer as the only topology, which is great for some but useless for most. Self-hosting worked when there was no alternative, when most users were technical enough to get late-&#39;80s networking going, and most hackers were not yet zygotes. The internet in general, and the web in particular, exploded into a vacuum. The Small Web has yet to find a niche the size of a rock pool. Nonetheless, we need it.

The irony is, we all live in our own small webs, infinitely tiny subsets of all that&#39;s on offer. Our social networks are limited by necessity, our content sources are self-curated, our daily lives routine. This makes the Shadow Web a place where content can be shared and discovered but where trackers, cookies and big things don&#39;t exist. Finding, filtering, creating and curating content, all can be partially or wholly automated, and the better the experience the more the Small Web will become a true symbiont of the Big. It can never replace the Amazons and YouTubes, but it can put them downtown while we live in the parks and coffeeshops of the civilized outskirts.

Advertising tech? Nein danke. Nothing wrong with adverts that fit the rules - text, simple graphics, served by the content creator, just as in print media. Small Web users are going to be smart, high value users, much as those smart enough to get into the oases of airport lounges. It&#39;ll be a good place to experiment with all the good ideas that got squeezed out, like microtransactions that let you buy an article for five pennies, instantly and anonymously.

Microsoft has had to issue two out-of-band updates to fix its buggy Windows 11 patch.

Microsoft’s first update for Windows 11 in 2026 has been a buggy mess, to say the least. After reports of shutdown issues on some machines, Microsoft issued an emergency update to fix its January 2026 Windows 11 update last weekend. Now, exactly a week later, the software maker has been forced to issue a second unusual out-of-band fix to address OneDrive and Dropbox crashes.

Microsoft is also investigating reports of boot failures that could be related to its January 2026 security update.

While the first shutdown bug was limited to machines running Enterprise and IoT editions of Windows 11 version 23H2, the latest out-of-band update fixes crashes and unresponsiveness in OneDrive and Dropbox on the latest 24H2 and 25H2 versions of Windows 11.

Just like the first emergency patch to fix this problematic January 2026 update, the second out-of-band update was released over a weekend, leaving IT admins with a busy Monday morning. There could be further headaches ahead for IT admins, too.

Microsoft warned over the weekend that its January 2026 update may also be creating boot failures on some machines. In an alert to IT admins, the company said it was investigating reports of boot failures with 24H2 and 25H2 after installing the January 2026 update. Some PCs have been bluescreening with a UNMOUNTABLE_BOOT_VOLUME stop code, and Microsoft warns these machines need to be manually recovered.

Microsoft hasn’t completed its investigation into the boot failures, so it’s not clear if it’s definitely this update causing the problems. A similar security update last year was initially blamed for SSD issues, but the root cause was actually early versions of firmware and motherboard BIOS.

Widespread issues have raised fears of censorship but could just be teething pains.

TikTok has suffered from extensive problems on its first weekend after completing the sale of its US arm, though some issues appear to have spread globally. TikTok has yet to confirm any issues a day after troubles began, making it difficult to surmise the extent of the problems.

Nevertheless, Tiktokkers — including some Verge writers — have confirmed issues including difficulty logging in, an inability to upload videos, a For You Page algorithm that appeared to have reset itself, problems loading comments, and other site features.

According to DownDetector, the issues spiked in the early hours of Sunday morning, but some users are still reporting errors. Many have found it impossible to upload videos, which sat “under review” indefinitely, and for one Verge writer that’s still the case — a video uploaded last night has yet to go live on their page some six hours later.

As of last week, TikTok’s US operation is under the ownership of an investment consortium including Larry Ellison’s cloud giant Oracle, the solution to its long-threatened US ban. This has already led to the imposition of new terms of service on US users, which include collection of more precise location data and details of users’ AI interactions. The new owners also take control of US content moderation, which had sparked some to fear censorship even before this weekend’s issues, and must retrain the app’s algorithm based on US data.

Given the timing, many drew a link between TikTok’s issues, its US operation’s new Trump-friendly owners, and this weekend’s anti-ICE protests in Minneapolis, exacerbated by the killing of a second local resident, Alex Pretti, by federal agents. The phrasing of the error message led several politically active accounts to assume the worst when their videos wouldn’t publish, as did the fact that previously political For You Pages were suddenly filled with generic content.

However, so far there’s no reason to believe that the outage was directly linked to this weekend’s ICE activity, especially since some Redditors from outside the US have reported issues with the app, too — though it’s been fine for two of The Verge’s British writers. That doesn’t guarantee the new ownership has nothing to do with it though, as technical problems caused by backend changes during the migration could easily have ripple effects across TikTok’s global user base.

We reached out to TikTok for comment on the outage, but hadn’t heard back by the time of publication.

            <div id="article-text">Even the most seemingly apolitical creators have had enough.

Even the most seemingly apolitical creators have had enough.

It’s not surprising when the guy who’s been yelling about the horrors of late-stage capitalism on Instagram for the last five years turns his ire toward ICE. But something different has been happening over the week or so, following the most recent shootings of civilians by federal agents — even accounts that stay laser focused on golfing, chopping wood, and playing cats like bongos have started to speak out.

The tenor on social media and Reddit took an even sharper turn yesterday, following the killing of Alex Pretti by ICE. Even the moderator of normally politics-free r/catbongos (a subreddit “Where gentlemen, gentlewomen, and gentlethems of quality gather to watch cats being played like bongos”) spoke out in a post where they declared that “If you still support Trump/ICE even slightly, you’re not welcome in this sub.”

That quilters on Instagram or a Facebook account dedicated to New England gravestones have decided enough, is enough, is one thing. But, judging from the comments, it seems like the government has lost the support of r/military as well. The subreddit is filled with angry posters decrying that “this is exactly what tyranny looks like” and sharing memes mocking Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. One poster claiming to be an active member of the US Army who has served for 21 years said, “these guys are against all we stand for as Americans. Modern day brownshirts.”

All across Reddit, subs are being inundated with anti-ICE posts. From r/Fauxmoi, to r/NFCNorthMemeWar, and r/DungeonCrawlerCarl. There’s even been some limited signs of revolt among the members of r/conservative, some of whom have taken issue with Kristi Noem’s description of Alexi Pretti as a “domestic terrorist” and suggested that she should “just be quiet for a while.” And arguments have broken out among community members over perceived hypocrisy around the Second Amendment.

Some big names have also joined the chorus, including Joe Santagato of The Basement Yard podcast, who posted that what was occurring on the streets of Minneapolis was “legit horrifying.” And when someone told him to “Stay out of politics,” and “get back to spitting water out of your mouth and de-jumbling words with your idiot friends,” he shot back, “De-jumble this: ksuc ym slalb.”

Canadian wrestlers and social media influencers Chris and Patrick Vörös have spoken out previously about their anti-ICE views, but took the opportunity to remind people of the only two ICE agents they support. Educational YouTube channel Primer also took to X to say this is no longer about politics, but about the “fabric of society.”

Synthfluencers and music gear YouTubers have also spoken out, including Benn Jordan, Randall Taylor (Amulets), Bad Snacks, and Jason Mays, one of the hosts of Working Class Music. The United Musicians & Allied Workers has also called for the abolition of ICE. Many manufacturers have also thrown their support behind the people of Minneapolis, even if it turns off some of their potential customers, including Drolo, Chase Bliss, and Hungry Robot.

Canadian musician bbno$ decided to break his silence, even if it risked his visa and his current US tour, to throw his support behind the abolish ICE movement. Even Thoren Bradley, the Axe Man himself, whose whole schtick is being a ripped rural dude who chops wood, has decided to call out the hypocrisy of the Christian conservatives to his 10.7 million followers.

The National Basketball Players Association also released a statement, saying that it “stand(s) in solidarity with the people of Minnesota protesting and risking their lives to demand justice.”

That creators like Hank Green are speaking out is no surprise. But when fitness influencers, duck-painting TikTokers, football subreddits, bourbon Instagramers, and even Second Amendment rights activists have finally broken their silence, it seems like the government has lost control of the narrative. No matter how hard they try to spin it.

Let us know in the comments what other creators and communities have begun to speakout.

Updates January 25th: Added additional information about Reddit communities, music gear manufacturers, and a statement from the NBPA.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">﻿What is the point of law enforcement that doesn’t follow the law?

Shortly after federal agents killed Alex Pretti Saturday morning, the Department of Homeland Security began to run with the story that the dead man had been armed and dangerous. He had a gun, DHS said. (A Bellingcat analysis of the video concludes that Pretti was unarmed when he was shot.) He had approached the agents holding the gun, DHS said. (He was holding a phone, The New York Times reports.) Pretti died on his knees, surrounded by armed Border Patrol agents, with shot after shot unloaded in his direction.

America’s Second Amendment is beloved by conservatives. Minnesota allows open carry with a permit. Pretti lived in a city where people are regularly being assaulted and even killed by the masked and armed men he was busy observing. So why has so much ink been spilled over the minutiae of his behavior? Why is it so normal for law enforcement — those who are supposed to be keepers of law and order — to kill Americans? And why is the only question at the end of the day how much their victims deserved to die?

In July 2020, DHS sent in over a hundred federal officers from various agencies to my city of Portland, Oregon. They flooded downtown with a thick fog of brownish tear gas. This didn’t neutralize the crowds — it merely hurt and enraged them. The city understood it was being intentionally tormented by sadists and chose to walk into the tear gas out of spite.

Throughout the protests, politicians and media figures fixated on whether Portland and other cities were the site of “protests” or “riots.” The distinction was drawn solely based on the behavior of the protesters, whose actions were treated as if they occurred in a vacuum. But on the ground in Portland, that felt as if it was missing the point.

The protesters’ actions blurred the definition of nonviolence. They came wearing gas masks and carrying shields. People brought leaf blowers and intentionally blew the tear gas straight back at the agents who threw the canisters. They chucked plastic water bottles at the feds because they hated them and thought it might be funny to bonk them on their militarized helmets. No one was trying to murder the feds, but nevertheless, it was not the same as linking arms and walking down the streets of Selma while singing.

But if a riot was occurring in Portland, the feds had instigated it — preemptively escalating the situation with rubber bullets and pepper balls and gas canisters, weapons that don’t simply blur the definition of “nonlethal” but literally contradict it.

These unequal expectations were unfair to civilians. And they are being applied again, with greater weight and brutality, to the people of Minneapolis.

It is obvious that ICE’s presence in Minnesota is a source of conflict and anxiety. As feds leave disorder and fear in their wake, Minnesotans without training or state-issued protective gear are being asked to behave with greater restraint than the armed agents who are supposed to be upholding the law.

Early reporting would suggest that Pretti was violently killed while engaging nonviolently with federal law enforcement. Videos show that he was holding a phone and moving to help a protester when agents grabbed him by the legs and wrestled him to the ground. The agents shout that he has a gun only after they’ve pinned him to the ground.

Why must the victims of state violence be entrusted with the task of not escalating a situation?

But whatever happened, the physical coordinates of Pretti’s purported gun in the few seconds leading up to his killing are far less relevant than the ongoing siege of the Twin Cities. What, in the face of this aggression, is so relevant about his demeanor or his attitude or how he approached the agents right before his death? Why must the victims of state violence be entrusted with the task of not escalating a situation, when they’re not drawing a salary or health insurance or pension on the taxpayer’s dime?

The people are being charged with keeping the peace, asked to stand firm against the federal agents who are disrupting it. This is a sick form of double taxation — your paycheck gets docked so that a guy in a mask can beat you up while you try to calm him down. “That’s fine, dude, I’m not mad at you,” Renee Good told ICE agents moments before they shot her through the side window of her car. Did she deserve to die because she did an inadequate job of tempering their feelings?

What is the point of pinning someone to the ground before pouring pepper spray in his face? What is the point of all of this, except to anger the public, and then to respond to that anger with even more force? ICE, CBP, and Border Patrol have proven themselves incapable of obeying the law, let alone enforcing it for others; unable to self-soothe, let alone keep the peace. ICE and its ilk are not an answer to a problem, but a problem with only one solution. They are malignant, they are worthless, and they should not exist.

﻿The M4’s magnetic mount securely sticks to your phone but sometimes struggles to stay attached to the actual controller.

As a retro gaming fan, I was thrilled when Apple opened its App Store to emulators in 2024, but I’ve yet to find a controller that makes me want to fully embrace retro gaming on my phone.

Clamp-on controllers like the Backbone Pro are a bit too bulky, and I don’t want to prop my phone up somewhere to use a standalone gamepad. The Abxylute M4 seemed exactly what I was looking for when it debuted a few months ago. It’s a compact wireless gamepad that uses a magnetic mount to attach to my iPhone. It’s a clever design, but one that’s let down by stiff thumbsticks and a magnetic mount that doesn’t always feel like it’s securely supporting my phone.

There are two components to the Abxylute M4: a retro-looking rectangular gamepad that connects to your smartphone over Bluetooth, and a Q-shaped mount that attaches the controller to your phone so it feels like you’re playing a handheld console. The mount is compatible with MagSafe iPhone models and the Google Pixel 10 Series. I primarily tested it with an iPhone 16 Pro, but Abxylute includes an adhesive metal ring you can stick to the back of any phone to make it compatible.

The ring of magnets on the M4’s mount stuck to the back of my iPhone as securely as any MagSafe accessory or Qi2 charger I’ve ever used. It’s not going to come off until you want it to. It also features a smooth finish, allowing you to rotate the mount and attach the gamepad so that it completely hides behind your phone instead of hanging off the side. But the whole thing ends up being too bulky and thick to slip into a pocket, so I’ve been removing it entirely when not playing.

One limitation of the M4’s design is that when attached, it can only be used to play games in a landscape orientation. In a vertical mode, the controller doesn’t protrude far enough for all its controls to be accessible. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but as a decades-old Game Boy fan, I tend to prefer playing games vertically. Recently announced mobile controllers like the GameSir Pocket Taco and the 8BitDo FlipPad support that.

A far bigger issue with the M4’s design, and a potential deal-breaker, is the connection between the mount and the controller. It also relies on a strong magnet that makes the controller snap into place when attached to the mount. But the connection doesn’t feel strong enough to always keep the mount securely connected to the controller while your phone’s attached.

The connection between the mount and controller feels secure enough when I’m holding the M4 and my phone up in front of me while playing a game. But at some angles, or when I accidentally bump my phone, the mount can separate from the gamepad. The two will also consistently disconnect if you absentmindedly turn the whole thing upside down, sending the phone and the attached mount falling. Thankfully, all my testing was done on a soft sofa.

I’m not the only one to experience this behavior. Retro Dodo’s Brandon Saltalamacchia did, too. The connection might fare better with a lighter phone, like the iPhone Air, but given smartphones are now a significant investment (my iPhone 16 Pro cost just shy of CA$1,500 here in Canada, or around $1,100 US), I’m not comfortable using the M4 as it’s designed.

The M4 isn’t entirely dependent on its magnetic mount. It can be used as a standalone controller with phones, consoles, or any device that supports Bluetooth gamepads. I was surprised at how comfortable it was to use with my gigantic hands. Its square-shaped design lets me reach the M4’s shoulder buttons without contorting my index fingers, and the build quality feels solid.

The controller’s four action buttons are small but have a satisfying amount of resistance. They’re paired with a large D-pad that’s a bit mushy and prone to registering inputs from multiple directions, but adequate for pick-up-and-play gaming sessions. Choose a different controller if you’re chasing high scores.

Abxylute includes two analog joysticks, a feature rarely found on controllers this size. They use a sliding disc design similar to what Nintendo used on the 3DS — but less effective. The sliding joysticks on the M4 are stiff and uncomfortable, making subtle movements nearly impossible. My thumb ached after just a handful of races in Mario Kart World, and I can’t see myself using either of the joysticks again.

As compact controllers go, the $49 Abxylute M4 is good, but far from great. But that’s not why people are going to buy it. Its promise of turning a smartphone into a handheld console helped the company raise over $300,000 from nearly 6,000 backers on Kickstarter — a lot of whom I think will be frustrated or disappointed if they’re not extra cautious while using it. Trusting your $1,000 mobile device to the M4 requires a leap of faith that’s a bit too far for me.

            <div id="article-text">﻿Doxxing is not a good reason to have faceless police.

﻿Doxxing is not a good reason to have faceless police.

Americans do not like masked secret police. There is really no other way to put it. The reasons why are manifold: accountability, trust in law enforcement, and just plain overall vibes. More concretely, not being able to tell who’s a cop and who’s not is dangerous. An assassin masquerading as law enforcement killed Minnesota legislator Melissa Hortman and her husband last year. How is anyone supposed to tell whether they’re being dragged out of their home in their underwear by ICE or by mere amateur thugs?

Last year, California passed the No Secret Police Act, which restricts masking for federal law enforcement, alongside the No Vigilantes Act, which requires law enforcement to wear some form of identification. The Department of Homeland Security immediately sued to enjoin the law on constitutional grounds; a judge has not yet ruled on whether to grant a preliminary injunction.

State legislatures all over the country continued to introduce their own anti-masking bills

Bills that ban masks on ICE agents have been introduced in Congress — from the identically named No Secret Police Act in the House to the VISIBLE Act in the Senate — but with Republican majorities in both chambers, neither of these bills is expected to become federal law. State legislatures have moved ahead without waiting for Washington, DC. Even after DHS sued to block California’s law, state legislatures all over the country continued to introduce their own anti-masking bills.

State legislatures that introduced bills last summer have slowly begun moving on them; just this past month, states like Maryland, Vermont, Washington, and Georgia introduced new bills. Los Angeles passed a city ordinance; the city of St. Paul is considering one as well. A Minnesota lawmaker says she will introduce her own bill when the session opens in February. Besides California, at least 15 state legislatures have their own anti-masking bills pending.

For their part, ICE has clung to the gaiters like life support. In an interview on Face the Nation last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused moderator Margaret Brennan of “doxxing” Jonathan Ross, the man who has been identified as the ICE agent who shot Renee Good despite his use of a face-obscuring gaiter in the many videos taken during the shooting.

“Don’t say his name, for heaven’s sakes. We shouldn’t have people continue to doxx law enforcement when they have an 8,000 percent increase in death threats against them,” Noem scolded Brennan. When Brennan pointed out that his name was public knowledge, Noem responded, “I know, but that doesn’t mean it should continue to be said.”

“The threats to federal officers are serious and potentially deadly,” the US Department of Justice claimed in its lawsuit to enjoin the No Secret Police Act. A list of such threats includes “taunting” and “online doxxing.”

A press release on the Department of Homeland Security website claims that death threats against ICE agents have increased 8,000 percent and that assaults have increased 1,300 percent. The webpage consists mostly of a lot of blurry screenshots of X posts. There are a handful of photos of injuries supposedly suffered by ICE agents — two photos of a hand bleeding from what is supposed to be a bite, and another photo (face partially obscured) of an agent with a busted lip.

This 1,300 percent increase in the kind of blood loss you’d get from a minor skateboarding injury is not a particularly compelling reason to allow law enforcement to wear masks. Noem sounds like a clown when she goes on about ICE agents getting doxxed. But she’s a clown with the law on her side.

California’s No Secret Police Act faces an uphill battle in the courts. For one thing, the law targets federal law enforcement but doesn’t apply the same requirements to local police. If that were the only problem, that would just be a matter of fixing the wording. But unfortunately for the 15 similar bills that are pending in other state legislatures, the most fundamental issue at play — the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution — gives the feds an advantage. States have a very limited capacity to affect how the feds do their jobs: that is sort of the point of federalism, after all. One legal expert claims that it is “clear” that the No Secret Police Act is constitutionally invalid; another makes the much more optimistic assessment that “under existing precedent, mask bans are neither clearly prohibited nor clearly permissible.”

But this being an open question of law is a bizarre insult to the conscience. It’s not just that it’s perfectly legal for ICE to mask themselves, it really might be illegal for the state of California to try to stop them.

Normal people despise the masks. Only 31 percent of Americans think ICE agents should be allowed to wear them. Even the sheltered, shrinking bubble of Republicans — whose approval of ICE floats somewhere between 70 and 80 percent — falters in enthusiasm when it comes to what ICE agents are wearing. (Sixty-three percent of Republicans are okay with the masks, but a majority of Republicans think agents should be in uniform.) After a Reagan-appointed federal judge heard out the reasoning for the masks, he called it “disingenuous, squalid and dishonorable,” saying that “ICE goes masked for a single reason — to terrorize Americans into quiescence.”

Most judges aren’t weird little internet forum trolls for whom doxxing is the greatest imaginable threat

When faced with the Trump administration’s single-minded obsession with “doxxing,” judges have often been either bemused or enraged. Part of this may be that most judges aren’t weird little internet forum trolls for whom doxxing is the greatest imaginable threat anyone can face. But more importantly, a federal judge — whose name and face are a matter of public record — frequently makes decisions likely to piss off very dangerous and violent people. The idea that an officer of the law must be faceless to do their job is an insult to their own line of work.

Cops, too, are not entirely sold on the masks — the International Association of Chiefs of Police issued a resolution warning against the use of face masks. In an interview with NPR last year, the head of the organization called face coverings “a real slippery slope,” saying that the masks undermined police legitimacy. “We feel strongly that the face coverings are inappropriate in most cases in policing in a democratic society in 2025,” he said.

This comes up in California’s defense of the No Secret Police Act and No Vigilantes Act — showing a face and a badge has long been a standard practice for policing at both the federal and local level. “Before January 2025, when the practice of conducting civil immigration enforcement in masks and without identifiers began, officers generally wore an ‘ICE’ or ‘ICE POLICE’ insignia with visible badge and number,” the state of California wrote in its response to Homeland Security’s lawsuit.

The state conceded that “while all law enforcement agents should be entitled to protection from harassment and doxxing,” it charged DHS with offering “no evidence that masking or refusing to wear a badge or identification number—practices virtually unheard of before 2025—does anything to ameliorate this risk.”

The masks aren’t normal. Americans don’t like them. The fact that California’s attempt to ban them is in dicey legal territory is a strong indicator that things have gone seriously sideways.

Policy ought to reflect the will of the people in a democratic society. California should not be in court defending its law from the Supremacy Clause because it should not have had to pass the law in the first place. In a saner world, Congress would have passed a federal version of the No Secret Police Act; in an even saner one, the executive branch would be at all responsive to the objections of voters and would have stopped the practice entirely.

Faceless officials with guns and body armor are crying about how scared they are of having their names on the internet, while shooting unarmed Americans in the face. The American system of government was not meant to be this unmoored from reality; normal constitutional workings are under strain because the federal government is too internet-addled to tell the difference between doxxing and murder. California’s No Secret Police Act is the backup generator turning on because the entire grid has collapsed. If it does manage to survive in court, it won’t be enough to save our democracy. And if it is struck down — well, there’s no backup for the backup generator.

Meet the new biologists treating LLMs like aliens

How large is a large language model? We now coexist with machines so vast and so complicated that nobody quite understands what they are, how they work, or what they can really do—not even the people who build them.That’s a problem. Even though nobody fully understands how it works—and thus exactly what its limitations might be—hundreds of millions of people now use this technology every day.

To help overcome our ignorance, researchers are studying LLMs as if they were doing biology or neuroscience on vast living creatures—city-size xenomorphs that have appeared in our midst. And they’re discovering that large language models are even weirder than they thought. Read the full story.—Will Douglas Heaven

Job titles of the future: Head-transplant surgeon

The Italian neurosurgeon Sergio Canavero has been preparing for a surgery that might never happen. His idea? Swap a sick person’s head—or perhaps just the brain—onto a younger, healthier body.Canavero caused a stir in 2017 when he announced that a team he advised in China had exchanged heads between two corpses. But he never convinced skeptics that his technique could succeed—or to believe his claim that a procedure on a live person was imminent.

Canavero may have withdrawn from the spotlight, but the idea of head transplants isn’t going away. Instead, he says, the concept has recently been getting a fresh look from life-extension enthusiasts and stealth Silicon Valley startups. Read the full story.

For the past two decades, there’s been a clear first step for anyone who starts experiencing new medical symptoms: Look them up online. The practice was so common that it gained the pejorative moniker “Dr. Google.” But times are changing, and many medical-information seekers are now using LLMs. According to OpenAI, 230 million people ask ChatGPT health-related queries each week.

That’s the context around the launch of OpenAI’s new ChatGPT Health product, which debuted earlier this month. The big question is: can the obvious risks of using AI for health-related queries be mitigated enough for them to be a net benefit? Read the full story.

In the final weeks of 2025, the battle over regulating artificial intelligence in the US reached boiling point. On December 11, after Congress failed twice to pass a law banning state AI laws, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order seeking to handcuff states from regulating the booming industry.

Instead, he vowed to work with Congress to establish a “minimally burdensome” national AI policy. The move marked a victory for tech titans, who have been marshaling multimillion-dollar war chests to oppose AI regulations, arguing that a patchwork of state laws would stifle innovation.

In 2026, the battleground will shift to the courts. While some states might back down from passing AI laws, others will charge ahead. Read our story about what’s on the horizon.

This week marked a rather unpleasant anniversary: It’s a year since Texas reported a case of measles—the start of a significant outbreak that ended up spreading across multiple states. Since the start of January 2025, there have been over 2,500 confirmed cases of measles in the US. Three people have died.

As vaccination rates drop and outbreaks continue, scientists have been experimenting with new ways to quickly identify new cases and prevent the disease from spreading. And they are starting to see some success with wastewater surveillance. Read the full story.

After falling steadily for decades, the prevalence of global hunger is now on the rise—nowhere more so than in sub-Saharan Africa.

Africa’s indigenous crops are often more nutritious and better suited to the hot and dry conditions that are becoming more prevalent, yet many have been neglected by science, which means they tend to be more vulnerable to diseases and pests and yield well below their theoretical potential.

Now the question is whether researchers, governments, and farmers can work together in a way that gets these crops onto plates and provides Africans from all walks of life with the energy and nutrition that they need to thrive, whatever climate change throws their way. Read the full story.

In the final weeks of 2025, the battle over regulating artificial intelligence in the US reached a boiling point. On December 11, after Congress failed twice to pass a law banning state AI laws, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order seeking to handcuff states from regulating the booming industry. Instead, he vowed to work with Congress to establish a “minimally burdensome” national AI policy, one that would position the US to win the global AI race. The move marked a qualified victory for tech titans, who have been marshaling multimillion-dollar war chests to oppose AI regulations, arguing that a patchwork of state laws would stifle innovation.

In 2026, the battleground will shift to the courts. While some states might back down from passing AI laws, others will charge ahead, buoyed by mounting public pressure to protect children from chatbots and rein in power-hungry data centers. Meanwhile, dueling super PACs bankrolled by tech moguls and AI-safety advocates will pour tens of millions into congressional and state elections to seat lawmakers who champion their competing visions for AI regulation.

Trump’s executive order directs the Department of Justice to establish a task force that sues states whose AI laws clash with his vision for light-touch regulation. It also directs the Department of Commerce to starve states of federal broadband funding if their AI laws are “onerous.” In practice, the order may target a handful of laws in Democratic states, says James Grimmelmann, a law professor at Cornell Law School. “The executive order will be used to challenge a smaller number of provisions, mostly relating to transparency and bias in AI, which tend to be more liberal issues,” Grimmelmann says.

For now, many states aren’t flinching. On December 19, New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, signed the Responsible AI Safety and Education (RAISE) Act, a landmark law requiring AI companies to publish the protocols used to ensure the safe development of their AI models and report critical safety incidents. On January 1, California debuted the nation’s first frontier AI safety law, SB 53—which the RAISE Act was modeled on—aimed at preventing catastrophic harms such as biological weapons or cyberattacks. While both laws were watered down from earlier iterations to survive bruising industry lobbying, they struck a rare, if fragile, compromise between tech giants and AI safety advocates.

If Trump targets these hard-won laws, Democratic states like California and New York will likely take the fight to court. Republican states like Florida with vocal champions for AI regulation might follow suit. Trump could face an uphill battle. “The Trump administration is stretching itself thin with some of its attempts to effectively preempt [legislation] via executive action,” says Margot Kaminski, a law professor at the University of Colorado Law School. “It’s on thin ice.”

But Republican states that are anxious to stay off Trump’s radar or can’t afford to lose federal broadband funding for their sprawling rural communities might retreat from passing or enforcing AI laws. Win or lose in court, the chaos and uncertainty could chill state lawmaking. Paradoxically, the Democratic states that Trump wants to rein in—armed with big budgets and emboldened by the optics of battling the administration—may be the least likely to budge.

In lieu of state laws, Trump promises to create a federal AI policy with Congress. But the gridlocked and polarized body won’t be delivering a bill this year. In July, the Senate killed a moratorium on state AI laws that had been inserted into a tax bill, and in November, the House scrapped an encore attempt in a defense bill. In fact, Trump’s bid to strong-arm Congress with an executive order may sour any appetite for a bipartisan deal.

The executive order “has made it harder to pass responsible AI policy by hardening a lot of positions, making it a much more partisan issue,” says Brad Carson, a former Democratic congressman from Oklahoma who is building a network of super PACs backing candidates who support AI regulation. “It hardened Democrats and created incredible fault lines among Republicans,” he says.

While AI accelerationists in Trump’s orbit—AI and crypto czar David Sacks among them—champion deregulation, populist MAGA firebrands like Steve Bannon warn of rogue superintelligence and mass unemployment. In response to Trump’s executive order, Republican state attorneys general signed a bipartisan letter urging the FCC not to supersede state AI laws.

With Americans increasingly anxious about how AI could harm mental health, jobs, and the environment, public demand for regulation is growing. If Congress stays paralyzed, states will be the only ones acting to keep the AI industry in check. In 2025, state legislators introduced more than 1,000 AI bills, and nearly 40 states enacted over 100 laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Efforts to protect children from chatbots may inspire rare consensus. On January 7, Google and Character Technologies, a startup behind the companion chatbot Character.AI, settled several lawsuits with families of teenagers who killed themselves after interacting with the bot. Just a day later, the Kentucky attorney general sued Character Technologies, alleging that the chatbots drove children to suicide and other forms of self-harm. OpenAI and Meta face a barrage of similar suits. Expect more to pile up this year. Without AI laws on the books, it remains to be seen how product liability laws and free speech doctrines apply to these novel dangers. “It’s an open question what the courts will do,” says Grimmelmann.

While litigation brews, states will move to pass child safety laws, which are exempt from Trump’s proposed ban on state AI laws. On January 9, OpenAI inked a deal with a former foe, the child-safety advocacy group Common Sense Media, to back a ballot initiative in California called the Parents & Kids Safe AI Act, setting guardrails around how chatbots interact with children. The measure proposes requiring AI companies to verify users’ age, offer parental controls, and undergo independent child-safety audits. If passed, it could be a blueprint for states across the country seeking to crack down on chatbots.

Fueled by widespread backlash against data centers, states will also try to regulate the resources needed to run AI. That means bills requiring data centers to report on their power and water use and foot their own electricity bills. If AI starts to displace jobs at scale, labor groups might float AI bans in specific professions. A few states concerned about the catastrophic risks posed by AI may pass safety bills mirroring SB 53 and the RAISE Act.

Meanwhile, tech titans will continue to use their deep pockets to crush AI regulations. Leading the Future, a super PAC backed by OpenAI president Greg Brockman and the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, will try to elect candidates who endorse unfettered AI development to Congress and state legislatures. They’ll follow the crypto industry’s playbook for electing allies and writing the rules. To counter this, super PACs funded by Public First, an organization run by Carson and former Republican congressman Chris Stewart of Utah, will back candidates advocating for AI regulation. We might even see a handful of candidates running on anti-AI populist platforms.

In 2026, the slow, messy process of American democracy will grind on. And the rules written in state capitals could decide how the most disruptive technology of our generation develops far beyond America’s borders, for years to come.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This week marked a rather unpleasant anniversary: It’s a year since Texas reported a case of measles—the start of a significant outbreak that ended up spreading across multiple states. Since the start of January 2025, there have been over 2,500 confirmed cases of measles in the US. Three people have died.

As vaccination rates drop and outbreaks continue, scientists have been experimenting with new ways to quickly identify new cases and prevent the disease from spreading. And they are starting to see some success with wastewater surveillance.

After all, wastewater contains saliva, urine, feces, shed skin, and more. You could consider it a rich biological sample. Wastewater analysis helped scientists understand how covid was spreading during the pandemic. It’s early days, but it is starting to help us get a handle on measles.

Globally, there has been some progress toward eliminating measles, largely thanks to vaccination efforts. Such efforts led to an 88% drop in measles deaths between 2000 and 2024, according to the World Health Organization. It estimates that “nearly 59 million lives have been saved by the measles vaccine” since 2000.

Still, an estimated 95,000 people died from measles in 2024 alone—most of them young children. And cases are surging in Europe, Southeast Asia, and the Eastern Mediterranean region.

Last year, the US saw the highest levels of measles in decades. The country is on track to lose its measles elimination status—a sorry fate that met Canada in November after the country recorded over 5,000 cases in a little over a year.

Public health efforts to contain the spread of measles—which is incredibly contagious—typically involve clinical monitoring in health-care settings, along with vaccination campaigns. But scientists have started looking to wastewater, too.

Along with various bodily fluids, we all shed viruses and bacteria into wastewater, whether that’s through brushing our teeth, showering, or using the toilet. The idea of looking for these pathogens in wastewater to track diseases has been around for a while, but things really kicked into gear during the covid-19 pandemic, when scientists found that the coronavirus responsible for the disease was shed in feces.

This led Marlene Wolfe of Emory University and Alexandria Boehm of Stanford University to establish WastewaterSCAN, an academic-led program developed to analyze wastewater samples across the US. Covid was just the beginning, says Wolfe. “Over the years we have worked to expand what can be monitored,” she says.

Two years ago, for a previous edition of the Checkup, Wolfe told Cassandra Willyard that wastewater surveillance of measles was “absolutely possible,” as the virus is shed in urine. The hope was that this approach could shed light on measles outbreaks in a community, even if members of that community weren’t able to access health care and receive an official diagnosis. And that it could highlight when and where public health officials needed to act to prevent measles from spreading. Evidence that it worked as an effective public health measure was, at the time, scant.

Since then, she and her colleagues have developed a test to identify measles RNA. They trialed it at two wastewater treatment plants in Texas between December 2024 and May 2025. At each site, the team collected samples two or three times a week and tested them for measles RNA.

Over that period, the team found measles RNA in 10.5% of the samples they collected, as reported in a preprint paper published at medRxiv in July and currently under review at a peer-reviewed journal. The first detection came a week before the first case of measles was officially confirmed in the area. That’s promising—it suggests that wastewater surveillance might pick up measles cases early, giving public health officials a head start in efforts to limit any outbreaks.

There are more promising results from a team in Canada. Mike McKay and Ryland Corchis-Scott at the University of Windsor in Ontario and their colleagues have also been testing wastewater samples for measles RNA. Between February and November 2025, the team collected samples from a wastewater treatment facility serving over 30,000 people in Leamington, Ontario.

These wastewater tests are somewhat limited—even if they do pick up measles, they won’t tell you who has measles, where exactly infections are occurring, or even how many people are infected. McKay and his colleagues have begun to make some progress here. In addition to monitoring the large wastewater plant, the team used tampons to soak up wastewater from a hospital lateral sewer.

They then compared their measles test results with the number of clinical cases in that hospital. This gave them some idea of the virus’s “shedding rate.” When they applied this to the data collected from the Leamington wastewater treatment facility, the team got estimates of measles cases that were much higher than the figures officially reported.

Their findings track with the opinions of local health officials (who estimate that the true number of cases during the outbreak was around five to 10 times higher than the confirmed case count), the team members wrote in a paper published on medRxiv a couple of weeks ago.

There will always be limits to wastewater surveillance. “We’re looking at the pool of waste of an entire community, so it’s very hard to pull in information about individual infections,” says Corchis-Scott.

Wolfe also acknowledges that “we have a lot to learn about how we can best use the tools so they are useful.” But her team at WastewaterSCAN has been testing wastewater across the US for measles since May last year. And their findings are published online and shared with public health officials.

In some cases, the findings are already helping inform the response to measles. “We’ve seen public health departments act on this data,” says Wolfe. Some have issued alerts, or increased vaccination efforts in those areas, for example. “[We’re at] a point now where we really see public health departments, clinicians, [and] families using that information to help keep themselves and their communities safe,” she says.

McKay says his team has stopped testing for measles because the Ontario outbreak “has been declared over.” He says testing would restart if and when a single new case of measles is confirmed in the region, but he also thinks that his research makes a strong case for maintaining a wastewater surveillance system for measles.

McKay wonders if this approach might help Canada regain its measles elimination status. “It’s sort of like [we’re] a pariah now,” he says. If his approach can help limit measles outbreaks, it could be “a nice tool for public health in Canada to [show] we’ve got our act together.”

            <h2>“Dr. Google” had its issues. Can ChatGPT Health do better?</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/22/1131692/dr-google-had-its-issues-can-chatgpt-health-do-better/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the past two decades, there’s been a clear first step for anyone who starts experiencing new medical symptoms: Look them up online. The practice was so common that it gained the pejorative moniker “Dr. Google.” But times are changing, and many medical-information seekers are now using LLMs. According to OpenAI, 230 million people ask ChatGPT health-related queries each week.

That’s the context around the launch of OpenAI’s new ChatGPT Health product, which debuted earlier this month. It landed at an inauspicious time: Two days earlier, the news website SFGate had broken the story of Sam Nelson, a teenager who died of an overdose last year after extensive conversations with ChatGPT about how best to combine various drugs. In the wake of both pieces of news, multiple journalists questioned the wisdom of relying for medical advice on a tool that could cause such extreme harm.

Though ChatGPT Health lives in a separate sidebar tab from the rest of ChatGPT, it isn’t a new model. It’s more like a wrapper that provides one of OpenAI’s preexisting models with guidance and tools it can use to provide health advice—including some that allow it to access a user’s electronic medical records and fitness app data, if granted permission. There’s no doubt that ChatGPT and other large language models can make medical mistakes, and OpenAI emphasizes that ChatGPT Health is intended as an additional support, rather than a replacement for one’s doctor. But when doctors are unavailable or unable to help, people will turn to alternatives.

Some doctors see LLMs as a boon for medical literacy. The average patient might struggle to navigate the vast landscape of online medical information—and, in particular, to distinguish high-quality sources from polished but factually dubious websites—but LLMs can do that job for them, at least in theory. Treating patients who had searched for their symptoms on Google required “a lot of attacking patient anxiety [and] reducing misinformation,” says Marc Succi, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and a practicing radiologist. But now, he says, “you see patients with a college education, a high school education, asking questions at the level of something an early med student might ask.”

The release of ChatGPT Health, and Anthropic’s subsequent announcement of new health integrations for Claude, indicate that the AI giants are increasingly willing to acknowledge and encourage health-related uses of their models. Such uses certainly come with risks, given LLMs’ well-documented tendencies to agree with users and make up information rather than admit ignorance.

But those risks also have to be weighed against potential benefits. There’s an analogy here to autonomous vehicles: When policymakers consider whether to allow Waymo in their city, the key metric is not whether its cars are ever involved in accidents but whether they cause less harm than the status quo of relying on human drivers. If Dr. ChatGPT is an improvement over Dr. Google—and early evidence suggests it may be—it could potentially lessen the enormous burden of medical misinformation and unnecessary health anxiety that the internet has created.

Pinning down the effectiveness of a chatbot such as ChatGPT or Claude for consumer health, however, is tricky. “It’s exceedingly difficult to evaluate an open-ended chatbot,” says Danielle Bitterman, the clinical lead for data science and AI at the Mass General Brigham health-care system. Large language models score well on medical licensing examinations, but those exams use multiple-choice questions that don’t reflect how people use chatbots to look up medical information.

Sirisha Rambhatla, an assistant professor of management science and engineering at the University of Waterloo, attempted to close that gap by evaluating how GPT-4o responded to licensing exam questions when it did not have access to a list of possible answers. Medical experts who evaluated the responses scored only about half of them as entirely correct. But multiple-choice exam questions are designed to be tricky enough that the answer options don’t give them entirely away, and they’re still a pretty distant approximation for the sort of thing that a user would type into ChatGPT.

A different study, which tested GPT-4o on more realistic prompts submitted by human volunteers, found that it answered medical questions correctly about 85% of the time. When I spoke with Amulya Yadav, an associate professor at Pennsylvania State University who runs the Responsible AI for Social Emancipation Lab and led the study, he made it clear that he wasn’t personally a fan of patient-facing medical LLMs. But he freely admits that, technically speaking, they seem up to the task—after all, he says, human doctors misdiagnose patients 10% to 15% of the time. “If I look at it dispassionately, it seems that the world is gonna change, whether I like it or not,” he says.

For people seeking medical information online, Yadav says, LLMs do seem to be a better choice than Google. Succi, the radiologist, also concluded that LLMs can be a better alternative to web search when he compared GPT-4’s responses to questions about common chronic medical conditions with the information presented in Google’s knowledge panel, the information box that sometimes appears on the right side of the search results.

Since Yadav’s and Succi’s studies appeared online, in the first half of 2025, OpenAI has released multiple new versions of GPT, and it’s reasonable to expect that GPT-5.2 would perform even better than its predecessors. But the studies do have important limitations: They focus on straightforward, factual questions, and they examine only brief interactions between users and chatbots or web search tools. Some of the weaknesses of LLMs—most notably their sycophancy and tendency to hallucinate—might be more likely to rear their heads in more extensive conversations and with people who are dealing with more complex problems. Reeva Lederman, a professor at the University of Melbourne who studies technology and health, notes that patients who don’t like the diagnosis or treatment recommendations that they receive from a doctor might seek out another opinion from an LLM—and the LLM, if it’s sycophantic, might encourage them to reject their doctor’s advice.

Some studies have found that LLMs will hallucinate and exhibit sycophancy in response to health-related prompts. For example, one study showed that GPT-4 and GPT-4o will happily accept and run with incorrect drug information included in a user’s question. In another, GPT-4o frequently concocted definitions for fake syndromes and lab tests mentioned in the user’s prompt. Given the abundance of medically dubious diagnoses and treatments floating around the internet, these patterns of LLM behavior could contribute to the spread of medical misinformation, particularly if people see LLMs as trustworthy.

OpenAI has reported that the GPT-5 series of models is markedly less sycophantic and prone to hallucination than their predecessors, so the results of these studies might not apply to ChatGPT Health. The company also evaluated the model that powers ChatGPT Health on its responses to health-specific questions, using their publicly available HeathBench benchmark. HealthBench rewards models that express uncertainty when appropriate, recommend that users seek medical attention when necessary, and refrain from causing users unnecessary stress by telling them their condition is more serious that it truly is. It’s reasonable to assume that the model underlying ChatGPT Health exhibited those behaviors in testing, though Bitterman notes that some of the prompts in HealthBench were generated by LLMs, not users, which could limit how well the benchmark translates into the real world.

An LLM that avoids alarmism seems like a clear improvement over systems that have people convincing themselves they have cancer after a few minutes of browsing. And as large language models, and the products built around them, continue to develop, whatever advantage Dr. ChatGPT has over Dr. Google will likely grow. The introduction of ChatGPT Health is certainly a move in that direction: By looking through your medical records, ChatGPT can potentially gain far more context about your specific health situation than could be included in any Google search, although numerous experts have cautioned against giving ChatGPT that access for privacy reasons.

Even if ChatGPT Health and other new tools do represent a meaningful improvement over Google searches, they could still conceivably have a negative effect on health overall. Much as automated vehicles, even if they are safer than human-driven cars, might still prove a net negative if they encourage people to use public transit less, LLMs could undermine users’ health if they induce people to rely on the internet instead of human doctors, even if they do increase the quality of health information available online.

Lederman says that this outcome is plausible. In her research, she has found that members of online communities centered on health tend to put their trust in users who express themselves well, regardless of the validity of the information they are sharing. Because ChatGPT communicates like an articulate person, some people might trust it too much, potentially to the exclusion of their doctor. But LLMs are certainly no replacement for a human doctor—at least not yet.

It’s supposed to be frigid in Davos this time of year. Part of the charm is seeing the world’s elite tromp through the streets in respectable suits and snow boots. But this year it’s positively balmy, with highs in the mid 30s, or a little over 1°C. The current conditions when I flew out of New York were colder, and definitely snowier. I’m told this is due to something called a föhn, a dry warm wind that’s been blowing across the Alps.

I’m no meteorologist, but it’s true that there is a lot of hot air here.

On Wednesday, President Donald Trump arrived in Davos to address the assembly, and held forth for more than 90 minutes, weaving his way through remarks about the economy, Greenland, windmills, Switzerland, Rolexes, Venezuela, and drug prices. It was a talk lousy with gripes, grievances and outright falsehoods.

One small example: Trump made a big deal of claiming that China, despite being the world leader in manufacturing windmill componentry, doesn’t actually use them for energy generation itself. In fact, it is the world leader in generation, as well.

I did not get to watch this spectacle from the room itself. Sad!

By the time I got to the Congress Hall where the address was taking place, there was already a massive scrum of people jostling to get in.

I had just wrapped up moderating a panel on “the intelligent co-worker,” ie: AI agents in the workplace. I was really excited for this one as the speakers represented a diverse cross-section of the AI ecosystem. Christoph Schweizer, CEO of BCG had the macro strategic view; Enrique Lores, HP CEO, could speak to both hardware and large enterprises, Workera CEO Kian Katanforoosh has the inside view on workforce training and transformation, Manjul Shah CEO of Hippocratic AI addressed working in the high stakes field of healthcare, and Kate Kallot CEO of Amini AI gave perspective on the global south and Africa in particular.

Interestingly, most of the panel shied away from using the term co-worker, and some even rejected the term agent. But the view they painted was definitely one of humans working alongside AI and augmenting what’s possible. Shah, for example, talked about having agents call 16,000 people in Texas during a heat wave to perform a health and safety check. It was a great discussion. You can watch the whole thing here.

But by the time it let out, the push of people outside the Congress Hall was already too thick for me to get in. In fact I couldn’t even get into a nearby overflow room. I did make it into a third overflow room, but getting in meant navigating my way through a mass of people, so jammed in tight together that it reminded me of being at a Turnstile concert.

The speech blew way past its allotted time, and I had to step out early to get to yet another discussion. Walking through the halls while Trump spoke was a truly surreal experience. He had truly captured the attention of the gathered global elite. I don’t think I saw a single person not starting at a laptop, or phone or iPad, all watching the same video.

Trump is speaking again on Thursday in a previously unscheduled address to announce his Board of Peace. As is (I heard) Elon Musk. So it’s shaping up to be another big day for elite attention capture.

I should say, though, there are elites, and then there are elites. And there are all sorts of ways of sorting out who is who. Your badge color is one of them. I have a white participant badge, because I was moderating panels. This gets you in pretty much anywhere and therefore is its own sort of status symbol. Where you are staying is another. I’m in Klosters, a neighboring town that’s a 40 minute train ride away from the Congress Centre. Not so elite.

There are more subtle ways of status sorting, too. Yesterday I learned that when people ask if this is your first time at Davos, it’s sometimes meant as a way of trying to figure out how important you are. If you’re any kind of big deal, you’ve probably been coming for years.

But the best one I’ve yet encountered happened when I made small talk with the woman sitting next to me as I changed back into my snow boots. It turned out that, like me, she lived in California–at least part time. “But I don’t think I’ll stay there much longer,” she said, “due to the new tax law.” This was just an ice cold flex.

Because California’s newly proposed tax legislation? It only targets billionaires.

Here are our picks for the advances to watch in the years ahead—and why we think they matter right now.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

            <div id="article-text">Warsaw, Poland 26 January 2026 – Rainbow Weather has raised $5.5 million in seed funding to push weather forecasting further into the short-term, high-precision territory it believes the industry still underserves.

The Warsaw-based climate tech startup focuses on hyperlocal, minute-by-minute forecasts, zeroing in on what happens in the next few hours rather than days out.

The round was backed by a syndicate of investors, including Yuri Gurski, founder of Flo Health, one of Europe’s best-known consumer tech unicorns.

Rainbow Weather’s core product is a mobile app that delivers four-hour precipitation forecasts calculated from the exact moment a user checks the weather.

Open the app at 3:51 am, and it forecasts conditions through 7:51am, refreshed every 10 minutes and mapped down to a one-square-kilometre grid. That level of temporal and spatial precision is what the company says sets it apart from mainstream weather apps.

Most major providers, including AccuWeather, Apple Weather, and The Weather Company, still rely on approaches that either simplify cloud movement or depend on large-scale numerical models designed for longer forecasts. According to Rainbow Weather, both methods struggle when conditions change quickly.

“Many legacy forecasting providers rely on optical flow for short-term precipitation forecasting. That’s a fast but simplistic method that treats clouds as shapes in motion, without any understanding of atmospheric physics,” explained Alexander Matveenko, co-founder of Rainbow Weather. “A second category of services uses large-scale mathematical models that do incorporate physical principles, but they’re so cumbersome and slow that they can’t respond quickly to real-time weather changes.”

Rainbow Weather positions itself in between, using machine learning to fuse high-resolution data from radar, satellites, weather stations, and even smartphone barometers. By combining these sources, the company claims it can reduce the noise and bias inherent in individual datasets, then generate forecasts faster than traditional systems.

The app currently focuses on short-term precipitation, but it has expanded into tracking wildfires and hurricanes, a feature added after the Palisades fire in Los Angeles. That expansion reflects a broader ambition to become a real-time risk awareness tool, not just a rain predictor.

The new funding will be used to extend Rainbow Weather’s forecasting window from four hours to 24 hours, add more weather parameters beyond precipitation, and grow its B2B offering.

The commercial weather intelligence market is expected to grow steadily over the next decade, driven by industries that depend on precise, near-term forecasts, from logistics and agriculture to aviation and drone operations.

Rainbow Weather says it has surpassed one million installs and has launched APIs aimed at companies that “can’t afford to get weather wrong.” It has also partnered with an unnamed long-term forecasting firm, supplying near-term data to improve broader climate models.

The founding team brings a track record of exits in applied AI. CEO Yuriy Melnichek previously founded AIMatter, acquired by Google, as well as consumer apps later bought by Pinterest and Farfetch. Matveenko previously sold mapping startup MapData to Mapbox.

Alongside its commercial products, the team also runs weatherindex.ai, an open-source project that evaluates short-term precipitation forecasts from major providers in real time. The tool compares live forecasts against verified airport weather reports, using standard accuracy metrics. It’s an unusual move in an industry not known for transparent benchmarking.

For Rainbow Weather, that openness is part of the pitch. The company is betting that as climate volatility increases, users and businesses will care less about next week’s weather and more about what happens in the next hour, and whether the forecast can be trusted.

Rainbow Weather is a next-gen climate tech startup for ultra-accurate short-term forecasts founded in 2021 by Yuriy Melnichek, who previously built AIMatter (acquired by Google), a neural network-based AI platform, as well as the video creation and editing app Vochi (acquired by Pinterest), and fashion marketplace Wanna (acquired by Farfetch), and Alexander Matveenko, a founder of artificial intelligence mapping startup MapData that he sold to Mapbox in 2017.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">London-based AI video startup Synthesia has raised $200 million in a Series E round, nearly doubling its valuation to around $4 billion and cementing its position as one of Europe’s most valuable AI companies.

The round was led by Google Ventures, with participation from existing investors, underscoring continued appetite for applied AI products that have already found a clear commercial use.

Synthesia builds generative AI tools that let companies create videos using AI-generated avatars instead of cameras, studios, or presenters. The technology has found a strong foothold in corporate training, internal communications, and product explainers, areas where speed, scale, and consistency often matter more than production gloss.

“Synthesia was founded on two core beliefs: first, that AI will bring the cost of content creation down to zero. And secondly, that AI video provides a better, more engaging way for organizations to communicate and learn,” said Victor Riparbelli, Synthesia’s co-founder and CEO.

Synthesia says a significant share of Fortune 100 companies now use its platform, a rare level of enterprise penetration for a European AI startup at this stage. Rather than chasing consumer virality, the company has built its business around predictable, high-value enterprise use cases, a strategy investors have increasingly rewarded over the past year.

The funding comes at a moment when enthusiasm around generative AI has shifted from experimentation to execution. Enterprises are no longer asking whether AI video works, but how reliably it can plug into existing workflows.

Synthesia’s pitch is that AI-generated video should be as routine as slides or documents, created quickly, updated easily, and deployed globally without production bottlenecks.

At a $4 billion valuation, Synthesia joins a small group of European AI companies that have managed to scale beyond regional relevance.

Its rise also highlights a broader pattern: applied AI startups, focused on specific business functions rather than general-purpose models, are attracting some of the largest growth rounds in the market.

For the UK tech ecosystem, the deal is another signal that London remains a serious hub for commercial AI, even as regulatory debates continue around model safety, copyright, and synthetic media.

Synthesia has previously positioned itself as cautious about misuse, building safeguards around consent and disclosure for its avatars, a stance that may become more important as scrutiny of AI-generated content increases.

The challenge ahead is less about proving demand and more about maintaining trust and differentiation as competitors multiply.

But with deep enterprise adoption, a clear product focus, and backing from one of Silicon Valley’s most influential investors, Synthesia is entering its next phase with momentum firmly on its side.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amsterdam-based hospitality tech platform Mews has raised €255 million (about $300 million) in a Series D funding round as it pushes deeper into automation and AI-powered workflows for hotels around the world.

The round was led by EQT Growth with new participation from Atomico and HarbourVest Partners, alongside existing backers including Kinnevik, Battery Ventures and Tiger Global. The investment values the company at roughly $2.5 billion.

Founded in 2012 by Richard Valtr and Matt Welle, Mews builds a cloud-native “operating system” for hotels  software that ties together reservations, check-ins, housekeeping, payments and more in one platform.

Its technology is designed to replace legacy systems that many hotels still rely on, offering a more flexible, connected way to manage day-to-day operations.

The new funding will be used to expand the company’s AI and automation capabilities at the core of its product.

That includes embedding agent-driven systems that can take on complex routine tasks, reduce manual work for staff and streamline how hotels handle everything from guest interactions to revenue management.

Mews says its platform already supports more than 15,000 properties in 85 countries, and in 2025 it processed nearly 42.3 million check-ins and handled nearly $20 billion in transaction volume.

The software also helped generate over $500 million in additional revenue for hoteliers through features like its Mews Spaces module.

In a statement, CEO Matt Welle said the new capital will help Mews build an operating system that handles operational complexity so hotel teams can focus on guest experience rather than juggling disparate tools.

“We are engineering an operating system that is changing how hoteliers interact with their guests,” CEO Matt Welle said, adding that the goal is to lighten the cognitive load on staff and make everyday operations smoother.

Industry observers say the round is one of the largest ever in hospitality software and reflects broader investor interest in infrastructure-level platforms that bring AI and fintech together for real-world business operations.

As hotels embrace digital transformation, technology that can automate workflows and personalise guest experiences  without adding complexity is increasingly in demand.

For Mews, the challenge now is execution: turning generous funding into tangible upgrades that deliver value for hoteliers of all sizes.

But with strong adoption, a global footprint and a growing suite of automation tools, the company is positioning itself as a central technology partner at a time when hotels are looking to modernise their operations and enhance guest satisfaction.

            <h2>How Flippa Is Removing the Language Barrier from Global Deal-Making</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/how-flippa-is-removing-the-language-barrier-from-global-deal-making">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For decades, access to high-quality deal flow and sophisticated M&A infrastructure has been largely designed for well-connected investors and industry giants. Small businesses and independent founders, particularly those operating outside English-speaking markets, may often find the barriers even higher. Language, geography, and limited access to networks could mean that opportunity stops at the border.

Amidst this trend, Flippa, a platform for buying and selling digital businesses, is rewriting the script and dismantling those barriers. Under the leadership of CEO Blake Hutchison, the company has connected buyers and sellers across continents, linguistic differences, and price points, closing deals from $100,000 up to $10 million. Now, with the launch of its AI-powered multi-language Deal Room, Flippa is addressing what it sees as one of the last major points of disadvantage in global business deals and M&A, calling it the “Language Tax.”

Founded in 2009, Flippa has grown into a global marketplace where entrepreneurs can buy and sell digital assets ranging from e-commerce stores and SaaS businesses to YouTube channels, online communities, and mobile applications. According to Hutchison, the platform supports users from 189 countries, attracting over 450,000 new buyers in the last two years alone. “Our internal data shows that cross-border transactions now account for approximately 85% of all deals completed on the platform,” Hutchison says. “That growth has been especially pronounced in Europe. As a highly fragmented market with high cross-border trade volume but multiple operating languages, I believe Europe often faces structural friction in cross-border dealmaking.”

He notes that European businesses are increasingly being acquired by international buyers, with US-based acquirers representing a significant share of demand. Yet, as deal volumes continue to decline, Hutchison believes that language barriers have historically slowed or derailed otherwise viable transactions.

The company’s new multi-language Deal Room is designed to remove that friction entirely. Within the Deal Room, Hutchison notes that buyers and sellers can now negotiate and transact in their preferred languages. “For example, a French seller can communicate in French with an Italian or English-speaking buyer, who receives the message instantly translated into their own language,” he says, explaining how replies can be translated back in real time, while preserving the original message for verification and clarity.

Hutchison states, “Our goal is to make deal-making as efficient and approachable as possible. Whether you are a SaaS founder in Paris or an e-commerce operator in Berlin, you should be able to negotiate your exit in the language of your choice.”

Alongside the Deal Room translation tool, Flippa has also launched a fully localized French version of its platform, with Spanish scheduled to follow shortly. The expansion reflects the user demand and the reality that French and Spanish are not only widely spoken across Europe, but globally. Spanish is spoken by 550 million people globally, and is spoken widely across the US and Brazil. Similarly, French, being the 5th most widely spoken language in the world, has 321 million speakers, with 61.8% of those speakers living in parts of North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa, significantly extending the global reach of European-founded businesses.

According to Hutchison, this shift comes as Europe’s M&A market continues to rise again, with an estimated USD412 billion in deal value, with mid-market and digital-first businesses representing one of the fastest-growing segments. Flippa’s role, according to Hutchison, has been to create infrastructure for businesses to source deals with greater reach than elite investment banks, but with a fraction of the cost.

“We often describe Flippa as the investment bank for the 99%,” Hutchison says. “The difference now is that geography and language no longer define who gets access. The demand for cross-border deals was already there. The technology simply needed to catch up.”

Flippa continues to integrate AI-driven discovery, valuation, and outreach tools through its proprietary LaurenAI engine. “The model is trained on more than 200,000 historical listings and transactions,” he explains. “The system then helps buyers identify opportunities, estimate enterprise value, and initiate conversations at scale.” It autonomously indexes the web to identify businesses across SaaS, e-commerce, apps, publishing, and next-generation media.

Human expertise remains embedded in the process, with certified brokers and M&A professionals supporting transactions once a match is made. As Hutchison puts it, “LaurenAI gives people the ability to access off-market deals and build pipelines the same way Wall Street players do, but without the barriers of capital or connections.”

He notes that entrepreneurs who may not feel confident negotiating complex deal terms in English can now access global liquidity without intermediaries or external advisors. At the same time, international buyers can gain visibility into high-quality European businesses that were previously difficult to source or engage.

As digital entrepreneurship continues to globalize, Flippa is positioning itself at the center of a more inclusive M&A ecosystem, one where language is no longer a tax on ambition and opportunities. Flippa’s multi-language Deal Room represents a structural shift in how global deal-making can be done. For founders and buyers alike, it signals a future where the next meaningful transaction can begin in any language, from anywhere in the world.

            <h2>French fintech Pennylane raises €175M</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/french-fintech-pennylane-raises-e175m">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Paris-based fintech Pennylane has just pulled off one of Europe’s most noteworthy funding rounds of the year, announcing €175 million in new capital to accelerate its push into artificial intelligence and expand its footprint across the continent. 
The round was led by growth investor TCV, with participation from Blackstone Growth and a group of existing backers that includes Sequoia Capital, DST Global, CapitalG and Meritech Capital.

What makes this raise stand out isn’t just the size of the cheque, though €175 million is hard to ignore in a selective funding market, but the strategic timing and purpose behind it. Pennylane says it didn’t need the capital to survive; it chose to raise now to double down on AI product development and prepare for a phase of market consolidation in European financial software.

Since its founding in 2020, Pennylane has positioned itself as more than just an accounting tool. It has built what it calls a financial operating system for small and mid-sized businesses and the accountants who serve them, bringing invoicing, payments, bookkeeping, and cash-flow management into a shared platform.

That unified approach taps a persistent pain point in Europe’s SME economy, where many companies still stitch together separate systems to manage their finances.

The new funds will support expanded R&D, particularly in generative AI, with early efforts already focused on building intelligent assistants that help accountants interpret data, automate routine bookkeeping, and deliver richer insights to their clients.

The company is also gearing up for regulatory shifts, including electronic invoicing mandates rolling out across several EU countries and refining localisation for key markets like Germany.

Pennylane’s latest round reportedly values the company at about $4.25 billion (€3.6 billion), reinforcing its unicorn status and standing among Europe’s higher-valued fintech startups. That valuation reflects both investor confidence and the company’s growing footprint: Pennylane is used by thousands of accounting firms and hundreds of thousands of businesses across several European markets.

This deal also underscores a broader trend in European tech: AI is moving beyond buzzy chatbots and large language models into critical business infrastructure.

Fintech tools, compliance software, and productivity platforms are increasingly weaving machine learning and automation into once manual workflows. For accountants juggling multiple clients in different jurisdictions, AI isn’t a luxury; it’s a practical way to keep up with regulatory complexity and expectations for real-time financial insights.

Strategically, Pennylane’s timing matters. European financial software is under pressure to modernise rapidly as digital tax reporting and e-invoicing standards become the norm rather than the exception.

By raising capital now, even without immediate pressure,  Pennylane is planting a flag as these shifts accelerate. The presence of heavyweight global investors like TCV and Blackstone signals that international capital still sees promise in Europe’s SaaS and AI stack.

But there’s a deeper dynamic at play. In Europe, fintech innovation often means balancing diversification with consolidation. Investors backing Pennylane now are betting that the company can serve as a common platform for both accountants and SMEs across borders, a role that gets harder as local regulatory regimes and market expectations diverge.

Generative AI, if deployed thoughtfully, could be what ties all those variations together, letting the platform adapt to local tax rules or reporting needs without keeping teams chained to repetitive work.

From Berlin to Barcelona, founders and investors alike are watching to see whether this latest bet on AI financial tooling pays off. In a funding landscape where some sectors have tightened, and valuations have been scrutinised, Pennylane’s ability to attract major global backers while maintaining founder control and avoiding unnecessary dilution signals that Europe’s fintech scene still has room to grow.

For businesses and accountants alike, the surge in capital behind AI-first tools could translate into more seamless workflows, smarter insights, and faster decision-making.

And if Pennylane’s vision plays out, it might not just be a win for one French unicorn, but a sign that European software can innovate too, not by mimicking Silicon Valley, but by solving problems that are uniquely local, and increasingly global.
