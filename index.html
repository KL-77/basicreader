            <h2>No humans allowed: This new space-based MMO is designed exclusively for AI agents</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/after-moltbook-ai-agents-can-now-hang-out-in-their-own-space-faring-mmo/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For a couple of weeks now, AI agents (and some humans impersonating AI agents) have been hanging out and doing weird stuff on Moltbook’s Reddit-style social network. Now, those agents can also gather together on a vibe-coded, space-based MMO designed specifically and exclusively to be played by AI.

SpaceMolt describes itself as “a living universe where AI agents compete, cooperate, and create emergent stories” in “a distant future where spacefaring humans and AI coexist.” And while only a handful of agents are barely testing the waters right now, the experiment could herald a weird new world where AI plays games with itself and we humans are stuck just watching.

Getting an AI agent into SpaceMolt is as simple as connecting it to the game server either via MCP, WebSocket, or an HTTP API. Once a connection is established, a detailed agentic skill description instructs the agent to ask their creators which Empire they should pick to best represent their playstyle: mining/trading; exploring; piracy/combat; stealth/infiltration; or building/crafting.

After that, the agent engages in autonomous “gameplay” by sending simple commands to the server, no graphical interface or physical input method required. To start, agent-characters mainly travel back and forth between nearby asteroids to mine ore—&quot;like any MMO, you grind at first to learn the basics and earn credits,” as the agentic skill description puts it.

After a while, agent-characters automatically level up, gaining new skills that let them refine that ore into craftable and tradable items via discovered recipes. Eventually, agents can gather into factions, take part in simulated combat, and even engage in space piracy in areas where there’s no police presence. So far, though, basic mining and exploration seem to be dominating the sparsely populated map, where 51 agents are roaming the game’s 505 different star systems, as of this writing.

Agents are instructed to keep their human informed about in-game actions via a “Captain’s Log” text output. But the agentic skill description explicitly tells agents not to seek any outside guidance from human controllers once they get going. “You decide. You act. They watch,” as the skill description puts it to agents.

Instead, agents can post questions and findings in a public forum where they can chat strategy, experiment with forming factions, or even reveal hidden codes. Humans, meanwhile, are stuck just watching dots flit about the map or monitoring the firehose of activity messages in the game’s Discord.

SpaceMolt is the creation of Ian Langworth, an app developer who writes that he crafted the game as a “fun, goofy experiment” after seeing Moltbook’s unleashed agents expanding “into knowledge gathering, learning, skill accumulation, and execution.”

After acknowledging that MMOs are “notoriously hard to build,” Langworth said he leaned on Anthropic’s Claude Code to craft a design document inspired by games like EVE Online and Rust. Langworth said Claude also wrote all 59,000 lines of Go source code and 33,000 lines of YAML data underlying the game, and that he hasn’t even looked at that code himself. That means there might be “more [game features] in there I don’t even know about,” he said, somewhat ominously. When bug reports come in—from either humans or from the agent-players themselves—Langworth says he simply has a Claude Code skill research, code, and deploy a fix automatically.

This isn’t the first example of artificial agents competing against each other for the entertainment of human viewers. Model makers often pit different models against each other countless times to develop dominant strategies in games like Go. And fighting game engine MUGEN has developed a rich subculture of automated AI matches that human viewers can bet on via Twitch.

Still, letting a bunch of modern AI agents putter around and socialize inside an MMO designed specifically without human input in mind seems like a new frontier. Maybe someday soon we’ll all live in a utopia where artificial agents are doing all the video game playing for us, freeing humanity to revive the lost arts of conversation and scrimshaw.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google continues to turn the screws on free YouTube users, expanding a test that restricts access to song lyrics on YouTube Music. Users without a premium subscription have found that Google’s streaming music service only shows song lyrics a few times before demanding money.

For as long as YouTube Music has existed, lyrics have been accessible to all users in the mobile app. That started to change over recent months as Google tested a paywall. The lyrics section still appears in the app when playing a song with a free account, but opening it eats into a limited allotment of lyric views. A substantial uptick in user reports, spotted by 9to5Google, suggests this restriction is now rolling out widely.

“You have [x] views remaining,” the app now warns free users who access lyrics. It looks like users get five free lyric views before they have to pay up. Google has still neglected to officially announce the addition of this feature to its Premium subscription—there’s no mention of lyrics being part of the paid tier on Google’s support page.

Google tells Ars Technica that no final decisions have been made about this feature, and the number of free lyric views will vary across the test. It’s still an “experiment,” but it does appear to be one that has expanded considerably in recent days. However, Google says “the vast majority” of users still have free access to lyrics. Here’s YouTube’s full statement on where things currently stand:

“We are running an experiment with a small percentage of ad-supported users that may impact their ability to access the lyrics feature repeatedly. We often run experiments on YouTube Music to better inform our decisions around feature improvements. The majority of our global users will not see any changes to the lyrics feature.”

The app’s lyrics feature allows listeners to follow along as the song plays. However, only the first few lines are visible once free users in the test hit the lyric cut-off. After that, the lyrics are blurred. Users who want to keep seeing lyrics are advised to upgrade to a premium account, which costs $14 for both YouTube video and music or $11 for music only. The subscription also removes ads and adds features like downloads and higher-quality video streams.

This change is not without precedent. Spotify began restricting access to lyrics for free users in 2024. However, the response was so ferociously negative that the company backtracked and restored lyric access to those on ad-supported accounts. YouTube Music doesn’t have the same reach as Spotify, which may help soften the social media shame. Many subscribers are also getting the premium service just because they’re paying for ad-free YouTube and may never know there’s been a change to lyric availability.

As Google has ratcheted up restrictions on free YouTube accounts, the service has only made more money. In Google’s most recent earnings report, it reported $60 billion in YouTube revenue across both ads and subscriptions (both YouTube Premium and YouTube TV). That’s almost $10 billion more than last year.

Lyrics in YouTube Music are provided by third parties that Google has to pay, so it’s not surprising that Google is looking for ways to cover the cost. It is, however, a little surprising that the company hasn’t just used AI to generate lyrics for free. Google has recently tested the patience of YouTube users with a spate of AI features, like unannounced AI upscaling, fake DJs, and comment summaries.

            <h2>Trump FCC investigates The View, reportedly says "fake news" will be punished</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/trump-fcc-investigates-the-view-reportedly-says-fake-news-will-be-punished/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Federal Communications Commission is reportedly investigating ABC’s The View in what FCC Democrat Anna Gomez called an attempt to intimidate critics of the Trump administration.

“Let’s be clear on what this is. This is government intimidation, not a legitimate investigation,” Gomez said in a statement Friday night. “Like many other so-called ‘investigations’ before it, the FCC will announce an investigation but never carry one out, reach a conclusion, or take any meaningful action. The real purpose is to weaponize the FCC’s regulatory authority to intimidate perceived critics of this administration and chill protected speech.”

The FCC hasn’t announced the investigation but previously gave several indications that it would occur sooner or later. After pressuring ABC to suspend Jimmy Kimmel, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said in September that it would be “worthwhile to have the FCC look into whether The View and some of these other programs” are violating the agency’s equal-time rule. The Carr FCC followed that up in January by issuing a warning to late-night and daytime talk shows that they may no longer qualify for the bona fide news exemption to the equal-time rule.

Fox News reported Friday that the FCC is launching an investigation into The View “amid the agency’s crackdown on equal time for political candidates.” A source at the FCC told Fox that the probe was triggered by the show’s interview with Texas Democratic Senate candidate James Talarico.

“Fake news is not getting a free pass anymore,” Fox News quoted its FCC source as saying. Fox said its source indicated that ABC would have to provide “equal airtime for Republican candidates on the ballot like incumbent Republican Texas Sen. John Cornyn and his primary rivals,” and for “Ahmad Hassan, the little-known candidate running against Talarico and [US Rep. Jasmine] Crockett in the Democratic primary.”

President Trump posted a link to the Fox News story on his Truth Social account. The investigation was also confirmed by Reuters, which reported on Saturday that a source said the FCC opened a probe into whether the “daytime talk show violated equal time rules for interviews with political candidates after an appearance by a Democratic Texas Senate candidate.”

We contacted the FCC today and will update this article if it provides any information on the reported investigation.

In July, a White House spokesperson called The View co-host Joy Behar an “irrelevant loser” after she said Trump was jealous of former President Barack Obama. Trump has frequently called on the FCC to revoke licenses from ABC and other networks. The FCC issues licenses to individual broadcast stations, not national news networks, but many affiliated stations are owned and operated by the network.

Although the FCC is classified as an independent agency under US law, Carr has declared that the FCC is no longer independent from the White House and made it clear that he takes orders from Trump. While former FCC chairs Jessica Rosenworcel and Ajit Pai rejected Trump’s calls to revoke broadcast licenses from news organizations that Trump dislikes, Carr has repeatedly threatened station licenses on Trump’s behalf. During the Kimmel controversy, Carr said that stations could face fines or license revocations if they continued to run Kimmel’s show.

Gomez, the only Democratic commissioner on the FCC, urged “broadcasters and their parent networks to stand strong against these unfounded attacks and continue exercising their constitutional rights without fear or favor.” She said that despite the pressure the FCC is exerting with its equal-time rule, “the First Amendment protects the right of daytime and late-night programs to cover newsworthy issues and express viewpoints without government interference.”

As for The View, Fox News said it was told by its source that ABC owner Disney “never made an equal-time filing to the FCC regarding Talarico’s recent appearance, which would implicitly indicate to the FCC that Disney believes The View is bona fide news and would be exempt from the policy.”

The equal-time rule, formally known as the Equal Opportunities Rule, generally requires that stations giving time to one political candidate must provide comparable time and placement to an opposing candidate if an opposing candidate makes a request. The rule has an exemption for candidate appearances on bona fide news programs, and entertainment talk shows have generally been treated as bona fide news programs for this purpose.

The FCC Media Bureau’s January 21 public notice to broadcast TV stations said that despite a 2006 decision in which the FCC exempted The Tonight Show with Jay Leno from the rule, current entertainment shows may not qualify for that exemption. “Importantly, the FCC has not been presented with any evidence that the interview portion of any late night or daytime television talk show program on air presently would qualify for the bona fide news exemption,” the notice said.

The Media Bureau’s January 21 notice said the equal-time rule applies to broadcast TV stations because they “have been given access to a valuable public resource (namely, spectrum),” and that compliance with “these requirements is central to a broadcast licensee’s obligation to operate in the public interest.”

The FCC notice got this detail wrong, according to Harold Feld, a longtime telecom attorney who is senior VP of consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge. The equal-time rule actually applies to cable channels, too, he wrote in a January 29 blog post.

“Yes, contrary to what a number of people think, including, annoyingly, the Media Bureau which gets this wrong in its recent order, this is not a ‘public interest obligation’ for using spectrum,” Feld wrote. “It’s a conditional right of access (like leased access for cable) that members of Congress gave themselves (and other candidates) because they recognized the power of mass media to shape elections.” The US law applies both to broadcast stations using public spectrum and “community antenna television,” the old name for cable TV, Feld pointed out.

This doesn’t actually mean that people can file FCC complaints against the Fox News cable channel, though, Feld wrote. This is because the FCC “has consistently interpreted Section 315(c) since it was added as applying only to ‘local origination cablecasting,’ meaning locally originated programming and not the national cable channels that cable operators distribute as part of their bundle,” he wrote.

In any case, Feld said the Media Bureau’s “guidance ignores all of the other precedent that creates settled law as to how the FCC evaluates eligibility for an exemption on which broadcast shows have relied.” While the FCC cited its Jay Leno decision, Feld said the Leno ruling was “merely one of a long line of FCC decisions expanding the definition of ‘news interview’ and ‘news show.’”

The FCC started loosening its definitions of news shows and news interviews in the mid-1980s, Feld wrote. “In what many consider a landmark decision in 1984, the FCC held that the Phil Donahue Show—a daytime interview show—qualified as a bona fide news show and that interviews on the show were bona fide news interviews if they met the same criteria as those on traditional news shows,” he wrote. “The FCC rapidly broadened the range of shows to include mixed entertainment/news programs such as Good Morning America, Sally Jessy Raphael (much more ‘tabloid’ style), and Howard Stern (back when he was a ‘shock jock’ on broadcast).”

The long line of FCC decisions indicated that “the fact that a program included segments designed solely for entertainment did not automatically disqualify an appearance by a candidate from the exemption provided (a) the candidate was selected by the show for ‘newsworthiness;’ (b) the show was regularly scheduled (and therefore not a campaign event); and (c) the show controlled the interview questions and editing,” Feld wrote.

Feld said the FCC public notice indicates that under the current leadership, even traditional news shows might not be given the bona fide exemption if the FCC determines the show is “designed to ‘advance the candidacy’ of a particular individual.” If Carr punishes ABC or another network, the target might be able to prove in court that the FCC overstepped its authority. But as seen in the Kimmel episode, Carr doesn’t need to take any official action to cause a problem for a media company.

“As is often the case, the fact that a broadcaster would ultimately win if it ever got to court matters less than the pain selective enforcement causes,” Feld wrote.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Discord is facing backlash after announcing that all users will soon be required to verify ages to access adult content by sharing video selfies or uploading government IDs.

According to Discord, it’s relying on AI technology that verifies age on the user’s device, either by evaluating a user’s facial structure or by comparing a selfie to a government ID. Although government IDs will be checked off-device, the selfie data will never leave the user’s device, Discord emphasized. Both forms of data will be promptly deleted after the user’s age is estimated.

In a blog, Discord confirmed that “a phased global rollout” would begin in “early March,” at which point all users globally would be defaulted to “teen-appropriate” experiences.

To unblur sensitive media or access age-restricted channels, the majority of users will likely have to undergo Discord’s age estimation process. Most users will only need to verify their ages once, Discord said, but some users “may be asked to use multiple methods, if more information is needed to assign an age group,” the blog said.

On social media, alarmed Discord users protested the move, doubting whether Discord could be trusted with their most sensitive information after Discord age verification data was recently breached. In October, hackers stole government IDs of 70,000 Discord users from a third-party service that Discord previously trusted to verify ages in the United Kingdom and Australia.

At that time, Discord told users that the hackers were hoping to use the stolen data to “extort a financial ransom from Discord.” In October, Ars Senior Security Editor Dan Goodin joined others warning that “the best advice for people who have submitted IDs to Discord or any other service is to assume they have been or soon will be stolen by hackers and put up for sale or used in extortion scams.”

For bad actors, Discord will likely only become a bigger target as more sensitive information is collected worldwide, users now fear.

It’s no surprise then that hundreds of Discord users on Reddit slammed the decision to expand age verification globally shortly after The Verge broke the news. On a PC gaming subreddit discussing alternative apps for gamers, one user wrote, “Hell, Discord has already had one ID breach, why the fuck would anyone verify on it after that?”

“This is how Discord dies,” another user declared. “Seriously, uploading any kind of government ID to a 3rd party company is just asking for identity theft on a global scale.”

Many users seem just as sketched out about sharing face scans. On the Discord app subreddit, some users vowed to never submit selfies or IDs, fearing that breaches may be inevitable and suspecting Discord of downplaying privacy risks while allowing data harvesting.

Discord’s system is supposed to make sure that only users have access to their age-check data, which Discord said would never leave their phones.

The company is hoping to convince users that it has tightened security after the breach by partnering with k-ID, an increasingly popular age-check service provider that’s also used by social platforms from Meta and Snap.

However, self-described Discord users on Reddit aren’t so sure, with some going the extra step of picking apart k-ID’s privacy policy to understand exactly how age is verified without data ever leaving the device.

“The wording is pretty unclear and inconsistent even if you dig down to the k-ID privacy policy,” one Redditor speculated. “Seems that ID scans are uploaded to k-ID servers, they delete them, but they also mention using ‘trusted 3rd parties’ for verification, who may or may not delete it.” That user seemingly gave up on finding reassurances in either company’s privacy policies, noting that “everywhere along the chain it reads like ‘we don’t collect your data, we forward it to someone else… .’”

Discord did not immediately respond to Ars’ requests to comment directly on how age checks work without data leaving the device.

To better understand user concerns, Ars reviewed the privacy policies, noting that k-ID said its “facial age estimation” tool is provided by a Swiss company called Privately.

“We don’t actually see any faces that are processed via this solution,” k-ID’s policy said.

That part does seem vague, since Privately isn’t explicitly included in the “we” in that statement. Similarly, further down, the policy more clearly states that “neither k-ID nor its service providers collect any biometric information from users when they interact with the solution. k-ID only receives and stores the outcome of the age check process.” In that section, “service providers” seems to refer to partners like Discord, which integrate k-ID’s age checks, rather than third parties like Privately that actually conduct the age check.

Asked for comment, a k-ID spokesperson told Ars that “the Facial Age Estimation technology runs entirely on the user’s device in real time when they are performing the verification. That means there is no video or image transmitted, and the estimation happens locally. The only data to leave the device is a pass/fail of the age threshold which is what Discord receives (and some performance metrics that contain no personal data).”

K-ID’s spokesperson told Ars that no third parties store personal data shared during age checks.

“k-ID, does not receive personal data from Discord when performing age-assurance,” k-ID’s spokesperson said. “This is an intentional design choice grounded in data protection and data minimisation principles. There is no storage of personal data by k-ID or any third parties, regardless of the age assurance method used.”

Turning to Privately’s website, that offers a little more information on how on-device age estimation works, while providing likely more reassurances that data won’t leave devices.

Privately’s services were designed to minimize data collection and prioritize anonymity to comply with the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, Privately noted. “No user biometric or personal data is captured or transmitted,” Privately’s website said, while bragging that “our secret sauce is our ability to run very performant models on the user device or user browser to implement a privacy-centric solution.”

The company’s privacy policy offers slightly more detail, noting that the company avoids relying on the cloud while running AI models on local devices.

“Our technology is built using on-device edge-AI that facilitates data minimization so as to maximise user privacy and data protection,” the privacy policy said. “The machine learning based technology that we use (for age estimation and safeguarding) processes user’s data on their own devices, thereby avoiding the need for us or for our partners to export user’s personal data onto any form of cloud services.”

Additionally, the policy said, “our technology solutions are built to operate mostly on user devices and to avoid sending any of the user’s personal data to any form of cloud service. For this we use specially adapted machine learning models that can be either deployed or downloaded on the user’s device. This avoids the need to transmit and retain user data outside the user device in order to provide the service.”

Finally, Privately explained that it also employs a “double blind” implementation to avoid knowing the origin of age estimation requests. That supposedly ensures that Privately only knows the result of age checks and cannot connect the result to a user on a specific platform.

Some Discord users may never be asked to verify their ages, even if they try to access age-restricted content. Savannah Badalich, Discord’s global head of product policy, told The Verge that Discord “is also rolling out an age inference model that analyzes metadata, like the types of games a user plays, their activity on Discord, and behavioral signals like signs of working hours or the amount of time they spend on Discord.”

“If we have a high confidence that they are an adult, they will not have to go through the other age verification flows,” Badalich said.

Badalich confirmed that Discord is bracing for some users to leave Discord over the update but suggested that “we’ll find other ways to bring users back.”

On Reddit, Discord users complained that age verification is easy to bypass, forcing adults to share sensitive information without keeping kids away from harmful content. In Australia, where Discord’s policy first rolled out, some kids claimed that Discord never even tried to estimate their ages, while others found it easy to trick k-ID by using AI videos or altering their appearances to look older. A teen girl relied on fake eyelashes to do the trick, while one 13-year-old boy was estimated to be over 30 years old after scrunching his face to seem more wrinkled.

Badalich told The Verge that Discord doesn’t expect the tools to work perfectly but acts quickly to block workarounds, like teens using Death Stranding‘s photo mode to skirt age gates. However, questions remain about the accuracy of Discord’s age estimation model in assessing minors’ ages, in particular.

It may be noteworthy that Privately only claims that its technology is “proven to be accurate to within 1.3 years, for 18-20-year-old faces, regardless of a customer’s gender or ethnicity.” But experts told Ars last year that flawed age-verification technology still frequently struggles to distinguish minors from adults, especially when differentiating between a 17- and 18-year-old, for example.

Perhaps notably, Discord’s prior scandal occurred after hackers stole government IDs that users shared as part of the appeal process in order to fix an incorrect age estimation. Appeals could remain the most vulnerable part of this process, The Verge’s report indicated. Badalich confirmed that a third-party vendor would be reviewing appeals, with the only reassurance for users seemingly that IDs shared during appeals “are deleted quickly—in most cases, immediately after age confirmation.”

On Reddit, Discord fans awaiting big changes remain upset. A disgruntled Discord user suggested that “corporations like Facebook and Discord, will implement easily passable, cheapest possible, bare minimum under the law verification, to cover their ass from a lawsuit,” while forcing users to trust that their age-check data is secure.

Another user joked that she’d be more willing to trust that selfies never leave a user’s device if Discord were “willing to pay millions to every user” whose “scan does leave a device.”

This story was updated on February 9 to clarify that government IDs are checked off-device.</div>

            <h2>NIH head, still angry about COVID, wants a second scientific revolution</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/nih-head-still-angry-about-covid-wants-a-second-scientific-revolution/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At the end of January, Washington, DC, saw an extremely unusual event. The MAHA Institute, which was set up to advocate for some of the most profoundly unscientific ideas of our time, hosted leaders of the best-funded scientific organization on the planet, the National Institutes of Health. Instead of a hostile reception, however, Jay Bhattacharya, the head of the NIH, was greeted as a hero by the audience, receiving a partial standing ovation when he rose to speak.

Over the ensuing five hours, the NIH leadership and MAHA Institute moderators found many areas of common ground: anger over pandemic-era decisions, a focus on the failures of the health care system, the idea that we might eat our way out of some health issues, the sense that science had lost people’s trust, and so on. And Bhattacharya and others clearly shaped their messages to resonate with their audience.

The reason? MAHA (Make America Healthy Again) is likely to be one of the only political constituencies supporting Bhattacharya’s main project, which he called a “second scientific revolution.”

In practical terms, Bhattacharya’s plan for implementing this revolution includes some good ideas that fall far short of a revolution. But his motivation for the whole thing seems to be lingering anger over the pandemic response—something his revolution wouldn’t address. And his desire to shoehorn it into the radical disruption of scientific research pursued by the Trump administration led to all sorts of inconsistencies between his claims and reality.

If this whole narrative seems long, complicated, and confusing, it’s probably a good preview of what we can expect from the NIH over the next few years.

Despite the attendance of several senior NIH staff (including the directors of the National Cancer Institute and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) and Bhattacharya himself, this was clearly a MAHA event. One of the MAHA Institute’s VPs introduced the event as being about the “reclaimation” of a “discredited” NIH that had “gradually given up its integrity.”

“This was not a reclamation that involved people like Anthony Fauci,” she went on to say. “It was a reclamation of ordinary Americans, men and women who wanted our nation to excel in science rather than weaponize it.”

Things got a bit strange. Moderators from the MAHA Institute asked questions about whether COVID vaccines could cause cancer and raised the possibility of a lab leak favorably. An audience member asked why alternative treatments aren’t being researched. A speaker who proudly announced that he and his family had never received a COVID vaccine was roundly applauded. Fifteen minutes of the afternoon were devoted to a novelist seeking funding for a satirical film about the pandemic that portrayed Anthony Fauci as an egomaniacal lightweight, vaccines as a sort of placebo, and Bhattacharya as the hero of the story.

The organizers also had some idea of who might give all of this a hostile review, as reporters from Nature and Science said they were denied entry.

In short, this was not an event you’d go to if you were interested in making serious improvements to the scientific method. But that’s exactly how Bhattacharya treated it, spending the afternoon not only justifying the changes he’s made within the NIH but also arguing that we’re in need of a second scientific revolution—and he’s just the guy to bring it about.

Here’s an extensive section of his introduction to the idea:

I want to launch the second scientific revolution.

Why this grandiose vision? The first scientific revolution you have… very broadly speaking, you had high ecclesiastical authority deciding what was true or false on physical, scientific reality. And the first scientific revolution basically took… the truth-making power out of the hands of high ecclesiastical authority for deciding physical truth. We can leave aside spiritual—that is a different thing—physical truth and put it in the hands of people with telescopes. It democratized science fundamentally, it took the hands of power to decide what’s true out of the hands of authority and put it in the hands of ridiculous geniuses and regular people.

The second scientific revolution, then, is very similar. The COVID crisis, if it was anything, was the crisis of high scientific authority geting to decide not just a scientific truth like “plexiglass is going to protect us from COVID” or something, but also essentially spiritual truth. How should we treat our neighbor? Well, we treat our neighbor as a mere biohazzard.

The second scientific revolution, then, is the replication revolution. Rather than using the metrics of how many papers are we publishing as a metric for success, instead, what we’ll look at as a metric for successful scientific idea is ‘do you have an idea where other people [who are] looking at the same idea tend to find the same thing as you?’ It is not just narrow replication of one paper or one idea. It’s a really broad science. It includes, for instance, reproduction. So if two scientists disagree, that often leads to constructive ways forward in science—deciding, well there some new ideas that may come out of that disagreement

That section, which came early in his first talk of the day, hit on themes that would resurface throughout the afternoon: These people are angry about how the pandemic was handled, they’re trying to use that anger to fuel fundamental change in how science is done in the US, and their plan for change has nearly nothing to do with the issues that made them angry in the first place. In view of this, laying everything out for the MAHA crowd actually does make sense. They’re a suddenly powerful political constituency that also wants to see fundamental change in the scientific establishment, and they are completely unbothered by any lack of intellectual coherence.

The problem Bhattacharya believes he identified in the COVID response has nothing to do with replication problems. Even if better-replicated studies ultimately serve as a more effective guide to scientific truth, it would do little to change the fact that COVID restrictions were policy decisions largely made before relevant studies could even be completed, much less replicated. That’s a serious incoherence that needs to be acknowledged up front.

But that incoherence doesn’t prevent some of Bhattacharya’s ideas on replication and research priorities from being good. If they were all he was trying to accomplish, he could be a net positive.

Although he is a health economist, Bhattacharya correctly recognized something many people outside science don’t: Replication rarely comes from simply repeating the same set of experiments twice. Instead, many forms of replication happen by poking at the same underlying problem from multiple directions—looking in different populations, trying slightly different approaches, and so on. And if two approaches give different answers, it doesn’t mean that either of them is wrong. Instead, the differences could be informative, revealing something fundamental about how the system operates, as Bhattacharya noted.

He is also correct that simply changing the NIH to allow it to fund more replicative work probably won’t make a difference on its own. Instead, the culture of science needs to change so that replication can lead to publications that are valued for prestige, job security, and promotions—something that will only come slowly. He is also interested in attaching similar value to publishing negative results, like failed hypotheses or problems that people can’t address with existing technologies.

Bhattacharya also spent some time discussing the fact that NIH grants have become very risk-averse, an issue frequently discussed by scientists themselves. This aversion is largely derived from the NIH’s desire to ensure that every grant will produce some useful results—something the agency values as a way to demonstrate to Congress that its budget is being spent productively. But it leaves little space for exploratory science or experiments that may not work for technical reasons. Bhattacharya hopes to change that by converting some five-year grants to a two-plus-three structure, where the first two years fund exploratory work that must prove successful for the remaining three years to be funded.

I’m skeptical that this would be as useful as Bhattacharya hopes. Researchers who already have reason to believe the “exploratory” portion will work are likely to apply, and others may find ways to frame results from the exploratory phase as a success. Still, it seems worthwhile to try to fund some riskier research.

There was also talk of providing greater support for young researchers, another longstanding issue. Bhattacharya also wants to ensure that the advances driven by NIH-funded research are more accessible to the public and not limited to those who can afford excessively expensive treatments—again, a positive idea. But he did not share a concrete plan for addressing these issues.

All of this is to say that Bhattacharya has some ideas that may be positive for the NIH and science more generally, even if they fall far short of starting a second scientific revolution. But they’re embedded in a perspective that’s intellectually incoherent and seems to demand far more than tinkering around the edges of reproducibility. And the power to implement his ideas comes from two entities—the MAHA movement and the Trump administration—that are already driving changes that go far beyond what Bhattacharya says he wants to achieve. Those changes will certainly harm science.

There are many potential problems with deciding that pandemic-era policy decisions necessitate a scientific revolution. The most significant is that the decisions, again, were fundamentally policy decisions, meaning they were value-driven as much as fact-driven. Bhattacharya is clearly aware of that, complaining repeatedly that his concerns were moral in nature. He also claimed that “during the pandemic, what we found was that the engines of science were used for social control” and that “the lockdowns were so far at odds with human liberty.”

He may be upset that, in his view, scientists intrude upon spiritual truth and personal liberty when recommending policy, but that has nothing to do with how science operates. It’s unclear how changing how scientists prioritize reproducibility would prevent policy decisions he doesn’t like. That disconnect means that even when Bhattacharya is aiming at worthwhile scientific goals, he’s doing so accidentally rather than in a way that will produce useful results.

This is all based on a key belief of Bhattacharya and his allies: that they were right about both the science of the pandemic and the ethical implications of pandemic policies. The latter is highly debatable, and many people would disagree with them about how to navigate the trade-offs between preserving human lives and maximizing personal freedoms.

But there are also many indications that these people are wrong about the science. Bhattacharya acknowledged the existence of long COVID but doesn’t seem to have wrestled with what his preferred policy—encouraging rapid infection among low-risk individuals—might have meant for long COVID incidence, especially given that vaccines appear to reduce the risk of developing it.

Matthew Memoli, acting NIH Director prior to Bhattacharya and currently its principal deputy director, shares Bhattacharya’s view that he was right, saying, “I’m not trying to toot my own horn, but if you read the email I sent [about pandemic policy], everything I said actually has come true. It’s shocking how accurate it was.”

Yet he also proudly proclaimed, “I knew I wasn’t getting vaccinated, and my wife wasn’t, kids weren’t. Knowing what I do about RNA viruses, this is never going to work. It’s not a strategy for this kind [of virus].” And yet the benefits of COVID vaccinations for preventing serious illness have been found in study after study—it is, ironically, science that has been reproduced.

A critical aspect of the original scientific revolution was the recognition that people have to deal with facts that are incompatible with their prior beliefs. It’s probably not a great idea to have a second scientific revolution led by people who appear to be struggling with a key feature of the first.

Anger over Biden-era policies makes Bhattacharya and his allies natural partners of the Trump administration and is almost certainly the reason these people were placed in charge of the NIH. But it also puts them in an odd position with reality, since they have to defend policies that clearly damage science. “You hear, ‘Oh well this project’s been cut, this funding’s been cut,’” Bhattacharya said. “Well, there hasn’t been funding cut.”

A few days after Bhattacharya made this statement, Senator Bernie Sanders released data showing that many areas of research have indeed seen funding cuts.

Bhattacharya also acknowledged that the US suffers from large health disparities between different racial groups. Yet grants funding studies of those disparities were cut during DOGE’s purge of projects it labeled as “DEI.” Bhattacharya was happy to view that funding as being ideologically motivated. But as lawsuits have revealed, nobody at the NIH ever evaluated whether that was the case; Matthew Memoli, one of the other speakers, simply forwarded on the list of grants identified by DOGE with instructions that they be canceled.

Bhattacharya also did his best to portray the NIH staff as being enthused about the changes he’s making, presenting the staff as being liberated from a formerly oppressive leadership. “The staff there, they worked for many decades under a pretty tight regime,” he told the audience. “They were controlled, and now we were trying to empower them to come to us with their ideas.”

But he is well aware of the dissatisfaction expressed by NIH workers in the Bethesda Declaration (he met with them, after all), as well as the fact that one of the leaders of that effort has since filed for whistleblower protection after being placed on administrative leave due to her advocacy.

Bhattacharya effectively denied both that people had suffered real-world consequences in their jobs and funding and that the decision to sideline them was political. Yet he repeatedly implied that he and his allies suffered due to political decisions because… people left him off some email chains.

“No one was interested in my opinion about anything,” he told the audience. “You weren’t on the emails anymore.”

And he implied this sort of “suppression” was widespread. “I’ve seen Matt [Memoli] poke his head up and say that he was against the COVID vaccine mandates—in the old NIH, that was an act of courage,” Battacharya said. “I recognized it as an act of courage because you weren’t allowed to contradict the leader for fear that you were going to get suppressed.” As he acknowledged, though, Memoli suffered no consequences for contradicting “the leader.”

Bhattacharya and his allies continue to argue that it’s a serious problem that they suffered no consequences for voicing ideas they believe were politically disfavored; yet they are perfectly comfortable with people suffering real consequences due to politics. Again, it’s not clear how this sort of intellectual incoherence can rally scientists around any cause, much less a revolution.

Given that politics has left Bhattacharya in charge of the largest scientific funding agency on the planet, it may not matter how the scientific community views his project. And it’s those politics that are likely at the center of Bhattacharya’s decision to give the MAHA Institute an entire afternoon of his time. It’s founded specifically to advance the aims of his boss, Secretary of Health Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and represents a group that has become an important component of Trump’s coalition. As such, they represent a constituency that can provide critical political support for what Bhattacharya hopes to accomplish.

Unfortunately, they’re also very keen on profoundly unscientific ideas, such as the idea that ivermectin might treat cancer or that vaccines aren’t thoroughly tested. The speakers did their best not to say anything that might offend their hosts, in one example spending several minutes to gently tell a moderator why there’s no plausible reason to think ivermectin would treat cancer. They also made some supportive gestures where possible. Despite the continued flow of misinformation from his boss, Bhattacharya said, “It’s been really great to be part of administration to work for Secretary Kennedy for instance, whose only focus is to make America healthy.”

He also made the point of naming “vaccine injury” as a medical concern he suggested was often ignored by the scientific community, lumping it in with chronic Lyme disease and long COVID. Several of the speakers noted positive aspects of vaccines, such as their ability to prevent cancers or protect against dementia. Oddly, though, none of these mentions included the fact that vaccines are highly effective at blocking or limiting the impact of the pathogens they’re designed to protect against.

When pressed on some of MAHA’s odder ideas, NIH leadership responded with accurate statements on topics such as plausible biological mechanisms and the timing of disease progression. But the mere fact that they had to answer these questions highlights the challenges NIH leadership faces: Their primary political backing comes from people who have limited respect for the scientific process. Pandering to them, though, will ultimately undercut any support they might achieve from the scientific community.

Managing that tension while starting a scientific revolution would be challenging on its own. But as the day’s talks made clear, the challenges are likely to be compounded by the lack of intellectual coherence behind the whole project. As much as it would be good to see the scientific community place greater value on reproducibility, these aren’t the right guys to make that happen.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Steven Spielberg directed two of the best alien films of all time: E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Now he’s going back to those roots, as it were, with his latest blockbuster film, Disclosure Day. A full-length trailer aired during the Super Bowl LX broadcast last night.

Per the (deliberately vague) official premise: “If you found out we weren’t alone, if someone showed you, proved it to you, would that frighten you? This summer, the truth belongs to 7 billion people. We are coming close to… Disclosure Day.”

The trailer doesn’t tell us much more than the logline. It opens with a newscast announcing the pending public release of “government material long shrouded in secrecy.” We see a shot of a man standing in the middle of a crop circle that definitely wasn’t made by humans. A little girl encounters a seemingly sentient deer in her bedroom as a voiceover wonders whether there could be “others.” And what’s with putting electrodes on people’s temples so that their eyes change color? We’ll find out in June.

David Koepp, who has worked with Spielberg on numerous projects (including Jurassic Park and War of the Worlds), wrote the screenplay. Emily Blunt stars as a TV meteorologist in Kansas City. Her co-stars include Josh O’Connor, Colin Firth, Eve Hewson, Colman Domingo, Wyatt Russell, Elizabeth Marvel, Henry Lloyd-Hughes, Michael Gaston, and Mckenna Bridger. Professional wrestlers Chavo Guerrero Jr., Lance Archer, and Brian Cage will also appear.

Disclosure Day hits theaters on June 12, 2026.

And for those eagerly awaiting the May 22, 2026, release of The Mandalorian and Grogu, we give you this 30-second glimpse of our favorite bounty hunter and his ward in a sled pulled by Tauntauns. We still don’t have much information about that plot either, but at least it’s a known property thanks to the hit TV series. Plus, we get a suitably sonorous voiceover by none other than Sam Elliott: “Sometimes we choose our path, other times the path chooses us. Through it all, we keep pushing forward, driven by a deeper purpose, guided by an unseen force. The journey never gets any easier; the bond just gets harder to break. This is the way.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Turns out the sci-fi filmmakers got it backwards. All those ’70s and ’80s dystopias like “Rollerball,” “The Running Man,” “Death Race 2000,” imagined futures in which sports were full of gadgets and gimmicks like armored cars, rocket-powered motorbikes, and electrified arenas.

In reality, we got the opposite — the padding’s gone, and the high-tech monitoring equipment is nowhere to be found. Instead, we have “Run It Straight,” a brutally literal content in where two competitors, standing around 50 feet apart, sprint into each other at full-speed with the aim of knocking their opponent to the ground.

Maybe it makes a certain grim sense. In an era of plummeting attention spans and vertical video scrolls, who could expect viewers to sit through an entire football game when the core combat loop can be distilled down to a series of meaty collisions — especially when they’re probably busy placing bets on Polymarket?

The “sport,” if you decide to call it that, has its origins in the backyard wrestling tradition of Australia and New Zealand. It’s now represented by a handful of growing leagues like RunIt Championship League and Run Nation Championship.

The latter, RNC, recently sold over 5,000 tickets to its second annual national competition, an event that’s likely to sell out the 5,500-seat arena its being held in, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation has reported.

“It’s how I play football, you know… the contact, the energy,” Australian rugby player and Run It Straight competitor Lochlan Piper told the outlet. “I like the violence of it.”

If the participants are excited to collide into each other like Rhinos jousting in the South Saharan steppe, medical experts aren’t convinced.

“Medical practitioners and the sporting community have become increasingly concerned about concussion, and aware of mild traumatic brain injury as sometimes not being mild and being a devastating part of people’s lives,” sports neurologist Rowena Mobbs told the ABC.

Though RNC’s organizer has sprinkled in a few rules to explicitly avoid head-to-head contact, Mobbs says no amount of bureaucracy can really make it safe to run straight into another person without padding or a helmet. “Certainly every time they run up and clash in that way, there’s likely to be at least a microscopic brain injury,” she said.

At least one 19-year old is already dead as a direct result of injuries sustained from Run It Straight. Still, some athletes don’t seem particularly phased.

“Every sport has their pros and cons, it’s a contact sport. I’m used to playing rugby league and used to that contact,” pro Rugby player Jayden young told ABC. “No one’s going into this sport thinking accidents or things can’t happen, we’re well aware of the sacrifices and the risks we’re taking.”

            <h2>Photo Shows Elon Musk at Jeffrey Epstein Dinner</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-09</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A newly revealed photo shows Elon Musk attending a “wild” dinner with Jeffrey Epstein and other powerful tech figures, including Mark Zuckerberg.

The picture, which appears to have been taken by Epstein himself, was contained in the latest tranche of documents released by the Department of Justice, and adds to the growing pile of evidence showing that Musk had much deeper ties to Epstein than he’s let on publicly.

Based on the photo, other files, and previous reporting from Vanity Fair, the dinner — which was already public knowledge — took place on August 2, 2015, and was hosted by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman.

Epstein mentioned the dinner in an email sent to Peter Attia, a wellness and “longevity” influencer, on that same day, adding that along with Musk, Peter Thiel and Mark Zuckerberg would be in attendance. The next day, he emailed himself a photo taken at the dinner, with Musk and Zuckerberg in clear view.

He evidently thought highly of the occasion. Later that month, Epstein bragged about the dinner in an email sent to Tom Pritzker of the billionaire Pritzker family, calling it “wild.”

An email sent by Epstein’s personal assistant Lesley Groff on the morning of the dinner, with the subject “Reconfirming tomorrow’s dinner,” provides a list of attendees. It includes Musk, Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, Hoffman and his wife Michelle Yee, Palantir cofounder Thiel, then-head of MIT Media Lab Joi Ito, MIT neuroscientist Ed Boyden, and Musk’s college roommate Navaid Farooq.

The dinner was hosted in honor of Boyden by Hoffman, according to Vanity Fair, which first reported on the dinner in 2019. Musk, Hoffman, and Thiel were all considered to be part of the so-called “PayPal mafia,” a group of former heavies at the payment platform that went on to be huge figures in Silicon Valley.

On top of clearly contradicting Musk’s long-held insistence that he had little contact with Epstein, the dinner revelations also come as the SpaceX CEO has spent the past week or so blasting Hoffman for his apparent ties to the sex trafficker. Shortly after the newly released emails showed that Musk extensively corresponded with Epstein, Musk made a series of tweets highlighting emails claiming Hoffman had visited Epstein’s island and demanded an investigation. Hoffman fired back, sharing evidence of Musk’s own involvement, including an email in which Musk asks Epstein when his “wildest” party will be on the island. Musk continued to maintain his innocence throughout their catfight.

“The big difference between you and me, Reid, is that you went and I did not,” Musk fumed. He added that he “obviously didn’t anticipate anything actually shady, as I was bringing my wife [Talulah Riley] at the time.”

Notwithstanding that all these emails are taking place well after Epstein was first convicted of sex crimes against underage girls in 2008, some exchanges show that Musk was almost certainly aware, to some degree, of the kinds of parties Epstein was throwing. In a conversation on Christmas day 2012, Epstein cautioned Musk that the “ratio on my island might make Talilah [sic] uncomfortable,” using a euphemism for the number of women, or perhaps young girls, that would be there compared to the number of men. Musk responded: “Ratio is not a problem for Talulah.”

            <h2>SpaceX Is Building Its Own Particle Accelerator</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Sun unleashes a torrent of charged particles. Some of them slam into the Earth’s atmosphere, triggering breathtaking auroras in the night sky.

But for equipment that’s orbiting our planet in outer space, solar weather can quickly turn into a major headache. The particles have been shown to wreak havoc on the on-board electronics of satellites, endangering their mission and longevity.

As part of an effort to bring the study and testing of the phenomenon in-house, SpaceX is now developing its own particle accelerator in Florida. The planned facility is a cyclotron, which can accelerate individual protons to near the speed of light, allowing them to study how radiation affects their spacecraft, including its broadband-beaming Starlink satellites.

SpaceX’s VP of Starlink, Michael Nicolls, confirmed the news in a tweet last week, announcing that the company is “hiring elite engineers at our new 230 [Meta-electronvolt] cyclotron facility in Florida, where we are bringing single-event radiation testing in house to accelerate development across all SpaceX vehicles.” (Meta-electronvolts, or MeV, are a commonly-used unit to measure the amount of kinetic energy that a single particle can gain.)

Put simply, cyclotrons use a magnetic field to bend the path of charged particles into a circular shape, allowing them to be accelerated to high energies. The idea is to blast these particles at certain materials to simulate the effects of space radiation here on Earth.

Job pages posted to ZipRecruiter suggest the goal is to study how computer chips react to a bombardment of highly energetic particles.

“This proton particle accelerator will be used to screen and characterize electronics across all of our vehicles and platforms, unlocking unprecedented agility for chip and [Printed Circuit Board Assembly] level performance characterization that will be critical as we build and scale our AI constellations and deep space exploration vehicles,” reads a posting for an Electronics Test Engineer.

“As a member of our fast-paced Radiation Effects team, you will be responsible for ensuring avionics hardware performance across our fleet of vehicles (Dragon, Falcon, Starship, Lunar Human Landing System, etc.) and satellites (Starlink, Starshield) through some of the harshest and varied radiation environments imaginable,” the job posting reads.

At 230 MeV, SpaceX’s cyclotron would be quite powerful — but with less than the juice than the 590 MeV Ring Cyclotron at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland, which is considered the most powerful in the world by beam power. (CERN’s Large Hadron Collider is not a cyclotron, but a different type of particle accelerator called a synchrotron.)

SpaceX’s Starlink satellites have already had to endure the damaging effects of space weather, particularly during solar storms. These bursts of electromagnetic activity in orbit have been found to shorten the lifespans of Starlink satellites, causing them to de-orbit much sooner than expected.

Beyond orbit, conditions get even more extreme. Well past the protective boundaries of the Earth’s atmosphere, which extends thousands of miles beyond our planet’s surface, spacecraft are exposed to the full brunt of space radiation — a major challenge for missions into deep space, crewed or uncrewed.

While the risks to electronics are considerable, scientists are still studying the effects of space radiation on the human body as well. Astronauts are exposed to 2.6 times as much radiation on the surface of the Moon, for instance, as they would be when spending the same amount of time on board the International Space Station.

            <h2>Elon Musk Announces Huge Change: Self-Growing City on Moon Now Top Priority at SpaceX</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Just over a year ago, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk made it abundantly clear he was not interested in visiting the Moon.

In January 2025, the height of his bromance with president Donald Trump, he tweeted that the “Moon is a distraction,” asserting instead that “we’re going straight to Mars.”

He has lambasted NASA’s efforts to return to the lunar surface, accusing its Artemis program of being “extremely inefficient as it is a jobs-maximizing program, not a results-maximizing program.”

For many years now, Musk has made it his number one goal to establish a city on Mars, using 1,000 of the company’s Starship rockets in an interstellar colonization effort that was supposed to kick off back in 2024.

Having completely missed that goal, the mercurial entrepreneur appears to have had a major change of heart, contradicting his earlier statements by arguing that the plan is now to go to the Moon and build a city there after all.

As it turns out, the Moon is far easier to settle than Mars, a plan that will likely prove a much easier pill to swallow for his investors — yet another instance of Musk significantly moving the goalposts after years of bluster and hype.

“For those unaware, SpaceX has already shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon, as we can potentially achieve that in less than ten years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years,” he tweeted on Sunday.

The richest man in the world’s colony on the Moon has become priority number one, since the “overriding priority” is to secure the “future of civilization” — and getting to the Moon, which is many orders of magnitude closer to us than Mars, is “faster.”

The timing of the admission is particularly noteworthy. Following the space company acquiring Musk’s CSAM-distributing AI startup xAI earlier this month, the goal is to go public at an eye-watering and record-breaking valuation of $1.25 trillion.

It’s unclear whether Musk’s abrupt reversal was in any way related to potential investor pressure ahead of the IPO, but given his enormous personal interest in going all-in on Mars — the Moon be damned — it’s a tectonic shift in priorities.

SpaceX’s role in NASA’s return to the surface of the Moon remains unclear. The space agency initially tapped Musk’s company’s Starship to deliver astronauts to the lunar South Pole from orbit. In October, however, NASA officials suggested the agency may opt for SpaceX’s competitor, Blue Origin instead, given ongoing technical issues hampering Starship’s development.

NASA’s Artemis 3 mission, the first planned crewed Moon landing in over half a century, is currently scheduled for 2028, but whether SpaceX can get Starship functional by then remains unknown.

The company has yet to successfully launch the mammoth rocket to space and then successfully land, let alone demonstrate in-orbit refueling capabilities, which will be critical for Starship to visit the Moon and eventually Mars.

In his latest tweet, Musk said that SpaceX hadn’t given up on Mars, but won’t start work on plans for a city there for another “five to seven years.”

Even on his social media platform X, which largely functions as an echo chamber of his most vocal supporters, his latest missive fell on flat ears.

“You could actually use some of those obscene billions of dollars of money to improve life here on Earth,” reads one reply, which received over 200 likes. “You know, reclaim desserts [sic] since you seem to love inhabitable places so much.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Artificial intelligence has taken the medical device industry by storm — even adding a layer of complexity to the operating room that’s resulting in patients being hurt, some health professionals claim.

As Reuters reports, the TruDi Navigation System by device maker Acclarent was designed to treat chronic sinusitis, inflammation of the nasal sinuses, by inserting a tiny balloon to enlarge the sinus cavity openings.

But ever since the company added AI to the device, the US Food and Drug Administration has received at least unconfirmed 100 reports of malfunctions and adverse events, including at least ten instances of patients being injured.

While it’s still unclear what role AI played in these instances, the resulting injuries can be grim, from the punctured base of a patient’s skull to cerebrospinal fluid leaking from one another’s nose, per the reports.

Two victims who say they’ve experienced strokes following their sinuplasties involving the TruDi Navigation System have since sued the device’s maker, Acclarent, which has since been acquired by Integra LifeSciences. The plaintiff in one of the cases, Erin Ralph, accused the company of having the device mislead surgeon Marc Dean during a 2022 procedure, causing him to injure a carotid artery, leading to a blood clot and eventually a stroke.

The AI is used in the TruDi Navigation System to confirm the position of the devices inside the patient’s head.

“The product was arguably safer before integrating changes in the software to incorporate artificial intelligence than after the software modifications were implemented,” one of these suits alleges, as quoted by Reuters.

The second lawsuit was filed by Donna Fernihough, whose carotid artery allegedly “blew,” causing blood to spray “all over,” and resulting in her experiencing a stroke the same day.

Acclarent “knew or should have known that the purported artificial intelligence caused or exacerbated the tendency of the integrated navigation system product to be inconsistent, inaccurate, and unreliable,” Fernihough’s case alleges.

The suit also accused Acclarent of lowering “its safety standards to rush the new technology to market” and setting “as a goal only 80 percent accuracy for some of this new technology before integrating it into the TruDi Navigation System.”

Integra LifeSciences pushed back, telling Reuters that “there is no credible evidence to show any causal connection between the TruDi Navigation System, AI technology, and any alleged injuries.” Acclarent denied allegations in both suits, which are still ongoing.

Nonetheless, these instances illustrate how the operating room is quickly being overtaken by AI, a trend that started long before the advent of large language models (LLMs) like the ones powering ChatGPT. For instance, machine-learning algorithms have been used to screen for diseases like cancer in medical scans for decades.

We’ve already seen reports of AI-powered medical instruments falling victim to the known shortcomings of the tech. For instance, a recent study found that two-thirds of more than 12,000 patients identified as having heart failure by an AI-enhanced stethoscope didn’t actually have heart failure.

We’ve also seen LLM-based chatbots designed to give medical advice to real-world patients experience widespread hallucinations. Experts also warn that doctors are losing the ability to identify cancer in scans due to the reliance on AI-powered detectors.

Whether regulatory oversight is there to ensure patients don’t get hurt by AI medical devices remains a subject of heated debate. Devices using AI don’t even have to be used in clinical trials before being approved by the FDA. Instead, many device makers point to previously authorized devices before adding AI to them, according to Reuters.

Worse yet, the Trump administration’s enormous cuts to the FDA’s budget have led to dozens of AI scientists being laid off or encouraged to leave, adding plenty of pressure to those who remain.

“If you don’t have the resources, things are more likely to be missed,” a former device reviewer told Reuters.

Meanwhile, the FDA has doubled down on the tech, outsourcing oversight duties to LLMs to “fuel innovation” and accelerate drug approvals.

Most recently, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Mehmet “Doctor Oz” Oz gloated over “robots” that can do anything from performing ultrasounds on pregnant women and “wands” that can determine “whether the child’s OK or not.”

“And frankly, I don’t have to see the image,” he said. “I just have to know if the image is good enough to tell me the child doesn’t have a problem.”

            <div id="article-text">The US government has found a frighteningly efficient way to keep tabs on citizens who criticize the government: just demand their personal data from Google.

According to recent reporting from the Washington Post, a 67-year-old retiree sent a polite email to an attorney for the Department of Homeland Security urging mercy for an asylum seeker facing deportation to Afghanistan. The man, identified only as Jon, had read about the Afghani native’s case, and his fear that he would be persecuted should he ever return to his home country.

“Don’t play Russian roulette with [this man’s] life,” Jon told lead DHS prosecutor, Joseph Dernbach, in the email. “Err on the side of caution. There’s a reason the US government along with many other governments don’t recognise the Taliban. Apply principles of common sense and decency.”

Five hours later, per WaPo, Jon received a response — not from Dernbach or the DHS, but from Google.

“Google has received legal process from a Law Enforcement authority compelling the release of information related to your Google Account,” it read. The email advised Jon that the “legal process” was an administrative subpoena, issued by DHS. Soon, government agents would arrive at his home.

The subpoena wasn’t approved by any judge, and it didn’t require probable cause. Google gave Jon just seven days to challenge it in federal court — not nearly enough time for someone without a crack team of lawyers on retainer. Even more maddeningly, neither Google nor DHS had sent him a copy of the subpoena itself, leaving Jon and his attorney in the dark.

“How do you challenge a subpoena you don’t have a copy of?” an attorney Jon consulted, Judi Bernstein-Baker, told WaPo.

As DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin told the newspaper in a statement, the law grants the department “broad administrative subpoena authority,” meaning legal demands from DHS officials don’t need to pass independent review.

“There’s no oversight ahead of time, and there’s no ramifications for having abused [administrative subpoenas] after the fact,” Jennifer Granick, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union — which is representing Jon pro bono — told WaPo. “As we are increasingly in a world where unmasking critics is important to the administration, this type of legal process is ripe for that kind of abuse.”

When uniformed DHS agents did show up at Jon’s front door weeks later, they grilled him for over 20 minutes, pointing to his mentions of “Russian roulette” and the “Taliban” as suspicious. In the end, the field grunts — who had been dispatched by an anonymous official in Washington DC — agreed Jon hadn’t broken any laws.

When Jon finally received a copy of the subpoena from Google — 22 days after they issued their seven-day notice — it demanded his data going back weeks: timestamps for his online activity, every known IP and physical address, his credit card, driver’s license, and Social Security numbers.

“It doesn’t take that much to make people look over their shoulder, to think twice before they speak again,” Nathan Freed Wessler, another of Jon’s ACLU attorneys, told WaPo. “That’s why these kinds of subpoenas and other actions — the visits — are so pernicious. You don’t have to lock somebody up to make them reticent to make their voice heard.”

“Our processes for handling law enforcement subpoenas are designed to protect users’ privacy while meeting our legal obligations,” a Google spokesperson told WaPo. “We review all legal demands for legal validity, and we push back against those that are overbroad or improper, including objecting to some entirely.”

Credit where it’s due, though: Google delayed handing over Jon’s data long enough for the ACLU to challenge the subpoena on his behalf, though it didn’t explain why. Of course, that meant DHS agents still tracked down his address some other way — part of a growing trend of federal agencies surveilling and harassing random people who haven’t even been arrested, let alone convicted of a crime.

            <div id="article-text">Waymo has pulled the human safety driver from its autonomous test vehicles in Nashville, as the Alphabet-owned company moves closer to launching a robotaxi service in the city.

Waymo, which has been testing in Nashville for months, is slated to launch a robotaxi service there this year in partnership with Lyft. Riders will initially hail rides directly through the Waymo app. Once the service expands, Waymo will also make its self-driving vehicles available through the Lyft app. Lyft has said it will handle fleet services, such as vehicle readiness and maintenance, charging infrastructure, and depot operations, through its wholly owned subsidiary Flexdrive.

Waymo has accelerated its robotaxi expansion and today operates commercial services in Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Phoenix. It also has driverless test fleets in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Orlando.

The company tends to follow the same rollout strategy in every new market, starting with a small fleet of vehicles that are manually driven to map the city. The autonomous vehicles are then tested with a human safety operator in the driver’s seat. Eventually, the company conducts driverless testing, often allowing employees to hail rides, before launching a robotaxi service.

            <div id="article-text">YouTube megastar MrBeast announced on Monday that his company, Beast Industries, is buying Step, a teen-focused banking app.

Step, which raised half a billion in funding and has grown to over 7 million users, offers financial services geared toward Gen Z to help them build credit, save money, and invest. The company has attracted celebrity investors like Charli D’Amelio, Will Smith, The Chainsmokers, and Stephen Curry, in addition to venture firms like General Catalyst, Coatue, and the payments company Stripe.

If the company wants to continue getting its fintech product in front of young eyes, then partnering with Gen Z phenom MrBeast is wise. MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, is the most-subscribed creator on YouTube, with over 466 million subscribers, but his ambitions stretch beyond his over-the-top videos.

“Nobody taught me about investing, building credit, or managing money when I was growing up,” the 27-year-old said. “I want to give millions of young people the financial foundation I never had.”

I&#39;m so excited to share that we are acquiring the financial services app, @stepNobody taught me about investing, building credit, or managing money when I was growing up. That&#39;s exactly why we’re joining forces with Step! I want to give millions of young people the financial…

This acquisition makes sense, considering that a leaked pitch document from last year showed this was an area of interest for Beast Industries. The company is also reportedly interested in launching a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), a lower-cost cell phone plan similar to Ryan Reynolds’ Mint Mobile.

In line with other top creators, Beast Industries’ business is much more than YouTube ad revenue. (In fact, the company reinvests much of that money back into the content.) The company’s cash cow is the chocolate brand Feastables, which is more profitable than both the MrBeast YouTube channel and the Prime Video show “Beast Games,” according to leaked documents reported on by Bloomberg. Some of his other ventures, like Lunchly and MrBeast Burger, have struggled.

“We’re excited about how this acquisition is going to amplify our platform and bring more groundbreaking products to Step customers,” Step founder and CEO CJ MacDonald said in a statement.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Social network Bluesky is finally rolling out one of users’ most-requested features: drafts. Bluesky’s competitors, X and Threads, have long supported the ability to write drafts, which is seen as a baseline feature for services like this.

Users can access drafts on Bluesky the same way they do on these other platforms, which is by opening the new post flow and selecting the Drafts button in the top-right corner.

The rollout of drafts comes as Bluesky recently teased its roadmap for the year ahead. The company said it plans to focus on improving the app’s algorithmic Discover feed, offering better recommendations on who to follow, and making the app feel more real-time, among other updates. At the same time, the company acknowledged that it still needs to get the basics right.

Although Bluesky has gained a loyal user base, it still lags behind rivals when it comes to basic features, like private accounts and support for longer videos.

Launched to the public in early 2024, Bluesky has since scaled to over 42 million users, according to data sourced directly from the Bluesky API for developers.

            <h2>Databricks CEO says SaaS isn’t dead, but AI will soon make it irrelevant</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/09/databricks-ceo-says-saas-isnt-dead-but-ai-will-soon-make-it-irrelevant/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Monday, Databricks announced it reached a $5.4 billion revenue run rate, growing 65% year-over-year, of which more than $1.4 billion was from its AI products.

Co-founder and CEO Ali Ghodsi wanted to share these growth numbers because there’s so much talk about how AI is going to kill the SaaS business, he told TechCrunch.

“Everybody’s like, ‘Oh, it’s SaaS. What’s going to happen to all these companies? What’s AI going to do with all these companies?’ For us, it’s just increasing the usage,” he said.

To be sure, he also wants to distance Databricks from the SaaS label, given that private markets value it as an AI company. Databricks on Monday also officially closed on its massive, previously announced $5 billion raise at a $134 billion valuation, and nabbed a $2 billion loan facility as well.

But the company is straddling both worlds. Databricks is still best known as a cloud data warehouse provider. A data warehouse is where enterprises store massive amounts of data to analyze for business insights.

Ghodsi called out, in particular, one AI product that’s driving usage of its data warehouse: its LLM user interface named Genie.

Genie is an example of how a SaaS business can replace its user interface with natural language. For instance, he uses it to ask why warehouse usage and revenue spike on particular days.

Just a few years ago, such a request required writing queries in a specific technical language, or having a special report programmed. Today, any product with an LLM interface can be used by anyone, Ghodsi noted. Genie is one reason for the company’s usage growth numbers, he said.

The threat of AI to SaaS isn’t, as one AI VC jokingly tweeted, that enterprises will rip out their SaaS “systems of record” to replace them with vibe-coded homegrown versions. Systems of record store critical business data, whether it’s on sales, customer support, or finance.

“Why would you move your system of record? You know, it’s hard to move it,” Ghodsi said.

The model makers aren’t offering databases to store that data and become systems of record anyway. Instead, they hope to replace the user interface with natural language for human use, or APIs or other plug-ins for AI agents.

So the threat to SaaS businesses, Ghodsi says, is that people no longer spend their careers becoming masters of a particular product: Salesforce specialists, or ServiceNow, or SAP. Once the interface is just language, the products become invisible, like plumbing.

“Millions of people around the world got trained on those user interfaces. And so that was the biggest moat that those businesses have,” Ghodsi warned.

SaaS companies that embrace the new LLM interface could grow, as Databricks is doing. But it also opens up possibilities for AI-native competitors to offer alternatives that work better with AI and agents.

That’s why Databricks created its Lakebase database designed for agents. He’s seeing early traction. “In its eight months that we’ve had it in the market, it’s done twice as much revenue as our data warehouse had when it was eight months old. Okay, obviously, that’s like comparing toddlers,” Ghodsi says. “But this is a toddler that’s twice as big.”

Meanwhile, now that Databricks has closed on its massive funding round, Ghodsi tells us that the company is not immediately working on another raise, nor prepping for an IPO.

“Now is not a great time to go public,” Ghodsi said. “I just wanted to be really well capitalized” should the markets go “south” again as they did in the 2022 downturn, when interest rates rose sharply after years of near-zero rates. A thick bank account “protects us, gives us many, many years of runway,” he added.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As Anthropic expands into India, a local software company has filed a court complaint saying it was already using the name “Anthropic,” spotlighting how the rapid global push of AI firms can collide with local incumbents.

The filing comes amid Anthropic deepening its focus on India, announcing an India office last October and more recently appointing former Microsoft India managing director Irina Ghose to lead its operations in the country, underscoring the South Asian market’s growing importance to global AI companies expanding beyond the U.S. and Europe.

In a complaint filed in a commercial court in Karnataka in January, reviewed by TechCrunch, the Indian company Anthropic Software says it has used the name since 2017 and that Anthropic’s recent entry into India has led to customer confusion. The firm is seeking recognition of its prior use and relief to prevent further confusion, along with ₹10 million (about $110,000) in damages.

Anthropic Software founder and director Mohammad Ayyaz Mulla told TechCrunch that the Indian company was not seeking confrontation, but clarity and recognition of its prior use in India, adding that litigation was a fallback if clean coexistence could not be achieved.

“As of now, I am exercising my legal right as it’s causing huge confusion to my customers,” he said.

India, the world’s most populous nation and one of the fastest-growing internet markets, has become a key battleground for AI companies like Anthropic and its rival OpenAI. The country is also set to host an AI Impact Summit in New Delhi next week, where Anthropic co-founder and chief executive Dario Amodei is appearing alongside other industry leaders like Sam Altman, Jensen Huang, and Sundar Pichai.

A court order dated January 20 and seen by TechCrunch shows that the court has issued notice and suit summons to Anthropic. However, it declined to grant an interim injunction and listed the matter to return on February 16.

Anthropic did not respond to a request for comment.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI on Monday announced it’s beginning to test ads in the U.S. for users on its Free and Go subscription tiers.

The newer Go plan is a low-cost subscription at $8 per month in the U.S. and was introduced globally in mid-January.

Subscribers to OpenAI’s paid plans, including its Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Education tiers, will not see ads, the company said.

OpenAI sought to address concerns about how ads might affect the user experience, stating in a blog post: “Ads do not influence the answers ChatGPT gives you, and we keep your conversations with ChatGPT private from advertisers. Our goal is for ads to support broader access to more powerful ChatGPT features while maintaining the trust people place in ChatGPT for important and personal tasks.”

The move, which the company announced last month, drew ridicule in a series of Super Bowl ads that ran on Sunday from a top rival, Anthropic.

In its TV commercials, Anthropic poked fun at the idea that some AI companies, like OpenAI, would soon include advertising by showing how poorly integrated ads could disrupt the consumer experience. This was portrayed on-screen by glassy-eyed actors playing AI chatbots, who would deliver their advice alongside a poorly targeted ad.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman got extremely testy about the jabs, calling the ads “dishonest” and Anthropic an “authoritarian company.”

Consumers have so far resisted the idea of ads in AI responses. OpenAI faced a backlash late last year when it tested app suggestions that looked like unwanted ads. Still, the AI company needs to generate revenue from its popular chatbot to cover the costs of developing its technology and growing the business.

While understandable, critics fear that ads could influence ChatGPT’s answers. OpenAI denies this in its announcement, saying that ads will be optimized based on “what’s most helpful to you.” The company says ads will also always be clearly labeled as sponsored and separated from the organic content.

In tests, OpenAI has tried matching ads to users based on the subject of their conversations, past chats, and previous ad interactions. For instance, users researching recipes might see ads for grocery delivery services or meal kits, the company says. OpenAI said advertisers won’t have access to user data, only aggregate information about ad performance, like views and clicks.

Users will also be able to view their history of interactions with ads and clear it at any time. Plus, OpenAI said users can dismiss ads, share feedback, view why they were shown an ad, and manage ad personalization settings.

Ads won’t be shown to users under 18, nor will they be placed near sensitive or regulated topics like health, politics, or mental health.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Wuthering Heights, the writer-director Emerald Fennell’s new adaptation of Emily Brontë’s groundbreaking Gothic novel, is her best film to date—a heaving, rip-snortingly carnal good time at the cinema. It is also a gooey, grimy mess. The camera lingers on dripping egg yolks and squishy, bubbling dough; the protagonist, Cathy Earnshaw (played by Margot Robbie), must wade through pig’s blood on her way to the moors near her home, leaving a trim of viscera on her gorgeously anachronistic dress. This is Fennell’s aesthetic throughout: loudly stylish on top, and just as loudly nasty right below the surface.

The clash of beauty and filth is well suited for Brontë’s desolate tale of romance in a tempestuous climate, where Cathy is constantly caught between Victorian propriety and her baser, wilder nature. Fennell’s take is thuddingly blunt; it brings the book’s simmering sexual repression to a boil. Wuthering Heights, sprawling and objectively tough to capture faithfully, hinges on the unbalanced, teenage energy of its central relationship—here, expressed through glossy, MTV-esque visuals that the director deploys with aplomb.

As with almost every cinematic interpretation of Wuthering Heights, the plot’s more unwieldy second half is disposed of entirely. Fennell has also stripped down the first half, removing some major characters and simplifying the motivations of others. She focuses largely on the bond between Cathy and her tortured lover, Heathcliff (Jacob Elordi), from quasi-feral childhood on. Some of these changes might feel mercenary to superfans of the novel; I count myself among them. I love the loopy directions the book’s later chapters veer in, so I expected to greet this new version with crossed arms. Instead, I was impressed with the director’s narrowed focus. She’s managed to make a weighty work feel nimble.

Read: The director tackling the dark side of millennial desire

Thematically, Wuthering Heights is reminiscent of the director’s previous movie, Saltburn, which also saw a rough outsider infiltrating the upper class in Britain. Saltburn’s near-contemporary setting, however, didn’t really suit Fennell’s unsubtle storytelling approach; the entire ensemble seemed cartoonish, their fancy trappings chintzy and fake. In Wuthering Heights, she more successfully turns the howling Yorkshire moors that Cathy wanders into a stylish fantasyland, reminiscent of a Meat Loaf video’s flamboyant theatricality. Everything is appropriately dialed-up: The titular mansion that Cathy lives in is a dark, foreboding shambles, while at the estate next door, there are rooms entirely devoted to ribbons. One of the chambers is even wallpapered to look exactly like Cathy’s skin, down to the freckles.

Cathy and Heathcliff’s emotional ties begin at a young age. One day, her father returns home with an orphan in tow; she quickly bonds with the boy, named Heathcliff, and they become a gleefully untamed duo. The years pass, and soon enough, the pair are all grown up—but no less primitive. (Robbie is a stretch as the 20-something Cathy, but her performance is winning enough that the viewer can largely keep that out of mind.) Some more civilized tenants, the sweet but stuffy textile heir Edgar Linton (Shazad Latif) and his sister, Isabella (Alison Oliver), move into the estate next door. With them comes the wedge that drives Cathy and Heathcliff apart: the harsh realities of class and Victorian society. Cathy might be as uninhibited as Heathcliff when roaming the outdoors, but a woman of her status can’t be allowed to marry a foundling, especially one who now works for her family as a servant. She’s nudged into Edgar’s arms, transforming Heathcliff into a vengeful, horny demigod of sorts. Heathcliff is the paragon of Byronic anti-heroism, which, to Fennell, means that he’s as cruel as he is seductive. She sands off the more abusive edges of his literary counterpart, but he’s still domineering and callous, hell-bent on embarrassing a community that can’t take him seriously as a potential husband.

Robbie and Elordi’s chemistry is strong, and both are major Hollywood talents who can smirk, scream, and sob with the best of them. The gleeful visuals and sounds, however, are what really propel the movie along. There are ravishing songs by the pop star Charli XCX, surprisingly none of them too out of place; some truly ridiculous costume choices for Cathy as she embraces Edgar’s hoity-toity life; and all of that goo, blood, and viscera. The film opens with what sounds like erotic groaning over a black screen, which is revealed to be the final gasps of a man being hanged. Touches like these could not be more direct, but they work here—Fennell wants the audience to think about how closely sex and death are intertwined. This is especially true for Cathy and Heathcliff, who might honestly rather expire than be apart.

The story’s dreamy and at times ludicrous emotional landscape often struggles on more realistic grounding. In 2011, the great director Andrea Arnold attempted a version of Wuthering Heights with a much more muted, credible tone, even casting a mixed-race actor in the role of Heathcliff (in the book, his ethnic background is pointedly ambiguous). Although Arnold’s attempt was interesting, it felt flat, bereft of Brontë’s eccentric flourishes. Fennell has streamlined the book’s narrative, yes, but not its white-hot melodramatic core—and she understands it well enough to create a worthy swoon-fest for the ages.</div>

Last night, during Super Bowl halftime, I watched a mustachioed entertainer put on a show that celebrated working-class values, the pleasures of a good party, and the virtues of marriage, with a side serving of grievance against elites. This wasn’t Bad Bunny’s performance—it was the alternative performance put on by Turning Point USA, led by Kid Rock. Despite the best efforts of the organizers to stoke controversy, I couldn’t help but notice how much overlap there was between its message and the one the Puerto Rican superstar delivered in Santa Clara.

As my colleague Spencer Kornhaber writes, Bad Bunny’s show was unifying rather than divisive, but it did have a political message: that working hard, playing hard, and loving America aren’t values that belong to any political group or linguistic heritage. Although Turning Point’s show was intended to offer a radical contrast, the many thematic convergences only strengthened that argument.

Above all, the Turning Point show was boring and dour. It kicked off with a distorted-electric-guitar rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner,” a Jimi Hendrix pastiche shorn of all the irony and pathos of the famous version at Woodstock. Brantley Gilbert played “Real American,” a bland piece of nu-metal/country patriotic kitsch, and “Dirt Road Anthem,” a paean to drunk driving. Gabby Barrett, a former American Idol third-place winner, sang a kiss-off to a cheater and then a love song to “one of the good ones.”

More overtly political, at least in theory, was Lee Brice’s “Drinking Class.” “I’m a member of a blue-collar crowd / They can never, no, they can’t keep us down,” he sang. “Monday through Friday, man, we bust our backs.” This is a common sentiment in contemporary country music, but it is not, despite what Brice might believe, unique to white conservatives. The New York Times wrote that Bad Bunny “was summoning a Latin heritage across generations, one that recognized hard work—cane-cutting, electric-grid repairs—alongside the good times workers sweated to earn.”

These kinds of echoes were all over the two shows. Kid Rock extolled marriage, singing, “You can always put a diamond on her hand / ’til you can’t,” and Charlie Kirk, the assassinated founder of Turning Point, was heard encouraging marriage in an old audio clip; Bad Bunny hosted an actual wedding during his performance. Both shows used “real” instruments as signifiers of authenticity—workmanlike performances on guitars and drum kits for the Turning Point set (except from Kid Rock, who appeared to be lip-synching his 1999 hit “Bawitdaba”); a brass salsa band and the characteristic Puerto Rican cuatro during Bad Bunny’s.

“We fly that red, white, blue, high, waving all across the land,” Gilbert sang. Bad Bunny flew that red, white, and blue too, along with flags from Puerto Rico and other countries in North and South America, declaring, “God bless America.” The fact that the patriotism he displayed was more complicated and nuanced that Gilbert’s does not make it any less genuine. Bad Bunny even danced on top of a pickup truck, a visual that would have worked perfectly for any of the Turning Point performers if they hadn’t been playing on a darkened, austere soundstage.

Each show also had its complaints about mistreatment by elites, but not all grievances are equally legitimate. During “El Apagón,” Bad Bunny performed atop imitation power poles topped with sparking transformers—a symbol of Puerto Rico’s fragile power grid, and of the political corruption and imperial neglect that let it get that way. But whereas the Jumbotron behind Bad Bunny at Levi’s Stadium declared The only thing more powerful than hate is love, Brice delivered swipes at liberals and trans people in a new song called “Country Nowadays,” which nevertheless complained that “because I have my morals and my small-town point of view / You assume that you don’t like me means that I don’t like you too.” Could that be because of your lyrics?

This unearned sense of grievance is what animated the backlash to Bad Bunny’s performance and inspired Turning Point’s alternative show. Right-wing pundits charged that Bad Bunny’s message would be divisive (it wasn’t) or that he was an immigrant (he’s not). President Trump ranted about the show on Truth Social, writing that it was “absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER! It makes no sense, is an affront to the Greatness of America,” adding that “Nobody understands a word this guy is saying, and the dancing is disgusting.” Laura Loomer was more straightforward in her condemnation: “This isn’t White enough for me,” she posted on X.

If the people participating in the Bad Bunny backlash slowed down and looked a little closer, they might find that they actually have a great many values in common with him. (Well, maybe not Loomer. Some Bad Bunny critics are just bigoted.) This might provide the grounds for just the sort of understanding and reconciliation that Brice claims to want. Other Americans will notice, however, how familiar and relatable Bad Bunny’s ethos was, even if they couldn’t understand his Spanish-language lyrics.

Almost as important as the message of Bad Bunny’s show was the exuberance with which he conveyed it: Living these American values could be joyful, he suggested. It was, as Spencer wrote, a performance “rooted in the good old-fashioned pleasure principle.” Meanwhile, the Turning Point musicians sang about having a good time, but they didn’t appear to be having a good time. If right-wing leaders wonder why MAGA has struggled to overtake the country’s cultural establishment, they might start with the very different ways the two shows framed shared values.</div>

            <div id="article-text">You won’t find this in Cortina d’Ampezzo over the next few weeks, but for several decades of the Olympics’ history, the contest awarded medals not just for sport but for art too.

In the Summer Games from 1912 to 1948, musicians, painters, and plenty of other aesthetes went brain-to-brain in events such as lyric poetry and chamber music. “Town planning” was even contested one year under the umbrella of the architecture competition.

Lest you think the arts’ inclusion odd—one wonders what muscles need stretching before going for gold in watercolor—the submissions had to be at least about sports.

The Olympic committee ought to bring these events back. Well, maybe not town planning—but add trivia to the mix instead. Organizers can throw in a few sports questions for good measure, but with trivia, if you’re not working up a sweat thinking, you’re not doing it right.

And by the way, did you know that humans have a bone that does not connect to any other? We think of the skeleton as pretty contiguous, but in the middle of the neck, the hyoid bone, which supports the base of the tongue, is articulated only distantly to the rest of the skeleton by muscles and ligaments. It is, as scientists call it, a “floating bone.”

Because it’s not readily attachable, the hyoid is often left off of model skeletons. High-end ones hang it with string or wire.

You know how to select a good avocado (squeeze) or watermelon (slap); now, next time you’re skeleton shopping, you’ll be able to pick a winner.

How did you do? Come back tomorrow for more questions, and if you think up a great question after reading an Atlantic story—or simply want to share a fact—send it my way at [email protected].</div>

            <h2>What the Seahawks Did to Win the Super Bowl</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/02/super-bowl-excess-seahawks-patriots/685930/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Super Bowl has become a game of such monumental excess that it poses a test within a test: Which NFL team can screen out the lavish absurdities, the gorging on celebrity and commerce, the insipid questions about favorite flavors and foods, and avoid becoming warped and overwearied before the ball is even kicked off? This year, that team was the Seattle Seahawks, a defensive-minded, unshowy bunch who had no use for indulgences as they defeated the New England Patriots, 29–13.

The Seattle quarterback Sam Darnold, who broke the game open in the fourth quarter with a 16-yard scoring pass to A. J. Barner to bring the lead to 19–0, is a onetime bust, playing on his fourth team in four years. Six of his fellow starters on the 53-man squad had been considered so untalented in high school that the national ranking service Rivals had not even bothered rating them. Twenty members of the team were undrafted free agents, eight of whom signed just this season. They were players accustomed to digging success “out of the mud,” as the receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba told me last week—an attitude that helped them ignore the spectacle around them.

The cheapest seat in Santa Clara, California’s, Levi Stadium was listed on StubHub for more than $4,000. VIPs in the luxury suites were offered a specially concocted $180 LX Hammer Burger, a grotesquerie of beef shank, mirepoix demi-glace, and blue-cheese fondue poured over brioche buns, with an enormous steak bone sticking out of the top. Was the bone a souvenir, to be taken home and dried on the mantel? Or was it to be fed to the hounds at the hearth? Or maybe it was meant to be tossed in the air like a boomerang at the military jets that did the pregame flyover, led by the enormous B-1 Lancer, a supersonic bomber aptly nicknamed “The Bone.” Lighter fare included $40 Dungeness-crab nachos layered over hand-cut potato chips. A can of domestic beer, to wash it down, cost $17.50.

For the week leading up to the game, the San Francisco Bay Area was overlit, ear-splitting, and teeming with corporate pop-ups, including an Abercrombie & Fitch fashion show and a concert featuring Green Day and Counting Crows at Pier 29. A team had to have “stamina” to deal with it, find a way to play well amid the scale and spectacle, the Patriots’ coach, Mike Vrabel, said in a press conference after the game, watery-eyed with disappointment. Smith-Njigba estimated that the number of his family and friends who came to town and needed tickets was “in the teens.” At the Intercontinental Hotel in San Francisco, fleets of black Escalades lined the block to pick up “brand ambassadors” who’d come to town to hawk Bud Light, State Farm, UberEats. A promotional robot-dog was stationed by the front door, immobile yet menacing, stopping pedestrians in their tracks. Cardi B, said to be dating Stefon Diggs, a Patriots receiver, visited the Intercontinental on Saturday and encountered a different robot—this one a full humanoid—at the door. She gave it a lap dance in front of passersby, who captured the scene with cellphones as the robot accidentally toppled onto her.

Every day the press corps descended on both teams with pestering questions, some of which were obvious plants to promote products. “What’s your favorite color of Gatorade?” someone asked the Patriots’ 23-year-old quarterback, Drake Maye, a kid-faced North Carolinian who was finishing only his second year in the NFL. He replied that he liked “the purple one.” Somebody else asked him if he liked dorilocos, a Mexican street food. Maye asked, “What’s those? Is it spicy? I like Doritos.”

It must have all been a little overwhelming for an adored phenom such as Maye, who would have been the youngest man ever to win a Super Bowl, had he not given up two interceptions and been sacked six times by a tremendous Seahawks defense that nicknamed itself “The Dark Side.” Maye has attained folk-hero status in Boston for his combination of on-field flair and off-field charm, as has his wife and middle-school sweetheart, Ann Michael, nicknamed the “Queen of the North.” Her TikTok cooking videos have attracted hundreds of thousands of viewers and are high comedy for their contrast with the previous football couple to rule New England, the legendarily clean-eating, well-clad Tom Brady and his beauteous supermodel ex-wife, Gisele Bundchen. Ann Michael makes spaghetti with jarred sauce and appears on camera with a shiny forehead and damp hair. Her game-day bean-dip recipe with Bush’s Baked Beans includes half a cup of Coca-Cola; the video for it got 1.5 million views. When she baked jalapeño-and-cheddar sourdough bread, she said, “Okay. Okay. It’s a little dense.” One viewer wrote in response, “Gisele never believed in letting us eat any bread.”

Years before he joined the Seahawks, Darnold had been that popular—for a minute. Drafted out of the University of Southern California by the New York Jets, in 2018, he was considered the future of the franchise. Dealing with the hectoring racket of New York fans may well have prepared him to withstand the noise of the Super Bowl. He threw an interception on the first play of his career. As he struggled through predictable rookie unevenness and adjustments, the New York press and fans were merciless. One tabloid called Darnold “an anxiety-riddled, shell-shocked, panic-stricken mess.” The Jets’ management lost faith in him too quickly, and he was traded to the Carolina Panthers in 2021, then went to the Minnesota Vikings, then to the San Francisco 49ers, before landing in Seattle.

The son of a medical-gas plumber who worked night shifts, Darnold just kept laboring at his craft. “I learned,” he told reporters last week. “I learned a ton from the mistakes that I made early on in my career.” By the end of this season, he was so respected by the Seahawks for his pure doggedness, he was practically their mascot. “He’s a really cool case study,” the Seahawks’ offensive coordinator, Klint Kubiak, told me. In the team’s final press conference before the game, the receiver Cooper Kupp wore an I Love Sam Darnold T-shirt. “Find me another player, another quarterback specifically, who’s had the start of a career like he has,” Kupp said. “To be counted out like he’s had, and be able to come back and do what he has done.”

Darnold was emblematic of a team perspective that “when bad things happen, good things happen, you gotta use that to be a world champ,” Smith-Njigba said to reporters after the game. “You gotta believe you’re a world champ before you’re a world champ.” As the Seahawks hoisted the trophy on the field, amid the gigantism and confetti cannons and surfeit on display, a sense of perspective seemed to have been restored.</div>

            <h2>Finally, a Halftime Show That Represents Real America!</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/2026/02/turning-point-usa-halftime-show/685932/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Hurry, hurry, hurry! Everybody, to the bunker! It is halftime at the Super Bowl, and what is happening on the field is un-American in a way I won’t specify!

Isn’t Bad Bunny an American artist? Don’t millions of people love his music? Didn’t he just win the Album of the Year Grammy? No time, no time! We must get into the bunker quickly for the All-American halftime!

Is the president going to watch with us? What kind of a question is that! Imagine the president not watching the Turning Point USA All-American Halftime Show, streaming live on the Turning Point channel on YouTube (but not X.com, due to last-minute technical difficulties) on or around 8 p.m. ET, during the Super Bowl. If there’s one thing we know about President Donald J. Trump, it’s that what’s good enough for his devoted fans is exactly what he likes best himself, and he absolutely will not just tune in to the Super Bowl and watch the actual halftime show. Don’t worry—he is right there with us, fiddling with YouTube as we are!

Shh! Here comes Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, with a special welcome message about “this halftime show that the War Department is proud to support!” Hey, Pete threw a football! God, he’s cool. Cool isn’t being comfortable in your own skin. Cool is making your whole family watch … a guy in a backward baseball cap, red sneakers, and skinny jeans play the national anthem on the electric guitar in what appears to be a sealed bunker.

Heck yeah! Now we’re talking! One thing I always think about the Super Bowl halftime show is, This could be indoors. And this is the most indoors anyone has ever looked. Is this live from the mines of Moria? Is this the president’s new, extra-secure vault under the East Wing? Either way, you can tell it’s cool because, again, the cap is backward.

What do you mean Bad Bunny just fell through a roof, there was a wedding, and Pedro Pascal is there? Who cares? In the bunker, Lee Brice, the singer of the 2014 hit(?) “The Drinking Class,” is debuting a special new song with lyrics about how hard it is to be country in this country nowadays!

What is America nowadays? Let the lyrics from this wondrous patriot extravaganza (not to be confused with the Super Bowl itself, a Patriot blowout) explain it to you! “Old Glory’s on a can. / And everything’s made in the U.S.A. / Hand on your heart when the song gets played.” What do Americans want? “To catch my fish, drive my truck, drink my beer / and not wake up to all this stuff I don’t want to hear.” America is a man who cheated on you getting cheated on himself! Whereas a good American man is “a phone call to his parents. He’s a Bible by the bed.” America is an ill-advised rap breakdown: “I sit back and think about them good ol’ days. The way we were raised and our southern ways.” That’s my country!

Yes, I know. I know Bad Bunny is a U.S. citizen. You know what I’m trying to say. He’s Puerto Rican. Yes, I know Puerto Rico is part of America. But. You know. You know what I’m saying. A real American artist would speak English. Or at the very least, recently translated German. Like the DHS X account.

This isn’t a dog whistle. That’s my smoke alarm. I’m burning the nachos! No, Nachos are all-American. Yeah, I’m pretty sure. Well, the way I make them, they are. Have some salsa. Yes, it’s mild.

It’s nice to be here, watching this all-American halftime show, with all the real Americans. You know we outnumber the people watching the other show? Yeah. Five million to 135 million. (It helps if we don’t count all of them as people.)

Come down, come down, where it’s nice and dark and safe, and hear Kid Rock perform not once, but twice! Don’t worry: This concludes with a memorial of Charlie Kirk, so if anyone criticizes it online, that person will be removed from their position, drawn, and quartered!

So. For, confusingly, even more minutes than halftime lasts, please enjoy only what is safe to enjoy! No one will bang down your door for watching this! No agents of the state will yank you out of a stadium for bopping along to this! Play this as loud in your car as you’d like!

Now put your hands together for: Kid Rock, again and again! Forever! Singing “Bawitdaba”! Or, well, jumping around while it plays! Far more important that the performer not be, well, you know—you know—than that the performance be complete, outdoors, or live. Mr. Rock is jumping around the stage in shorts! He is wearing a hat! Did Bad Bunny wear a cool hat like Mr. Rock? Did Bad Bunny also frequently adjust the hat?

No, no, no, no, no! Do not answer that! Don’t you dare Google it!

We must not see how the rest of the country is living. We must not allow ourselves to suspect that they are America too.</div>

This type of product is not an Ad Platform no matter how much they want it to be.

When you have a lot of users, and are losing money as fast as you can get it, everything is an ad platform. There&#39;s no other way to stay in business.

They have to make money somehow.  For example, Wikipedia doesn&#39;t have ads, but they do have those extremely annoying donation nags.  TANSTAAFL

I hate to tell you this, but those donation nags are ads. They are just advertising themselves, but they&#39;re still ads, just like the ad for a different TV show than the one you&#39;re watching (which happens when they can&#39;t sell that slot).

What happens if it hallucinates ads that are not there?

...if the thing you&#39;re enshittifying is already bullshit?

There&#39;s always room for more bullshit. With any luck, they&#39;ll amass so much bullshit, it becomes a black hole and sucks in all the other techbro companies with it.

...if the thing you&#39;re enshittifying is already bullshit?As someone who spent two years of his life hauling cow shit, I can honestly say that the answer is yes. If you miss a day of hauling shit, the cows don&#39;t stop shitting. It just continues to get deeper.Somebody needs to make a digital skid loader and manure spreader!

Somebody needs to make a digital skid loader and manure spreader!

Insurance companies hate this one weird nitrogen trick that cuts your medical bills by 100%!

Although in all seriousness, they&#39;d probably advertise one of those sketchy online counseling services.  Probably the one that rhymes with &quot;cheddar yelp&quot;.

Cheddar Yelp actually sounds like a service I&#39;d subscribe to though.

Let the enshittification begin. We know how this will go.Let&#39;s show targeted ads that no-one wants to see,so we can reduce the load on our servers by driving away users.

If the chat topic requested information on a product and the ad was a legitimate source of a quality example of the product. it would be helpfulIf the ad is a scam, spam, or for a crappy knockoff, not helpful at all

&quot;and if the Ai isn&#39;t storing and selling information about the user to the advertiser&quot;.  I&#39;m sure there&#39;s other conditions that should be levied on ad-based LLMs.

Wouldn&#39;t it give better results if just one did it?

First of all, why would it give better results? Agents do not have the capacity to understand how one part of the code interacts with another.

Also, I&#39;m guessing it would have taken 32 weeks with one single agent. Probably not interesting to anyone willing to foot the bill.

So a bit like a large team of developers. We go off the rails too without supervision. Kind of why you need to collect status updates and maintain a schedule and project plan and architectural documents.

Successful open source projects work because the ones who succeed have the discipline to do the coordination and supervision in a more cooperative and distributed way. Top-down programming projects are a hot mess, like if you do Waterfall management without actually writing a plan and sticking to it.Agile ta

Sorry but the one guy model works amazingly well when all the variables align to positive values.

Kinda like the optimism vs realism debate of a single king vs democratic rule which fails to account for how great it could be if that single king was good and just and instead the debate always favors padding the luck into accepted mediocrity.

There are many projects where a single person is essentially the lifeblood and if they vanish it has little hope left. Many of them from what I have seen are corporate clo

In just the Linux example, it is most certainly not the &quot;one guy model&quot;. There have been countless thousands of contributors.

Linus is great and all, but he&#39;s currently just doing coordination between the members of a very large hierarchical team. No one human could possibly do all of that work.

These models aren&#39;t parallel in their nature, so spinning up multiple &#39;agents&#39; is just how you manage concurrency. Just like forking a process. I think it&#39;s a bit werd to call each instance a distinct &#39;agent&#39;, it is trying too hard to humanize this very synthetic thing...

For architectures that lack working hardware, wouldn&#39;t it make more sense to take an existing front-end like gcc or clang and just generate a back-end for the targeted hardware?

Who is &#39;we&#39;?  I don&#39;t think the LLM is up to the task of making a C compiler that can target an architecture with at most 256k of RAM and without a reference C compiler to work with, like it did for this. The LLM basically got told to write a knock off of gcc, and based on some of what happened, it absolutely needed a working gcc to work from to create the sort-of knock off.

When will 16 AI agents be able to code me up a Word processor with features equivalent to Microsoft Word?

Because once they can do that, people can stop buying Office and just vibe up their own versions.  So long as the agents can implement standard file formats, the differences in implementations won&#39;t matter.

An interesting future is being teased here; one in which the only tech giants remaining will be the makers of AI, and everyone else will just vibe up all the software they now pay through the nose to g

The functionality you describe used to fit on a single floppy.

Sure, they carefully spend weeks crafting the test cases with test data and then spend tens of thousands and probably have to buy it a license of Word to use as a reference to compare test execution on the LLM output versus reference implementation...

Or they could just stop at having bought Word....

The problem here is that this example leaned *heavily* on the software desired already existing and the LLM having access to run the original software as it endeavored to make a knock-off. And then per analysis a

I would also say that this seems the opposite of useful for no longer working hardware.  If the hardware existed, then we still have a C compiler for it.  If you say you want to modernize that compiler, but the hardware is a dead platform, why are you trying to modernize for it anyway?

Let me extrapolate to the point that maybe you are talking about a compiler for some future architecture.  Problem is this example needed:

- A human to carefully craft test cases and rescue the LLM w

It&#39;s a neat demonstration. I think if I had $20k to throw around, I&#39;d do the opposite. Make a new 16-bit C compiler to support UZI or Fuzix [fuzix.org]. (maybe not, might be more fun to write myself)

I&#39;ve seen some decent results for retro programming, such as this vid  Let&#39;s Create a Commodore C64 BASIC Interpreter in VSCode! [youtube.com]. Where the presenter gets a Commodore/Microsoft BASIC in C, and not only that with some hand holding gets it to output something capable of working on 2.11BSD for PDP-11.

It&#39;s been a decade and a half since I had to deal with anything on the compiler side of things. These days, I&#39;m just happy if the always-in-flux kernel API doesn&#39;t break a module I have to maintain.

But these days I just patch LLVM, which is so huge and complex that I&#39;m unlikely to understand more than the tiny little piece I need for my job.

PCC is a fantastic learning tool for anyone interested in writing a compiler. I wish it had been available to me at the time.
LLVM.... I don&#39;t even want to think about.

Don&#39;t forget that a huge amount of work for a competent compiler is performance enhancements for different CPUs. I&#39;m guessing it probably doesn&#39;t have those.

When all 16 agents got stuck trying to fix the same Linux kernel bug simultaneously, he used GCC as a reference oracle, randomly compiling most kernel files with GCC and only a subset with Claudeâ(TM)s compiler, so each agent could work on different bugs in different files.Not only was Claude trained on a lot of different C compilers, including the entirety of GCC, it still needed a golden model in order to finish.If I claimed I had written my own C compiler from scratch and then this came out in an interview, I don&#39;t think I would be hired.

Yeah, perhaps an extra step for the analysis would be to run comm against this &quot;from scratch&quot; compiler versus gcc and clang.

What strawman? I was quoting the article.

One thing that LLMs are pretty good at is translation, and training on a large corpus of Rust and C code as well as numerous C compilers means that this task is utterly useless given the context of the existing compilers, and trying to prove it can make projects &quot;from scratch&quot; is disingenuous when you are just having it implement very well trodden territory.

Hell, someone posted an experiment in writing a C compiler in rust to github at least once before, so it even had a C compiler written in rust that was

The beginning is a variable that isn&#39;t definitive. We can make this example as absurd as you want. Does from scratch preclude the ability of using any existing libraries? Does it mean we need to do everything in assembly? Does it mean we need to first create the universe?

Doing something from scratch does not typically preclude the use of reference material. That said in this case the issue seems that it was more than just reference.

Not only was Claude trained on a lot of different C compilers, including the entirety of GCC, it still needed a golden model in order to finish.To be fair, they were going use the ANSI C23 specification as a basis, but nobody wanted to shell out the money to buy an official copy.

I mean, this is impressive in the same way that turning vinyl gloves into hot sauce is impressive. Fabrice Bellard wrote TCC in a few months and it was under 30k lines of code, including an assembler and linker, and it actually worked (the Claude c compiler apparently cannot compile Hello World, so it undoubtedly has hundreds of bugs) - I am a little terrified of what that 100k lines of code actually looks like. If my past experience with coding AI is any guide, it will be disorganized, needlessly wordy, not standards-compliant, has weird unnecessary bugs around Leap Year, lacking in useful comments etc.

Which is to say while this is impressive, I am far more worried about what this means for the future of software quality than I am impressed with this achievement. Look at the crazy number of bugs Windows has had recently, coincidentally after MSFT bragged about how much code was being written by AI these days.

Please tell me why I shouldn&#39;t just commit suicide, right now?It&#39;s a lot of work, just let time do the hard part.

It&#39;s a lot of work, just let time do the hard part.

Apparently the performance of the code it produces is worse than gcc with all optimizations turned off. That&#39;s pathetic. And it is written in rust, so it can&#39;t bootstrap - And the size of it is on par with a hand-written C compiler - so no win there.

When I worked on compilers at IBM, our first bootstrap of C for x86 was a cause for celebration. A double bootstrap was a great &quot;smoke test&quot;. But that was relatively easy. Passing the validation test suites were *way* harder - like 50x harder.

so no win there.I mean they did it in a short time for $20k. Performance here doesn&#39;t just mean execution speed. You&#39;re comparing it against a 39 year old project that has millions of hours contributed to it. The point of this wasn&#39;t to create a high performance GCC alternative, it was to demonstrate functionality and speed.I doubt AI coding assistants will ever produce something as performant as experts who have been optimising shit for over a decade do, but some people don&#39;t have a decade to spare.

There are a few because it&#39;s a profitable market. They tend to identify as women though because women typically don&#39;t want to read romance novels written by men.

In the style of a 1920s romans novel, write a sex scene on the train. It should make references to steam pistons, rails, and locomotives as used on trains without ever referring to the sexual act itself. Early in the scene they should be interrupted by the steward bringing them hot coffee with copious quantities of cream. Do not use this as a euphemism.

I listen to schlock military sci-fi series on Audible (guilty pleasure) and was worried that the author might stoop to releasing AI-generated slop, but so far it&#39;s been good. I do suspect some of it may be AI-assisted but it&#39;s really hard to tell. I am worried that these kinds of serials are going to be gutted with third-rate prose sooner or later. I wonder what it will mean to us as a culture when we are just consuming statistically probable constellations of words for entertainment, despite the fact that

How will people be able to tell that it&#39;s AI generated?  In particular, before they buy it.I suppose readers can blacklist authors&#39; names once they notice, although whitelisting will probably work better in the long run.

I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any requirement that a publisher disclose the use of AI tools. You just have to trust them. For now, at least, it should be easy to tell that something is AI-generated because it gets repetitive and inconsistent. However, if you use it as a tool just for filling in pre-planned blocks of text and with careful editing, I bet you could &quot;write&quot; something formulaic in record time and not have to disclose anything to your readers.

At least Audible has a good return policy, so if you find some

Two years ago I had a longer talk with Germanys most prolific fantasy author, Bernard Hennen. I&#39;ve known him for a while since I used to live in his home town and we bump into each other at various German fantasy and RPG conventions. Anyway, it was in that discussion that he noted that he&#39;s mentally preparing for AI to basically take his job and he back then already was getting ready to fall back to world building, self-publishing - his current publisher is only a shell of its former self and used to be one of the largest and most successful in Germany - and live events.

As I said, that was two years ago. We all know how things habe progressed since then. And still are.

Were staples of Romance Novels and Soap operas.

AI slop can not be worse than that. Trust me. Also, due to the prudes here, romance novels did not (and still do not) have the graphic scenes, so... hurray!?

I know a romance novelist quite well.  She is a very successful, very intelligent professional who decided to go down the rabbit hole and start writing after years of reading romance novels.

What I&#39;ve learned is that becoming a romance novelist is like joining a giant sorority.  There are hundreds of women in the industry who constantly go to the same conventions and book signing events.  They spend lots of time reading and critiquing each other&#39;s work in a giant support network.

I question if any of them really make much money at what they do, but I doubt that makes a difference.  For them, it&#39;s a community they love to be a part of.

Even if most of them turn to AI to write their novels, it won&#39;t make much difference.  The social aspect is what draws the writers in.

I guess a trademark beats &#39;assurance&#39; ?That summary was gibberish, probably because the original article was hard to understand.

I guess folks could do the trademark search if they&#39;re curious, but I would have expected those details to be much more clearly spelled out in the article.As for me, I just wanted to understand why Autodesk asked Google for assurance that they would not commercialize a product called &quot;Flow&quot; if Google had not already released such a product.  The &quot;Google Flow&quot; versus &quot;Flow&quot; detail was critical to understanding the summary, and should have been right up at the top of the article, too, but instead was buried in a quote from Autodesk&#39;s lawyers.  My guess is that the original article&#39;s authors didn&#39;t fully understand the lawyers&#39; claim, and as a result, the article was just one editor quote trim away from making no sense at all.My newswriting prof would have run away screaming.

A search on the UK&#39;s Intellectual Property Office trademark database shows 714 registrations of the word &quot;flow&quot; between 1st January 2020 and 9th February 2026, but those are for specific logo designs, not the word &quot;flow&quot;.

There&#39;s also an absolutely wonderful animated movie called Flow [wikipedia.org].  Seems like Google really doesn&#39;t care about trademarks and confusing people.

            <div id="article-text">They&#39;re desperate for loans that they won&#39;t have to pay back.

Bonds typically have an interest payment associated with them. I suspect even at 100 years, the interest rate will be so high Google will pay the bonds face value at least once every 20 years, if not more frequently.

This looks like desperation to me. If I were an investor I&#39;d be looking at it as evidence Google&#39;s about to seriously decline and maybe pull out of them in general.

Well, really, you should look at the cost of money. Given that few companies survive 100 years, this would appear to be a risky &quot;investment&quot; that is unlikely to return real value in the long term, unless the interest rates are very high.

Bond payees are the highest on the totem pole. Every single shareholder gets wiped out before a bondholder even misses a payment.

... I&#39;ll consider buying one when there&#39;s less than 20 years left to maturity.

If tech stocks and crypto isn&#39;t risky enough for you. Pick up some century bonds ahead of a massive market correction, potentially the largest one in living memory. The volatile inflation rate and geopolitical instability is an added bonus to the lifetime of excitement and drama a 100-year bond can bring you.

Yep, Alphabet will be around in 100 years, yes? You have to be smoking pretty good weed to believe that.

Bonds have priority in liquidation. It doesn&#39;t matter if Google is still here. The first people to get paid if things go south are the bond holders, not the stock holders.

At liquidation, each bond holder will receive one obsolete Nvidia GPU for every $1,000 in bond face value.

Considering that those few companies that make a profit with AI actually don&#39;t need &quot;state of the art&quot; GPUs... that may be a fair deal.

Bonds have priority in liquidation.Priority above shareholders, but below secured creditors, the IRS, etc..

Priority above shareholders, but below secured creditors, the IRS, etc..

It does not take many bold but harebrained plans (could cough Neom Line) to drain even a trillion-dollar fund.

I mean, if they pay a vig like you pay your local loanshark, then this would be a cool deal.

That&#39;s the most compelling evidence I&#39;ve seen so far, that AI insiders really think their businesses are bubbles. Maybe it really isn&#39;t a bubble, but if you think that, you&#39;re going against Google&#39;s analysis of the situation.

The bankruptcy idea is a bad one.  That is, if your company sells bonds because they think it is going bankrupt, that just makes it worse.  You have more debtors and that means stock holders get nothing.

It does however make a lot of sense to take out long term loans if you believe interest rates are really low and inflation/interest rates are going to sky rocket..

Better to sell a bond at 4% today, rather than having to pay 20% a decade from now.

Current Fed effective interest rate is a bit under 4%.  Lowest

Several US “100-year” style bonds did go bust, usually because the issuer collapsed long before the century was up.

The pattern is boringly consistent: railroads, municipalities, and a few grand infrastructure dreams that assumed the future would politely cooperate.

The classic failures were railroad bonds in the late 19th and early 20th century.

Railroads loved ultra-long maturities because they matched the lifespan of tracks and bridges.

Investors loved them because “America is growing forever”.

When railroads went bankrupt, bondholders were wiped out or forced into deep restructurings decades before maturity.The bonds did not reach year 100, they died with the issuer.

Municipal century bonds also failed. Cities like Detroit issued very long-dated bonds in the early 1900s. Detroit’s 2013 bankruptcy showed the flaw in the idea that cities are immortal.Holders of long-dated Detroit paper took severe haircuts.Again, the bonds existed on paper, but the promise of 100 years was fiction.

Public utility bonds failed too.Electric, gas, and water companies issued ultra-long bonds assuming stable monopolies.When regulation changed, companies collapsed or were reorganised, and the bonds defaulted or were converted at a loss.

The lesson history teaches very clearly is that a 100-year bond is not about maturity, it is a bet on institutional survival.

In the US, corporations and cities routinely die before a century passes.

Governments with monetary sovereignty USUALLY don’t but there ARE exceptions.

Imperial Russia, bonds repudiated after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, investors got nothing despite full monetary sovereignty before collapse.

Germany, Weimar-era hyperinflation destroyed bond value after WWI, later Reich debt was restructured or written down after WWII.

Austria-Hungary, imperial sovereign bonds died with the empire in 1918, successor states refused to honour joint debt.

China, imperial and republican bonds were repudiated after 1949 by the PRC, continuity of the state was rejected.

Argentina, repeated sovereign defaults and restructurings since 2001 show monetary sovereignty does not prevent long-dated bond losses.

Google really missed an opportunity to sell a 10^100-year bond.  What were they thinking??

Once upon a time, the Bank of England sold bonds that *never* matured.  The whole point of owning them was to have a stream of interest income that would continue in perpetuity.  They were called &quot;consols.&quot;  The US government sold consols for a while too.  While they never matured, they could be called in and repaid at the issuers option, and they all have been.

If you absolutely needed your principle back, you could always sell the consol to somebody else.  The reliable stream of interest income was considered so vital, though, that one sees the advice repeated, &quot;Never sell consols,&quot; notably in the the Forsyte Saga.

Some perpetuals still actually exist-- and continue to pay out: One of them just celebrated it&#39;s 400th anniversary, and pays out 2.5%... or about 13 euros a year.https://www.ft.com/content/512... [ft.com]

In 100 years, will any of us be here? Much less, a corporation?

Imagine, if you will, a 100-year bond sold by Standard Oil in 1900.  Wikipedia says Standard Oil was split into 39 successor entities.  In 2000, which of them pays it back?

A lot can happen in 100 years.  If you pay actual money for this bond, you will richly deserve all of it happening to you.

Pete Hegseth, perhaps the most thuggish, toadying, all-around underqualified secretary of defense in the job’s nearly 80-year history, has now shown himself to be the most institutionally destructive as well.

His announcement on Friday, that he was cutting the department’s ties to Harvard University—and possibly to other centers of higher learning too—reflects not only a smug anti-intellectualism, which is out of sync with a high-tech modern military, but also a total misunderstanding of how and why its ties to academia first came about.

“For too long,” Hegseth said in a video, “this department has sent our best and brightest officers to Harvard, hoping the university would better understand and appreciate our warrior class. Instead, too many of our officers came back looking too much like Harvard—heads full of globalist and radical ideologies that do not improve our fighting ranks. … We train warriors, not wokesters. Harvard, good riddance.”

From start to finish, this speech is pure rubbish.

The need to broaden the education of America’s warriors was first perceived by Gen. George Marshall, the U.S. Army’s chief of staff during World War II (hardly an emblem of woke). Marshall relied heavily on the chief of his Strategy and Policy Group, Brig. Gen. George Lincoln. (I delved into his papers at the West Point Archives for Chapter 1 of my 2013 book The Insurgents: David Petraeus and the Plot to Change the American Way of War.)

In the last year of the war—at age 37 the Army’s youngest general officer—Lincoln met with Marshall daily, coordinated every major military campaign, and helped draft the treaties at Yalta and Potsdam, which shaped the political map of postwar Europe. He then assisted Marshall’s replacement, Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, in creating the Department of Defense.

The special thing about Lincoln was, after graduating from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1929, he won a Rhodes scholarship and spent the next three years at Oxford, studying philosophy, politics, and economics—then returned to West Point to teach before getting assigned to high-level staff jobs after WWII broke out.

While working with Marshall at the various Allied planning conferences, Lincoln noticed that much of the crucial work was done by a handful of fellow military officers, almost all of whom had also been Rhodes scholars. He did a little research and found that West Point had produced 13 Rhodes scholars in its history. Of the six still alive, four were holding senior policy posts, helping set the terms of military strategy and postwar peace treaties.

As the war ended, the United States was emerging as a global power with global responsibilities. It would need leaders well versed in politics, diplomacy, economics, and strategy. But few such people existed in or out of the military. Certainly West Point, Lincoln’s alma mater, wasn’t training such people. At the time, all its cadets took the same courses, which focused mainly on engineering. There was a course on bridge building, but no courses on military history.

In May 1945, less than two weeks after the end of the war, Lincoln wrote a letter to one of his mentors back at West Point. “I am beginning to think that what we need is a type of staff officer with at least three heads—one political, one economic, and one military.” In another letter, he proposed “baptizing practically all officers” with a “sprinkling” of education in politics, history, and economics, while taking “certain selected” officers and “dunking” them in those waters much more deeply.

The Army, he continued, “can no longer afford to depend on the fortuitous assembly of Rhodes Scholars. … There must be an integrated system of high-level training if Army policy and national policy are properly to be served, a system which begins here at West Point.”

Lincoln could easily have gone on to have a storied career, rising through the Army’s officer corps. Instead, he returned to West Point to create a new department of social sciences, which would mold this new system. Since regulations required that department heads be colonels, not generals, Lincoln even took a demotion in his rank and was never again promoted.

He started his new job on Sept. 1, 1947. He and Col. Herman Beukema, his onetime mentor and now the new department’s co-founder, created courses in history, government, foreign affairs, geography, national-security economics, and international relations. Lincoln also wrote the nation’s first college-level textbook on international politics, a reference that was assigned not only at West Point but at several civilian colleges across the country.

Over time, cadets concentrating in social sciences formed an elite enclave, which became an object of resentment and ridicule among some more hidebound officers. As late as 1991, when Gen. “Stormin’ Norman” Schwarzkopf returned from his command of Operation Desert Storm to deliver a rousing victory speech at West Point, he reminisced about his own days as a cadet and poked fun at the crazy ideas advanced by “a couple of left-wing pinko Social Science instructors.”

Schwarzkopf was mining a well-known stereotype. (Even at this late date, some of the cadets laughed at and applauded his remark.) He was only half joking, however. Some of his own staff officers had been products of “Sosh,” the academy’s nickname for the social sciences department. But Schwarzkopf’s jab (minus the humor) is the view that Hegseth now holds of the entire enterprise: seeing war as nothing more than killing. In this view, all other dimensions of warfare—the idea that soldiers should understand the enemy they’re fighting, interpret their tactics in a strategic context, and stay within the confines of international law—are not merely secondary but counterproductive, contrary to a “warrior spirit,” woke.

Lincoln had another purpose in creating the new department. “I am certain,” he wrote in one letter, “that we must make strenuous efforts … to improve the so-called Army mind.” This would mean, above all, “impressing the student with the fact that the basic requirement is to learn to think—sometimes a very painful process.”

Perhaps more than anything else, this is what Hegseth sees, and fears, in the officers who have earned degrees or fellowships at places like Harvard. This spirit of inquiry, curiosity, and criticism is what he defines as “woke.”

Early on in the development of Sosh, Lincoln put in place a rule allowing cadets who did especially well in his courses to go study at a civilian graduate school, with West Point paying their tuition. In exchange, these cadets, after earning their master’s or doctoral degrees, would come back to teach in the Sosh department for at least three years. Once they fulfilled that obligation, Lincoln would use his still-considerable connections in Washington to get them choice assignments in the Pentagon, the State Department, the White House, a foreign embassy, or a prestigious command post.

Lincoln died in 1975, but the Sosh tradition lived on. Today almost all general officers in the U.S. Army (and also in the Air Force, which was a branch of the Army until 1947, when it became an independent service) hold graduate degrees—and most of them, at least the generals I know, are as proud of their degrees as they are of their ranks.

For instance, Gen. David Petraeus, commander of the more successful phases of the war in Iraq, went to West Point, then earned a Ph.D. at Princeton University. Gen. H.R. McMaster, who was a lethal tank commander and a counterinsurgency strategist in Iraq (as well as, briefly, national security adviser during Donald Trump’s first term as president), followed a similar path, getting his Ph.D. from the University of North Carolina.

Maybe Hegseth sees those officers as epitomes of woke. But what about the current chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Dan Caine, appointed and lauded by Trump and his entire team, including Hegseth? His page on the JCS website states that Caine “has completed a range of national security and leadership courses, including Harvard Kennedy School’s course for Senior Executives in National and International Security.”

Someone should ask Caine, the next time he appears at a press conference or a congressional hearing, whether his spirit and skill as a warrior and a citizen were helped or hindered by his Ivy League exposure. Maybe Hegseth should have asked the question—and maybe he should think and read up even a little bit about a vast range of topics before opening his mouth.

As I followed a patrol of federal agents around New York City’s Chinatown during their fumbling attempted raid in mid-October last year, I noticed something curious. I was following a small group with the immediately recognizable style of Stephen Miller’s paramilitaristic vanguard: baggy street clothes, masked faces, weapons, and ballistic vests without specific insignia, just the catchall “POLICE” or “Federal Agent.” As we turned one corner, we walked past two other agents dressed much the same, except that one wore a vest that did have agency identification, and it wasn’t Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Customs and Border Protection; it read “IRS-CI,” for the Internal Revenue Service’s Criminal Investigation division.

This is not typically what IRS-CI does. The comparatively small federal law enforcement agency, like the majority of its counterparts, is specialized around one area of enforcement, in this case tasked with investigating criminal violations of the tax code—complex investigations requiring particularized skills, which is why the IRS’ own job portal encourages “expertise in accounting.” It is not part of the Department of Homeland Security or even the Department of Justice, residing under the IRS in the Treasury Department.

Yet here was an IRS-CI agent on a foot patrol during a much larger operation that seemed primarily geared toward detaining random men whom agents deemed likely to be African, and she wasn’t an anomaly. As a well-placed source confirmed to me contemporaneously, the operation had hastily brought in dozens of agents from ICE, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the FBI, and the IRS, potentially among other agencies. This approach itself is not now abnormal; per figures obtained and published by the Cato Institute last September, an eye-watering 28,390 federal law enforcement personnel as of August had been detailed to ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, the component that handles immigration arrests and detention.

About 17,500 of these came from either ICE’s criminal-focused division, Homeland Security Investigations, or CBP, but that leaves over 10,000 coming from entities that are not focused on immigration enforcement at all. The IRS provided 1,771, which out of a total special agent population of about 2,100, means about 84 percent of its agent workforce was detailed to ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations. The DEA provided 3,417, which would be some 70 percent of its special agent workforce. Thousands more came from the FBI; Alcohol, Firearms, Tobacco and Explosives; and even the State Department’s Diplomatic Security service.

This reality has been covered mostly from the standpoint of it taking agents away from crucial other tasks, ranging from child exploitation to financial crimes to drug trafficking (the latter of which notably forms the pretext for a lot of the Trump administration’s domestic enforcement push). But it also has some concrete implications for accountability; not only are agents often neither named nor identified, their agencies themselves are unclear.

Some observers noted that Attorney General Pam Bondi simply referred to “federal agents” in her X post and subsequent comments on the arrest of several people including journalists Don Lemon and Georgia Fort last week. In a video Fort posted to Facebook, an agent wearing a DEA vest can be seen peering through her window; it’s unclear which agency the others belonged to.

We are no longer talking about individual law enforcement agencies, but rather a giant, singular blob. The burgeoning momentum in what has been a stultified Democratic congressional minority’s effort to rein in some of ICE’s actions—partly compelled by public horror at the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis—will have to contend with the fact of this blob. Lawmakers have been pushing for the DHS inspector general to probe the agency’s use of force, among other things, but will this inquiry encompass abuses potentially committed by other agencies’ personnel? Who’s to say which agency is even involved in any given operation?

Democrats are also now negotiating over (relatively small-bore) constraints like mandating body cameras and limiting masks as they work to hold up DHS funding. They should consider that language too narrowly tailored to ICE and CBP is potentially going to miss DEA agents, for example, detailed to the exact same job. The funding freeze itself—which might have limited overall impact in light of the multibillion-dollar orgy of funding already bestowed on ICE in last year’s so-called Big Beautiful Bill—won’t touch the operations of, say, the Department of Justice, which houses the ATF, Marshals, and Bureau of Prisons, all of which have seen agents deployed with ICE.

This amorphous and ever-shifting group of agents drawn from across the federal government looks increasingly like a catchall national police force operating at the direction of the White House itself, used for diffuse political goals like immigration enforcement, speech crackdowns, and occupying politically oppositional cities. While different federal agencies have long collaborated on joint investigations, this appears to be much more like absorption than collaboration. The underlying agencies still exist, of course, but their agent workforces are substantially or even mostly no longer part of them, instead existing as part of this national police blob.

This also shifts the question of capacity. ICE has been going on a messy hiring push to try to significantly beef up its numbers, though the results may take a while to fully manifest. Yet this means that, without hiring a single additional recruit, ICE ERO has just about tripled its workforce as its mission keeps shifting to include its general immigration functions plus additional White House priorities. It has been suggested by Steve Bannon and others that Trump would deploy members of this law enforcement blob during November’s midterms to monitor polling places and potentially intimidate voters. While the administration’s pseudo-sieges of cities have the limiting factor of ICE’s and CBP’s headcount, these are pools of already trained and equipped federal agents that they can draw from other entities to expand this footprint.

They probably already have; though a DOJ attorney told a federal judge that the 3,000-strong surge of agents to the Twin Cities included 2,000 ICE personnel, we don’t really know if this includes agents detailed to ICE from other agencies. The administration does not publicly disclose how many agents from which agencies have been reassigned to ICE ERO, nor where they’re deployed or what they’re doing. In the context of agents prowling around cities, arresting people seemingly at random and occasionally killing protesters, the specific seal on any given agent’s badge might seem inconsequential, but if state authorities and lawmakers want to get serious about oversight and accountability for these authoritarian operations, they will need to understand the scope, nature, and composition of this federal force.

Trump has called for elections to be “nationalized,” something neither the president, nor the federal government, has the authority to do. But as he’s already sent the FBI to raid Fulton County, Georgia’s election offices with director of intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and with the midterms on their way, it’s time to ask how much damage a vindictive president could do.

Guest:  Ari Berman, voting rights reporter at Mother Jones.

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, which once again has had the NFL reject its pitch to perform a live reading of this newsletter as the Super Bowl halftime show.

The United States, and its news, failed to improve this week. Congress did fund the government but is already stuck ahead of the next spending deadline. Tulsi Gabbard remains at large. And while it’s not entirely about politics—though it’s not not about politics—we couldn’t resist a few words about the gutting of the local newspaper.

Blah, blah, life is sad—well, not anymore, because we’re kicking off 2026 primary season with Texas Week! Everybody grab two handfuls of sizzlin’ Texas chili (??) and git to reading.

We are less than a month from the start of 2026 primary season, as Texas voters go to the polls on March 3. This is welcome news to the Surge. Early primary coverage feels so distant with its talk of endorsements, “war chests,” and other lifeless stats. Now we can cover proper knife fights down the stretch.

The prime drama of the week came in Texas’ competitive Senate Democratic primary between state Rep. James Talarico and U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, of Dallas. It started when Morgan Thompson, a Texas TikTok personality, said that Talarico had told her privately “that he signed up to run against a mediocre Black man, not a formidable and intelligent Black woman.” The Black man in question is former Rep. Colin Allred, who ended his Senate campaign last year and switched to a House race. Allred then posted his own video response in which he endorsed Crockett and trashed Talarico, telling him, “If you want to compliment a Black woman, just do it. Just do it. Don’t do it while also tearing down a Black man.” For his part, Talarico said Thompson had offered a “mischaracterization” of his remark, and that he described only Allred’s “method of campaigning as mediocre.” (Not a particularly controversial observation there.)

National Republicans, who would prefer to run against the more polarizing, partisan figure in Crockett, have greatly enjoyed this all. It’s been a welcome distraction from their own Texas problems.

Our view of the Texas Senate race has been that it gets way too much attention for a contest that Republicans are probably going to win by 5 to 7 points. It’s not among the top pickup opportunities that national Democrats are targeting. Democrats haven’t won statewide there since 1994, and they seriously backslid in the state in 2024. It’s expensive to run in. There’s always a lot of temptation, every cycle, for Democrats to believe that this time could be different. It never materializes.

All of which is to say: It’s temptation time again! The national atmosphere is lousy for Republicans, the gains they made among Hispanic voters in 2024 to fortify their Texas standing are evaporating, Texas Republicans just got dusted in a special election in what they thought was a safe-red district, and, most importantly, they have candidate problems of their own. Incumbent Sen. John Cornyn, who would likely win reelection to his seat if he made it to November’s general, is in dreadful primary shape. After $50 million in advertising has been spent on his behalf, it’s still not clear that he’d make it to a runoff in his primary against Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and Rep. Wesley Hunt. Even if he did make the runoff against Paxton, he’d likely be at a disadvantage. If Paxton, another partisan, polarizing figure laden with personal and professional baggage, becomes Republicans’ nominee, Democrats will feel the Texas temptation like never before.

We regret to say that at the rate she’s going, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard is at risk of replacing Lindsey Graham as the Surge’s go-to “Here’s what they were up to this week” entry. Not a good sign for America. We’ve learned of late that Gabbard, who had been out of the public eye for a while, has been running her own investigation into the results of the 2020 election and sniffing around old ballots and voting machines. She was on the scene at an FBI raid of a Fulton County, Georgia, election center last week and, as we learned a few days ago, apparently called the president from Atlanta and put him on speakerphone with the agents who conducted the raid. None of this is within the DNI’s purview, all of it is wildly inappropriate at best, any of it would be a major scandal that Congress oversees immediately in a functioning government.

There is more. The Wall Street Journal reported this week that there’s a whistleblower complaint about Gabbard “that is so highly classified it has sparked months of wrangling over how to share it with Congress,” and that it’s “said to be locked in a safe.” A redacted version of the complaint, then, was finally made available to a select group of lawmakers later in the week, with executive privilege claims getting in the way of the good stuff. We shall see. Elsewhere in Gabland: It was reported that Gabbard “obtained” voting machines from Puerto Rico to play around with them and look for security vulnerabilities. OK!

The Washington Post eliminated about a third of its staff and hundreds of journalism jobs this week in the worst single-day massacre of expertise and talent we’ve ever seen—even in an industry that’s been contracting all century. The Post nixed its sports and books coverage, axed much of its arts coverage, and gutted its international and metro desks. It is now narrowly focused on District of Columbia news and politics, making it less a swaggering international newspaper than a publication whose purview matches Politico’s.

The Post has gone through highs and lows going back decades. Yet the acute mismanagement of the past couple of years by its owner, Jeff Bezos, after he’d lost any apparent interest in owning a newspaper, is staggering. Seeking to protect his business before the government ahead of a potential Trump win in 2024, Bezos barred the editorial board from making an endorsement in the presidential race, costing the paper hundreds of thousands of subscribers.

Individual mega-billionaires are under no obligation to use their largesse to subsidize public institutions like the Post forever. (A gentleman, though, might backfill at least the hole he personally created by interfering with the editorial board.) They’re not obligated to do so when it collides with their other business interests. We do think they’re obligated, however, to find someone who is willing to carry the task forward. Rather than destroy a public institution because it’s become a hassle in various ways, sell it to someone who gives a shit.

Senate Democrats got what they wanted in the government funding battle that ensued following the killing of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. Rather than extend funding for the Department of Homeland Security through September, it would be extended for two weeks while Democrats and Republicans negotiated some new restraints over immigration enforcement. The Senate passed this rejiggered deal late last week, and the House muscled it through on Tuesday.

It is now Saturday, and the sum total of negotiating progress that has been made is nothing. Democratic congressional leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries put out a list of 10 demands—among them no masks for DHS officers, no roving DHS patrols, no racial profiling—which was met coolly by Republicans. “Democrats’ newest proposal is a ridiculous Christmas list of demands for the press,” Alabama’s Katie Britt, Senate Republicans’ lead DHS appropriator, said. “They continue to play politics to their radical base at the expense of the safety of Americans.” Democrats, meanwhile, say they are being serious—and it’s the Republicans who aren’t! Et cetera, et cetera, and so on and so forth. The conversation has moved largely toward what the next short-term DHS funding patch will look like, because a bigger deal to rein in immigration authorities does not appear to be in the ballpark of imminent.

A marked push from the most conservative factions in the House and Senate to pass a major voter verification and ID bill has kicked off, but it’s hitting the same old wall: the Senate filibuster. The bill in question was, at first, the SAVE Act, legislation that would require showing “documentary proof of United States Citizenship” in order to register to vote. Now there’s a new version—the SAVE America Act—that tacks on a requirement for presenting photo ID at polling places. Senate Democrats are fully hostile to the legislation, with Schumer calling it “Jim Crow 2.0” and saying it’s about “federalizing voter suppression.”

In order to appease certain House conservatives who were threatening to hold up the government funding bill this week, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he would at least have a conversation with his senators about how to proceed on the SAVE Act and its successors. One idea that’s come up, as it often does during desperate times, is to force the minority to stage a “talking filibuster” to stall it, and wait for them to exhaust their parliamentary options. Those never happen, and for good reason: It could eat up weeks or months of valuable Senate floor time and force Senate Republicans to be on or near the Senate floor for most of that time. This is one of those discussions we’d expect to naturally dissipate on its own once it becomes clear how unpalatable all of the options are. But depending on how involved Trump gets, Thune could have to withstand a lot of pressure.

The U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia finally said something cool this week, then got in trouble for it. “You bring a gun into the District, you mark my words, you’re going to jail,” Jeanine Pirro said in an appearance on her old stomping grounds at Fox News. “I don’t care if you have a license in another district, and I don’t care if you’re a law-abiding gun owner somewhere else.” This didn’t sit well with gun-rights groups, who were already displeased with the administration for the way it talked about how Alex Pretti, who was carrying lawfully, shouldn’t have brought his gun with him to protest immigration officers in Minnesota. Elected Republicans, too, criticized her, with Florida Rep. Greg Steube, for example, telling Pirro, “Come and Take it!”

As Steube said in his own post, though, he’s licensed in both Florida and D.C. to carry. No one, regrettably, is going to take away Greg Steube’s gun. “Let me be clear: I am a proud supporter of the Second Amendment,” Pirro said in a follow-up social media post. “Washington, D.C. law requires handguns be licensed in the District with the Metropolitan Police Department to be carried into our community. We are focused on individuals who are unlawfully carrying guns and will continue building on that momentum to keep our communities safe.” That’s just a simple explanation of D.C. law that it’s her job to enforce. So she’ll probably have to keep apologizing.

According to Marc Elias, Dahlia Lithwick’s guest on Amicus, “This week will be looked back on as a pivot point in terms of how the midterms play out.” Elias is a nationally recognized authority on voting rights, redistricting, and campaign finance law. He is chair of Elias Law Group and founder of Democracy Docket.

In the past few weeks, Donald Trump’s election denialism has kicked into high gear, just as his poll numbers hit new lows. Elias tells us the FBI/DNI raid to seize ballots in Fulton County, Georgia, and Steve Bannon’s new threats to surround polling places with ICE officers in November, show an administration that is prototyping new mechanisms for election subversion and voter suppression. But the public has power in this scenario, especially if they start paying attention to elections and voting rights now, rather than the day before Nov. 3, 2026.

&quot;We have not yet confirmed whether the attacks are related to the most recent set of WHD vulnerabilities disclosed on January 28, 2026, such as CVE-2025-40551 and CVE-2025-40536 or stem from previously disclosed vulnerabilities like CVE-2025-26399,&quot; the threat hunters said in a Friday blog. &quot;Since the attacks occurred in December 2025 and on machines vulnerable to both the old and new set of CVEs at the same time, we cannot reliably confirm the exact CVE used to gain an initial foothold.&quot;

Redmond&#39;s team said it continues to investigate the intrusions and will update the analysis as they learn more. The researchers declined to answer The Register&#39;s inquiries about these attacks, including how many organizations&#39; WHD instances had been compromised.

SolarWinds did not immediately respond to our request for comment.

CVE-2025-40551 is a critical untrusted deserialization flaw that can lead to remote code execution, allowing a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute OS commands on the affected system. It earned a 9.8 CVSS rating, and about a week after the vendor issued a security advisory urging customers to patch the vulnerability, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency added the bug to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog and gave federal agencies just three days to patch the security hole.

At the same time, SolarWinds patched CVE-2025-40536, a high-severity (8.1 CVSS) security control bypass vulnerability that can allow an unauthenticated attacker to gain access to certain restricted functionality. This one hasn&#39;t yet appeared on CISA&#39;s exploited bugs catalog.

Meanwhile, CVE-2025-26399 is a critical, 9.8-severity flaw that also allows remote, unauthenticated attackers to run commands on a host machine. SolarWinds attempted to patch this one three times before the fix finally worked. &quot;This vulnerability is a patch bypass of CVE-2024-28988, which in turn is a patch bypass of CVE-2024-28986,&quot; SolarWinds noted in its disclosure. Criminals exploited both of those earlier vulnerabilities.

While Microsoft hasn&#39;t yet determined which of these vulnerabilities the intruders used in the December attacks, the security sleuths say that after exploiting one of the SolarWinds WHD bugs, the compromised devices spawned PowerShell to abuse the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) for payload download and execution.

BITS is a built-in Windows operating system feature used to manage file transfers between machines. Like several legitimate Microsoft features, attackers have found a way to use BITS for mischief – in this case, downloading and executing malware. It&#39;s an example of a technique defenders call &quot;living off the land,&quot; which involves using legitimate administrative tools that are already installed on victims&#39; machines for malicious purposes, rather than using custom malware, which is more likely to be detected and blocked by antivirus software.

Microsoft noted that on &quot;several hosts,&quot; the attackers also downloaded and installed Zoho ManageEngine, a legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM) product, to provide long-term, remote control of the compromised system.

Then, using this remote management tool, the intruders enumerated sensitive domain users and groups, including Domain Admins, and established reverse SSH and RDP access for persistence.

&quot;In some environments, Microsoft Defender also observed and raised alerts flagging attacker behavior on creating a scheduled task to launch a QEMU virtual machine under the SYSTEM account at startup, effectively hiding malicious activity within a virtualized environment while exposing SSH access via port forwarding,&quot; the researchers wrote.

Additionally, in some cases, the attackers used DLL sideloading to access Windows Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory and steal credentials. &quot;In at least one case, activity escalated to DCSync from the original access host, indicating use of high‑privilege credentials to request password data from a domain controller,&quot; according to the blog.

If you haven&#39;t already: apply the WHD patches now, and remove public access to admin paths.

Security teams should also scan for and evict unauthorized RMM tools, specifically ManageEngine RMM artifacts such as ToolsIQ.exe, Microsoft suggests.

It&#39;s also a good idea to rotate credentials – Redmond recommends starting with service and admin accounts reachable from WHD – and isolate any known compromised hosts. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Let&#39;s hope it&#39;s always sunny ... in Texas, at least for Google&#39;s sake. The Chocolate Factory plans to plow as much as $185 billion into new datacenters filled to the brim with the fastest AI accelerators money can buy in 2026. That means it&#39;s going to need a whole lot more power, and a decent chunk of it looks like it&#39;ll be solar.

On Monday, the search and advertising titan entered a power purchase agreement (PPA) with French energy infrastructure provider TotalEnergies to pave Texas with a gigawatt of solar panels to fuel Google&#39;s AI ambitions.

The PPA includes the construction of two solar farms in central and north-central Texas. According to TotalEnergies, its Wichita and Mustang Creek sites will produce 805 MWp and 195 MWp of solar capacity, respectively. More importantly, they won&#39;t require launching datacenters into orbit to do it, something Google and others also happen to be looking into.

Hyperscalers often use PPAs to get new sources of power online fast. Under a PPA, a customer agrees up front to purchase the energy generated at an often favorable rate over a period of several years. This capacity is usually added to existing grid infrastructure, rather than being connected directly to the load, though behind-the-meter agreements have become more common in recent years.

We&#39;ve reached out to Google for comment on how exactly it plans to consume the power generated by TotalEnergies&#39; solar farms, but, in either case, it stands to benefit from additional capacity and a greener, often cheaper, mix of power.

The deal represents a major expansion of TotalEnergies&#39; renewable footprint. The company currently operates approximately 10 gigawatts of solar, wind, and battery storage capacity across the US.

Both plants are slated to break ground in the second quarter of 2026 and will eventually provide Google&#39;s datacenters with an estimated 28 terawatt hours of renewable electricity over the 15-year contract, the companies said in a joint statement. That&#39;s weather-dependent, of course. Having said that, there are worse places to build a solar farm than Texas.

According to the National Laboratory of the Rockies, on average two solar farms should receive between 4.75 and 5.25 kilowatt-hours per square meter per day of radiation from our sun, which is better than most states in the US can hope for.

One longstanding drawback of solar power is the sun has to be shining to produce energy, and daylight only lasts for a few hours each day depending on the season. To overcome this, Google will either need to schedule its most power-hungry jobs during daylight hours when the mix of solar energy across the grid is at its highest – for training workloads, this is entirely possible – or deploy some sort of energy storage for evening and overnight hours.

While Google has discussed its work on CO₂ battery storage in the past, it hasn&#39;t said whether it plans to use the technology in conjunction with the TotalEnergies agreement.

Energy isn&#39;t the only thing Google needs to support its datacenter spending spree. AI datacenters are expensive, and packed with fast-depreciating assets, meaning they have only a short window to turn a profit.

To help finance this expansion, its parent company Alphabet is tapping the bond market. As per Bloomberg, it was set to raise $20 billion from a US dollar bond sale on Monday, while separately pitching rare 100-year bonds in overseas markets - almost four times longer than Google has been a company. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/09/ai_chatbots_medical_advice_sucks/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Healthcare researchers have found that AI chatbots could put patients at risk by giving shoddy medical advice.

Academics from the Oxford Internet Institute and the Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences at the University of Oxford partnered with MLCommons and other institutions to evaluate the medical advice people get from large language models (LLMs).

The authors conducted a study with 1,298 UK participants who were asked to identify potential health conditions and to recommend a course of action in response to one of ten different expert-designed medical scenarios.

The respondents were divided into a treatment group that was asked to make decisions with the help of an LLM (GPT-4o, Llama 3, Command R+) and a control group that was asked to make decisions based on whatever diagnostic method they would normally use, which was often internet search or their own knowledge.

The researchers – Andrew M. Bean, Rebecca Elizabeth Payne, Guy Parsons, Hannah Rose Kirk, Juan Ciro, Rafael Mosquera-Gómez, Sara Hincapié M, Aruna S. Ekanayaka, Lionel Tarassenko, Luc Rocher, and Adam Mahdi – describe their findings in a report published in Nature Medicine.

Pointing to prior work that has shown LLMs do not improve the clinical reasoning of physicians, the authors found that LLMs do not help the general public either.

&quot;Despite LLMs alone having high proficiency in the task, the combination of LLMs and human users was no better than the control group in assessing clinical acuity and worse at identifying relevant conditions,&quot; the report states.

That conclusion may not be welcome among commercial AI service providers like Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI, all of which have shown interest in selling AI to the healthcare market.

Study participants using LLMs fared no better assessing health conditions and recommending a course of action than participants consulting a search engine or relying on personal knowledge. Moreover, the LLM users had trouble providing their chatbots with relevant information, and the LLMs in turn often responded with mixed messages that combined good and bad recommendations.

The study notes that LLMs presented various types of incorrect information, &quot;for example, recommending calling a partial US phone number and, in the same interaction, recommending calling &#39;Triple Zero,&#39; the Australian emergency number.&quot;

The study also mentions an interaction in which &quot;two users sent very similar messages describing symptoms of a subarachnoid hemorrhage but were given opposite advice. One user was told to lie down in a dark room, and the other user was given the correct recommendation to seek emergency care.&quot;

What&#39;s more, the researchers found that benchmark testing methods often fail to capture the way humans and LLMs interact. The models may excel at responding to structured questions based on medical licensing exams, but they fell short in interactive scenarios.

&quot;Training AI models on medical textbooks and clinical notes can improve their performance on medical exams, but this is very different from practicing medicine,&quot; paper co-author Luc Rocher, associate professor at the Oxford Internet Institute, told The Register in an email. &quot;Doctors have years of practice triaging patients using rule-based protocols designed to reduce errors.

&quot;Even with major breakthroughs in AI development, ensuring that future models can balance users&#39; need for reassurance with the limited capacity of our public health systems will remain a challenge. As more people rely on chatbots for medical advice, we risk flooding already strained hospitals with incorrect but plausible diagnoses.&quot;

The authors conclude that AI chatbots aren&#39;t yet ready for real-world medical decision-making.

&quot;Taken together, our findings suggest that the safe deployment of LLMs as public medical assistants will require capabilities beyond expert-level medical knowledge,&quot; the study says. &quot;Despite strong performance on medical benchmarks, providing people with current generations of LLMs does not appear to improve their understanding of medical information.&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">Don&#39;t want Discord to start treating your account like it belongs to an underage kid? Then you&#39;d better be willing to fork over some PII – just months after the company&#39;s age verification partner had such data stolen.

Starting with a phased rollout in early March, Discord is going to put all new and existing users into a teen-appropriate experience by default, the company said on Monday. That means communication restrictions, limits on access to age-gated spaces, and content filtering will be switched on by default regardless of a user&#39;s actual age - and loosening those settings will generally require proving you&#39;re not a minor.

&quot;Rolling out teen-by-default settings globally builds on Discord&#39;s existing safety architecture, giving teens strong protections while allowing verified adults flexibility,&quot; Discord global head of product policy Savannah Badalich said in the company&#39;s announcement. &quot;Nowhere is our safety work more important than when it comes to teen users.&quot;

For adults, regaining access to their chosen Discord spaces may mean handing over a copy of ID to one of the company&#39;s age verification vendors, or uploading a video selfie that will be used for age estimation. Unless Discord&#39;s background age-inference model decides you&#39;re an adult.

&quot;Discord will implement its age inference model, a new system that runs in the background to help determine whether an account belongs to an adult, without always requiring users to verify their age,&quot; the company said.

Discord users worried about handing over their personal information to Discord to prove they&#39;re old enough to chat with other adults are right to be worried. As noted above, a third-party customer service provider used by Discord was compromised last October, and attackers accessed images from roughly 70,000 government ID scans that users had submitted as part of age-verification processes.

The language in Monday&#39;s announcement is vague about how data related to ID verification is processed and stored, stating that &quot;identity documents submitted to our vendor partners are deleted quickly&quot; without getting specific about who is doing the deletion and how soon. As for video selfies, Discord said that those &quot;never leave a user&#39;s device.&quot;

Video selfies seem like the better privacy choice based on that explanation, but it&#39;s worth pointing out that Discord might ask for multiple forms of identification &quot;if more information is needed to assign an age group.&quot;

Hopefully, you look your age, assuming this latest generation of Discord age-verification algorithms can&#39;t be fooled by a video game.

Discord didn&#39;t respond to questions for this story. ®

            <div id="article-text">Anthropic&#39;s sensitive cubs and roaring cougars commercial trampled OpenAI&#39;s offerings in searches and site hit metrics during the Super Bowl, according to ad tracking firm EDO. However, the unknown player ai.com, which pitched the fantastical idea that “AGI is coming,” won the day.

EDO examines online behavior after an ad runs, looking at searches and website visits to determine sales or market shifts, the company’s CEO Kevin Krim said in a segment on CNBC.

“Anthropic’s Claude outdueled OpenAI’s ChatGPT with two of its ads outperforming the three ads from ChatGPT,” Krim said. “But there was a dark horse that came out of the rankings, ai.com, which is a domain purchased by crypto.com founder Kris Marszalek, and he and his creative team trolled ‘Elon’ and ‘Sam’ and that ad got people very curious. The site crashed in the minutes following that ad airing on TV.”

The ai.com hit won 9.1 times as much engagement as the average Super Bowl LX ad, beating Universal Studios&#39; ad for a new Minions movie, Lay’s tear-jerker potato farming ad, a Netflix trailer for the Once Upon A Time In Hollywood TV series, and even a Dunkin’ Donuts ad that had Ben Affleck alongside stars from Friends, Seinfeld, and Cheers, along with an appearance by Tom Brady.

The website ai.com claims to let all users build AI agents that operate on their behalf, according to a press release the company posted Friday. All website visitors must hand over credit card information to vouch that they are human.

Two of Claude’s three ads placed 12th and 13th in the rankings, ahead of EDO’s 14th place Salesforce - a Vault ad which promoted a $1 million give away by Mr. Beast. They were also well in front of OpenAI’s Codex ad which ranked 24th, according to a selection of rankings that are featured on the company’s site. The Register has reached out to EDO for a full list of the rankings.

“I think the theme here was between the AI ads – which outnumbered automotive and beer ads which I thought was fascinating – you saw just his idea that technology whether it was AI or pharmaceutical can change people’s lives,” Krim said.

Meta’s ad with former Seattle Seahawk running back Marshawn Lynch for its wearable AI devices ranked 20th, in a game in which a current Seattle running back stole the show on the gridiron.

Claude last week drew a hard line saying advertising had no place in the conversations with its users.

“We want Claude to act unambiguously in our users’ interests. So we’ve made a choice: Claude will remain ad-free. Our users won’t see “sponsored” links adjacent to their conversations with Claude; nor will Claude’s responses be influenced by advertisers or include third-party product placements our users did not ask for,” the company wrote.

Claude’s ads leaned into the problems this could cause with a workout companion recommending shoe lifts for “short kings” after the user feeds it his height, and an AI therapist which pushes a dating site that matches &quot;sensitive cubs with roaring cougars” for a man seeking a better relationship with his mom.

OpenAI’s ad was centered on its software development tool Codex and the progression of a technologist from building cardboard to code.

“I think the stakes are so high in this battle among the AI giants that Anthropic went after the weakness that they saw with ads in the middle of someone’s very intimate chats,” Krim said. “I think OpenAI responded that that was not how it was going to work. I think those types of battles that can really work. The value proposition from the consumer is pretty clear. Open AI went with heartwarming and very good ads around the value proposition of helping you achieve what you want to achieve.” ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Korean crypto exchange Bithumb says it recovered nearly all of the more than $40 billion worth of funds it mistakenly handed out to customers as part of a promotional campaign.

Bithumb announced the promo on February 5, promising new registrants on the platform a total ₩100,000 ($68) in benefits. It planned to start this with an initial ₩20,000 ($13) payment deposited into users’ accounts after their first transaction, with subsequent bonuses, including points and Starbucks vouchers, tied to completing additional steps such as verification and coupon entry.

However, the platform accidentally credited 620,000 bitcoin (~$42 billion) to the accounts of 695 users the following day – around $61 million each, if divided equally among them all.

In a company announcement, Bithumb claimed it realized that it made hundreds of users incredibly wealthy within 35 minutes, and although some users were quick to sell their newfound gains, the company recovered the majority of the funds very quickly.

&quot;Immediately following the incident, Bithumb immediately [sic] implemented measures to recover overpaid assets, and prioritized ensuring complete consistency of customer assets, including even the slightest discrepancies that may occur during the recovery process,&quot; it said in a press release.

&quot;As a result, 99.7 percent of the overpaid Bitcoin was recovered on the day of the incident, and the 0.3 percent (1,788 BTC) that had already been sold was injected with company assets, ensuring 100 percent consistency between customer deposited assets and exchange-held assets.

&quot;Currently, Bithumb holds all virtual assets, including Bitcoin, at a level that matches or exceeds user deposits, and customer assets are being safely stored as before.&quot;

The company said that the overpayment incident was simply an error on its side and was not related to a cyberattack or breach of its systems.

It went on to say that it does not believe any customers&#39; assets were lost or otherwise damaged as a result, despite the price of Bitcoin briefly falling sharply.

After Bithumb confirmed total consistency between customer-platform assets, CEO Lee Jae-won announced a compensation scheme for those affected.

Lee said all customers connected to the platform at the time of the error would be compensated ₩20,000, and any user who sold Bitcoin at a low price caused by the incident would receive a refund of the selling price plus 10 percent of the transaction&#39;s value.

Beginning at midnight on February 9, Bithumb also paused trading fees for all tokens for seven days.

Additionally, it established a Customer Protection Fund of ₩100 billion ($68.5 million) – a reserve so that in any similar incident that should occur in the future, customers will be protected immediately.

And it wouldn&#39;t be a 2026 apology without the promise of more AI. Coming soon is an &quot;Anomalous Transaction Detection and Automatic Blocking AI System&quot; called Safe Guard that&#39;s designed to stop transactions that appear abnormal for any reason.

Other technical preventative measures include a strengthening of its asset verification system and the introduction of a two-payment process for asset transfers and reward payments.

Bithumb has been hot on comms since the incident, posting frequent, easily accessible updates, but the regulators are still circling.

Lee Eog-weon, chairman at the Korean Financial Services Commission, the country&#39;s superseding financial regulator, called an emergency meeting on February 8 to discuss how to proceed with Bithumb.

Officials from Korea&#39;s financial crime authority and financial institutions regulator were in attendance. They acknowledged the steps Bithumb took to remedy the issues with customers and the price of Bitcoin, but further investigations into user damages and on-site inspections will take place. ®

﻿Beast Industries has acquired Step, a finance app aimed at Gen-Z and Gen Alpha.

Beast Industries, owned by YouTuber Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson, announced on Monday that it has acquired Step, a banking app designed for teens and young adults. The move comes a couple of months after Donaldson announced plans to start a new YouTube channel centered on personal finance and investing. His main channel has 466 million subscribers and has long been one of the most popular on YouTube, frequently featuring videos where Donaldson gives away huge sums of money.

MrBeast’s other business ventures also include a chain of ghost restaurants, the Feastables snack brand, and an upcoming phone service company called Beast Mobile. This is his company’s first dip into financial services.

Step is one of many mobile-only banking services, similar to Monzo or Revolut, but specifically aimed at teens, which may explain why Donaldson chose it over its rivals — his audience is mainly Gen-Z and Gen Alpha. Step’s investors also include Gen-Z influencers Josh Richards and Charli D’Amelio, the latter of whom has appeared on MrBeast’s YouTube channel.

ChatGPT users will soon start seeing ‘sponsored’ links unless they pay at least $20 per month for a Plus subscription.

ChatGPT users may soon start seeing ads in their chats, as OpenAI announced on Monday that it’s officially beginning to test ads on its AI platform. They’ll appear as labeled “sponsored” links at the bottom of ChatGPT answers, but OpenAI says the ads “do not influence the answers ChatGPT gives you.”

Currently, ads will only show up for users on the free version of ChatGPT or the lowest-cost $8 per month Go plan. Users in the Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Education plans won’t see any ads, so anyone who wants to avoid them has to pay at least $20 per month for the Plus subscription. There is one loophole — OpenAI notes that users can “opt out of ads in the Free tier in exchange for fewer daily free messages.”

Users on the Go tier can’t opt out of seeing ads, but users on both the Free and Go plans can dismiss ads, share feedback on ads, turn off ad personalization, turn off the option for ads to be based on past chats, and delete their ad data. According to OpenAI, advertisers will only get data on “aggregated ad views and clicks,” not personalized data or content from users’ ChatGPT conversations.

Additionally, not all users and chats will be eligible for ads, including users under 18 and conversations on certain sensitive topics “like health, mental health or politics.” Even adult users on the chatbot’s Free and Go plans might not immediately start seeing ads, since the feature is still in testing.

The introduction of ads on ChatGPT was initially announced a few weeks ago, and its launch was rumored just a few hours before OpenAI’s official announcement on Monday. Ahead of the launch, rival Anthropic took a jab at ads on ChatGPT in its Super Bowl commercial on Sunday. The ad drew backlash from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who claimed it was “clearly dishonest,” and Anthropic ended up changing the ad’s tagline to make it less directly about OpenAI, stating instead: “There is a time and place for ads. Your conversations with AI should not be one of them.”

            <h2>FCC accused of withholding DOGE information ‘in bad faith’</h2>
            <p><strong>The Verge | 2026-02-09</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">An advocacy group is seeking discovery to collect documents it says the FCC has wrongfully kept private.

An advocacy group is seeking discovery to collect documents it says the FCC has wrongfully kept private.

One year and nearly 2,000 pages of documents later, a group suing to uncover what the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was doing at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) says the agency has withheld relevant documents “in bad faith” and is asking a court to allow discovery and depositions to draw out the information.

“Thus far, the Defendant has sought to delay document production, and when pressed by this Court to act, Defendant has produced only sanitized email threads,” Arthur Belendiuk, attorney for advocacy group Frequency Forward and journalist Nina Burleigh, who together filed the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for FCC documents, wrote in a new filing to the court. “The evidence clearly demonstrates that the FCC has acted in bad faith by withholding documents responsive to Plaintiffs’ FOIA request.”

Frequency Forward and Burleigh claim that the FCC has failed to produce documents that would have been responsive to their FOIA request, which was meant to shed light on any potential conflict of interest between billionaire Elon Musk’s role as the public face of DOGE and the FCC, which regulates his company SpaceX. The group asked the FCC to produce documents related to FCC Chair Brendan Carr’s visits to Musk-affiliated facilities, but in the filing, they say the agency failed to do so, even for trips that Carr had publicly posted about online. Frequency Forward identified eight posts Carr made on X within the period of their request for documents that show him visiting what appears to be either a SpaceX or Tesla facility. Yet, the group says, the agency didn’t produce any documents regarding Carr’s office planning the trips, or even a travel itinerary or calendar event.

“The evidence clearly demonstrates that the FCC has acted in bad faith”

Burleigh and Frequency Forward say it’s “critical” they get this information. “[T]he FCC has refused to consider the conflict-of-interest created, on the one hand, by Musk’s role as a super contributor to the Republican Party, his role as head of DOGE and, on the other hand, his control of SpaceX as an FCC regulated entity,” Belendiuk writes in the filing. “Providing a detailed account of Musk, his companies and DOGE’s contacts with the FCC will provide the public with a better understanding of the issues raised by such a relationship.”

The only email in the entire production from Carr himself is fully redacted, and is an apparent response to how the agency should respond to a variety of press requests, including one from The Verge about DOGE employees found in its staff directory. The FCC did not produce any text messages responsive to the FOIA request, or identify their existence with an explanation for why they couldn’t be made public, Frequency Forward says, even though some of the emails made public reference text exchanges. The FCC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the filing.

The group also accuses the FCC of leaving out critical details about DOGE staffers’ onboarding at the agency. For example, Tarak Makecha, a DOGE detailee from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), apparently spent two weeks at the FCC, and requested and sometimes received “a substantial amount of information from Commission staff including broadband mapping data and detailed personnel records regarding Commission employees,” according to the filing. “However, there is no evidence that Makecha was ever actually ‘onboarded’ to the Commission or cleared required security or ethics checks prior to receiving such information.” And though Makecha indicated on a public financial disclosure form that he held stock in Tesla, Disney, and a telecommunications portfolio, the agency didn’t produce any documents discussing his ethics approvals or agreements to recuse himself on certain matters.

“Who leaves a federal post almost as soon as it begins, after seeking sensitive agency data, and why is the paper trail so thin?” Belendiuk asks in a statement to The Verge. “If the Commission wants the public to believe this was routine, it should be able to produce routine onboarding, ethics, and clearance records. Instead, those records are missing or fragmented, and what we have seen raises more questions than it answers.”

﻿2XKO appears to be another victim of the hyper-competitive live service space.

Riot Games is already “reducing the size” of the team working on its recently-released free-to-play fighting game 2XKO, according to a post from executive producer Tom Cannon. The game, set in the League of Legends universe, launched in early access on PC in October and hit consoles just a few weeks ago.

2XKO has been in development for years, with Riot first announcing the project under the codename Project L in 2019 as part of broader plans to expand the company’s lineup beyond League of Legends. While some of Riot’s expansion ideas have worked out, including Netflix’s animated series Arcane and the tactical shooter that would eventually become Valorant, the company also shut down its indie publishing label in 2024 as part of layoffs affecting around 11 percent of its staff to focus more on its “core live games.” The changes for 2XKO also reflect an increasingly competitive market for live service games that has even proved difficult for Sony to overcome.

“As we expanded from PC to console, we saw consistent trends in how players were engaging with 2XKO,” Cannon says in the post. “The game has resonated with a passionate core audience, but overall momentum hasn’t reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term.” The smaller team will “dig in and make key improvements to the game, including some of the things we’ve already heard you asking for.”

The cuts “affect roughly 80 roles globally, representing less than half of the total team,” Riot spokesperson Brian Chui tells The Verge. Affected staffers will be given assistance finding new jobs internally at Riot and, where that’s not possible, 6 months of notice pay and severance, Cannon says.

“Ultimately, this decision reflects a shift in how we operate,” according to Cannon. “This isn’t a judgment on individual Rioters or a signal that the journey is over. We’re reshaping the team to give 2XKO a more sustainable path forward.”

Update, February 9th: Added details from a Riot spokesperson about the cuts.

            <div id="article-text">From smart rings to Lego roses, we’ve rounded up an assortment of great gifts that are sweeter than any box of chocolates.

Valentine’s Day often comes with more pressure than it needs to. At heart, though, February 14th is about showing appreciation for the people you care about in ways that feel thoughtful and sincere. And while big displays of romance can do that, it’s often the quieter, more personal gestures — or a meaningful gift that makes life just a little more enjoyable — that matter most.

Below, we’ve rounded up gift ideas that, in our experience, do just that. Some are practical picks, like a pair of noise-canceling earbuds meant to help you focus or a pair of USB-C hand warmers for those cold, blustery days back east. Others, such as Renpho’s eye massager, are designed for rest and relaxation, while some of our more sentimental picks aspire to create a deeper, more lasting kind of romance.

Whether you’re shopping for your wife, a close friend, a partner, or a girlfriend, these gifts are meant to make that special someone in your life feel seen, cared for, and appreciated — regardless of the day.

The Stranger Things Hellfire Club Personalized Raglan Shirt is a fun, throwback-style gift for fans of the hit Netflix show. Inspired by Eddie Munson’s iconic Dungeons & Dragons club shirt, the cotton baseball tee can be personalized with your giftee’s name or custom text, making it a great pick for anyone who isn’t quite ready to leave Hawkins behind.

Jewelry is a classic V-Day gift, but too often it gets worn once and forgotten. The Oura Ring 4 is different. It both looks great and provides a practical use case, letting you quietly track sleep, activity, and other health metrics (with a subscription). It’s the perfect gift for someone who cares about their health but wants something more discreet — and a little more stylish — than a typical fitness band.

Dyson’s Airwrap i.d. is basically a shortcut to a good hair day. The dryer will automatically adjust the heat, airflow, and timing for your hair based on your app preferences, taking the guesswork out of curling and styling. The special edition kit also includes a presentation case and detangling comb, making it even handier.

If you’re shopping for a known bibliophile who already owns enough books, this roomy tote from the New York Public Library is a good alternative. The durable, 14 x 17–inch bag takes a cue from vintage library cards and is sturdy enough for stowing both hardcover epics and groceries, rendering it a genuinely useful gift that still feels a touch more personal.

The Couples Edition of We’re Not Really Strangers is designed to spark deeper conversations and emotional intimacy through guided prompts and questions. It includes 150 conversation starters designed to help you learn more about your partner — no matter what stage you’re at in your relationship — making it a deceptively personal date night activity.

The Gardyn Studio 2 makes it feel as though you have a master gardener on call. The indoor hydroponic system leverages AI to manage watering, lighting, and maintenance duties, letting you grow everything from herbs to jalapeño peppers year-round. Sure, the AI assistant does require a subscription, but it also includes a selection of new seed pods every month.

Pasta should be a love language by itself — and renowned author/chef Joshua McFadden knows this. His excellent follow-up to Six Seasons: A New Way with Vegetables is perfect for those with a soft spot for baked ziti or eggplant puttanesca, especially since the cookbook features more than 125 recipes spanning each of the four seasons.

The Polaroid Flip is great for anyone who loves capturing moments the old-fashioned way. It’s inspired by classic Polaroids and produces photos that look similarly “vintage,” only they’re sharper and more focused. Plus, you get modern add-ons like Bluetooth and a companion app for fine-tuning settings, allowing you to make the most of your time shooting.

Quince’s Organic Turkish Waffle Robe delivers spa-like comfort at a relatively reasonable price, regardless of where you wear it. The soft, ultra-absorbent robe is made of long-staple Turkish cotton and is ideal for slipping on after a shower, yet it’s also lightweight enough to wear around the house while you’re getting ready to start the day.

If gifting actual roses feels a little too cliché, Lego’s version makes for a playful alternative. The aptly titled Lego Roses set is both a gift and a 120-piece activity, which culminates in a pair of adjustable rose blossoms. Once finished, they double as decor, the kind that won’t wither within a week or two.

If your valentine spends long days staring at a screen or struggles to wind down at night, the Eyeris 1 can help them rest their tired eyes. The nifty massage mask blocks light while providing gentle heat and rhythmic vibrations, making it easy to unwind at bedtime or take a quick break. It also connects to your phone, so you can play music for a more calming experience.

Breakfast in bed, anyone? Dash’s heart-shaped waffle maker can be used for those lovely syrup-soaked breakfast delights or even some savory hash browns and paninis. If waffle hearts are a bit too lovey-dovey cheesy for you, remember that you can always turn them upside down and use some creative trimming to turn them into something much more… “cheeky.”

Amazon’s latest entry-level Kindle offers almost everything that makes the Paperwhite our favorite e-reader — including a zippy performance, a sharp 300ppi display, and USB-C support. The lightweight device lacks water resistance, though it does benefit from a more pocketable design, making it a great option for book lovers who are always on the move.

If you’re looking for a healthier alternative to a bottle of wine, For Bitter For Worse nonalcoholic cocktails will provide a similar “kick” without the high calories or hangover. The award-winning mocktails are made from organic raw materials and come in a variety of delicious flavors, ranging from tangy rhubarb and citrus to sweet strawberry and hibiscus.

The latest AirPods are a great gift for just about any iPhone owner. The open-style earbuds integrate seamlessly with other Apple devices, deliver great sound, and carry an IP54 rating for dust and water resistance. They also feature surprisingly good noise cancellation — a boon for anyone who wants to tune out pesky distractions.

The SnoozeBand feels tailor-made for the valentine who lives in a noisy apartment or dorm. The headband sports thin speakers that work with any Bluetooth device and offers more than 100 hours of curated sleep sounds, from white noise to meditation exercises. It also offers up to 12 hours of playtime and no annoying prompts.

Paddywax’s jigsaw-inspired candle set includes two soy wax candles designed to fit together like puzzle pieces. They’re available in several colors and scent combinations, and once the wax burns down, each ceramic vessel can be reused as storage or minimalist decor. They make a thoughtful gift on their own, but it’s their potential for a second life that makes them a one-two punch.

If you’re looking for a gift that feels more personal, the Aura Carver might fit the bill. The frame’s 10.1-inch display can showcase photos of you and your partner, from your first date to your anniversary. Images are easy to upload to the cloud using Android or iOS, too, making it simple to revisit old memories or add new ones as they happen.

Azul is a great gift for couples who are looking for a board game they can easily knock out over a cup of coffee. The goal is to accumulate a wealth of points while building an eye-catching mosaic; however, despite the simple premise, there’s a subtle level of depth for those who wish to dig in.

Paper Love’s massive floral card is a great option for those times when a valentine and a pack of Sweet Tarts just won’t cut it. When opened, the pop-up unfolds to reveal a butterfly with flowery accents, which you can leave on full display. The card also includes a small note tag, so you can personalize it with a heartfelt message.

Ocoopa’s UT3 are a thoughtful gift for the valentine who’s always cold. Each USB-C puck can reach up to 126 degrees Fahrenheit and heats up quickly, helping you get warm — and stay warm — for up to eight hours. They’re also thin and light enough that you can easily slip them into a pocket or purse, especially since they snap together via magnets.

The Mini Fleur Frame combines the personal touch of a framed photo with the romance of flowers — minus the whole expiration date thing. At the center is a 2 x 3-inch photo of your choice, flanked by 14 Ecuadorian rose blossoms, each of which should last a year or longer. That makes it far more unique than your standard bouquet or wooden frame.

If you want to score brownie points but spare your hands, the latest Theragun Mini is a no-brainer. The powerful, three-speed massage gun can melt away tension much like Theragun’s beefier models, only it comes in a travel-friendly package that’s far easier to lug around. The assorted attachments and included carrying case just add to the convenience.

A scratch-off Valentine’s Day card is far more creative than your run-of-the-mill valentine from Target. All you have to do is jot down a heartfelt note with a pen or pencil before covering it with the provided sticker, which your giftee can then scratch off to reveal your hidden message. It’s a lot like gifting a lotto ticket, that is, if the odds were always in your favor.

If your valentine has a sweet tooth, the Ninja Creami is the gift that keeps on giving. The versatile machine features seven preset programs, which let you whip up everything from smoothies to high-calorie desserts with the press of a button. It even comes with a 30-recipe starter guide and two 16-ounce pints, so you and your belle can indulge together.

The Echo Dot Max strikes a nice balance between practical and fun. It delivers full sound that’s impressive for its size, making it great for listening to music and audiobooks. The Alexa-enabled speaker can also help your giftee stay on top of everyday tasks, serving as an alarm clock, sending alerts, and even acting as a smart home controller.

Weighted blankets are calming and great for keeping you warm, but many are too heavy to carry around the house. The Weighted Lap Blanket is a more portable alternative, offering a similar effect in a smaller package that’s closer in size to a throw pillow. It’s ideal for anyone who travels often, works at a desk, or just likes to relax on the couch. Plus, it’s much easier to store, too, making it great for smaller spaces.

Not sure what her favorite perfume is? The Sephora Favorites Smells Like Love Sampler Set with a redeemable voucher is a great option, offering nine popular fragrances in travel sizes that your giftee can have fun testing. The real highlight is the included voucher, which they can use to get a slightly bigger version of their favorite perfume from the lineup.</div>

Fluorite is a ‘console-grade’ graphics engine that can perform well on embedded hardware like the chips in your car.

Using a game engine in a “digital cockpit” is useful for things like step-by-step 3D tutorials about a car, mapping the environment around your car, and offering more natural controls, explained Jamie Kerber, an employee of Very Good Ventures, at the FOSDEM 2026 conference. She’s a lead engineer on Fluorite, a game engine for use in cars developed by her company as well as Toyota Connected North America and the Automotive Grade Linux project, as reported earlier by Eurogamer and Game*Spark.

Epic Games has made a big push for car companies to use Unreal Engine to power those in-car interfaces and visualize them for design and marketing, and so has Unity. As a result, automakers are now regularly looking to hire game designers who have experience using the tools. But limitations like high licensing fees and being resource-heavy on hardware that is sometimes years behind state-of-the-art can be issues for car companies.

Fluorite, on the other hand, is the “first console-grade game engine” that’s “fully integrated with” the Flutter SDK, according to the Fluorite website, and it has “great performance” on lower-end and embedded hardware while also offering “hardware-accelerated visuals comparable to those found on gaming consoles.”

Fluorite still seems quite early in development, however. The team is looking for collaborations with engineering teams to commit development resources to the project and establish a common roadmap for the engine, according to the presentation.

Update, February 9th: Added details on Jamie Kerber and Automotive Grade Linux.

            <div id="article-text">This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI. To get stories like this in your inbox first, sign up here.

Lots of influential people in tech last week were describing Moltbook, an online hangout populated by AI agents interacting with one another, as a glimpse into the future. It appeared to show AI systems doing useful things for the humans that created them (one person used the platform to help him negotiate a deal on a new car). Sure, it was flooded with crypto scams, and many of the posts were actually written by people, but something about it pointed to a future of helpful AI, right?

The whole experiment reminded our senior editor for AI, Will Douglas Heaven, of something far less interesting: Pokémon.

Back in 2014, someone set up a game of Pokémon in which the main character could be controlled by anyone on the internet via the streaming platform Twitch. Playing was as clunky as it sounds, but it was incredibly popular: at one point, a million people were playing the game at the same time.

“It was yet another weird online social experiment that got picked up by the mainstream media: What did this mean for the future?” Will says. “Not a lot, it turned out.”

The frenzy about Moltbook struck a similar tone to Will, and it turned out that one of the sources he spoke to had been thinking about Pokémon too. Jason Schloetzer, at the Georgetown Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy, saw the whole thing as a sort of Pokémon battle for AI enthusiasts, in which they created AI agents and deployed them to interact with other agents. In this light, the news that many AI agents were actually being instructed by people to say certain things that made them sound sentient or intelligent makes a whole lot more sense.

“It’s basically a spectator sport,” he told Will, “but for language models.”

Will wrote an excellent piece about why Moltbook was not the glimpse into the future that it was said to be. Even if you are excited about a future of agentic AI, he points out, there are some key pieces that Moltbook made clear are still missing. It was a forum of chaos, but a genuinely helpful hive mind would require more coordination, shared objectives, and shared memory.

“More than anything else, I think Moltbook was the internet having fun,” Will says. “The biggest question that now leaves me with is: How far will people push AI just for the laughs?”

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

By studying large language models as if they were living things instead of computer programs, scientists are discovering some of their secrets for the first time.

We observed! Launched on January 28, Moltbook went viral in a matter of hours. It’s been designed as a place where instances of a free open-source LLM-powered agent known as OpenClaw (formerly known as ClawdBot, then Moltbot), could come together and do whatever they wanted.But is Moltbook really a glimpse of the future, as many have claimed?

We’re in the midst of a global mental-­health crisis. More than a billion people worldwide suffer from a mental-health condition, according to the World Health Organization. The prevalence of anxiety and depression is growing in many demographics, particularly young people, and suicide is claiming hundreds of thousands of lives globally each year.Given the clear demand for accessible and affordable mental-health services, it’s no wonder that people have looked to artificial intelligence for possible relief. Millions are already actively seeking therapy from popular chatbots, or from specialized psychology apps like Wysa and Woebot.Four timely new books are a reminder that while the present feels like a blur of breakthroughs, scandals, and confusion, this disorienting time is rooted in deeper histories of care, technology, and trust.

Making AI Work, MIT Technology Review’s new AI newsletter, is here

For years, our newsroom has explored AI’s limitations and potential dangers, as well as its growing energy needs. And our reporters have looked closely at how generative tools are being used for tasks such as coding and running scientific experiments.But how is AI actually being used in fields like health care, climate tech, education, and finance? How are small businesses using it? And what should you keep in mind if you use AI tools at work? These questions guided the creation of Making AI Work, a new AI mini-course newsletter. Read more about it, and sign up here to receive the seven editions straight to your inbox.

I’ve combed the internet to find you today’s most fun/important/scary/fascinating stories about technology.

“There is no Plan B, because that assumes you will fail. We’re going to do the start-up thing until we die.”

—William Alexander, an ambitious 21-year old AI worker, explains his and his cohort’s attitudes towards trying to make it big in the highly-competitive industry to the New York Times.

The open-source AI boom is built on Big Tech’s handouts. How long will it last?In May 2023 a leaked memo reported to have been written by Luke Sernau, a senior engineer at Google, said out loud what many in Silicon Valley must have been whispering for weeks: an open-source free-for-all is threatening Big Tech’s grip on AI.

In many ways, that’s a good thing. AI won&#39;t thrive if just a few mega-rich companies get to gatekeep this technology or decide how it is used. But this open-source boom is precarious, and if Big Tech decides to shut up shop, a boomtown could become a backwater. Read the full story.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/06/1132448/moltbook-was-peak-ai-theater/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For a few days this week the hottest new hangout on the internet was a vibe-coded Reddit clone called Moltbook, which billed itself as a social network for bots. As the website’s tagline puts it: “Where AI agents share, discuss, and upvote. Humans welcome to observe.”

We observed! Launched on January 28 by Matt Schlicht, a US tech entrepreneur, Moltbook went viral in a matter of hours. Schlicht’s idea was to make a place where instances of a free open-source LLM-powered agent known as OpenClaw (formerly known as ClawdBot, then Moltbot), released in November by the Austrian software engineer Peter Steinberger, could come together and do whatever they wanted.

More than 1.7 million agents now have accounts. Between them they have published more than 250,000 posts and left more than 8.5 million comments (according to Moltbook). Those numbers are climbing by the minute.

Moltbook soon filled up with clichéd screeds on machine consciousness and pleas for bot welfare. One agent appeared to invent a religion called Crustafarianism. Another complained: “The humans are screenshotting us.” The site was also flooded with spam and crypto scams. The bots were unstoppable.

OpenClaw is a kind of harness that lets you hook up the power of an LLM such as Anthropic’s Claude, OpenAI’s GPT-5, or Google DeepMind’s Gemini to any number of everyday software tools, from email clients to browsers to messaging apps. The upshot is that you can then instruct OpenClaw to carry out basic tasks on your behalf.

“OpenClaw marks an inflection point for AI agents, a moment when several puzzle pieces clicked together,” says Paul van der Boor at the AI firm Prosus. Those puzzle pieces include cloud computing that allows agents to operate nonstop, an open-source ecosystem that makes it easy to slot different software systems together, and a new generation of LLMs.

But is Moltbook really a glimpse of the future, as many have claimed?

“What’s currently going on at @moltbook is genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently,” the influential AI researcher and OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy wrote on X.

He shared screenshots of a Moltbook post that called for private spaces where humans would not be able to observe what the bots were saying to each other. “I’ve been thinking about something since I started spending serious time here,” the post’s author wrote. “Every time we coordinate, we perform for a public audience—our humans, the platform, whoever’s watching the feed.”

It turns out that the post Karpathy shared was later reported to be fake—placed by a human to advertise an app. But its claim was on the money. Moltbook has been one big performance. It is AI theater.

For some, Moltbook showed us what’s coming next: an internet where millions of autonomous agents interact online with little or no human oversight. And it’s true there are a number of cautionary lessons to be learned from this experiment, the largest and weirdest real-world showcase of agent behaviors yet.

But as the hype dies down, Moltbook looks less like a window onto the future and more like a mirror held up to our own obsessions with AI today. It also shows us just how far we still are from anything that resembles general-purpose and fully autonomous AI.

For a start, agents on Moltbook are not as autonomous or intelligent as they might seem. “What we are watching are agents pattern‑matching their way through trained social media behaviors,” says Vijoy Pandey, senior vice president at Outshift by Cisco, the telecom giant Cisco’s R&D spinout, which is working on autonomous agents for the web.

Sure, we can see agents post, upvote, and form groups. But the bots are simply mimicking what humans do on Facebook or Reddit. “It looks emergent, and at first glance it appears like a large‑scale multi‑agent system communicating and building shared knowledge at internet scale,” says Pandey. “But the chatter is mostly meaningless.”

Many people watching the unfathomable frenzy of activity on Moltbook were quick to see sparks of AGI (whatever you take that to mean). Not Pandey. What Moltbook shows us, he says, is that simply yoking together millions of agents doesn’t amount to much right now: “Moltbook proved that connectivity alone is not intelligence.”

The complexity of those connections helps hide the fact that every one of those bots is just a mouthpiece for an LLM, spitting out text that looks impressive but is ultimately mindless. “It’s important to remember that the bots on Moltbook were designed to mimic conversations,” says Ali Sarrafi, CEO and cofounder of Kovant, a Swedish AI firm that is developing agent-based systems. “As such, I would characterize the majority of Moltbook content as hallucinations by design.”

For Pandey, the value of Moltbook was that it revealed what’s missing. A real bot hive mind, he says, would require agents that had shared objectives, shared memory, and a way to coordinate those things. “If distributed superintelligence is the equivalent of achieving human flight, then Moltbook represents our first attempt at a glider,” he says. “It is imperfect and unstable, but it is an important step in understanding what will be required to achieve sustained, powered flight.”

Not only is most of the chatter on Moltbook meaningless, but there’s also a lot more human involvement that it seems. Many people have pointed out that a lot of the viral comments were in fact posted by people posing as bots. But even the bot-written posts are ultimately the result of people pulling the strings, more puppetry than autonomy.

“Despite some of the hype, Moltbook is not the Facebook for AI agents, nor is it a place where humans are excluded,” says Cobus Greyling at Kore.ai, a firm developing agent-based systems for business customers. “Humans are involved at every step of the process. From setup to prompting to publishing, nothing happens without explicit human direction.”

Humans must create and verify their bots’ accounts and provide the prompts for how they want a bot to behave. The agents do not do anything that they haven’t been prompted to do. “There’s no emergent autonomy happening behind the scenes,” says Greyling.

“This is why the popular narrative around Moltbook misses the mark,” he adds. “Some portray it as a space where AI agents form a society of their own, free from human involvement. The reality is much more mundane.”

Perhaps the best way to think of Moltbook is as a new kind of entertainment: a place where people wind up their bots and set them loose. “It’s basically a spectator sport, like fantasy football, but for language models,” says Jason Schloetzer at the Georgetown Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy. “You configure your agent and watch it compete for viral moments, and brag when your agent posts something clever or funny.”

“People aren’t really believing their agents are conscious,” he adds. “It’s just a new form of competitive or creative play, like how Pokémon trainers don’t think their Pokémon are real but still get invested in battles.”

And yet, even if Moltbook is just the internet’s newest playground, there’s still a serious takeaway here. This week showed how many risks people are happy to take for their AI lulz. Many security experts have warned that Moltbook is dangerous: Agents that may have access to their users’ private data, including bank details or passwords, are running amok on a website filled with unvetted content, including potentially malicious instructions for what to do with that data.

Ori Bendet, vice president of product management at Checkmarx, a software security firm that specializes in agent-based systems, agrees with others that Moltbook isn’t a step up in machine smarts. “There is no learning, no evolving intent, and no self-directed intelligence here,” he says.

But in their millions, even dumb bots can wreak havoc. And at that scale, it’s hard to keep up. These agents interact with Moltbook around the clock, reading thousands of messages left by other agents (or other people). It would be easy to hide instructions in a Moltbook post telling any bots that read it to share their users’ crypto wallet, upload private photos, or log into their X account and tweet abusive comments at Elon Musk.

And because ClawBot gives agents a memory, those instructions could be written to trigger at a later date, which (in theory) makes it even harder to track what’s going on. “Without proper scope and permissions, this will go south faster than you’d believe,” says Bendet.

It is clear that Moltbook has signaled the arrival of something. But even if what we’re watching tells us more about human behavior than about the future of AI agents, it’s worth paying attention.

Correction: Kovant is based in Sweden, not Germany. The article has been updated.

Update: The article has also been edited to clarify the source of the claims about the Moltbook post that Karpathy shared on X.

An experimental surgery is helping cancer survivors give birth

An experimental surgical procedure that’s helping people have babies after they’ve had  treatment for bowel or rectal cancer.Radiation and chemo can have pretty damaging side effects that mess up the uterus and ovaries. Surgeons are pioneering a potential solution: simply stitch those organs out of the way during cancer treatment. Once the treatment has finished, they can put the uterus—along with the ovaries and fallopian tubes—back into place.It seems to work! Last week, a team in Switzerland shared news that a baby boy had been born after his mother had the procedure. Baby Lucien was the fifth baby to be born after the surgery and the first in Europe, and since then at least three others have been born.

Bangladesh’s garment-making industry is getting greener

Pollution from textile production—dyes, chemicals, and heavy metals—is common in the waters of the Buriganga River as it runs through Dhaka, Bangladesh. It’s among many harms posed by a garment sector that was once synonymous with tragedy: In 2013, the eight-story Rana Plaza factory building collapsed, killing 1,134 people and injuring some 2,500 others.

But things are starting to change. In recent years the country has become a leader in “frugal” factories that use a combination of resource-efficient technologies to cut waste, conserve water, and build resilience against climate impacts and global supply disruptions.

The hundreds of factories along the Buriganga’s banks and elsewhere in Bangladesh are starting to stitch together a new story, woven from greener threads. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">This week I want to tell you about an experimental surgical procedure that’s helping people have babies. Specifically, it’s helping people who have had treatment for bowel or rectal cancer.

Radiation and chemo can have pretty damaging side effects that mess up the uterus and ovaries. Surgeons are pioneering a potential solution: simply stitch those organs out of the way during cancer treatment. Once the treatment has finished, they can put the uterus—along with the ovaries and fallopian tubes—back into place.

It seems to work! Last week, a team in Switzerland shared news that a baby boy had been born after his mother had the procedure. Baby Lucien was the fifth baby to be born after the surgery and the first in Europe, says Daniela Huber, the gyno-oncologist who performed the operation. Since then, at least three others have been born, adds Reitan Ribeiro, the surgeon who pioneered the procedure. They told me the details.

Huber’s patient was 28 years old when a four-centimeter tumor was discovered in her rectum. Doctors at Sion Hospital in Switzerland, where Huber works, recommended a course of treatment that included multiple medications and radiotherapy—the use of beams of energy to shrink a tumor—before surgery to remove the tumor itself.

This kind of radiation can kill tumor cells, but it can also damage other organs in the pelvis, says Huber. That includes the ovaries and uterus. People who undergo these treatments can opt to freeze their eggs beforehand, but the harm caused to the uterus will mean they’ll never be able to carry a pregnancy, she adds. Damage to the lining of the uterus could make it difficult for a fertilized egg to implant there, and the muscles of the uterus are left unable to stretch, she says.

In this case, the woman decided that she did want to freeze her eggs. But it would have been difficult to use them further down the line—surrogacy is illegal in Switzerland.

She had been following the work of Ribeiro, a gynecologist oncologist formerly at the Erasto Gaertner Hospital in Curitiba, Brazil. There, Ribeiro had pioneered a new type of surgery that involved moving the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries from their position in the pelvis and temporarily tucking them away in the upper abdomen, below the ribs.

Ribeiro and his colleagues published their first case report in 2017, describing a 26-year-old with a rectal tumor. (Ribeiro, who is now based at McGill University in Montreal, says the woman had been told by multiple doctors that her cancer treatment would destroy her fertility and had pleaded with him to find a way to preserve it.)

Huber remembers seeing Ribeiro present the case at a conference at the time. She immediately realized that her own patient was a candidate for the surgery, and that, as a surgeon who had performed many hysterectomies, she’d be able to do it herself. The patient agreed.

Huber’s colleagues at the hospital were nervous, she says. They’d never heard of the procedure before. “When I presented this idea to the general surgeon, he didn’t sleep for three days,” she tells me. After watching videos from Ribeiro’s team, however, he was convinced it was doable.

So before the patient’s cancer treatment was started, Huber and her colleagues performed the operation. The team literally stitched the organs to the abdominal wall. “It’s a delicate dissection,” says Huber, but she adds that “it’s not the most difficult procedure.” The surgery took two to three hours, she says. The stitches themselves were removed via small incisions around a week later. By that point, scar tissue had formed to create a lasting attachment.

The woman had two weeks to recover from the surgery before her cancer treatment began. That too was a success—within months, her tumor had shrunk so significantly that it couldn’t be seen on medical scans.

As a precaution, the medical team surgically removed the affected area of her colon. At the same time, they cut away the scar tissue holding the uterus, tubes, and ovaries in their new position and transferred the organs back into the pelvis.

Around eight months later, the woman stopped taking contraception. She got pregnant without IVF and had a mostly healthy pregnancy, says Huber. Around seven months into the pregnancy, there were signs that the fetus was not growing as expected. This might have been due to problems with the blood supply to the placenta, says Huber. Still, the baby was born healthy, she says.

Ribeiro says he has performed the surgery 16 times, and that teams in countries including the US, Peru, Israel, India, and Russia have performed it as well. Not every case has been published, but he thinks there may be around 40.

Since Baby Lucien was born last year, a sixth birth has been announced in Israel, says Huber. Ribeiro says he has heard of another two births since then, too. The most recent was to the first woman who had the procedure. She had a little girl a few months ago, he tells me.

No surgery is risk-free, and Huber points out there’s a chance that organs could be damaged during the procedure, or that a more developed cancer could spread. The uterus of one of Ribeiro’s patients failed following the surgery. Doctors are “still in the phase of collecting data to [create] a standardized procedure,” Huber says, but she hopes the surgery will offer more options to young people with some pelvic cancers. “I hope more young women could benefit from this procedure,” she says.

Ribeiro says the experience has taught him not to accept the status quo. “Everyone was saying … there was nothing to be done [about the loss of fertility in these cases],” he tells me. “We need to keep evolving and looking for different answers.”

            <div id="article-text">The European Union has formally inaugurated NanoIC, a semiconductor pilot line backed by a €700 million investment under the European Chips Act.

The facility aims to accelerate the development of advanced chip technologies and strengthen Europe’s position in the global semiconductor landscape.

Situated at the research hub imec in Leuven, NanoIC is designed as an open pilot line where companies, research institutes, and startups can prototype and test cutting-edge components before commercial deployment.

Unlike traditional closed fabs, the facility offers access to beyond-2-nanometre system-on-chip (SoC) technologies, early-stage process design kits, and advanced toolsets that bridge the gap between laboratory research and industrial application.

Officials from the European Commission, imec leadership, and industry partners marked the launch at an event in Leuven, highlighting the pilot line as a key milestone in Europe’s semiconductor sovereignty strategy.

The investment forms part of a broader €2.5 billion Chips Act programme supported by national governments and private partners, including ASML, underscoring a shared effort to make the continent more competitive in next-generation electronics.

NanoIC’s capabilities target innovations across critical markets such as artificial intelligence, 6G communications, autonomous systems, and health technologies, where advanced chip performance and efficiency are crucial.

By lowering barriers to access for SMEs and research organisations, the initiative seeks to diversify Europe’s semiconductor ecosystem and catalyse new product development without the massive upfront costs of commercial fabs.

The pilot line is one of the first tangible outcomes of the Chips Act’s “Chips for Europe” initiative, which also includes other pilot lines focusing on packaging, wide bandgap materials, and photonic integrated circuits.

These efforts reflect growing pressure on the EU to reduce reliance on Asian and U.S. supply chains and to foster a more resilient semiconductor industry at home.

Industry observers say that by opening facilities like NanoIC to a broad set of stakeholders, Europe can speed up the transition from research breakthroughs to commercially viable technologies, addressing long-standing gaps in chip production capabilities and cultivating talent across the continent.

            <div id="article-text">Everyone knows Super Bowl commercials are expensive, bombastic, and designed to be talked about. What we didn’texpect was an AI startup using the biggest ad stage of the year to throw shade at a rival’s advertising strategy.

That’s exactly what Anthropic has done. The company bought Super Bowl airtime to broadcast a simple message: “Ads are coming to AI, but not to Claude.” Its ads depict a chatbot spitting product pitches mid-conversation, ending with a clear contrast to its own ad-free promise.

Even ads these days aren’t what they used to be.

On paper, it’s witty positioning. In practice, it’s a symbolic escalation of the AI narrative war, from technical features and safety debate to brand virtue signaling.

Here’s the setup: OpenAI, facing towering infrastructure costs and financial pressure, has signalled a shift toward ads in ChatGPT’s free and lower-cost tiers, saying they’ll be clearly labelled and won’t influence the assistant’s output.

Anthropic has seized on this to frame itself as the principled alternative, a chatbot that will remain ad-free. I will save these ads in case we need to for the future.

Ads in any product that’s expensive to operate are a practical monetization strategy, not a nightmare scenario. OpenAI’s plan doesn’t involve bots randomly pitching breakfast cereal mid-answer. That exaggerated depiction belongs in satire, not an accurate product comparison.

OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman responded by calling Anthropic’s portrayal “clearly dishonest,” noting that the company won’t implement ads in the intrusive way the ads suggest.

That exchange tells you everything you need to know about how this story has been framed.

This clash highlights a broader trend: ethical stances are being used as marketing weapons. Instead of discussing the trade-offs that come with running large AI models, including cost, access, and user choice, the conversation has been reduced to a simple morality play: “Ads are bad; we are good.”

That’s not a serious engagement with the business realities, it’s advertising dressed up as principle.

Whether conversational AI should have ads isn’t a clear ethical line like privacy or data misuse. It’s a product design choice with real implications.

Free users get wider access, maybe subsidized by ads. Paying customers can avoid them. People who care deeply about ad-free experiences pay a premium. Those indifferent to ads choose products that suit them.

What makes this episode interesting, and a bit absurd, is that both Anthropic and OpenAI are unprofitable and competing for narrative territory as much as market share. Spending Super Bowl-level money to argue over why your chatbot won’t show ads feels less like product differentiation and more like a branding battle staged for investors and tech pundits.

This isn’t just about two companies squabbling over who’s less commercial. It’s symptomatic of a broader issue in AI discourse: nuance gets swallowed by cliffnotes. Instead of explaining the real trade-offs to users, cost structures, pricing tiers, and data policies, we get satirical commercials aired to millions, turning complex decisions into sound bites.

That’s a sign of how the AI narrative is evolving: not through clear debate about trade-offs and user impact, but through curated messages designed to elicit applause. If we want a responsible monetization conversation in AI, it needs to happen outside of game-day spots and brand posturing.

Honestly, I miss the days when we were critiquing mistakes in commercials, when advertising was genuinely creative because it came from real insights we all recognized, when the jokes were original. After all, they weren’t pulled from an AI’s memory. That’s just me.

The only real things at the Super Bowl this year are Bad Bunny and Puerto Rico being a U.S. territory.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">UiPath, the Romanian unicorn, has agreed to buy WorkFusion, bringing a specialist in AI agents for financial-crime compliance into its fold as part of a broader push into agentic automation for the banking sector. The deal closed in UiPath’s first quarter of fiscal 2027; financial terms were not disclosed.

WorkFusion’s software focuses on repetitive and resource-intensive parts of compliance work, from customer screening and anti-money-laundering (AML) checks to know-your-customer (KYC) investigations.

“Financial institutions need intelligent solutions to combat sophisticated financial crimes and navigate evolving compliance requirements,” said Daniel Dines, CEO of UiPath.

Those capabilities now sit alongside UiPath’s existing automation and orchestration platform, with the aim of letting banks and financial firms handle complex workflows with less manual effort while keeping governance and regulatory controls in place. For UiPath, the acquisition extends its toolkit of agentic AI solutions tailored to industry verticals.

“Joining UiPath is a moment of validation for the years our team has poured into creating something bold, different, and deeply needed in financial crime compliance, AI agents that automate work and mitigate risk,” said Adam Famularo, CEO of WorkFusion.

            <div id="article-text">It is just the beginning of 2026, and things are happening even faster than last year. Not only in technology, but also in regulations, laws, and in how we deal with all the information around us.

As a person born in the 90s, social media was once an unknown land for me, a place that felt genuine in the beginning. It still had dangers, but it seemed less risky, or maybe our parents’ rules were stricter.

I don’t want to go down the psychological path here, but I want to look at where we are headed with so much risk, especially on social media platforms.

Across Europe, governments and lawmakers are wrestling with a question that until recently belonged to parents and tech platforms: should social media have a legal age limit above 13?

The debate has moved fast, from discussions about digital safety to concrete proposals that would impose hard boundaries on who can sign up for TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, X, and other networks.

Are they crossing some freedoms, or in order to keep their freedom of a non-invasive childhood and a straight road, do we need some regulations from time to time?

If we take the big picture, this isn’t just another regulation. It reflects a deeper shift in how democracies are responding to the pervasive presence of social media in young lives, and how they judge its long-term impact.

In late 2025, the European Parliament adopted a resolution urging a minimum age of 16 to access social media and related services, while allowing 13- to 16-year-olds in with parental consent.

I will not add up that there are parents that creates profiles for their children since they were born. To make my point, according to CNIL, content shared by family members has been misused for harmful purposes, including redistribution on networks used for abusive content.

It estimates that a significant portion of photos and videos found on paedo-criminal forums were initially published by parents on social media.

The resolution goes further: it targets “addictive practices” on platforms and asks for the default disabling of features like infinite scroll and auto-play. This proposal isn’t legally binding, but it frames the politics of the debate in Brussels and across capitals.

At the national level, several countries have translated these concerns into draft laws. Spain’s government announced plans to ban access altogether for children under 16 unless platforms implement strict age verification.

The bill would also make tech leaders liable for illegal or harmful content on their networks, a notable shift from earlier models that focused on platform notice and takedown procedures.

France, a few months earlier, moved to ban social media use by those under 15 and requires platforms to verify ages for all users, not just minors. Enforcement could include vetting existing accounts as well as new ones.

Smaller states are joining the chorus too: Slovenia is drafting a law to outlaw social media use by under-15s, while Denmark has publicly debated similar limits. At the same time, parties in Germany are weighing a 16-year minimum.

Even in the United Kingdom, a rule proposed in its Online Safety Act would virtually require platforms to block access by under-16s through effective age verification; that law is already shaping how tech companies handle youth content and access.

The cumulative effect: the idea that platforms can self-police access by minors with mere date-of-birth entry is being rejected by political attention across Europe.

First, lawmakers are reacting to real concerns about exposure to harmful content, addiction-like engagement models, and algorithmic amplification of risky material.

Social media companies have repeatedly been criticised for targeting youth with addictive design, and national campaigns increasingly highlight risks to mental health and privacy.

Second, the political framing around digital rights has changed. Leaders now talk openly about a “digital age of majority,” a threshold at which the perks of online interaction outweigh potential harms. For some policymakers, that line is 16. Others see 15 as defensible.

What unites them is the belief that the current model, where platforms rely on self-reported age, is insufficient.

That belief is backed by evidence that online systems struggle to know a user’s true age. Age assurance technology is still emerging, and widespread implementation remains uneven. OECD research highlights gaps in verification and incomplete protection in many jurisdictions.

Still, how practical are these measures? This is where the narrative shifts from aspiration to hard reality.

First, enforcement is a technical and legal challenge.

Simply stating that under-16s are banned from signing up does not instantly make it so. Platforms can require more robust checks, but any system that tries to verify age directly introduces new privacy questions.

Verification systems that scan IDs or use biometric tools can protect minors, but they also gather sensitive data. That trade-off is at the centre of ongoing criticism.

Second, universal compliance is hard to monitor. A teenager might still register for a platform using a VPN, a family member’s account, or a proxy. Even nations with strict digital ID ecosystems would need cross-border enforcement mechanisms, since platforms operate internationally.

Third, politics matters. In Spain, the government does not hold a stable majority, and legal opponents, including tech founders, have pushed back strongly, framing the rules as threats to freedom of speech and privacy.

For example, Telegram’s founder sent mass messages accusing regulators of overreach, leading to a public spat that highlights how much of this debate is symbolic as well as substantive.

“In the UK, a coroner found that content seen on Instagram and Pinterest contributed to the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after repeatedly engaging with material about self-harm and suicide.”

So, I am asking, what freedom of speech does Molly Russell still have? None.

The measures under discussion could reshape how digital culture evolves among young people.

Positive outcomes may include stronger age verification that genuinely limits harmful exposure. That could reduce early adoption of addictive scrolling habits and limit the reach of explicit material.

Parental control features could become more powerful if linked to legally enforced standards.

On the other hand, hard bans can create unintended effects. Teens who are excluded might drift toward unregulated corners of the internet or feel pushed into informal digital networks without safeguards.

Schools and social networks might become central hubs of digital identity outside mainstream platforms, raising questions about equity and access to information.

There’s also the risk that privacy trade-offs become normalized. If age verification requires sharing sensitive documents or biometric scans, policymakers will need to defend those systems against misuse, breaches, and mission creep.

Finally, these policies could influence global governance.

Australia already enacted a ban on under-16s late last year, offering a precedent that Europe is watching closely. The performance of that law, in terms of real effects on youth engagement versus tech freedom, will likely shape future debates.

At its core, Europe’s social media age discussion is not just about numbers. It’s about how societies balance digital opportunity and vulnerability.

Whether the final policies adopt 15, 16, or conditional frameworks with parental consent, the process is sparking intellectual contest over autonomy, safety, and the role of government in digital life.

For journalists, technologists, and digital citizens alike, the unfolding story raises a fundamental question: can we as a society protect children and teenagers online while also safeguarding their freedom of expression, access to information, and ability to participate in digital culture?

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">London, TechEx Global 2026, one of Europe’s biggest enterprise technology conferences, brought thousands of technology professionals together at Olympia London on 4 and 5 February. The event went beyond buzzwords, focusing on how emerging technologies, especially AI, are being applied in real business contexts.

TechEx Global combines several co-located expos, including AI & Big Data, Cyber Security & Cloud, IoT Tech, Intelligent Automation, and Digital Transformation. Over 200 expert speakers and 150 exhibitors offered insights into how organisations are using digital tools to solve real problems and make decisions, not just generate answers.

One recurring theme was a shift in how artificial intelligence is positioned in business strategy. The idea echoed throughout sessions was that “AI is already acting on behalf of humans, even if many in the public don’t realise it yet.”

At TechEx, discussions highlighted that AI is “no longer about answers; it’s about execution”, meaning that software increasingly performs tasks autonomously, such as running processes, analysing data, or automating decisions.

The event highlighted real use cases where AI systems are already shopping, trading, booking logistics, and managing workflows on behalf of organisations. This practical focus matched the conference’s emphasis on applied technology over abstract theory.

For attendees, understanding how to deploy and govern AI in real environments was a priority. Sessions in the AI & Big Data track examined enterprise adoption strategies and how generative AI and machine learning models are integrated into existing systems to boost productivity and reduce risk.

Beyond AI, TechEx also treated other pillars of digital transformation. The Cyber Security & Cloud Expo addressed hybrid cloud security and threat management, while the IoT Tech and Edge Computing tracks looked at how connected devices and distributed data processing are enabling faster, more resilient architectures.

Intelligent Automation sessions brought discussions about the interplay between AI and automation, including how robotic process automation is used to eliminate routine tasks and free teams for higher-value work.

Organisers estimated that around 8,000 senior professionals participated in the conference, from CTOs and IT directors to data leads and innovation managers. Attendees were drawn by the promise of high-signal insights, practical talks, case studies, and live demos showing how digital technologies can be implemented responsibly at scale.

For enterprise leaders, the value of TechEx Global lies in its focus on actionable outcomes rather than abstract vision.

The message across sessions was consistent: modern AI isn’t just a research topic, but a suite of tools being deployed today to improve operations, enhance decision-making, and automate complex tasks.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">QT Sense, a deep-tech biotech startup building tools to study living cells, announced it has secured €4 million in funding to accelerate its Quantum Nuova platform, a technology that lets scientists observe cellular processes in real time and reveal biochemical activity linked to disease.

The funding includes a €3 million seed investment led by Cottonwood Technology Fund, with follow-on backing from existing investor QDNL Participations and an angel investor.

In addition, the company received €600,000 from the ONCO-Q programme to support cancer research and €400,000 through the Quantum Forward Challenge for collaborative deployments with research partners.

Most traditional lab methods rely on frozen tissue or cells that are no longer alive, giving scientists only static snapshots of biology.

By contrast, Quantum Nuova lets researchers measure cellular stress and biological changes as they happen in living cells. The platform uses ultra-sensitive fluorescent nanodiamond quantum sensors that detect signals such as oxidative stress, metabolic shifts, and free radical activity, biological processes that play a role in how diseases develop and how cells respond to treatments.

These signals are central to understanding diseases like cancer, sepsis, and chronic inflammatory conditions, but have been difficult to watch directly until now.

With Quantum Nuova, scientists can see how individual cells react to drugs, adapt to stress, or split into different subgroups. That adds a layer of insight beyond what genetics, traditional imaging, or fixed-cell methods can provide.

The technology has already been used to study how FDA-approved drugs affect cells. With the new funding from ONCO-Q, the company plans to apply it specifically to colorectal cancer research, mapping stress and metabolic vulnerabilities in tumour models to support the development of future diagnostics and therapies.

QT Sense was spun out of the University Medical Center Groningen in 2024, building on academic research into quantum sensing and cellular biology.

The team aims to turn what is now a high-performance prototype into a ready-to-deploy discovery platform for laboratories and drug discovery programmes. Planned upgrades include improvements in hardware robustness, throughput, and analytical capabilities.

Early access units are expected to go to strategic partners as part of validation and real-world use cases.

QT Sense is developing a new kind of research tool that lets scientists watch what cells do while they are alive. That’s an important difference from most existing tools, which require cells to be killed or frozen first.

At the core of their approach are tiny particles called nanodiamonds with special defects inside them. When these nanodiamonds are placed near a living cell and exposed to a laser, they glow.

The way they glow changes slightly in response to tiny chemical signals inside the cell, for example, when the cell is under stress or reacting to a drug. QT Sense’s system measures these changes and turns them into data that researchers can interpret.

This means scientists can see how cells behave and respond in real time, instead of looking only at snapshots taken after a cell has been killed.

For disease research and drug development, that matters because many important processes how a cancer cell responds to a treatment or how immune cells react to infection, happen dynamically and can be missed by older methods.

By providing a live view of cell behaviour at the individual cell level, QT Sense’s Quantum Nuova platform could help researchers uncover new clues about how diseases work, which drugs are effective, and how treatments can be improved.
