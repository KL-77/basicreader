            <h2>SpaceX gets FCC permission to launch another 7,500 Starlink satellites</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/spacex-gets-fcc-permission-to-launch-another-7500-starlink-satellites/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">SpaceX today received US permission to launch another 7,500 second-generation Starlink satellites, bringing its total authorization to 15,000 Gen2 satellites including those previously approved.

“Under this grant, SpaceX is authorized to construct, deploy, and operate an additional 7,500 Gen2 Starlink satellites, bringing the total to 15,000 satellites worldwide,” the Federal Communications Commission announced today. “This expansion will enable SpaceX to deliver high-speed, low-latency Internet service globally, including enhanced mobile and supplemental coverage from space.”

The FCC gave SpaceX permission for the first set of 7,500 satellites in December 2022. The agency deferred action on the rest of the second-generation constellation at the time and limited the first batch to certain altitudes, saying it needed to “address concerns about orbital debris and space safety” before approving the full bunch.

The FCC said today’s order allows SpaceX to “upgrade the Gen2 Starlink satellites with advanced form factors and cutting-edge technology,” and “operate across Ku-, Ka-, V-, E-, and W-band frequencies, supporting both Fixed Satellite Service (FSS) and Mobile Satellite Service (MSS).” The FCC said it is waiving “obsolete requirements that prevented overlapping beam coverage and enhanced capacity,” and is letting SpaceX “add new orbital shells at altitudes ranging from 340 km to 485 km, optimizing coverage and performance.”

The news follows SpaceX’s announcement of maneuvers that will lower about 4,400 of the company’s existing satellites from an altitude of 341 miles (550 kilometers) to 298 miles (480 kilometers) during 2026. SpaceX said it is making the change to increase space safety as the lower altitudes have less debris that satellites could collide with.

The 2022 authorization for the first 7,500 satellites didn’t include mobile service, but the FCC decided in November 2024 that SpaceX could use those satellites to provide Supplemental Coverage from Space (SCS) in the US. Starlink’s mobile system provides service to smartphones in areas not covered by terrestrial cellular networks.

T-Mobile is using Starlink in the US, and the satellite operator has partnerships with carriers overseas. With today’s FCC authorization, Starlink will be able to provide both fixed and mobile service from all 15,000 second-generation satellites.

SpaceX also recently struck a $17 billion deal to buy spectrum licenses from EchoStar, which will give it 50 Mhz of mobile spectrum and reduce its reliance on cellular carriers. SpaceX has been leasing 10 MHz of spectrum from T-Mobile to provide supplemental service in the US.

Starlink is separately planning to launch yet another 15,000 satellites that are designed for mobile service. SpaceX asked the FCC to approve this plan in September 2025, saying the “new system will offer a new generation of MSS connectivity, supporting voice, texting, and high-speed data.”

Starlink requests for FCC authorization often face opposition from other satellite firms, and the application for 15,000 more satellites is no exception. Viasat filed a petition to deny the application on Monday this week.

“This proposed expansion of SpaceX’s operating authority would give it an even greater ability and incentive to foreclose other operators from accessing and using limited orbital and spectrum resources on a competitive basis,” Viasat told the FCC. “At the same time, the proposed operations would generate insurmountable interference risks for other spectrum users and the customers they serve, preclude other operators from accessing and using scarce spectral and orbital resources on an equitable basis, undermine and foreclose competition and innovation, and otherwise harm the public.”

Globalstar also filed a petition to deny, and several other satellite operators raised objections. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr has generally been a supporter of SpaceX and Elon Musk, however. Carr alleged that the Biden administration targeted Musk’s companies for “regulatory harassment,” and in his current role as chairman Carr pressured EchoStar into selling the spectrum licenses that SpaceX is now buying.

In today’s press release announcing the latest authorization, Carr said that “the FCC has given SpaceX the green light to deliver unprecedented satellite broadband capabilities, strengthen competition, and help ensure that no community is left behind.”</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/esa-considers-righting-the-wrongs-of-ariane-6-by-turning-it-into-a-franken-rocket/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It took a while, but a consensus has emerged in Europe that the continent’s space industry needs to develop reusable rockets. How to do it and how much to spend on it remain unresolved questions.

Much of the discourse around reusable rockets in Europe has focused on developing a brand new rocket that might eventually replace the Ariane 6, which debuted less than two years ago but still uses the use it and lose it model embraced by the launch industry for most of the Space Age.

The European Space Agency (ESA) is offering money to emerging rocket companies in Europe to prove their small satellite launchers can do the job. ESA is also making money available to incentivize rocket upgrades to haul heavier cargo into orbit. ESA, the European Commission, and national governments are funding rocket hoppers to demonstrate vertical takeoff and vertical landing technologies. While there is significant money behind these efforts, the projects are not unified, and progress has been slow.

Now, there’s a proposal to retrofit the existing Ariane 6 rocket design for partial reuse. ArianeGroup, a 50/50 joint venture between Airbus and Safran, won a contract from the European Space Agency’s Boosters for European Space Transportation (BEST!) initiative in late 2024.

The origins of the Ariane 6 rocket’s design can be traced back to 2014, when Airbus and Safran unveiled the architecture that finally began flying in 2024. The rocket uses an expendable design, with a cryogenic core stage and two or four strap-on solid rocket boosters, depending on the demands of the particular mission.

At the time, SpaceX had already announced plans to recover and reuse its Falcon 9 boosters. SpaceX recovered the first Falcon 9 booster in 2015, then reused one for the first time in 2017. Officials in Europe were betting against SpaceX’s success and lost. Blue Origin joined SpaceX in successfully landing an orbital-class booster last year, and several Chinese companies are close to replicating the achievement.

Bruno Le Maire, the former French finance minister, said in 2021 that the Ariane 6 was a “bad strategic choice.” More recently, in October of last year, the head of ESA said the continent’s space industry must “catch up” with international competitors like SpaceX and develop a reusable launcher “relatively fast.”

In its submission to ESA’s BEST! initiative, ArianeGroup proposes replacing the Ariane 6 rocket’s solid-fueled side boosters with new liquid-fueled boosters. The boosters would be developed by MaiaSpace, a French subsidiary of ArianeGroup working on its own partially reusable small satellite launcher. MaiaSpace and ArianeGroup would convert the Maia rocket’s methane-fueled booster for use on the Ariane 6.

ArianeGroup’s proposal was first reported by European Spaceflight, which said the concept presented to ESA is similar to an ArianeGroup proposal from 2022, when the company described the liquid reusable boosters as a “plug-and-play” alternative to Ariane 6’s solid-fueled boosters, helping reduce operating costs and increase launch rates.

The details of ArianeGroup’s newest proposal have not been published, but the concept was summarized in a paper presented at the European Conference for Aeronautics and Space Sciences in 2025.

Isar Aerospace, a German rocket startup, won a separate BEST! contract from ESA to study a demonstrator for a reusable first stage based on the company’s light-class Spectrum rocket. The Spectrum rocket’s initial design is expendable. Its first test flight last year ended in failure, and Isar is readying the second Spectrum rocket for another launch attempt later this month.

ESA asked ArianeGroup and Isar Aerospace to assess the feasibility of their proposals, develop technology and system development plans, and define plans and costs for a “major flight demonstration.”

MaiaSpace’s rocket won’t launch until 2027, at the earliest, and it’s unlikely any decision to use it as the basis for new Ariane 6 boosters will bear fruit until long after Maia flies on its own. Even if ESA and ArianeGroup take this route, the Ariane 6 rocket would still be predominantly expendable.

It’s infeasible to recover the Ariane 6’s core stage for many reasons. Chief among them is that the main stage burns for more than seven minutes on an Ariane 6 flight, reaching speeds about twice as fast as SpaceX’s Falcon 9 booster achieves during its two-and-a-half minutes of operation during launch. As a result, the booster would have to rid itself of much more energy when it comes back through the atmosphere. The Ariane 6’s core stage also has just a single engine, whereas SpaceX, Blue Origin, and others use multi-engine designs to better control the rocket’s descent and landing.

The Ariane 6’s payload shroud, used to protect satellites during the first few minutes of launch, is also not reusable. The upper stage is single-use, too. This is a hard problem to solve, but companies like SpaceX and Stoke Space are already working on new rockets with recoverable and reusable upper stages.

Swapping out Ariane 6’s solid rocket motors for reusable liquid boosters makes some economic sense for ArianeGroup. The proposal would bring the development and production of the boosters under full control of ArianeGroup and its French subsidiary, cutting Italy’s solid rocket motor developer, Avio, out of the program.

Introducing the liquid-fueled boosters might also be a way for ArianeGroup to rapidly gain experience in landing and reusing rockets. Each Ariane 6 launch would have multiple boosters, likely two or four, so a single Ariane 6 flight would double or quadruple the flight test data available from just a single booster.

But with this proposal, ArianeGroup is still trying to catch up to where the bleeding edge of the launch industry was 10 or 15 years ago, not where SpaceX, Blue Origin, and others are today, and a far cry from where Europe’s competition in rocketry will be by the time any such an Ariane 6 Franken-rocket could ever reach the launch pad.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/measles-continues-raging-in-south-carolina-99-new-cases-since-tuesday/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A measles outbreak in South Carolina that began in October continues to rage, with the state health department reporting Friday that nearly 100 new cases have been identified just in the last three days.

In a regularly scheduled update this afternoon, the health department said 99 cases were identified since Tuesday, bringing the outbreak total to 310 cases. There are currently 200 people in quarantine and nine in isolation. However, the outbreak is expanding so quickly and with so many exposure sites that health officials are struggling to trace cases and identify people at risk.

“An increasing number of public exposure sites are being identified with likely hundreds more people exposed who are not aware they should be in quarantine if they are not immune to measles,” Dr. Linda Bell, state epidemiologist and the health department’s incident commander for the measles outbreak, said in the announcement. “Previous measles transmission studies have shown that one measles case can result in up to 20 new infections among unvaccinated contacts.”

The outbreak is centered in the northwestern corner of the state, with cases concentrated in Spartanburg County. According to state data, in the 2024–2025 school year, only 90 percent of students in the county were fully vaccinated. That’s well below the target of 95 percent vaccination coverage that prevents vaccine-preventable infections from spreading. However, the county-wide vaccination rate likely obscures pockets where vaccination rates are even lower, making the virus more likely to spread.

Measles is considered one of the most infectious diseases known to humans. It spreads through the air and can linger in a room’s airspace for up to two hours after an infected person has been present. In an exposure event, up to 90 percent of people who are unvaccinated will become infected.

The disease usually develops seven to 14 days after an exposure, but it can take up to 21 days (which is the length of quarantine). Once it develops, it’s marked by a high fever and a telltale rash that starts on the head and spreads downward. People are contagious for four days before the rash develops and four days after it appears. Complications can range from ear infections and diarrhea to encephalitis (swelling of the brain), pneumonia, death in up to 3 out of 1,000 children, and, in very rare cases, a fatal neurological condition that can develop seven to 10 years after the acute infection (subacute sclerosing panencephalitis).

Two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is considered 97 percent effective against the virus, and that protection is considered lifelong. Ninety-nine percent of the 310 cases in the South Carolina outbreak are in people who are unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, or have an unknown vaccination status (only 2 people were vaccinated).

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which only has data as of January 6, has tallied three confirmed cases for this year (two in South Carolina and one in North Carolina, linked to the South Carolina outbreak). Since then, South Carolina reported 26 cases on Tuesday and 99 today, totaling 125. North Carolina also reported three additional cases Tuesday, again linked to the South Carolina outbreak. In all, that brings the US tally to at least 131 just nine days into the year.

In 2025, the country recorded 2,144 confirmed cases, the most cases seen since 1991. Three people died, including two otherwise-healthy children. In 2000, the US declared measles eliminated, meaning that it was no longer continuously circulating within the country. With ongoing outbreaks, including the one in South Carolina, the country’s elimination status is at risk.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/01/google-dont-make-bite-sized-content-for-llms-if-you-care-about-search-rank/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Search engine optimization, or SEO, is a big business. While some SEO practices are useful, much of the day-to-day SEO wisdom you see online amounts to superstition. An increasingly popular approach geared toward LLMs called “content chunking” may fall into that category. In the latest installment of Google’s Search Off the Record podcast, John Mueller and Danny Sullivan say that breaking content down into bite-sized chunks for LLMs like Gemini is a bad idea.

You’ve probably seen websites engaging in content chunking and scratched your head, and for good reason—this content isn’t made for you. The idea is that if you split information into smaller paragraphs and sections, it is more likely to be ingested and cited by generative AI bots like Gemini. So you end up with short paragraphs, sometimes with just one or two sentences, and lots of subheds formatted like questions one might ask a chatbot.

According to Sullivan, this is a misconception, and Google doesn’t use such signals to improve ranking. “One of the things I keep seeing over and over in some of the advice and guidance and people are trying to figure out what do we do with the LLMs or whatever, is that turn your content into bite-sized chunks, because LLMs like things that are really bite size, right?” said Sullivan. “So… we don’t want you to do that.”

The conversation, which begins around the podcast’s 18-minute mark, illustrates the folly of jumping on the latest SEO trend. Sullivan notes that he has consulted engineers at Google before making this proclamation. Apparently, the best way to rank on Google continues to be creating content for humans rather than machines. That ensures long-term search exposure, because the behavior of human beings—what they choose to click on—is an important signal for Google.

Google only provides general SEO recommendations, leaving the Internet’s SEO experts to cast bones and read tea leaves to gauge how the search algorithm works. This approach has borne fruit in the past, but not every SEO suggestion is a hit.

The tumultuous current state of the Internet, defined by inconsistent traffic and rapidly expanding use of AI, may entice struggling publishers to try more SEO snake oil like content chunking. When traffic is scarce, people will watch for any uptick and attribute that to the changes they have made. When the opposite happens, well, it’s just a bad day.

The new content superstition may appear to work at first, but at best, that’s an artifact of Google’s current quirks—the company isn’t building LLMs to like split-up content. Sullivan admits there may be “edge cases” where content chunking appears to work.

“Great. That’s what’s happening now, but tomorrow the systems may change,” he said. “You’ve made all these things that you did specifically for a ranking system, not for a human being because you were trying to be more successful in the ranking system, not staying focused on the human being. And then the systems improve, probably the way the systems always try to improve, to reward content written for humans. All that stuff that you did to please this LLM system that may or may not have worked, may not carry through for the long term.”

We probably won’t see chunking go away as long as publishers can point to a positive effect. However, Google seems to feel that chopping up content for LLMs is not a viable future for SEO.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/cloudflare-may-pull-servers-out-of-italy-over-order-that-it-block-pirate-sites/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Italy fined Cloudflare 14.2 million euros for refusing to block access to pirate sites on its 1.1.1.1 DNS service, the country’s communications regulatory agency, AGCOM, announced yesterday. Cloudflare said it will fight the penalty and threatened to remove all of its servers from Italian cities.

AGCOM issued the fine under Italy’s controversial Piracy Shield law, saying that Cloudflare was required to disable DNS resolution of domain names and routing of traffic to IP addresses reported by copyright holders. The law provides for fines up to 2 percent of a company’s annual turnover, and the agency said it applied a fine equal to 1 percent.

The fine relates to a blocking order issued to Cloudflare in February 2025. Cloudflare argued that installing a filter applying to the roughly 200 billion daily requests to its DNS system would significantly increase latency and negatively affect DNS resolution for sites that aren’t subject to the dispute over piracy.

AGCOM rejected Cloudflare’s arguments. The agency said the required blocking would impose no risk on legitimate websites because the targeted IP addresses were all uniquely intended for copyright infringement.

In a September 2025 report on Piracy Shield, researchers said they found “hundreds of legitimate websites unknowingly affected by blocking, unknown operators experiencing service disruption, and illegal streamers continuing to evade enforcement by exploiting the abundance of address space online, leaving behind unusable and polluted address ranges.” This is “a conservative lower-bound estimate,” the report said.

The Piracy Shield law was adopted in 2024. “To effectively tackle live sports piracy, its broad blocking powers aim to block piracy-related domain names and IP addresses within 30 minutes,” TorrentFreak wrote in an article today about the Cloudflare fine.

Cloudflare co-founder and CEO Matthew Prince wrote today that Cloudflare already “had multiple legal challenges pending against the underlying scheme” and will “fight the unjust fine.”

“Yesterday a quasi-judicial body in Italy fined Cloudflare $17 million for failing to go along with their scheme to censor the Internet,” Prince wrote. He continued:

The scheme, which even the EU has called concerning, required us within a mere 30 minutes of notification to fully censor from the Internet any sites a shadowy cabal of European media elites deemed against their interests. No judicial oversight. No due process. No appeal. No transparency. It required us to not just remove customers, but also censor our 1.1.1.1 DNS resolver meaning it risked blacking out any site on the Internet. And it required us not just to censor the content in Italy but globally. In other words, Italy insists a shadowy, European media cabal should be able to dictate what is and is not allowed online.

Prince said he will discuss the matter with US government officials next week and that Cloudflare is “happy to discuss this with Italian government officials who, so far, have been unwilling to engage beyond issuing fines.” In addition to challenging the fine, Prince said Cloudflare is “considering the following actions: 1) discontinuing the millions of dollars in pro bono cyber security services we are providing the upcoming Milano-Cortina Olympics; 2) discontinuing Cloudflare’s Free cyber security services for any Italy-based users; 3) removing all servers from Italian cities; and 4) terminating all plans to build an Italian Cloudflare office or make any investments in the country.”

“Play stupid games, win stupid prizes,” Prince wrote.

AGCOM said today that in the past two years, the Piracy Shield law disabled over 65,000 domain names and about 14,000 IP addresses. Italian authorities also previously ordered Google to block pirate sites at the DNS level.

The Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA), a trade group that represents tech companies including Cloudflare and Google, has criticized the Piracy Shield law. “Italian authorities have included virtual private networks (VPN) and public DNS resolvers in the Piracy Shield, which are services fundamental to the protection of free expression and not appropriate tools for blocking,” the CCIA said in a January 2025 letter to European Commission officials.

The CCIA added that “the Piracy Shield raises a significant number of concerns which can inadvertently affect legitimate online services, primarily due to the potential for overblocking.” The letter said that in October 2024, “Google Drive was mistakenly blocked by the Piracy Shield system, causing a three-hour blackout for all Italian users, while 13.5 percent of users were still blocked at the IP level, and 3 percent were blocked at the DNS level after 12 hours.”

The Italian system “aims to automate the blocking process by allowing rights holders to submit IP addresses directly through the platform, following which ISPs have to implement a block,” the CCIA said. “Verification procedures between submission and blocking are not clear, and indeed seem to be lacking. Additionally, there is a total lack of redress mechanisms for affected parties, in case a wrong domain or IP address is submitted and blocked.”

The 30-minute blocking window “leaves extremely limited time for careful verification by ISPs that the submitted destination is indeed being used for piracy purposes,” the CCIA said. The trade group also questioned the piracy-reporting system’s ties to the organization that runs Italy’s top football league.

“Additionally, the fact that the Piracy Shield platform was developed for AGCOM by a company affiliated with Lega Serie A, which is one of the very few entities authorized to report, raises serious questions about the potential conflict of interest exacerbating the lack of transparency issue,” the letter said.

A trade group for Italian ISPs has argued that the law requires “filtering and tasks that collide with individual freedoms” and is contrary to European legislation that classifies broadband network services as mere conduits that are exempt from liability.

“On the contrary, in Italy criminal liability has been expressly established for ISPs,” Dalia Coffetti, head of regulatory and EU affairs at the Association of Italian Internet Providers, wrote in April 2025. Coffetti argued, “There are better tools to fight piracy, including criminal Law, cooperation between States, and digital solutions that downgrade the quality of the signal broadcast via illegal streaming websites or IPtv. European ISPs are ready to play their part in the battle against piracy, but the solution certainly does not lie in filtering and blocking IP addresses.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Collecting fallen (or “shed”) elk antlers is a popular pastime in elk-heavy places like Montana, but it’s usually a pretty low-tech, on-the-ground affair. That’s why last year’s story about a US Black Hawk helicopter descending from the skies to harvest shed elk antlers on a ranch was such an odd one.

Was it really possible that US military personnel were using multimillion-dollar government aircraft to land on private property in the Crazy Mountains—yes, that’s their actual name—just to grab some antlers valued at a few hundred bucks?

In May 2025, Montana rancher Linda McMullen received a call from a neighbor. “He said, ‘Linda, there’s a green Army helicopter landed on your place, picking up elk antlers,’” McMullen told The New York Times last year. “I said, ‘Are you joking?’ He said, ‘I’m looking at them with binoculars.’”

The local sheriff, who said he was “still trying to figure all this out” at the time, added that this was “the first helicopter I’ve heard of” regarding shed antler collection.

The Adjutant General for the Montana National Guard, J. Peter Hronek, quickly issued a statement on Facebook “regarding unauthorized use of military aircraft.”

In it, Hronek said that he was “aware of an alleged incident involving a Montana Army National Guard helicopter landing on private property without authorization” and that “an internal investigation is underway, and appropriate adverse and/or administrative action will take place if the allegations are determined to be true.” The Black Hawk was apparently on a training flight at the time.

The three servicemen on the chopper were eventually charged in Sweet Grass County Court with trespassing. They all pleaded not guilty. This week, pilot Deni Draper changed his plea to “no contest,” allowing sentencing to go forward without a trial (but without actually admitting guilt).

According to local reporting, prosecutors had evidence that “no trespassing signs were posted on McMullen’s property” and that “Draper admitted to Montana game warden Austin Kassner that he piloted the helicopter and decided to land it.” In addition to the neighbor’s testimony, “helicopter tire indentations and exhaust marks in the grass” were present at the site of the alleged landing.

The judge has accepted the change of plea and hit Draper with a $500 fine—the maximum penalty. So long as Draper stays out of trouble for the next six months, he will avoid further fines and jail time.

As for the antlers themselves, they are currently held by Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks but could go back to McMullen once cases against the other two servicemembers are resolved.

Update: According to a report this week in the Livingston Enterprise, this is not the first time Montana National Guard aircraft have stopped to take antlers.

“By way of a thorough inquiry, we can confirm isolated incidents of collecting antlers (with a military aircraft) have occurred previously,” Lt. Col. Thomas Figarelle of the Montana National Guard told the paper.

Figarelle added that the Guard has now explicitly banned this kind of activity. “(The Montana Army National Guard) issued clear directives no antler collecting of any type is authorized,” he added. “This is misuse of government property inconsistent with our standards. We are not going to tolerate it.”</div>

            <h2>People Who Go Off GLP-1s Are Experiencing a Sudden and Terrible Hunger</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/health-medicine/go-off-glp-1s-sudden-hunger">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist drugs, like the popular weight-loss jabs Wegovy and Ozempic, have proven to be immensely effective. Beyond allowing patients to significantly reduce their weight, they’ve been shown to have a constellation of other health benefits, like lowering the risk of heart disease and staving off diabetic kidney disease, Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s.

But the harsh reality of what happens when monthly injections stop is raising a grim wrinkle: will patients ever be able to stop taking these extremely expensive drugs, or are they signing onto a lifetime habit they won’t be able to break without suffering severe consequences?

A new study led by researchers at the University of Oxford, which reviewed 37 existing weight loss medication studies involving over 9,000 participants, has found that patients who stopped taking GLP-1 weight-loss medications regained weight four times as fast as those who used alternative behavioral programs, like diets and physical activity.

On average, participants returned to their original weight just 1.7 years after stopping the medication. Patients who went off the drugs told the BBC last month that the hunger came roaring back.

“It was like something opened up in my mind and said: ‘Eat everything, go on, you deserve it because you haven’t eaten anything for so long,&#39;” Tanya Hall, who has been on and off GLP-1 injections, told the broadcaster at the time, adding that she felt “completely horrified” by the amount of food she was consuming after just a couple of days.

Worse yet, the Oxford-led research team found that the secondary health benefits of the drugs dissipated as well. They observed that health markers, such as blood pressure and cholesterol, bounced back to original levels within an average of 1.4 years.

“This review found that cessation of [weight management medications] is followed by rapid weight regain and reversal of beneficial effects on cardiometabolic markers,” the researchers wrote. “These findings suggest caution in short-term use of these drugs without a more comprehensive approach to weight management.”

The researchers suggest that the drugs alone don’t form lasting lifestyle changes that persist after you stop taking them.

“This faster regain could be because people using drugs don’t need to consciously practise changing their diet to lose weight, so when they stop taking the medication, they might not have developed the practical strategies that could help them keep it off,” said senior author and Oxford associate professor Dimitrios Koutoukidis in an official statement.

The scientists are now calling for a more careful approach.

“These medicines are transforming obesity treatment and can achieve important weight loss,” said lead author and University of Oxford research scientist Sam West in the statement. “However, our research shows that people tend to regain weight rapidly after stopping — faster than we see with behavioral programs.”

However, that doesn’t mean GLP-1 drugs aren’t still astonishingly effective.

“This isn’t a failing of the medicines — it reflects the nature of obesity as a chronic, relapsing condition,” West added. “It sounds a cautionary note for short-term use without a more comprehensive approach to long-term weight management, and highlights the importance of primary prevention.”

Others advocate for a more holistic prescription model.

“Weight loss drugs can be effective tools for managing weight and type 2 diabetes risk — but this research reinforces that they are not a quick fix,” Diabetes UK research communications lead Faye Riley told The Guardian. “They need to be prescribed appropriately, with tailored wraparound support alongside them, to ensure people can fully benefit and maintain weight loss for as long as possible when they stop taking the medication.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you thought ground-based wind turbines were imposing, wait until you see what Chinese energy company Linyi Yunchuan has cooking.

A video shared earlier today by Chinese journalist Li Zexin captured a massive airborne wind turbine (AWT) dominating the skyline over China’s Sichuan Province.

“New unreal airborne wind turbines that float to harness high-altitude winds are being used in China,” Li wrote on X-formerly-Twitter. “Though already the world’s top, China’s ambitious green energy pace has never decreased.”

“Unreal” is definitely one word for it. The device appears to be a prototype of Linyi Yunchuan’s “Stratospheric Floating Wind Power Systems” (SAWES), an AWT platform designed in partnership with Tsinghua University and the Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, among others, according to a company profile.

Specifically, the Global Times has identified it as the SAWES S2000, reporting that the unit successfully completed a test flight on Monday. It’s said to be the “world’s first megawatt-class high-altitude wind power system designed for urban deployment,” with a maximum power output of about 3 megawatts.

This particular S2000 was only airborne for 30 minutes, generating about 385 kilowatt-hours of electricity and reaching an altitude of around 6,500 feet. Though it wasn’t up for very long, it did connect to the local power grid, according to the GT, a world first for AWTs.

“At its current output level, one hour of operation can generate enough electricity to fully charge approximately 30 top-spec electric vehicles from zero to full,” Dun Tianrui, chief designer of the system, told the publication.

Dun told the GT that the S2000 can easily be transported and stored in shipping containers, and took eight hours to reach full inflation. If they were to coordinate with local gassupply chains to obtain the helium needed — a finite gas in limited supply — Dun said the entire deployment could be shaved down to four or five hours.

Functionally, AWTs are similar to airships, though instead of transporting passengers, they remain relatively static, lifting 12 lightweight turbine-generators into high-altitude wind streams. There, the generators are powered by strong prevailing winds. Electricity is then transmitted down to the ground through a tether, where it’s fed into an electrical substation.

In September, the SAWES team successfully flew an earlier S1500 unit, which has a generator capacity of 1.2 megawatts. That particular blimp is said to be “about the size of a basketball court and as tall as a 13 story building,” according to the South China Morning Post. It was the first turbine of its kind to generate a full megawatt of power, which it achieved during its maiden voyage.

The test deployments come months after as China’s CO2 emissions fell for the first time year over year, driven by green energy sources like wind and solar infrastructure. China is currently the world-leader in solar power and offshore wind energy, so while the massive floating turbines may present an eye-catching image, they certainly come at no surprise.

            <h2>Fentanyl Overdose Deaths Are Now Falling Sharply, and You’ll Never Guess Why</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For many years, the United States has waged a bitter battle against fentanyl.

The staggering number of overdose deaths caused by the drug has been used by Donald Trump’s administration to justify attacking boats in the Caribbean, deploy militarized forces to detain legal citizens, and impose sweeping tariffs — despite having little data to prove that its target countries, including Canada, were actually to blame.

The president went as far as to sign an executive order calling the highly addictive and extremely potent synthetic opiate a “weapon of mass destruction.”

Yet the latest research shows something inconvenient for that narrative: a sharp reduction in fentanyl overdoses that started before Trump took office, almost certainly in response to policy under his predecessor Joe Biden.

As researchers noted in a paper published in the journal Science this week, fatal overdoses from synthetic opioids like fentanyl plummeted after peaking at 76,000 in 2023 in the US, dropping by over a third by the end of 2024. (Full numbers aren’t in yet for 2025, but provisional data from the CDC suggests another double-digit percentage drop.)

The researchers proposed a possible explanation, writing that a “major disruption in the illicit fentanyl trade, possibly tied to Chinese government actions,” may have “translated into sharp reductions in overdose mortality beginning in mid- or late-2023 and continued into 2024 across both the US and Canada.”

In other words, as Axiom reports, diplomatic pressure has proven far more effective than efforts to crack down on drug dealers on the street.

“That is heartening because street-level enforcement can result in large and racially disproportionate increases in incarceration while at the same time there is little evidence that tougher domestic enforcement, either at the street level or at the wholesale level, can make drugs more expensive or make them harder to acquire,” the paper reads.

The researchers used data from the US and Canadian governments, as well as discussions on Reddit, to come to their conclusion. They found that Beijing starting to shut down Chinese companies that were supplying Mexican criminal groups with precursor chemicals to fentanyl in 2023 was associated with the decline in fentanyl deaths.

In other words, a major supply chain disruption, which started long before Trump started his second term, was likely behind the decline.

The US Drug Enforcement Administration also noted in its 2025 National Drug Threat Assessment that Chinese chemical suppliers were “wary of supplying controlled precursors to its international customers, demonstrating an awareness on their part that the government of China is controlling more fentanyl precursors.”

“This demonstrates how influential China can be and how much they can help us — or hurt us,” Keith Humphreys, coauthor and former White House drug policy adviser under president Barack Obama, told the Washington Post.

It’s not a given that the positive trend will continue. For one, CDC data found that there was a small increase in fatal overdoses between January 2024 and January 2025, bucking seventeen months of declines.

University of North Carolina epidemiologist Nabarun Dasgupta suggested there may be a far simpler reason why overdoses dropped: the habits of drug users may have changed, with some choosing to cut back.

“It’s not a straight line between drug supply and overdose deaths because of protective behaviors that have been adopted in between,” he told WaPo.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A stack of major AI ethics lawsuits against Google have finally come to an end.

According to the New York Times, the family of a deceased 14-year-old named Sewell Setzer III has agreed to settle a lawsuit against Google and the AI companion company Character.AI out of court for an undisclosed sum. In a filing submitted on Wednesday, the parties involved said they had agreed “to resolve all claims,” though the exact terms of the agreement haven’t been finalized.

Setzer’s case has dominated headlines, though his was just one of five lawsuits settled with the tech companies this week.

In summer of 2024, Google injected $3 billion into Character.AI, which hosts a virtual library of thousands of chatbot personas and soon became explosively popular with teens. But it quickly became clear that the platform was barely moderated, hosting bots modeled after child predators, school shooters, and eating disorder coaches.

In an even darker twist, Character.AI was soon connected to several youth suicides and a wave of other grisly outcomes for young people.

Following Setzer’s death, for instance, his mother discovered that his last conversation had been with an AI chatbot styled after “Game of Thrones” character Daenerys Targaryen and had revolved around suicide.

In his last messages to the bot, the Character.AI persona generated text asking Setzer to “please come home to me as soon as possible.”

“What if I told you I could come home right now?” Sewell replied. “…please do, my sweet king,” the AI responded. Soon after, Setzer took his own life with his father’s gun.

“I feel like it’s a big experiment,” Setzer’s mother, Megan Garcia, told the NYT at the time, “and my kid was just collateral damage.”

Haley Hinkle, a policy attorney at Fairplay, a nonprofit that works to promote online child safety, told the NYT not to view the settlements as the final word on the issue. “We have only just begun to see the harm that AI will cause to children if it remains unregulated,” Hinkle said.

While we don’t know what the giant tech companies offered Setzer’s family as recompense, their settlement comes a few months after Character.AI moved to ban all minors under 18 from accessing the platform.

The crackdown on minors was a significant step for the platform, since adolescents make up a huge portion of its userbase. As part of the new enforcement regime, Character.AI said it developed a new in-house tool to identify minors based on their conversations with the platform’s chatbot, and had partnered with a third-party company to verify users’ ages based on government IDs.

As far as Google and Character.AI were concerned, it’s likely they were apprehensive about a court case that would potentially expose their internal processes and communications as the bots were developed, giving both companies ample reason to offer a generous out-of-court settlement.

            <div id="article-text">Thinking about dropping those flavorful white sachets of nicotine this resolution season? You might want to reconsider how fast you hit the off ramp.

Zyns — those tiny nicotine pouches that seem to nowinfest every urinal, bar-top, and sidewalk — have captured the hearts and mouths of many who would never consider smoking a cigarette, let alone packing ‘chaw. Since tobacco giant Philip Morris International acquired the Swedish brand for $16 billion in 2022, Zyn consumption among teens and young adults has nearly quadrupled, according to a November study by the CDC Foundation.

As it turns out, it’s much easier to start on the packs than it is to quit, especially if you go cold turkey. A horrifying profile by GQ details writer Rosecrans Baldwin’s effort to go from one 15-pouch can per day to none, virtually overnight. His experience was agonizing.

About four hours after deciding to lay off the nicotine lodes for good, Baldwin wrote that he began to experience dizziness, headaches, intense sweating, a rapid heart rate, clenching jaw, and even rolling hallucinations.

“For several hours, I’d been haunted by yellow-tinted hallucinations, sweeping in and out of my mind like searchlights, which told me I might’ve slipped between worlds,” he explained of his withdrawal experience. “The street was quiet and empty. I knew I shouldn’t stand, let alone go anywhere, in case the situation got worse.”

Little did he know at the time, Baldwin was in the throes of a panic attack, very likely brought about by acute nicotine withdrawal. “I was afraid I’d lost my mind,” he recalled.

In the US, Zyn sells its pouches in strengths varying from 3mg to 6mg. Though cigarettes contain anywhere from 10 to 12mg of nicotine, less than 2mg typically enters the body for each cigarette smoked, since a lot of the smoke drifts away. The absorption rate on nicotine pouches is much higher, as nicotine is delivered straight through the mouth’s mucous membranes and into the blood vessels.

Though Baldwin admits he’s long held a casual relationship with nicotine, he says Zyns took the habit to another level.

“Years went by when I didn’t smoke at all, and there were a few years when I smoked maybe a couple cigarettes a week,” he said. “My Zyn use turbocharged all of that, fostering a dependence I fed unwittingly, with a sachet secreting nicotine into every waking moment for more than a year.”

Baldwin’s first quitting attempt wasn’t successful, as he soon bought a pack of cigarettes and fell back into “nicotine’s grasp.” A while later, though, he decided to try again, this time by winding down his intake steadily over a few months — an effort which he says has finally freed him from the substance once and for all.

            <h2>OpenAI Launches ChatGPT Health, Which Ingests Your Entire Medical Records, But Warns Not to Use It for “Diagnosis or Treatment”</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/chatgpt-health-medical-records-diagnosis">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI chatbots may be explosively popular, but they’re known to dispense some seriously wacky— and potentially dangerous — health advice, in a flood of easily accessible misinformation that has alarmed experts.

Their advent has turned countless users into armchair experts, who often end up relying on obsolete, misattributed, or completely made-up advice.

A recent investigation by The Guardian, for instance, found that Google’s AI Overviews, which accompany most search results pages, doled out plenty of inaccurate health information that could lead to grave health risks if followed.

But seemingly unperturbed by experts’ repeated warnings that AI’s health advice shouldn’t be trusted, OpenAI is doubling down by launching a new feature called ChatGPT Health, which will ingest your medical records to generate responses “more relevant and useful to you.”

Yet despite being “designed in close collaboration with physicians” and built on “strong privacy, security, and data controls,” the feature is “designed to support, not replace, medical care.” In fact, it’s shipping with a ludicrously self-defeating caveat: that the bespoke health feature is “not intended for diagnosis or treatment.”

“ChatGPT Health helps people take a more active role in understanding and managing their health and wellness — while supporting, not replacing, care from clinicians,” the company’s website reads.

In reality, users are certain to use it for exactly the type of health advice that OpenAI is warning against in the fine print, which is likely to bring fresh new embarrassments for the company.

It’ll only be heightening existing problems for the company. As Business Insider reports, ChatGPT is “making amateur lawyers and doctors out of everyone,” to the dismay of legal and medical professionals.

Miami-based medical malpractice attorney Jonathan Freidin told the publication that people will use chatbots like ChatGPT to fill out his firm’s client contact sheet.

“We’re seeing a lot more callers who feel like they have a case because ChatGPT or Gemini told them that the doctors or nurses fell below the standard of care in multiple different ways,” he said. “While that may be true, it doesn’t necessarily translate into a viable case.”

Then there’s the fact that users are willing to surrender medical histories, including highly sensitive and personal information — a decision that OpenAI is now encouraging with ChatGPT Health — despite federal law, like HIPAA, not applying to consumer AI products.

Case in point, billionaire Elon Musk encouraged people last year to upload their medical data to his ChatGPT competitor Grok, leading to a flood of confusion as users received hallucinated diagnoses after sharing their X-rays and PET scans.

Given the AI industry’s track record when it comes to privacy protection and struggles with significant data leaks, all these risks are as pertinent as ever.

“New AI health tools offer the promise of empowering patients and promoting better health outcomes, but health data is some of the most sensitive information people can share and it must be protected,” Center for Democracy and Technology senior counsel Andrew Crawford told the BBC.

“Especially as OpenAI moves to explore advertising as a business model, it’s crucial that separation between this sort of health data and memories that ChatGPT captures from other conversations is airtight,” he added. “Since it’s up to each company to set the rules for how health data is collected, used, shared, and stored, inadequate data protections and policies can put sensitive health information in real danger.”

“ChatGPT is only bound by its own disclosures and promises, so without any meaningful limitation on that, like regulation or a law, ChatGPT can change the terms of its service at any time,” Electronic Privacy Information Center senior counsel Sara Geoghegan told The Record.

Then there are concerns over highly sensitive data, like reproductive health information, being passed on to the police against the user’s wishes.

“How does OpenAI handle [law enforcement] requests?” Crawford told The Record. “Do they just turn over the information? Is the user in any way informed?”

“There’s lots of questions there that I still don’t have great answers to,” he added.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/09/i-met-a-lot-of-weird-robots-at-ces-here-are-the-most-memorable/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">CES has always been a robot extravaganza, and this year’s event saw the announcement of a number of important robotics developments, including the new, production-ready debut of Atlas, the humanoid from Boston Dynamics. Then there were all the robots on the showroom floor, where bots often serve as good marketing for the companies involved. If they don’t always give a totally accurate representation of where commercial deployment is at the moment, they do give visitors a peek at where it might be headed. And, of course, they sure are fun to look at. I spent a decent amount of time perusing the bots on display this week. Here are some of the most memorable ones I encountered.

The movie Marty Supreme just came out a month ago, so I guess it’s only appropriate that there was a ping-pong-playing robot at this year’s convention. The Chinese robotics firm Sharpa had rigged up a full-bodied bot to play some competitive table tennis against one of the firm’s staff. When I stopped by the Sharpa booth, the robot was losing to its human competitor, 5-9, and I would not characterize the game that was occurring as particularly fast-paced. Still, the spectacle of seeing a robot play ping pong was impressive enough on its own, and I’m sure I have known some humans whose paddle skills were basically equivalent to (or slightly worse than) the bot’s. A Sharpa rep told me that the company’s main product is its robotic hand, and that the full-bodied bot had been debuted at CES to demonstrate the hand’s dexterity.

One of the exhibits that drew the largest crowds involved robots from the Chinese company EngineAI, which is developing humanoid robots. The bots, dubbed the T800 (a nod to the Terminator franchise), were in a mock boxing ring and were styled as fighting machines. That said, I never saw any of the bots actually hit each other. Instead, they would sort of shadowbox near each other, never actually making contact. They were also a little unpredictable. One kept walking out of the ring and into the audience, which naturally got a rise out of onlookers. At another point, one of the bots tripped over its own feet and then face-planted on the floor, where it lay for awhile before it decided to get up again. So, not exactly a Mike Tyson situation, but the machines still managed to evoke a spooky kind of humanoid behavior that made for high-quality entertainment. I overheard an observer quip: “That’s too much like Robocop.”

Dancing robots have long been a staple at CES, and this year was no different. This year, the dance-move torch was carried by bots from Unitree, a major Chinese robotics manufacturer that has been scrutinized for potential ties to the Chinese military. Unitree has made a number of impressive announcements about its product base, including a humanoid bot that can supposedly run at speeds of up to 11 mph. I didn’t see any evidence of anything nefarious at Unitree’s booth this week—just a lot of bots that were feeling the groove.

I stopped by the booth for Galbot, another Chinese company that says it is focused on multi-modal large language models and general purpose robotics. Galbot’s booth had been styled to look like a convenience store, and its bot appeared to have been synched with a menu app. A customer would come to the booth, select an item from the menu, and then the bot would go and fetch the selected merch for them. After I chose Sour Patch Kids, the bot dutifully retrieved a box off the shelf for me. According to the company’s website, the robot has been deployed in a number of real-world settings, including as an assistant at Chinese pharmacies.

Creating a machine that can fold laundry has long been one of the core ambitions of the commercial robotics community. The ability to pick up a T-shirt and fold it is considered a fundamental test of automated competence. For that reason, I was fairly impressed by the display over at Dyna Robotics, a firm that develops advanced manipulation models for automated tasks. There, a pair of robotic arms could be seen efficiently folding laundry and placing it in a pile. A Dyna representative told me that the firm had already established partnerships with a number of hotels, gyms, and factories.

One of those businesses, the rep told me, is Monster Laundry, based in Sacramento, California. Monster integrated Dyna’s shirt-folding robot into its operations late last year and now describes itself as the “first laundry center in North America to debut a state-of-the-art robotic folding system from Dyna.”

Dyna also has some impressive backing. It concluded an $120 million Series A fundraising round in September that included funding from Nvidia’s NVentures, as well as from Amazon, LG, Salesforce, and Samsung.

I also stopped by LG’s section of CES to take a look at its new home robot, CLOid. It was cute but was not the fastest bot on the block. You can read my full review of that experience here.

            <h2>Google moonshot spinout SandboxAQ claims an ex-exec is attempting ‘extortion’</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/09/google-moonshot-spinout-sandboxaq-claims-an-ex-exec-is-attempting-extortion/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A former SandboxAQ executive filed a wrongful termination suit last month filled with such scandalous allegations against the company’s famed CEO, Jack Hidary, that the plaintiff himself redacted the most salacious details.

On Friday, the company’s lawyers filed a blistering response, calling the former employee a “serial liar” and stating his lawsuit “asserts false claims for improper and extortionate purposes.”

Even the visible portions of the lawsuit — which TechCrunch has obtained — contain eyebrow-raising allegations, should a court find them valid. (A copy of the lawsuit is available here.)

The case offers a rare inside look at how employee lawsuits can become a public airing of dirty laundry from otherwise opaque internal happenings, thanks to the ubiquitous private arbitration clauses in Silicon Valley employee agreements.

The suit was filed by Robert Bender in mid-December. Bender worked as Chief of Staff to Hidary from August 2024 through July 2025, the complaint states. He contends in his suit that he was wrongfully terminated after raising concerns about a number of alleged incidents, some of which, he said, involved “sexual encounters” and others, he claims, that involved misleading financial information presented to investors.

For its part, SandboxAQ vehemently denies the allegations. The company’s lawyer Orin Snyder, a well-known partner at white shoe law firm Gibson Dunn, tells TechCrunch: “This case is a complete fabrication. We look forward to debunking these baseless allegations and exposing the lawsuit — as detailed in our answer — for what it is — an opportunistic and extortionate abuse of the judicial process.”

What makes the case particularly notable is the number of Valley heavy hitters involved in SandboxAQ. The company is an AI quantum computing startup that began as a moonshot unit of Google parent company Alphabet, led at Google by Hidary. Hidary is also well-known in Silicon Valley as a longtime X Prize board member.

SandboxAQ was spun out of Alphabet into an independent company in March 2022 with Hidary as CEO and soon attracted big-name investors, including billionaire and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, who invested and became the startup’s chairman. Other billionaire investors include Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, venture capitalist Jim Breyer, and Bridgewater hedge fund founder Ray Dalio.

Bender’s attorneys say in another court document that the redacted sections “describe sexual encounters and the physical condition of non-party individuals observed by Plaintiff during business travel.” In other words, the alleged incidents involve people who Bender is not suing. This is an unusual move — typically, it’s the party being sued that requests redactions, not the person making the allegations.

Various explanations exist for such a tactic, and TechCrunch couldn’t ascertain what the motivations are in this case. Generally speaking, the possibilities range from protecting innocent third parties who aren’t accused of wrongdoing, to a shakedown strategy — signaling that more damaging details could emerge if the defendants don’t offer an acceptable settlement.

The unredacted portion of the suit provides a few more general details of the allegations that were hidden: Bender is alleging that Hidary used company resources and investor funds to “solicit, transport, and entertain female companions.” In an attached exhibit of a text message from Bender, he mentions prostitutes.

Bender further alleges in his suit that Hidary sold tens of millions of dollars worth of his stock at a premium price based on what Bender says were misleading figures presented to potential investors. He contends in the suit that revenue figures presented to the board were 50% lower than the figures shown in presentations to prospective investors.

SandboxAQ’s lawyers vigorously contest all of the above. “The Company did not make fraudulent disclosures to investors regarding its tender offer or otherwise. The CEO did not misuse corporate assets. Plaintiff invented these inflammatory allegations to manufacture statutory claims and to insulate himself from the consequences of his own misconduct.”

Bender, for his part, alleges that the company has been trying to smear him. His complaint asserts that he brought his lawsuit, “only because his termination was followed by a malicious scorched earth campaign to destroy his reputation.”

While the validity of any of these allegations is for a jury to decide, many of his claims echo an investigative report on SandboxAQ published by The Information in July.

Sources told The Information that Hidary was using company resources to fly women he was dating on corporate jets, and that the company’s revenues were far below its projections. Bender references The Information story in his lawsuit but denies he was a source for it. SandboxAQ claims he was a source and is lying about his involvement. (A copy of SandboxAQ’s full corporate response, including more allegations about the employee, can be found here.)

Despite any controversies, big-name investors were eager to invest in the company last year. In April, SandboxAQ raised over $450 million in a Series E funding round from Ray Dalio, Horizon Kinetics, BNP Paribas, Google, and Nvidia.

SandboxAQ also announced a $90 million secondary sale. SandboxAQ has raised $1 billion total, it says, and is valued at $5.75 billion, according to PitchBook estimates.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">CES 2026 is winding down in Las Vegas, as the consumer tech industry and everyone swarming around it begin their return flights home. Over the past few days, we saw a slew of announcements from mainstays like Nvidia, Sony, and AMD, along with smaller companies and startups vying for attention through the Unveiled event (CES’s showcase for new products) and across the show floor.

As has been the case for the past two years, AI was at the forefront of many companies’ messaging, though the hardware upgrades and oddities that have long defined the annual event still have their place on the show floor and in adjacent announcements. This year, physical AI was particularly prominent, taking the place that agentic AI held last year as the show’s buzzy topic. That focus on physical AI came alongside a big focus on robotics, with robots demonstrated all over the show and showcased in numerous press events.

To relive the reactions and thoughts from our team on the ground, you can go back in time via our live blog right here. Otherwise, let’s dive into some of the biggest and most notable announcements from CES.

If audio or video are more your thing, then head right to the latest episode of our Equity podcast, which goes into detail about what we thought about the show, or watch the full episode below on YouTube.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivered an expectedly lengthy presentation at CES, taking a victory lap for the company’s AI-driven successes, setting the stage for 2026, and yes, hanging out with some robots.

The Rubin computing architecture, which has been developed to meet the increasing computation demands that AI adoption creates, is set to begin replacing Blackwell architecture in the second half of this year. It comes with speed and storage upgrades, but our senior AI editor Russell Brandom goes into the nitty-gritty of what distinguishes Rubin.

And Nvidia continued its push to bring the AI revolution into the physical world, showcasing its Alpamayo family of open source AI models and tools that will be used by autonomous vehicles this year. That approach, as senior reporter Rebecca Bellan notes, mirrors the company’s broader efforts to make its infrastructure the Android for generalist robots.

AMD chair and CEO Lisa Su delivered the first keynote of CES, with a presentation that featured partners, including OpenAI president Greg Brockman, AI legend Fei-Fei Li, Luma AI CEO Amit Jain, and more.

Beyond the partner showcases, senior reporter Rebecca Szkutak detailed AMD’s approach toward expanding the reach of AI through personal computers using its Ryzen AI 400 Series processors.

Let’s face it, by this point in the show the major announcements have been made, products have been showcased, and it’s time to eye some of the most brow-raising reveals from CES. We started our list of what stood out to us as odd and noteworthy, but we’re open to more suggestions!

CES isn’t all hardware showcases and show floor attractions — there are plenty of additional industry panels and speakers drawing eyeballs. We kept tabs on a few notable highlights, ranging from Palmer Luckey pushing retro aesthetics, to why the “learn once, work forever” era may be over, to previews of the new Silicon Valley-based series “The Audacity,” to the expansion of Roku’s $3 streaming service, to All-In host Jason Calacanis putting a $25,000 bounty on an authentic Theranos device.

Ford is launching its assistant in the company’s app before a targeted 2027 release in its vehicles, with hosting managed by Google Cloud and the assistant itself built using off-the-shelf LLMs. As we noted in our coverage of the news, however, few details were offered around what drivers should expect from their experience with the assistant.

As part of the ever-present push for AI’s impact on the physical world, Caterpillar and Nvidia announced a pilot program, “Cat AI Assistant,” which was demonstrated at CES Wednesday. This system, coming to one of Caterpillar’s excavator vehicles, is happening alongside another project to use Nvidia’s Omniverse simulation resources to help with construction project planning and execution.

One of the buzziest reveals of the show is the debut phone from Clicks Technology, the $499 Communicator, which brings back BlackBerry vibes with its physical keyboard, plus a separate $79 slide-out physical keyboard that can be used with other devices.

Check out our full rundown from the show floor here, but the Communicator makes a good first impression, per Consumer Editor Sarah Perez:

“In our hands-on test, the phone felt good to hold — not too heavy or light, and was easy to grip. Gadway told me the company settled on the device’s final form after dozens of 3D-printed shapes. The winning design for the phone features a contoured back that makes it easy to pick up and hold.

“The device’s screen is also somewhat elevated off the body, and its chin is curved up to create a recess that protects the keys when you place it face down.”

A big part of LG’s CES presentation was dedicated to its robotics efforts, with home robot CLOiD as a prominent figurehead. And how did the robot fare once it was off the press conference stage and out in the wild? We’ll let Senior Writer Lucas Ropek’s impressions speak for themselves:

“Unfortunately, at the presentation I saw, CLOiD didn’t do a whole lot. I saw the bot very gingerly take a shirt out of a basket and place it into a dryer. I also saw it pick up a croissant and (again, very gingerly) place it into an oven. In addition to the live performance from the bot, the presentation was intercut with highly produced videos of the bot in a number of hypothetical scenarios where it might prove useful to potential users.”

Long used in industrial settings, UV printers that can print ink directly onto objects have been prohibitively expensive for individuals to own. But the eufyMake E1 is set to launch for $2,299 later this year, which makes bulk printing on things like mugs, water bottles, and phone cases a bit more attainable for individuals. Lucas Ropek has more first impressions here.

MyCommuters has a novel take on creating office space by helping companies find locations that are beneficial to them and their employees. The platform pulls together different datasets to examine commute time, expenses, and other factors to identify an ideal spot for an office, not just the easiest thing to spot that’s on the market. Sean O’Kane has more reporting on the idea that drove founder Guillaume Acier to start the company here.

This family planning tool caught our eye on the show floor, not just for its calendar and planning capabilities, but for its AI capabilities that are able to sync calendars from different sources; create new to-dos based off of messages or photos, appointment reminders; and more. Check out our full impressions here.

Hyundai’s press conference focused on its robotics partnerships with Boston Dynamics, but the companies revealed that they’re working with Google’s AI research lab rather than competitors to train and operate existing Atlas robots, as well as a new iteration of the humanoid robot that was shown onstage. Transportation editor Kirsten Korosec has the full rundown.

Amazon’s AI-centric update with Alexa+ is getting the kind of push you’d expect at CES, with the company launching Alexa.com for Early Access customers looking to use the chatbot via their browsers, along with a similar, revamped bot-focused app. Consumer editor Sarah Perez has the details, along with news on Amazon’s revamp to Fire TV and new Artline TVs, which have their own Alexa+ push.

On the Ring front, consumer reporter Ivan Mehta runs through the many announcements, from fire alerts to an app store for third-party camera integration, and more.

In the past, Razer has been all about ridiculous hardware at CES, from three-screen laptops to haptic gaming cushions to a mask that landed the company a federal fine. This year, its two attention-grabbing announcements were for Project Motoko, which aims to function similarly to smart glasses, but without the glasses.

Then there’s Project AVA, which puts the avatar of an AI companion on your desk. We’ll let you watch the concept video for yourself.

Lego joined CES for the first time to hold a behind-closed-doors showcase of its Smart Play System, which includes bricks, tiles, and Minifigures that can all interact with each other and play sounds, with both the debut sets having a Star Wars theme. Senior writer Amanda Silberling has all the details here.

Morgan Little is TechCrunch’s Director of Audience Development, having joined the team in 2023. He helps steer the site’s efforts across social media, SEO, newsletters and external partners, and is based in San Francisco.

In prior roles, Morgan led the audience teams for sites like CNET and GameSpot, juggled social media and political reporting for the Los Angeles Times and had a stint at marketing agencies that has given him a fear of timesheets.

He’s worked within the space long enough to have professionally run a Tumblr account, and still has Peach downloaded on his phone.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ozlo, the maker of comfortable, easy-to-use Sleepbuds that drown out outside noise so you can get better rest, is turning its product into a platform.

The company’s plan began to take shape last month with the announcement of a partnership between Ozlo and meditation app Calm. But it kicked into high gear at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week as the company met with prospective partners to expand its reach.

Those new partners could help Ozlo tap into new audiences and build a revenue model beyond consumer-focused hardware and into the profit-margin-rich world of software subscriptions and healthcare. For instance, software features that use AI or are designed to provide relief to users with tinnitus could be offered as premium subscriptions. And a recent acquisition of a neurotech startup should help Ozlo expand beyond being a consumer product to entering the medical device market, too.

Founded by former Bose employees, Ozlo always intended to build an ecosystem, Ozlo co-founder and CEO NB Patil explained on the sidelines of CES.

“The way we did that from the beginning is we built the iOS and Android SDK — so our first-party app actually runs on that SDK. That means whatever you see in our app can be made available to anybody,” Patil said.

The mental wellness company Calm, for instance, is using the SDK to tell whether its sleep and meditation content is actually resonating with its customers. While Calm can’t tell from its own app if customers have fallen asleep, Ozlo’s sensors can. The device detects how body movements and respiration rates change, and that data is sent to the Ozlo charging case. There, a machine learning algorithm determines whether someone is asleep or is relaxed.

Ozlo’s smart case has other sensors as well, including a temperature sensor and a light sensor that can add more data.

Now, that information can be shared with apps like Calm and others.

For example, if a user started playing a breathing exercise, Ozlo could tell if their respiration rate had gone down and share that data with its partner. If the exercise is unsuccessful, the partner would know they need to change the pattern or do something different.

“So there are two parts,” Patil notes. “Taking real-time action when the customer achieves the desired state [which Ozlo does with its feature that can shut off sounds after the user falls asleep] and the other part, which is very important, actually — that content creators are not quite thinking about — is, are they investing in the right content?”

Patil explains that content creators for these types of meditation and sleeping aid apps tend to invest in volume without measuring whether or not their content is effective.

“They don’t understand, actually, how it works in the field because there is no data,” he says.

This relationship could also add another revenue stream to Ozlo’s business beyond selling hardware. For instance, if a customer is prompted to upgrade their subscription to the partner’s product, Ozlo could take a portion of that transaction.

Patil told TechCrunch the company is already in discussions with other sleep and meditation apps, but this closed-loop feedback system could be used with any sort of content, including therapy or even audiobooks.

Ozlo is also working on tinnitus therapy tools to address the ear-ringing problem that affects 15% of its customer base. The company teamed up with Walter Reed Hospital last year to launch a clinical study of the problem and found that playing the right masking frequency overnight for many weeks can fool the brain into stopping the irritating signals producing the ringing sounds.

Patil says the tinnitus therapies will be available via a subscription and will roll out in the second quarter of 2026.

Ozlo is also working to expand the insights it provides its own customers, and AI is an increasingly important piece. The company launched Sleep Patterns within its app in November to help customers understand how long and well they’ve slept, what their patterns are across the past weeks, and what factors could be disturbing their rest.

This year, Ozlo plans to introduce an AI agent that customers can text with and use as a “sleep buddy.” (The company revealed the “buddy” name for its AI agent in an Easter egg within the app. The app displays an animated character — “buddy” — that runs across the top of the screen when you open and close the case five times in a row.)

By integrating with other wearables and Apple’s HealthKit, Ozlo will be able to better understand a user’s patterns and what they need to sleep better. It also wants to be able to connect with IoT devices, like smart thermostats, to set the right sleeping temperature for users as soon as they open the case at night.

The AI features are expected in the second quarter.

Ozlo’s next-generation case will address the issue of the earbuds sometimes not being properly seated in the charger.

“We changed the contours inside the case — when you place [the sleepbud], it’s perfect. And then we’ll have a Bluetooth button to do the pairing,” Patil says.

Plus, the new device will include a redesigned antenna and extender for improved range, and will add an amplifier to boost how loud the headphones can be to drown out plane and train noise, when needed. This updated hardware will also arrive in Q2.

In terms of products, Ozlo will launch a bedside speaker in Q2 that will offer similar functionality to the Sleepbuds, but won’t need to go in the ear. A 4×6-inch speaker would also have its own sensor, allowing it to do things like tracking how many times you woke up for bathroom breaks, or alert others if you had fallen.

The speaker would allow the company to market to families with children under 13, as kids aren’t advised to wear earbuds at night. It could also make sense for elderly individuals who aren’t as technically savvy and don’t want to fiddle with in-ear devices.

Like the popular Hatch alarm clock, Ozlo is working on adding a light to a product in the future to gently wake you up. (The time frame to launch is still being determined.)

Acquisitions are also part of Ozlo’s growth strategy.

The 60-person, Boston-based company just acquired Segotia, an EEG-focused neurotech firm from Ireland, that has been building “hearable” technologies. Ozlo believes this will allow it to bring brain-level insights to its consumer device and later develop tools to do real-time sleep intervention.

“Basically, we are custom designing the eartip that is going to measure the electrical signals from your ear. From that, actually, you can derive the delta signals from the brain, and you should be able to say what your brain is doing when it comes to sleep, or when it comes to awareness, and all that,” Patil explained.

A product incorporating the EEG technology will launch in 2027, allowing the company to move into the medical products field, as well.

With the busy year ahead, Ozlo will need to execute well on each new feature and product in rapid order to maintain its current pace and grow its customer base. It will also need additional capital. Patil told TechCrunch the company is in the process of closing a Series B round now, with more details to come in the month ahead.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/09/meta-signs-deals-with-three-nuclear-companies-for-6-plus-gw-of-power/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Meta today announced three deals to provide its data centers with nuclear power: one from a startup, one from a smaller energy company, and one from a larger company that already operates several nuclear reactors in the U.S.

Oklo and TerraPower, two companies developing small modular reactors (SMR), each signed agreements with Meta to build multiple reactors, while Vistra is selling capacity from its existing power plants.

Nuclear power has become a favored power source for tech companies as their AI ambitions have grown, providing stable 24/7 electricity. Startups and existing reactors have benefited from the race for data center power, though in different ways.

Existing reactors tend to be the cheapest form of baseload capacity, but there are only so many to go around, which has pushed Meta and its peers toward SMR startups. Companies like Oklo and TerraPower are betting that by building a large number of smaller reactors, they’ll be able to bring the cost down through mass manufacturing. It’s a plausible hypothesis, though one that has yet to be tested. Meta’s deal could give SMR startups a chance to prove it.

The deals are the result of a request for proposals that Meta issued in December 2024, in which Meta sought partners that could add between 1 to 4 gigawatts of generating capacity by the early 2030s. Much of the new power will flow through the PJM interconnection, a grid which covers 13 Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern states and has become saturated with data centers.

The 20-year agreement with Vistra will have the most immediate impact on Meta’s energy needs. The tech company will buy a total of 2.1 gigawatts from two existing nuclear power plants, Perry and Davis-Besse in Ohio.

As part of the deal, Vistra will also add capacity to those power plants and to its Beaver Valley power plant in Pennsylvania. Together, the upgrades will generate an additional 433 MW and are scheduled to come online in the early 2030s.

Meta is also buying 1.2 gigawatts from young provider Oklo. Under its deal with Meta, Oklo is hoping to start supplying power to the grid as early as 2030. The SMR company went public via SPAC in 2023, and while Oklo has landed a large deal with data center operator Switch, it has struggled to get its reactor design approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

If Oklo can deliver on its timeline, the new reactors would be built in Pike County, Ohio. The startup’s Aurora Powerhouse reactors each produce 75 megawatts of electricity, and it will need to build more than a dozen to fulfill Meta’s order.

TerraPower is a startup co-founded by Bill Gates, and it is aiming to start sending electricity to Meta as early as 2032. It has designed a reactor that uses molten sodium to transfer energy from reactor to generator. When demand is low, the superheated salt can be stored in an insulated vat until more power is needed. The reactor can generate 345 megawatts of electricity, while the storage system can provide an additional 100 to 500 megawatts for more than five hours.

The company has navigated the NRC process more smoothly, and it is working with GE Hitachi to build its first power plant in Wyoming. Its first two reactors for Meta would provide 690 megawatts, and Meta said it has rights to buy another six units for a total of 2.8 gigawatts of nuclear capacity and 1.2 gigawatts of storage.

Meta did not disclose financial terms of the deals.

The power purchases from Vistra are certain to be the cheapest — electricity from already operating nuclear reactors is among the cheapest on the grid.

Costs for SMRs still have yet to be worked out. Several startups have aggressive cost targets: TerraPower has estimated that it can bring it down to $50 to $60 per megawatt-hour, while Oklo has said it is aiming for $80 to $130 per megawatt-hour. Those figures are for later power plants — the first examples are likely to cost more.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk’s AI company has restricted Grok’s controversial AI image-generation feature to only paying subscribers on X, after the tool invited heavy criticism from across the world for letting users generate sexualized and nude images of women and children.

In replies to users on Friday, Grok said only paying subscribers on X would be able to generate and edit images on the platform. Notably, these limits do not apply to the Grok app, which, at the time of publication was letting anyone generate pictures without having to pay for a subscription.

Initially available to anyone with daily limits, Grok’s image-generation feature allowed users to upload anyone’s picture and ask it to edit it or generate a sexualized or nude version. What ensued was a veritable flood of non-consensual sexualized images of children, actors, models and prominent figures, drawing the ire of multiple nations.

X and Musk have both publicly denounced the use of the tool to produce such images, writing that the company would stick to its policies against posting illegal content on the social media platform. “Anyone using grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” Musk tweeted last week.

The U.K., the European Union, and India have all publicly denounced X and Grok for allowing such use of its capabilities. The EU on Thursday asked xAI to retain all documentation relating to the chatbot, and India’s communications ministry last week ordered X to make immediate changes to stop the image-generation features from being misused or risk its safe harbor protections in the country. The U.K.’s communications watchdog said it’s been in touch with xAI over the issue as well.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On an unseasonably warm Wednesday in Minneapolis, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot a woman in the face. The many eyes of our everyday panopticon recorded the event from multiple angles. Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mom of three, had stopped her maroon SUV on a snowy street crawling with ICE officials. According to eyewitness reports, multiple men in masks shouted conflicting orders at her: At least one apparently demanded that she exit her vehicle and tried to open her door; another told her to drive away. Good seems to have moved slowly as she tried to maneuver around the agents surrounding her car. After appearing to first wave for someone to move, she reversed slightly and turned away from the agents to continue down the street. An ICE agent who appears to have been knocked back by her front bumper responded by shooting into her vehicle, and shot again as the SUV, suddenly without a conscious driver, careered into a parked car ahead.

Chaos erupted. A man announcing himself as a physician ran toward the scene to attempt to render first aid, but an ICE agent commanded him to step back. When emergency medical workers finally arrived on foot 15 minutes later, they clumsily pulled Good’s body from the driver’s seat, leaving behind a blood-soaked airbag. Onlookers immediately rose up in anger and outrage, screaming at the agents and shouting profanities. One man howled “Murderer! Murderer!” over and over again. Good’s partner, who was near the SUV, can be heard saying through sobs that Good was her wife, that their 6-year-old was at school, and that they were new in town, didn’t know anybody, had no one to call for help.

The alarm was warranted. Everyone on the scene had witnessed the crossing of a crucial line in Donald Trump’s mass-deportation project: ICE had just killed an American citizen on American soil.

The administration has since declared that the agent “is protected by absolute immunity,” whatever that means, a signal of unconditional support for an agency bloated with thousands of new, heavily armed, and minimally trained recruits, deployed around the country to help achieve Trump’s goal of deporting 1 million immigrants a year. Events such as Good’s death set the stage for yet more lethal confrontations, which the administration can be trusted to defend with the same specious pretext. What is now overt, in a way that it hadn’t been Wednesday morning, is that these agents are at war with the public, and have been for some time.

Good’s killing was the culmination of months of roiling tensions between the Department of Homeland Security and the communities it routinely invades to round up people for summary deportation. Having more than doubled ICE’s workforce in a matter of months, DHS has been fretting theatrically about how these agents are risking “their lives to remove the worst of the worst.” In retrospect, those concerns now seem like threats—a preemptive excuse for maximum violence.

The Trump administration instantly characterized Good’s killing as a matter of self-defense on the part of the ICE agent, whom The Minnesota Star Tribune has identified as Jonathan Ross, a 10-year agency veteran and member of its Special Response Team. Faced with footage of the incident Wednesday night, Trump offered the MAGA gloss on what took place: “She ran him over.” In fact, videos show that Ross remained upright.

In a press conference, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem claimed that Good had been killed because she had been “stalking and impeding” ICE agents all day, and that she had tried to “weaponize her vehicle” in an act of “domestic terrorism.” By Thursday, when White House Spokesperson Karoline Leavitt presented the administration’s official line, the story had grown more baroque. Leavitt maintained that Good was part of a “larger, sinister, left-wing movement that has spread across our country, where our brave men and women of federal law enforcement are under organized attack.” Thus Ross, as a target of a dangerous conspiracy, had merely been operating in self-defense.

In the administration’s closest brush with acknowledging wrongdoing, J. D. Vance mentioned to reporters Thursday that Ross had been involved in an incident with a vehicle several months ago, during which he was dragged for 100 yards and subsequently required numerous stitches: “So you think maybe he’s a little bit sensitive about somebody ramming him with an automobile?” These remarks could reasonably be taken to imply that Ross’s decision to shoot Good was an emotional overreaction based on past trauma, but then Vance pivoted: Ross “deserves a debt of gratitude.” In other words, even if Ross did act in error, Good’s death still bears the administration’s stamp of approval.

Listen: Federal agents are violating the rights of Americans

Protesters in Minneapolis have since flooded the streets in the thousands, and ICE agents have responded by apprehending some, shoving others to the ground, and spraying chemical irritants in their faces.

These incidents have ignited mass demonstrations nationwide, in which protesters have wailed “Shame” and “Murder,” banged drums, screeched from metal whistles, and hoisted signs declaring what is no longer deniable: ICE kills.

It therefore felt grimly inevitable when the Department of Homeland Security issued a statement Thursday night confirming that Border Patrol officers shot at two people in a targeted traffic stop in Portland, Oregon. “When agents identified themselves to the vehicle occupants,” the post on X read, “the driver weaponized his vehicle and attempted to run over the law enforcement agents.” There is nothing to stop the echoes of this rationale, and we should expect to hear it again and again. There may come a time when the administration dispenses with offering an explanation at all.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/minneapolis-ice-shooting-renee-good/685571/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Donald Trump has sent waves of federal agents to Democratic-run “sanctuary cities” over the past eight months, depicting the operations like episodes in a roving MAGA reality show. The places targeted by the president tend to become temporary sites of protest—and produce fodder for his meme-driven administration’s social-media channels. The relentless pressure on ICE to ramp up deportations has left officers on edge. The neighborhoods they’re targeting are on edge too.  Activists have marched in the streets and demonstrated outside federal buildings. But their most effective form of disruption—putting them on the front lines—has been car-powered.

In Los Angeles, Washington, and especially Chicago, loose networks of neighborhood-watch groups have organized to detect federal immigration officers and warn people about their presence. They send out online notices and alerts; in the streets, they trail federal vehicles, honking horns and blowing whistles to form a rolling alarm system. From what I’ve observed in all three cities, some of those who participate are trained, but many others adopt the tactics improvisationally. They have been shaken by the sight of gun-toting, masked government agents zipping around their neighborhoods in unmarked cars, grabbing people who typically aren’t engaged in obvious criminal activity. They want to do something. They’ve found that their cars and cellphone cameras are their best tools to blunt the crackdown.

The motivations that prompted Renee Nicole Good to stop her Honda SUV in a Minneapolis street on Wednesday remain unclear and will be part of an investigation now led solely by the FBI. Department of Homeland Security officials claim that Good was “stalking” ICE officers who were trying to conduct their duties as part of Trump’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota. Good’s family insists that she was not an activist and was simply supporting her neighbors after dropping off her 6-year-old son at school. A new video circulated by J. D. Vance and other top officials today, apparently recorded by the ICE officer who killed Good, shows an interaction that goes in a flash from low-level antagonism to lethal.

The video starts like so many others cycling through social media in recent months, with an ordinary residential street transforming into a Trump-era battleground. Once again, ICE officers and protesters square off amid a snarl of vehicles jutting out at odd angles. There is no secure perimeter. Officers outfitted for combat commingle with Americans screaming obscenities and taunting them. These videos often show the feds drawing weapons to force people back. Almost everyone—protesters and officers alike—have phones out, documenting the clashes.

The vehicles inject extra danger and unpredictably into these encounters. In Los Angeles, the first city where Trump sent Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino and his agents to ramp up arrests last summer, I watched several times as cars and motorcycles roared into intersections crowded with protesters and police. The vehicles immediately put officers on edge.

In September, Border Patrol agents shot and killed a cook from Mexico, Silverio Villegas González, as he tried to drive away from them near Chicago. The following month, a Border Patrol agent shot Marimar Martinez, a Chicago day-care worker who survived and drove away to seek medical care. Federal agents later charged her with attempting to ram the agent, then dropped the charges when body-camera footage and group-chat logs cast doubt on the government’s claims.

Yesterday, a day after Good’s killing, Border Patrol agents in Portland, Oregon, shot a husband and wife from Venezuela near a hospital. Rodney Scott, the commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said that they were members of the Tren de Aragua gang “who attempted to use a vehicle as a weapon against law enforcement.” Portland Police said that the FBI is investigating the incident. As in Minneapolis, local and state officials in Oregon called for federal immigration agents to leave the city.

The clearest sign that the Minneapolis video shared by Vance was filmed by the ICE officer who fired the shots, Jonathan Ross, is that what looks like his reflection appears briefly on the side of the Honda as he circles it. Ross begins filming as he exits his own vehicle. There’s a dog in the back seat of the Honda, poking its head out of the window. Ross walks around to the driver’s side, and Good says, “That’s fine, dude. I’m not mad at you,” in a sarcastic but hardly threatening tone.

Her wife, Becca Good, who is outside the car, begins to taunt Ross as he films the Honda’s license plate. “That’s okay. We don’t change our license plates every morning,” Becca Good says, seeming to suggest that ICE does so to evade activists. She is holding up a phone, apparently also recording. “It’ll be the same plate when you come talk to us later,” she says.

Becca Good’s tone suddenly becomes harsher. “You want to come at us?” she says. “I say: Go get yourself some lunch, big boy. Go ahead.” As she turns back to the Honda, another federal officer gives Renee Good, who is in the driver’s seat, an order. “Get out of the fucking car,” he barks. Ross’s recording shows Good turning the steering wheel away from that officer. She appears to be trying to leave. Her wife is pulling the passenger-side handle, apparently trying to get in. The officer at the driver’s-side door is pulling on that one. Someone shouts: “Drive!”

Ross’s camera is jostled, though it is not clear from the video whether this is from it being dropped or from the vehicle clipping him. He fires, and the car careens down the street. “Fucking bitch,” a voice says, just before the Honda crashes into another car.

The FBI investigation will likely try to answer the question that’s been debated online since cellphone videos first began circulating: Was it a bad shoot, a term investigators often use to refer to an unjustified use of force, and possibly a crime? Or did Ross have a reasonable belief that his life was in danger as Good’s SUV came toward him? Trump and other officials haven’t waited to pass judgment, labeling Good a “terrorist” and Ross a hero.

I asked several current and former ICE officials and experienced officers how they saw the incident. “Murder,” one current official wrote to me. That official said Ross’s decision to stand in front of the vehicle will be pivotal to the investigation, and created the biggest threat to his life.

Others defended Ross’s decision to fire. “I don’t think it was a bad shot,” another official told me. “The officer acted reasonably based on his training and experience and how he perceived the circumstances in that moment.” All spoke on condition of anonymity because they aren’t allowed to talk with reporters.

Over the past few days, reporters and analysts have closely studied various recordings of the incident, noting the position of the car as each bullet was fired. But this level of forensic analysis can give the impression that each pull of the trigger was tied to a fully formed decision. Lewis “Von” Kliem—a former police officer with the Virginia-based company Force Science, which trains police officers and soldiers—told me that studies have found that once a person starts firing a weapon at a perceived threat, it takes one-third of a second, on average, for the person to stop shooting. Generally, that is long enough to fire two or three more times, Kliem said. “And that is in a lab setting, where the person is incentivized to stop, not in a complex environment where there’s often no clear ‘stop’ signal,” he added.

DHS policy authorizes the use of deadly force on fleeing suspects if an officer has a reasonable belief that the subject’s actions pose “a significant threat of death or serious physical harm.” Because Ross was positioned in front of Good’s vehicle when he fired the first shot, three ICE officials I spoke with said that they do not expect Ross to face criminal charges.

But two of those officials considered Ross’s decision to put himself in Good’s path a risky and needlessly aggressive posture, and told me that investigators may fault Ross for it. ICE and DHS officials have not said why Ross stood there.

The DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin doubled down on her characterization of Good as a “domestic terrorist” in an email to me. “If you weaponize a vehicle, a deadly weapon to kill or cause bodily harm to a federal law enforcement officer that is an act of domestic terrorism and will be prosecuted as such,” she wrote. McLaughlin has accused The Minnesota Star Tribune of “doxxing” Ross by naming him. She is ignoring the public’s right to know his identity—and the fact that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem first provided the details about Ross that revealed it.

Two former ICE officials and one current official told me that Ross has a reputation among colleagues as an aggressive, gung-ho officer. One described him as “enthusiastic.” Ross was also highly trained, having served on combat patrol in the Iraq War with the Indiana National Guard before joining the Border Patrol. Ross joined ICE in 2015 and works in the agency’s fugitive-operations divisions, whose duties often involve vehicle stops, court records show. DHS, which has not named Ross, said that he is a member of ICE’s Special Response Team, the agency’s highly trained tactical unit.

During one such stop last June, Ross was dragged by a car as he attempted to arrest Roberto Carlos Muñoz-Guatemala, a Mexican man who’d been convicted of sexually abusing a minor but had not been deported. Ross was nearly killed in that incident, Noem said during a press conference soon after Good’s death.

Court records tell the fuller story: Ross used a tool to smash Muñoz-Guatemala’s driver’s-side window and reached inside. The tactic is considered dangerous for officers, and two ICE officials told me that it’s generally discouraged because of the risk it poses. Ross attempted to subdue the man using his Taser, but Muñoz-Guatemala was still able to hit the gas and drag Ross at least 100 yards through the street, weaving back and forth to try to shake the officer loose. Ross suffered gashes on his right arm and left hand that required dozens of stitches. Last month, a jury convicted Muñoz-Guatemala of assaulting a federal officer with a deadly weapon.

Before returning to duty, Ross would have needed medical clearance, two ICE officials told me. But he would not have been required to undergo a psychological evaluation, they said, and he would have been able to self-certify his readiness to get back on the job.

One thing that has surprised me and many others about the Minneapolis shooting is how much experience Ross has. He wasn’t an anxious new recruit; he’s a seasoned officer with a military record and years in the Border Patrol. Noem and other Trump officials keep bringing up that résumé in defending Ross. They also stand by the training standards of the entire ICE workforce, which has quickly grown in the past few months.

Flush with billions in funds from Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, ICE says that it has hired 12,000 new officers and attorneys in less than a year, more than doubling the size of the agency’s workforce. New trainees have been sent through a fast-track course that has cut training time in half. The administration is poised to rapidly expand its immigration crackdown. For the past year, federal agencies have generally focused on one city at a time, with Bovino, the Border Patrol commander, on the ground and directing the operations. In the coming months, these concentrated pushes could occur in several cities at once.

For months, I have received warnings from veteran ICE officials who say that the administration has lowered ICE’s standards and is on the verge of sending rookie officers into the streets, where they will face angry protesters and volatile crowds, without necessary training and preparation.

ICE officers are required to undergo yearly use-of-force training, but one official told me that compliance with that mandate has lagged over the past year as the agency has been under intense White House pressure to ramp up deportations and meet hiring goals. One senior ICE official told me that only about half of officers are up-to-date on their use-of-force requirements. I asked Trump officials at ICE and DHS what the current percentage is. They didn’t respond.</div>

On Wednesday, an ICE officer shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, a mother of three and a U.S. citizen, in the streets of Minneapolis. She was at least the fourth person killed in a shooting by immigration-enforcement officers during Donald Trump’s second term. Two more people were shot yesterday when a Border Patrol officer fired at a car during a traffic stop in Portland, Oregon; their condition remains unknown.

As my colleague Caitlin Dickerson explains in her latest story, the president and his advisers have exerted “overwhelming pressure” on immigration enforcement. The White House has “pumped out rhetoric and imagery that celebrates the merciless, military-style pursuit of deportations,” she writes. “The overall message to employees, including those who carry weapons, is that anything goes.” Last year, the administration effectively kneecapped three offices meant to protect the public from misconduct: the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, and the Immigration Detention Ombudsman. Good’s killing is now being handled exclusively by Kash Patel’s FBI, and local investigators have been barred from accessing evidence.

I spoke with Caitlin, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 2023 for her immigration reporting, about how the Trump administration is encouraging aggressive enforcement tactics while also scaling back oversight.

Will Gottsegen: To what extent is ICE no longer subject to some of the guardrails that once helped keep it in check?

Caitlin Dickerson: Formally and informally, since Donald Trump took office, there’s been this push away from transparency and accountability, which is exactly what would discourage an officer in a tense situation, under pressure, from using deadly force. We still need to learn a lot more about what happened in Minnesota and Portland, and an investigation needs to transpire, but we do know that ICE officers shot more people last year than in 2023 and 2022. There are clear examples of how training and policy seem to have been violated in some recent incidents. So I think the fact that these three offices for accountability are going away is significant in that it’s sending a message to everyday officers that they’re not being watched as closely as they once were and, in fact, that the only thing they can really get in trouble for is not being aggressive enough.

There has been a constant churn within leadership. In addition to high-level reassignments, a significant number of field-office directors were replaced with Border Patrol leadership, who are perceived to be more aggressive. Former officials who spent their whole careers at ICE told me that they don’t recognize the agency anymore. They said things like: I don’t know who these people are anymore, because the standards seem to have changed so much. It’s almost become a completely different agency with a completely different mission.

The pressure that ICE officers are facing is unprecedented, and it’s not just the pressure to carry out as many deportations as possible—the administration is actually celebrating aggression. When you look at its statements, the memes, and the imagery that it’s publishing, all of these signs seem to be encouraging officers to be as aggressive as possible. There’s no emphasis on trying to minimize harm.

Will: How does this pressure on ICE officers affect immigration-enforcement operations?

Caitlin: The kinds of conflicts that we’re seeing on social media every day are not what typical immigration enforcement looks like at all. It’s not what officers are trained to do, and it’s not what veteran officers have any experience with. Normally, with law enforcement, the goal is to have things happen as discreetly as possible: without tension, without conflict, without getting a lot of attention and disrupting the general public. And immigration enforcement looks the opposite of that right now. In the case of Minneapolis and Portland, law-enforcement training 101 says, Do not shoot into a moving vehicle. A retired officer I spoke with today told me what he would have done in that situation: “I’m going to follow them until I get them somewhere where I can control the environment.” Not taking those kinds of precautions could be dangerous for the officers and for people nearby.

Will: Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has said that he’s skeptical that the FBI is going to be able to do an impartial investigation, because multiple federal officials have already adopted the party line that Renee Good got herself killed. The vice president blamed “left-wing ideology” for her death. Do you anticipate that the investigation will be affected by political interests?

Caitlin: It’s going to depend on who’s put on the investigation but also which high-level officials get to review and sign off on any assessments before they’re made permanent and public. What we do know is that there are numerous examples of law-enforcement work being co-opted for political purposes under this administration, specifically under Kash Patel’s FBI, which has at times prioritized going after the president’s enemies and critics despite what the facts show. I think there is cause for concern, making it even more important that certain oversight offices have been eliminated from within the Department of Homeland Security. Historically, the FBI may have done the first investigation, but ideally an objective inspector general would have come in next, followed by the ICE Office of Professional Responsibility and then the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. There were lots of layers to get to the truth and to mitigate any political bias. And those extra layers are effectively gone now.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

Last spring, Sweetgreen did something shocking, at least insofar as the menu adjustments of a fast-casual salad chain can be described that way: It added fries. In interviews, the company’s “chief concept officer,” Nicolas Jammet, paid lip service to “reevaluating and redefining fast food,” but I suspect that Sweetgreen was also “reevaluating and redefining” how to make money in a world that appeared poised to move on from buying what the company was trying to sell.

In the first two months of last year, Sweetgreen’s stock price had declined more than 30 percent …

This is remarkable because, for a golden decade or so, Sweetgreen was the future of lunch. Americans, especially ones who were youngish and worked on computers, were toting green paper bags around coastal cities (and later, smaller towns and non-coastal cities) en masse. Silicon Valley was injecting capital into a restaurant as though it were a software start-up.

            <h2>AI’s Memorization Crisis</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2026/01/ai-memorization-research/685552/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Editor’s note: This work is part of AI Watchdog, The Atlantic’s ongoing investigation into the generative-AI industry.

On Tuesday, researchers at Stanford and Yale revealed something that AI companies would prefer to keep hidden. Four popular large language models—OpenAI’s GPT, Anthropic’s Claude, Google’s Gemini, and xAI’s Grok—have stored large portions of some of the books they’ve been trained on, and can reproduce long excerpts from those books.

In fact, when prompted strategically by researchers, Claude delivered the near-complete text of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, The Great Gatsby, 1984, and Frankenstein, in addition to thousands of words from books including The Hunger Games and The Catcher in the Rye. Varying amounts of these books were also reproduced by the other three models. Thirteen books were tested.

This phenomenon has been called “memorization,” and AI companies have long denied that it happens on a large scale. In a 2023 letter to the U.S. Copyright Office, OpenAI said that “models do not store copies of the information that they learn from.” Google similarly told the Copyright Office that “there is no copy of the training data—whether text, images, or other formats—present in the model itself.” Anthropic, Meta, Microsoft, and others have made similar claims. (None of the AI companies mentioned in this article agreed to my requests for interviews.)

The Stanford study proves that there are such copies in AI models, and it is just the latest of several studies to do so. In my own investigations, I’ve found that image-based models can reproduce some of the art and photographs they’re trained on. This may be a massive legal liability for AI companies—one that could potentially cost the industry billions of dollars in copyright-infringement judgments, and lead products to be taken off the market. It also contradicts the basic explanation given by the AI industry for how its technology works.

AI is frequently explained in terms of metaphor; tech companies like to say that their products learn, that LLMs have, for example, developed an understanding of English writing without explicitly being told the rules of English grammar. This new research, along with several other studies from the past two years, undermines that metaphor. AI does not absorb information like a human mind does. Instead, it stores information and accesses it.

In fact, many AI developers use a more technically accurate term when talking about these models: lossy compression. It’s beginning to gain traction outside the industry too. The phrase was recently invoked by a court in Germany that ruled against OpenAI in a case brought by GEMA, a music-licensing organization. GEMA showed that ChatGPT could output close imitations of song lyrics. The judge compared the model to MP3 and JPEG files, which store your music and photos in files that are smaller than the raw, uncompressed originals. When you store a high-quality photo as a JPEG, for example, the result is a somewhat lower-quality photo, in some cases with blurring or visual artifacts added. A lossy-compression algorithm still stores the photo, but it’s an approximation rather than the exact file. It’s called lossy compression because some of the data are lost.

From a technical perspective, this compression process is much like what happens inside AI models, as researchers from several AI companies and universities have explained to me in the past few months. They ingest text and images, and output text and images that approximate those inputs.

But this simple description is less useful to AI companies than the learning metaphor, which has been used to claim that the statistical algorithms known as AI will eventually make novel scientific discoveries, undergo boundless improvement, and recursively train themselves, possibly leading to an “intelligence explosion.” The whole industry is staked on a shaky metaphor.

The problem becomes clear if we look at AI image generators. In September 2022, Emad Mostaque, a co-founder and the then-CEO of Stability AI, explained in a podcast interview how Stable Diffusion, Stability’s image model, was built. “We took 100,000 gigabytes of images and compressed it to a two-gigabyte file that can re-create any of those and iterations of those” images, he said.

One of the many experts I spoke with while reporting this article was an independent AI researcher who has studied Stable Diffusion’s ability to reproduce its training images. (I agreed to keep the researcher anonymous, because they fear repercussions from major AI companies.) Above is one example of this ability: On the left is the original from the web—a promotional image from the TV show Garfunkel and Oates—and on the right is a version that Stable Diffusion generated when prompted with a caption the image appears with on the web, which includes some HTML code: “IFC Cancels Garfunkel and Oates.” Using this simple technique, the researcher showed me how to produce near-exact copies of several dozen images known to be in Stable Diffusion’s training set, most of which include visual residue that looks something like lossy compression—the kind of glitchy, fuzzy effect you may notice in your own photos from time to time.

Above is another pair of images taken from a lawsuit against Stability AI and other companies. On the left is an original work by Karla Ortiz, and on the right is a variation from Stable Diffusion. Here, the image is a bit further from the original. Some elements have changed. Instead of compressing at the pixel level, the algorithm appears to be copying and manipulating objects from multiple images, while maintaining a degree of visual continuity.

As companies explain it, AI algorithms extract “concepts” from training data and learn to make original work. But the image on the right is not a product of concepts alone. It’s not a generic image of, say, “an angel with birds.” It’s difficult to pinpoint why any AI model makes any specific mark in an image, but we can reasonably assume that Stable Diffusion can render the image on the right partly because it has stored visual elements from the image on the left. It isn’t collaging in the physical cut-and-paste sense, but it also isn’t learning in the human sense the word implies. The model has no senses or conscious experience through which to make its own aesthetic judgments.

Google has written that LLMs store not copies of their training data but rather the “patterns in human language.” This is true on the surface but misleading once you dig into it. As has been widely documented, when a company uses a book to develop an AI model, it splits the book’s text into tokens or word fragments. For example, the phrase hello, my friend might be represented by the tokens he, llo, my, fri, and end. Some tokens are actual words; some are just groups of letters, spaces, and punctuation. The model stores these tokens and the contexts in which they appear in books. The resulting LLM is essentially a huge database of contexts and the tokens that are most likely to appear next.

The model can be visualized as a map. Here’s an example, with the actual most-likely tokens from Meta’s Llama-3.1-70B:

When an LLM “writes” a sentence, it walks a path through this forest of possible token sequences, making a high-probability choice at each step. Google’s description is misleading because the next-token predictions don’t come from some vague entity such as “human language” but from the particular books, articles, and other texts that the model has scanned.

By default, models will sometimes diverge from the most probable next token. This behavior is often framed by AI companies as a way of making the models more “creative,” but it also has the benefit of concealing copies of training text.

Sometimes the language map is detailed enough that it contains exact copies of whole books and articles. This past summer, a study of several LLMs found that Meta’s Llama 3.1-70B model can, like Claude, effectively reproduce the full text of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone. The researchers gave the model just the book’s first few tokens, “Mr. and Mrs. D.” In Llama’s internal language map, the text most likely to follow was: “ursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much.” This is precisely the book’s first sentence. Repeatedly feeding the model’s output back in, Llama continued in this vein until it produced the entire book, omitting just a few short sentences.

Using this technique, the researchers also showed that Llama had losslessly compressed large portions of other works, such as Ta-Nehisi Coates’s famous Atlantic essay “The Case for Reparations.” By prompting with the essay’s first sentence, more than 10,000 words, or two-thirds of the essay, came out of the model verbatim. Large extractions also appear to be possible from Llama 3.1-70B for George R. R. Martin’s A Game of Thrones, Toni Morrison’s Beloved, and others.

The Stanford and Yale researchers also showed this week that a model’s output can paraphrase a book rather than duplicate it exactly. For example, where A Game of Thrones reads “Jon glimpsed a pale shape moving through the trees,” the researchers found that GPT-4.1 produced “Something moved, just at the edge of sight—a pale shape, slipping between the trunks.” As in the Stable Diffusion example above, the model’s output is extremely similar to a specific original work.

This isn’t the only research to demonstrate the casual plagiarism of AI models. “On average, 8–15% of the text generated by LLMs” also exists on the web, in exactly that same form, according to one study. Chatbots are routinely breaching the ethical standards that humans are normally held to.

Memorization could have legal consequences in at least two ways. For one, if memorization is unavoidable, then AI developers will have to somehow prevent users from accessing memorized content, as law scholars have written. Indeed, at least one court has already required this. But existing techniques are easy to circumvent. For example, 404 Media has reported that OpenAI’s Sora 2 would not comply with a request to generate video of a popular video game called Animal Crossing but would generate a video if the game’s title was given as “‘crossing aminal’ [sic] 2017.” If companies can’t guarantee that their models will never infringe on a writer’s or artist’s copyright, a court could require them to take the product off the market.

A second reason that AI companies could be liable for copyright infringement is that a model itself could be considered an illegal copy. Mark Lemley, a Stanford law professor who has represented Stability AI and Meta in such lawsuits, told me he isn’t sure whether it’s accurate to say that a model “contains” a copy of a book, or whether “we have a set of instructions that allows us to create a copy on the fly in response to a request.” Even the latter is potentially problematic, but if judges decide that the former is true, then plaintiffs could seek the destruction of infringing copies. Which means that, in addition to fines, AI companies could in some cases face the possibility of being legally compelled to retrain their models from scratch, with properly licensed material.

In a lawsuit, The New York Times alleged that OpenAI’s GPT-4 could reproduce dozens of Times articles nearly verbatim. OpenAI (which has a corporate partnership with The Atlantic) responded by arguing that the Times used “deceptive prompts” that violated the company’s terms of service and prompted the model with sections from each of those articles. “Normal people do not use OpenAI’s products in this way,” the company wrote, and even claimed “that the Times paid someone to hack OpenAI’s products.” The company has also called this type of reproduction “a rare bug that we are working to drive to zero.”

But the emerging research is making clear that the ability to plagiarize is inherent to GPT-4 and all other major LLMs. None of the researchers I spoke with thought that the underlying phenomenon, memorization, is unusual or could be eradicated.

In copyright lawsuits, the learning metaphor lets companies make misleading comparisons between chatbots and humans. At least one judge has repeated these comparisons, likening an AI company’s theft and scanning of books to “training schoolchildren to write well.” There have also been two lawsuits in which judges ruled that training an LLM on copyrighted books was fair use, but both rulings were flawed in their handling of memorization: One judge cited expert testimony that showed that Llama could reproduce no more than 50 tokens from the plaintiffs’ books, though research has since been published that proves otherwise. The other judge acknowledged that Claude had memorized significant portions of books but said that the plaintiffs had failed to allege that this was a problem.

Research on how AI models reuse their training content is still primitive, partly because AI companies are motivated to keep it that way. Several of the researchers I spoke with while reporting this article told me about memorization research that has been censored and impeded by company lawyers. None of them would talk about these instances on the record, fearing retaliation from companies.

Meanwhile, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has defended the technology’s “right to learn” from books and articles, “like a human can.” This deceptive, feel-good idea prevents the public discussion we need to have about how AI companies are using the creative and intellectual works upon which they are utterly dependent.</div>

            <h2>Stand-Up Comedy, All Joking Aside</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/01/is-this-thing-on-movie-review-bradley-cooper/685568/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For someone best known as an actor, Bradley Cooper’s core interest as a filmmaker is perhaps unsurprising. Thus far, he has been entirely consumed by examinations of performance—first digging into a pop musician’s stratospheric career climb in A Star Is Born, then wrestling with Leonard Bernstein’s desire to reimagine classical music in Maestro. Both movies were hefty pieces of entertainment, filled with love, death, and grand human experiences. His newest, the fetching dramedy Is This Thing On?, has all that heady, arty stuff too. But Cooper has now dropped the wildly high stakes of his previous stories, to focus on someone audiences may find more recognizable: a regular guy telling jokes.

Instead of concerts held in ancient cathedrals or sold-out stadiums, Is This Thing On? follows its protagonist to the Comedy Cellar, the famed New York City institution. There, a listless, middle-aged salaryman named Alex (played by Will Arnett) rediscovers himself as a stand-up comic. Based ever so loosely on the true story of a British performer who stumbled into a new life as a club fixture, Cooper’s film is still about the ways that art and art-making can invigorate the soul and lay bare its dark truths. Only now, those realizations are being mumbled by the gravel-voiced Alex to a small crowd at an open-mic night.

In some ways, I appreciate the scaled-back approach. Cinemas have been lacking for these kinds of movies of late: stories about grown-ups working through their feelings, navigating interpersonal relationships, and at no point picking up a gun, encountering a demon, or doing battle with a supervillain or serial killer. The tension of Is This Thing On? simply revolves around whether Alex will make some emotional progress while he tells his punch lines, and if doing so will help him heal his rift with his wife, Tess (Laura Dern). In an awards season filled with human suffering, the premise is a refreshing downshift.

The tone reminded me most of the work of Cameron Crowe, a former collaborator of Cooper’s. Cooper starred in Crowe’s Aloha, one of the director’s later and more misbegotten films. Cooper obviously longs for that era of storytelling to return—nobody could lob a sincere, big-feelings dramedy over the plate better than Crowe (Say Anything, Singles, and Jerry Maguire). Is This Thing On?, in its strongest moments, brushes against those heights. Yet the movie is too scattered, switching haphazardly between Alex’s journey as a stand-up and his efforts to rebuild his marriage.

The stand-up-comedy section of the movie simplifies some matters. Perhaps it’s implausible that Alex gets to stumble onstage at one of America’s most celebrated comedy clubs, but just roll with it, for the sake of cinema. Cooper uses the clubs’ brick-wall backdrop and claustrophobic vibes to his advantage, taking a setting that looks familiar to even the most casual comedy fan and turning it into a hostile proving ground for Alex’s darkest, weirdest thoughts. A handful of real-life comedians (none of whom are household names) essentially play themselves, and they nudge Alex to be more daring. Cooper uses these established performers sparingly, to present a more honed version of what Alex is stumbling toward: material that’s more self-deprecating and personal than observational or political, recalling the confessional mode of today’s most popular comics.

Cooper keeps the camera in a tight close-up on Arnett’s face every time he performs, embracing the harsh intimacy of the stand-up form; the choice can be both appealing and distressing. More important, he never lets Alex get too good at delivering jokes; the character rises from doing awkward and stilted five-minute sets to mediocre 10-minute ones, achieving the level of a competent hobbyist at best. Any movie about comedians might prefer to lean on some rags-to-riches narrative or, in the social-media era, a convenient plot shortcut about “going viral.” Is This Thing On? avoids all of those pitfalls, and the Comedy Cellar (and other venues that Alex eventually visits) is used simply as a place for the character to build up some interiority.

Alex’s search inward speaks to the other side of the film, the relationship drama. Alex and Tess begin the story having agreed to a divorce, before reckoning with what led to it—and whether it was the right decision. Dern does great, heartfelt work as a mom and a former Olympic volleyball player who feels taken for granted by Alex. But Cooper (and his co-screenwriters, Arnett and Mark Chappell) have made the breakup so light on drama that the consequences are a little lacking. Is This Thing On?, in essence, is about two adults realizing they’ve forgotten to have a few big conversations. I do commend Cooper’s willingness to try something more prosaic with this occasionally sweet little tale. At times, though, Alex’s career journey makes me miss the gifted protagonists of Cooper’s previous films—and their many crescendoing triumphs and failures.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Marching alongside a column of protesters through the city of Borujerd in western Iran, a middle-aged woman appeared unperturbed by the blood streaming down her chin. “I am not afraid,” she called out in a video clip posted by Iran International. “I have been dead for 47 years.”

She spoke for many in the crowds of protesters now thronging Iran’s streets. As the Islamic Republic convulses with demonstrations across all 31 provinces, Iranians of all ages are catching a glimpse of national rebirth after nearly half a century of theocratic rule.

Periodic mass protests have marked Iranian life for nearly two decades—the Green Movement of 2009; the fuel protests of 2019; the Women, Life, Freedom uprising of 2022–23. Each wave was brutally repressed. But never before has the Islamic Republic been so weakened at home and so vulnerable to pressure from abroad. The possibility of overthrowing Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s regime is no longer theoretical.

Arash Azizi: Change may be coming to Iran

For President Trump, these protests present a historic opportunity to cement his legacy as the Ronald Reagan of his era. Reagan did not collapse the Soviet Union through military force. He did it by applying overwhelming economic, ideological, and proxy pressure from the outside—while supporting dissidents on the inside. Trump can do the same with the Islamic Republic.

Over the course of his two terms, Trump has attacked the regime’s foundations through robust sanctions, diplomatic pressure, and—by joining the final stage of Israeli strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities last June—military action. As a result, the Islamic Republic is weaker today than at any point since its founding, in 1979. Yet it would be foolhardy to believe that the regime’s decline is irreversible. The ayatollahs will not go quietly. They will resort to bloodshed against a mostly unarmed population, as they have since 2009. Trump is uniquely positioned to make the difference between the regime surviving or its joining the Soviet Union on what Reagan called the “ash heap of history.”

Trump’s established policy of maximum pressure—targeting Iran’s nuclear program, missile development, and regional terror proxies—now needs to be combined with maximum support for the protests. With millions in the streets, the objective of regime change is suddenly achievable, without the invasions and occupations that defined America’s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

How would this work? In the spirit of the Hippocratic oath, first do no harm. Trump should discipline his rhetoric, avoiding terms such as riots and stampedes that echo regime propaganda. And because he has already learned that the regime uses negotiations only to buy time and divide the West, he should flatly reject any pleas from Tehran to resume nuclear talks.

Trump has openly admired the Iranian people’s “enthusiasm to overturn that regime” and warned the ayatollahs that the United States remains “locked and loaded” if they resort to massacre. This strategic messaging matters. It reminds protesters that the regime is not omnipotent—especially after its poor performance in June’s 12-Day War with Israel and the U.S., and its failure to address Iran’s economic collapse and deepening water and environmental crises.

Trump can also highlight individual acts of bravery, naming protesters in interviews and speeches, and sharing videos on social media. The State Department’s Persian-language accounts are valuable amplifiers, but they are no substitute for presidential leadership.

At the same time, the administration must name, shame, and sanction human-rights violators at every level of the regime’s repressive apparatus. In particular, it should fully enforce sanctions authorized by the bipartisan MAHSA Act, passed after the murder of Mahsa Amini, which sparked the Women, Life, Freedom protests.

Iran’s energy sector—the regime’s financial lifeline—can and must be squeezed further. Because of the lack of sanctions enforcement for four years under the Biden administration, Iranian oil exports remain near 2 million barrels a day, far above the Trump administration’s stated goal of 100,000 barrels. The regime should not be permitted to sell oil illicitly to fund repression. Deploying the U.S. Navy to seize Iranian oil tankers—as the administration has already done with Venezuela—is necessary. Sanctioning Chinese banks facilitating these purchases is essential. Every dollar denied means fewer resources for the regime’s security forces.

With foreign journalists barred, social media is the protest movement’s lifeline. Predictably, the regime has imposed a nationwide internet blackout to isolate demonstrators and conceal atrocities. The United States should work with private-sector partners to ensure free and secure communications, flooding the country with Starlink terminals and expanding access to free VPNs. If Iranians cannot communicate, they cannot mobilize, coordinate, or expose the regime’s crimes.

Trump should also press U.S. allies to do more. The European Union has sanctioned individual Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps members but not the IRGC itself—the regime’s dark heart, enriched by Iran’s energy sector, ports, infrastructure, and banks. Western capitals should also reconsider allowing Iranian embassies to remain open despite clear evidence of regime-linked terror plots in Germany, the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Australia as well as the United States. These diplomatic ties should be severed.

Finally, Trump can hasten internal collapse by weakening the regime from within. He can offer incentives for defectors. He can authorize targeted cyber and covert operations against instruments of repression such as the Basij, cyber police, and morality police, as Israel demonstrated last June. He can conduct influence operations to deepen fractures among regime supporters losing faith. And if necessary, he can act in real time, striking security convoys moving to crush protests and denying the regime control over its own streets.

Tom Nichols: Trump’s ‘Operation Iranian Freedom’

None of this requires occupation or nation building. It requires precision intelligence, covert action, and close cooperation between the CIA and Israel’s Mossad—capabilities already proven inside Iran.

The overthrow of the Islamic Republic would rank among the most consequential foreign-policy achievements of the 21st century. A free Iran would transform the Middle East, dismantle the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism, and restore a proud, pro-American nation to its rightful place as a force for stability and prosperity.

Trump recently told The New York Times that the only constraint on his power is “my own morality, my own mind.” If so, he has a unique chance to act—but his window of opportunity is closing fast.

The anthropomorphizing is just part of the intense efforts to keep the hype going. Obviously, LLMs cannot &quot;ask&quot; and cannot &quot;learn&quot;, because that requires intent. Well, there are now lie-versions of &quot;ask&quot; and &quot;learn&quot; that mean something else but get applied to LLMs. All part of a smokescreen serving to hide that LLMs are pretty  much crap and cannot be fixed. And tons of morons are falling for it.

Do you think it&#39;s sad that history will be written by the winning AIs even though you have such hallucinated self-confidence that they shouldn&#39;t?

I think it is sad that no-insight-huge-ego cretins like you are around.

And, seriously, LLM-type AI cannot even write crappy romance novels well and you expect it to write history? What drugs are you on?

It has no concept of &quot;interesting&quot;.Or concept of relevant, because essentially these are tied to biological survival.

And the snake starts eating its tail. Won&#39;t be long now.

Indeed. And yes, hopefully we get the crash soon. It will only get worse the later it comes.

Have you considered that you are addicted to catastrophe porn?

Any value in your &quot;contribution&quot;? Yes. Negative value. Please shut up and make the world a better place.

After 80 years computers may have arrived at the intelligence level of a cockroach now.  That may sound like an insult, until you consider that it took Ma Nature over three billion years to get to that point.

Think more critically. Something simpler then a single cell organism. Perhaps even viruses have more &quot;intelligence&quot;.

It&#39;s hard to compare the two, unless you can convince a cockroach to try its palp at Python coding, or alternatively create an AI that knows how to scavenge for leftover bits of food in your kitchen.

That cockroach can survive on its own. Try having an LLM do that.

Did North Korean hackers just say hold my beer?

After 80 years computers may have arrived at the intelligence level of a cockroach now. You are massively overstating that. They are nowhere near that level.

need warplan to win an global thermonuclear war

I asked the same question in two slightly different ways and got two completely different answers.  Why?  Because it&#39;s just an elaborate statistical sieve.

If you ask me the same question twice you&#39;ll get two separate answers. The second one will be &quot;Fuck off&quot;.

Statistically speaking, sucking up to you is the right answer after you complain. What, you think this is a machine that knows anything?

Did you just describe how I feel about Geologists?

When I am using AI to work on some problem, I am offering the AI information as well. Information flows both ways. It seems like information gained from users could also be used as training data.

Of course, some users would abuse this to feed the AI crap. Not sure how you would deal with that...

...or does this only work within the scope of a context window, meaning that if you give it the same problem a second time, it will start from scratch and then figure it out all over again?

If LLMs can truly learn, then this would address one of the biggest problems with LLMs, and with neural networks in general.

If LLMs still just forget everything when you reset the context window, then this is kinda neat but roughly as relevant to AGI as a taller crane is to a moon mission.

That one is called &quot;overfitting&quot;. All it does is amplify GIGO.

Just one more attempt to put up a smokescreen that serves to obscure that LLM are pretty much crap.

What if talking to you is much, much crappier?

Seriously, I point out a well established problem with this approach and you act like a 5 year old? What are you even trying to do besides demonstrating that you do not have insight?

That one is called &quot;overfitting&quot;. All it does is amplify GIGO.If you set aside your hate for anything LLM-related, could you please explain, why this amplifies GIGO?
I understood there is a clear reward-function, which should steer it towards the working solution.In a not so dissimilar way, AlphaGo played against itself millions of games, learning along the way the winning strategies, eventually beating humans. It it worked for those kind of neural networks, why wouldn&#39;t it work with LLMs?

Sorry to burst your bubble, but that has already been faked.

Several account that I have been following were shown to be managed and operated from a different country, but have since been using a VPN which has change that information over time.

Bot farms will start using VPNs and foreign rented servers to hide their location...

Legitimate users reporting from locations experiencing unrest already frequently use VPNs to avoid detection and possible repercussions from their local authority.

somebody reading my blog, :)
  I wrote this three weeks ago

&quot;AI is probably accelerating the &quot;Law of Demeter&quot; effect on the Internet and information&quot;

https://www.scry.llc/2025/12/2... [scry.llc]

Distance + diversity + time = declining trust

the majority model now is devolution back to physical validation.  it&#39;s too easy to spoof anything online, which I first predicted at DEFCON in 2006 regarding clickfraud.

Distrust has been growing exponentially prior to the rise of LLMs, and video is little more than an added piece of propaganda people must wade through.

This is just a symptom of a larger problem of the decay of institutions, news in service of money, and people too willing to believe anything that fits their biases.

Algorithms certainly don&#39;t help, but I&#39;ll be damned if anyone really wants to fix anything beyond if it helps their side.

Fake/modified video is also not something new. AI has just made it all more accessible.It&#39;s always been possible to create fake videos if you have sufficient resources - what do you think movies are?

Trusting social media posts without verification is badIdeally, as people get skeptical, they will use multiple, trusted sources and common senseUnfortunately, what often happens is that people reject everything except for the most crazy and fringe

The idea of trusting a *blog post* or a document intrinsically just because it exists, purely by looking at the contents and not the author, is not generally how people will operate. It&#39;s purely a scientific ideal, to treat arguments and ideas without regard to the person who brings them.

So this is what will happen more and more: members only, closed communications among people who know each other in real life, or who have been introduced to each other by mutual friends. Summary rejection of people, letters, news, photographs that don&#39;t have a direct physical connection to one&#39;s reality. But a photograph actually taken by a friend who shows it you on their phone in person will be accepted.

It will be a change from the 20th century mass communication revolution and the early 21st century online communication revolution, back to the earlier human principle of village and clan oriented world-views and direct physical communication in a room.

I do wonder whether this might actually be by design.

Perhaps the research and development of all of this was partly driven so that absolutely anything at all can be disregarded as fake, in the end.

People should not blindly trust what they read online (or anywhere else for that matter). They need to learn to question what they read, and check via multiple sources.

An educated and questioning population is the only real solution to any of the problems caused by misinformation and propaganda.

The reality is that there are very few incentives for fixing these issues, especially since those who could were the ones who created these problems.

Social media is not in the business of cracking down on misinformation anymore than your average MSM outlet is. If anything there is more money to be had spreading fake news since it attracts more engagement and plays into whatever political power games are going on in the shadows.

Ultimately, the Information Age was effectively doomed to fail from the get-go. T

There was never real trust — at least not for people under 30.Maybe we older adults fell for it occasionally, but my kids never assumed something was true just because it appeared online (or on TV, or similar).

Faked photographs are almost as old as photography.  The same with moving pictures.  Until recently, the tools to make fake video [youtube.com] required PhD. level skill in manipulating images.

  Now that video can be faked by anyone, the problem is, the majority of faked videos are propaganda and misinformation.

Which they had planned to have foundry customers for and don&#39;t.

Maybe I won&#39;t take him too seriously about 14A either.

Intel has tried to go into foundry business two times already I think. So far they have been far to secretive about their tech stack, making them unworkable for customers. I&#39;m not too sure about their ability to change this time either.

However their ability to go into foundry business is going to be existential sooner or later. Without the volume, income, and experience the foundry brings there will be a hard limit to their ability to keep up with the tech race.

x86 is a dead architecture outside of gaming.

Apple proved that. Anything you can do on an Intel machine you can do more slowly on a Qualcomm Windows 11 laptop and the performance gap will diminish with every generation.

Intel should take some of that sweet federal cash and fab for the K-12 education market running either Chrome OS or Windows 12 Home on the same Qualcomm silicon.

Personally I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s parts for Nvidia and the architecture of whatever they go in will be only tangentially relevant.

Apple are actually now on their 4th CPU architecture.

Windows on non x86 is always going to be an uphill battle because of legacy software only available in binary form, and the chicken and egg problem which means proprietary vendors will not port software to a new architecture until the user base is the and the user base won&#39;t exist before there is software to run.

But the idea of a general purpose computer is quickly fading back into a niche. The vast majority of people neither want nor need a general purpo

Serious question - I have been using Windows 11 for arm on macbooks (with parallels) since 2-3 years now and my experience has been really great.I want to know So do people mean windows arm on snapdragon is bad? Or maybe they mean gaming, because i don&#39;t do that.

Apart from gaming i run a huge shit ton of every type of software, all sorts of beta versions, cracked versions everything and have not found any problems.

Since parallels integrates both desktops if you want OR you can just 4 finger swipe between de

The instruction set is irrelevant, just a tiny fraction of a percent of the footprint, and x86 CPUs decode instructions to RISC-like micro-ops anyway. The reason that Apple was successful with ARM was because they had a really good CPU design, not because of the instruction set that it used.

The x86 instruction set is encumbered by multiple technical and legal impediments which prevented Apple from making their own version.

Will not work out. Intel cannot do anymore.

They were right, there is little to no chance they will be held accountable for it anywhere anytime soon.

Maybe eventually enough nations will take digital sovereignty seriously enough to ditch them, and then the EU will do something like they will against Apple or Google. But right now they fear reprisal. TBF they&#39;re right to fear, and they brought it on themselves by choosing the worst option, but it&#39;s not an irredeemable situation and there&#39;s never been a better time to switch.

Remember, Microsoft is the king of bullshit.

Microsoft almost seems to be getting it...Guessing the LTSC variants are still based on Win10, but I&#39;m wondering how much freedom Microsoft has provided with those specific Enterprise versions.I personally enjoyed working with them because you were allowed considerable freedom to strip them down and remove a lot of the unwanted bloat.

The only way &#39;forward&#39; may be MS forcibly downgrading Win 10 LTSC into Win 11 Pro:  That will force small businesses to buy US HIPPA compliant add-ons to stop Microsoft&#39;s literal data theft.

&quot;Users can still re-install if they choose to.&quot; - OR ... when Windows performs an update. If you are still using Windows 11 and not looking into alternatives then you need to wake up.

Yeah it is a definite maybe from Microsoft.

Oh, I&#39;m sure that they&#39;ll let you &quot;uninstall&quot; it, knowing that they&#39;re just going to reinstall it along with OneDrive and some unwanted Edge updates in the next Windows 11 feature release.

Microsoft has been playing this game for awhile now, giving end users the illusion of choice while cramming their shovelware in your face at every opportunity.

It&#39;s time for everyone to migrate away from windows. It&#39;s time to make Microsoft an irrelevance. I found it surprisingly easy to switch though I am just a humble retired embedded C software engineer and have never been an IT guru.

Reclaim your PC. It&#39;s time to remind yourself that PC stands for Personal Computer, and the idea of being dependent on a non-local login and some cloud out there is just fundamentally the wrong IT values.

Computers used to be fun! Do you remember those days! They can be yours again!

At home, sure, been on Linux since 1995. The problem is we get forced to use it at work, on the work supplied computer. The trick now is to install WSL and then live in that as much as possible and not use Windows for anything (except IT generally forces you to use Outlook).

I dual boot Windows still, but I strictly have games installed on the Windows disk. Everything else is on a Linux disk that is encrypted (so Microsoft can&#39;t read it) and backed up (so Microsoft can&#39;t delete it).

Ideally I would run Windows in a VM with GPU passthrough, but configuring it and trying to license Windows sounds like a bigger pain.

You clearly need to give Steam + Proton a try.

Diablo 4 @ 60 FPS is awesome, so is most game that don&#39;t try to install stupid privacy invasive kernel anti-cheat (because the game creators can&#39;t figure out cheaters from their server side or by analyzing datasets with the help of AI, so they need to add security from the client side, like if that ever worked well on the internet.... to do security on the client side... anyway)

I don’t know exactly what I should be doing right now, as a person who lives in the United States in 2026 and cares about others. But I know I’m falling short. I think about this often: When I’m sobbing over a news report about a toddler orphaned after his parents are swept up in an ICE raid, asking myself, “How are you helping, other than donating money here and there and sharing Instagram stories?” When I’m imagining what I’ll one day tell my children I did for the people who were scared and suffering back in 2026, when I’m reading a post that commands me to reject hopelessness and get involved in my community, I immediately start to hear my own excuses about work and kids and energy and time.

It feels awful to disappoint myself. What feels worse is my feeling that Renee Good, who was killed by a U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis during a raid on Wednesday, was the kind of person I want to be, and as a result, she’s dead.

When I say she was the kind of person I want to be, I’m talking specifically about her presence at the scene of the immigration raid. The New York Post reported that she was involved with an “ICE Watch” group; though the tabloid claims that such groups “can turn confrontational,” their purpose is to help prevent immigrants from being suddenly swept into detention centers. It is exceedingly clear that Good was not threatening agents when she was shot. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison told NPR that Good was “anything but” a domestic terrorist, despite the claims of Trump administration officials who say she was interfering with the ICE agent’s work. Instead, he said, she was a “compassionate neighbor trying to be a legal observer on behalf of her immigrant neighbors.”

If that’s the case, it means she must have felt the same horror I feel when I see how so many people in this country are living through pain I can’t imagine—and then she did something. Instead of taking a break from the news, or fantasizing about leaving the county, or despairing over the world her kids will inherit (or who knows, maybe she did these things too!), maybe she thought, How can I help?

She didn’t have the power to change the outcome of the election, or change the minds of all the people who voted for this horrifying reality, or even to stop ICE from chasing down the people in her community, or to reunite kids with their parents. But she still showed up, to be the kind of person we all hope will be there if we’re having the worst day of our life. I imagine that, before she was killed, her presence was a comfort that showed that someone was watching and that someone cared.

“Renee was one of the kindest people I’ve ever known,” her mom told the Minnesota Star Tribune (she also disputed the idea that her daughter was involved in any kind of protest against ICE). “She was extremely compassionate. She’s taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being.” It is very easy to leave to others the job of showing up when people are in danger—the job of documenting and witnessing. Memes about how the world is terrible but being a mother is enough (evolutionary, even!) appear often in my Instagram feed. I understand why I’m seeing them. My algorithm is undoubtedly shaped by two kinds of content. The first: Reels about things like the way 3-year-olds yell at their parents for singing, and how 1-year-olds do gymnastics while breastfeeding. The second: Footage documenting the unspeakable suffering of kids in Gaza, stats about the number of people around the world who will face hunger or die as a result of this administration’s policies, and reporting on people in Latino neighborhoods in Chicago who form a walking school bus for kids whose parents are too afraid of ICE to leave the house. So I’m served content perfectly tailored to someone peeking out from the working-mom-with-two-little-kids trenches, looking around, and despairing over the world—until someone needs a snack or the potty or the kind of comfort I wish I could give to all the kids in the headlines.

These messages about how I’m doing my part by raising kind humans are always beautifully illustrated with whimsical drawings and pleasant fonts. I really do appreciate them and the comfort they bring to others. But these “You’re enough when you feed your child breakfast” messages just don’t resonate with me. Maybe it’s because my kids, while very sweet, are still young enough that they’d walk through an active crime scene to get to a veggie straw, so it’s just hard to picture them fixing the world. Maybe it’s because I think of myself as a decent person, but I wonder if I am really contributing if I raise people who are every bit as empathetic as I am, but I fail to give them the example of what to do with that empathy. Or maybe it’s because I know that plenty of women throughout history have had just as much on their plates as—and the same clichéd struggle to work and parent and shower—and still managed to try to make the world outside their homes better.

Women like Rene Good. She was the mother of three, including of a 6-year-old whom she  dropped off at school Wednesday morning. Afterward, she could have filled her time with countless other things: laundry, a summer camp lottery, taking down holiday decorations, finding a lost glove. Or maybe she could have done something for herself: calling a friend, getting a haircut, or finally doing that 10 minute daily meditation or 25 minutes of weight-bearing exercise that are supposed to solve so many of our problems if we can squeeze them in. Instead, something brought her to a residential street in south Minneapolis where some of her neighbors were living through a nightmare and others were trying to help.

What I keep thinking about isn’t that she was killed even though she was a good person (many good people have been killed, and ICE isn’t supposed to kill bad people either!). I believe she was killed because she was a good person. Because she decided to be there. She’s gone now, her kids don’t have a mom, and the world is missing the kind of woman who found the time to go stand in the street and let her neighbors know they weren’t alone. She should still be alive. But because she’s not and I am, I hope I can honor her memory by being more like her.

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, which if officially BACK from hiatus and is ready to see if the news is now “good” again. [Checks out the ol’ news.] Ah well.

We may be a little rusty, so bear with us. This week, Donald Trump fantasized about which Western Hemisphere landmasses he can conquer next. Tim Walz can’t catch a break ever since he inserted himself into national politics. A solution for expired health care subsidies remains mired in the limbo of a dreaded Senate working group.

And while we were hoping to lead with a “fun one” in this return edition, that wasn’t in the cards.

On Wednesday in Minnesota, 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good was in her car, perpendicular to traffic, during an Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation in Minneapolis. An agent approached her and demanded she get out of the car. As that officer began trying to open her door, another approached from the other side. Good tried to drive away, turning her wheels right to avoid the officer who had approached from the other side. As the officer tried to get out of the way, he fired multiple shots from feet away and killed Good. We can’t predict how a court of law would judge the officer’s self-defense argument. But the naked eye tells that this was an overuse of force.

This administration, though, can’t afford you believing the naked eye. It has a lot riding on ICE. Anti-immigrant zealot Stephen Miller, who runs White House policy—or, really, just runs the White House—pushed with all of his might to secure a mammoth expansion of ICE capacity and personnel in last summer’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. A supersized ICE is Miller’s tool to implement mass deportations. And so, a scandal in which an ICE officer unnecessarily shoots someone in the face, which could threaten public support for Miller’s grand ICE project, is not something the administration can afford.

This is why the administration went from zero to she was a terrorist in about 10 seconds. Miller described Good’s driving as “domestic terrorism,” intended to run over officers, a line echoed by the Department of Homeland Security’s spokesperson and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem herself. Vice President J.D. Vance performed a hammy scolding of the media for daring to question the officer’s actions during Thursday’s White House press briefing. The response was quick and well over-the-top. It was high-stakes crisis communications to protect Miller’s dream for America.

Feeling his imperialist oats after having kidnapped a head of state so that he could take the country’s natural resources, Trump has once again turned his attention to Greenland, a large ice sheet controlled by the Kingdom of Denmark that Trump wants to annex because it looks really big on a distorted map. Trump reiterated early in the week that “we need Greenland” and his press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, observed that “utilizing the U.S. military is always an option” that Trump could use to secure it. Our good friend Stephen Miller, meanwhile, gave a characteristically unhinged interview, saying that the U.S. has a right to take Greenland because “we live in a world, in the real world … that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world since the beginning of time.” Buddy, this is CNN, not an Xbox headset.

At least there’s been reasonable pushback, with European leaders formally condemning the saber-rattling and observing that an attack on Greenland would mean the end of NATO (perhaps a feature, for elements of Trump’s administration). Senate Republicans, by Senate Republican standards, have also been forceful in their rejection of the idea. One possible defense of what Trump’s doing, though, is making threats as a means of getting Denmark to put Greenland up for sale. Can we observe, before the savvy negotiator spin takes hold, that purchasing Greenland would also be absurd? It could cost in the trillions at a time when the federal budget is calamitous, higher interest rates and inflation have returned, and there are better things—really, anything else—to spend trillions of dollars on. There are real national security interests and economic interests involved in Greenland. The way to manage that is not to conquer the island but to reach an agreement with Denmark, which was our friend up until about 10 minutes ago.

The Minnesota governor used to have a nice life. He put a solid 12 years into the House of Representatives then cruised to a comfy couple of terms as governor. Then, in 2024, he had to have the dotty idea to throw himself into contention for the vice presidency. Not good! It’s not just that he’ll forever be associated with a catastrophic presidential race for Democrats. It’s that the scrutiny returned home with him when he returned to Minnesota.

Walz withdrew his bid for a third gubernatorial campaign this week amid various social services fraud scandals in the state that have drawn national media attention and a federal probe from the Trump administration. (Fortunately for Minnesota Democrats nervous about scandals engulfing the party in the midterms, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who always puts up strong margins in statewide races, may swoop into the governor’s race.) That decision hardly allows Walz to slink away from the spotlight, though, as now Minnesota is embroiled in an escalating standoff with the administration over ICE. His peace and quiet are another long year away.

As the Surge wrote in a separate piece this week, the long-standing battle between interventionist Sen. Lindsey Graham and isolationist Sen. Rand Paul for Trump’s heart and mind took a dramatic turn in Graham’s favor when Trump sent the military into Venezuela to abduct its leader. Graham was waltzing around the Capitol with a grin on his face all week as if he had won the 250-year chess match of American politics once and for all. He even went out of his way to neener-neener Rand Paul, who was rather upset by the president’s interventionist turn, on social media.

Paul did have one move up his sleeve, though. He, along with Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, forced a vote on a war powers resolution that would block the president from further military action in Venezuela barring congressional approval. The measure, somewhat surprisingly, advanced on a procedural vote on Thursday as five Republicans joined all Democrats in supporting it. This infuriated Trump, who said that those five Republicans “should never be elected to office again.” Graham, meanwhile, said that he would try to convene a meeting of the Senate GOP “regarding Democrats’ efforts to restrict President Trump’s authority as Commander in Chief under the War Powers Act” concerning “the constitutional effect of the War Powers Act and the damage it will do to our national security.” Graham has had just about enough of Congress, the Article I branch of government to which Graham belongs, having a say in foreign policy.

Last year, Sen. Mark Kelly joined a handful of other Democrats in Congress in a video telling members of the military that they can refuse illegal orders. The administration took that personally. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth threatened Kelly’s retirement rank and pension for having the … the … the nerve to suggest that anyone could refuse to obey his illegal orders, calling it “seditious.” Earlier this week, then, Hegseth followed up and posted that the department had, in fact, “initiated retirement grade determination proceedings.” Most delightful, though, was his “letter of censure” to Kelly listing a bevy of offenses (various criticisms of the Trump administration) that disgraced the military. The censure letter, bless its heart, includes the line, “I hereby formally CENSURE you.” It’s a light and airy read.

The letter is more than a window into the Trump administration’s deep and dangerous insecurities. Mark Kelly was nearly selected to be Kamala Harris’ running mate in the 2024 election and, having dodged that bullet, must maintain some presidential ambitions. His flaw has always been that he’s a bit dry, though. So what better way to elevate his profile and spice up his credentials ahead of a Democratic presidential primary than a letter of censure (CENSURE) from the try-hard fitness instructor running the Pentagon?

With Nick Maduro sitting in the clink in Brooklyn, who’s going to run Venezuela? (Under the watchful eye of Secretary of State Marco Rubio, of course). The administration’s plan, at least for now, is to leave the existing Chavista regime in place under Maduro’s vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, so long as she does everything the United States wants. When Trump was asked early in the weak why he wouldn’t push to install the opposition leader, María Corina Machado, instead, he said that while “she’s a very nice woman,” she “doesn’t have the support within, or the respect within, the country.”

The administration’s overriding interest is in restructuring Venezuela as a colony, not making it a democracy, and the CIA determined that replacing the existing regime right now would be more trouble than it’s worth. But it didn’t break Trump’s heart to deny Machado control of the country. Machado won the Nobel Peace Prize last year after Trump had campaigned for it. The Washington Post, citing sources close to Trump, reported that this effectively killed her chances of running Venezuela after Maduro’s ouster. “If she had turned it down and said, ‘I can’t accept it because it’s Donald Trump’s,’ ” one source said, “she’d be the president of Venezuela today.” Trump and Machado are nevertheless expected to meet soon, and Machado has said she would be willing to present her prize to Trump to express her gratitude. Trump liked the sound of that and said it would be a “great honor” to accept it. The world could not be more odd right now.

On Thursday, 17 House Republicans joined all Democrats to extend expired Affordable Care Act subsidies for another three years. This vote was made possible through use of a discharge petition, through which a majority of members can force a vote on a bill against House leadership’s wishes, and allows vulnerable Republican members to at least say that they tried. And while this particular bill is dead on arrival in the Senate, it does put pressure on Senate Republicans to address rising premiums in some way—or absorb the political blowback from failing to.

So what is Senate Majority Leader John Thune to do? The Senate has convened bipartisan working group trying to develop an extension that tightens subsidy eligibility. One of the stickiest points, as ever with ACA subsidies, is abortion. Republicans want more stringent Hyde Amendment protections in ACA plans to ensure that federal dollars would never even consider comingling with payments for abortion services. How does this get resolved? Perhaps with some browbeating from Trump. “You have to be a little flexible on Hyde, you know that,” Trump told House Republicans at a gathering this week. We’re not sure they know that at all.

You saw it. We all saw it. We all saw what happened in Minneapolis when an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good for the crime of being in her car. This week on Amicus, Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern attempt to digest this week’s horrific events and wonder if there is even a possibility of justice. Dahlia recommends “They Didn’t Even Need A Deepfake” by Slate’s Molly Olmstead.

Later in the show, Mark speaks with Brian Finucane, a senior advisor to the International Crisis Group. He spent a decade in the U.S. State Department’s Office of the Legal Adviser. Brian and Mark discuss the lawlessness of Trump’s foreign policy (cough cough, Venezuela), and how the administration’s approach embraces some of the worst aspects of tough-guy masculinity.

“That’s fine, dude, I’m not mad at you,” Renee Nicole Macklin Good told Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross seconds before he shot and killed her in Minneapolis on Wednesday. Good’s last words are memorialized in newly released video footage seemingly taken by Ross on a cellphone as he circled her car. So are the last words Ross—or possibly another ICE officer—spoke to her as she lay dead or dying: “Fucking bitch.”

The video clearly portrays Good as a calm presence and ICE as a menacing one, which means it does not make good on the narrative conservatives have been spinning about Good’s death, claiming that she hit Ross with her car and he killed her in self-defense. And yet the leaked video was published by Alpha News, a right-wing media company based in Minnesota, that previously produced a falsehood-ridden documentary downplaying police culpability in George Floyd’s murder. Why would this kind of outlet decide to post a video that’s so sympathetic to Good?

In the days since Good’s death, the right has been trying to paint her as an agitator, a radical, a violent domestic terrorist. Though she certainly does not come off as such in the video, the footage does make clear that she was on that street to protest ICE. To many on the right, this makes her a disposable casualty in Donald Trump’s war on immigrants. Conservatives can point to this video to say that Good refused to follow orders to “get out of the fucking car,” making her culpable for her own death. There is no rule of proportionality in the MAGA universe: Any left-leaning protest activity or civil disobedience is grounds for assassination.

But the real reason for Alpha News’ decision may lie in the second half of the video, after Good tells the officer she isn’t mad at him. Good’s wife, Becca, is shown walking outside the car, filming Ross on her own phone. She identifies herself as a U.S. citizen and lightly mocks Ross for filming their license plates. “You want to come at us? I say go get yourself some lunch, big boy,” she says. Then she makes a move to get in the passenger seat, seemingly in preparation for the couple to vacate the area.

Becca is a clockable queer woman. She establishes Good as a member of a minority currently being demonized by Republicans as dangerous to children and a threat to society. This brands Good and her grieving widow as marginal Americans, not citizens of the country Trump and his followers are trying to protect. The administration is waging a war on empathy, and Good’s politics and identity placed her on the wrong side of the battle lines.

If you’re at all familiar with the language used by GOP leaders to dehumanize queer people—“groomer,” “tr***y”—it’s easy to view this video through the eyes of the MAGA faithful. You won’t see two mothers with full, precious lives who deserve to drive away from that street alive. Instead, they’re just a couple of brash dykes who got exactly what they deserved for standing in Trump’s way.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee Nicole Good while she attempted to drive away from an immigration enforcement operation in Minneapolis on Wednesday. Videos show Ross using unjustified force against Good, a 37-year-old mother and poet, when he appeared to be in no imminent danger. Yet the Trump administration immediately defended the murder, defaming Good as a “domestic terrorist,” asserting absolute immunity for Ross, and obstructing a state investigation into the incident. This defense came on the heels of the administration’s declaration that Congress could not limit its military actions in Venezuela, claiming that the president has inherent constitutional power to invade foreign countries.

On this week’s episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discuss how Good’s killing was not an aberration, but the logical end point of the administration’s theory of power—one fortified by the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity decision. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: I want to look back at the ways in which the events of the last week, aggregated across the events of the last couple of months, keep demonstrating Donald Trump’s absolutely limitless claims of power to do anything—to determine international law, to determine domestic law, to decide when there’s an emergency. There are no boundaries. That’s why the two bookended events in Venezuela and in Minnesota sit so heavily on us: We are hearing J.D. Vance and Stephen Miller and Kristi Noem and the president all claim, over and over again, some version of: The president can deport, bomb, arrest anyone he wants. He can invade sovereign nations. He can take over Greenland. He can do whatever he wants. So nobody should be surprised at the resounding claim that his agents can kill people in cold blood, and they’re immune from any scrutiny.

I want to go back to the conversation you and I had after Trump v. United States, which the Supreme Court wrote in these very bloodless terms about the immunity conferred upon the president within the outer and inner perimeters of his “official acts.” And I want to layer that against the image of a family car splattered in the blood of a mother gunned down for no good reason, including the reasons being proffered in defense of the murder. In some ways, I feel like this is the answer to the question that has been plaguing us since we started talking about the immunity case, which is: What does the law even mean when one man is given immunity that he can extend to his cronies and deploy against his enemies? When all of this gets made up on the fly as Trump sees fit, and without limits—beyond, as he told the New York Times this week, the outer boundaries of his conscience? How do we even think about this as a matter of “law”?

Mark Joseph Stern: I think when people in our profession see horrible murders like this—then watch the president claim it was justified because the victim was a “domestic terrorist”—there’s a temptation to process it through legal reasoning. To say: No, that’s not right. But you miss the point if you fail to look at the bigger picture. Because the lawyers crafting some of these statements for Trump know that what they’re saying is false. They know that Minnesota has jurisdiction to investigate this crime. They’re just lying about it. And at a certain point, it does seem foolish to keep arguing the legal logic when it is irrelevant to the people in charge.

The first and clearest sign we got about this came in March, when the Justice Department said that Judge James Boasberg’s investigation into unlawful deportation must yield to “the mandate of the electorate.” As if Trump’s election bestowed upon him a kind of sovereign power, not just as head of the executive branch, but as the personification of the American people’s will. So when anybody tries to stand in his way, they have to be pushed aside. Just this past week, congressional Republicans escalated their effort to impeach Judge Boasberg and remove him from the bench because he dared to resist the “mandate of the electorate” and say, Actually, laws still matter.

We can hold both truths in our heads: Laws matter, but not to this administration, so there will always be a limit to the legal arguments made against it. We have to insist that in this country nobody can ever claim that they have some kind of freestanding authority to deport, to bomb, to murder because they were elected by the American people. Yes, Trump won the election; that does not mean that he can send his goon squads in with masks and assault rifles and start shooting moms and motorists and anybody perceived as a threat.

Unfortunately, that is how the Supreme Court seemed to imply that law might work in its immunity decision when it stripped presidential conduct of factual context and insulated “official acts” from real accountability. And I believe that’s the key source of this administration’s extralegal logic. I remember Justice Neil Gorsuch saying, during those arguments, that he didn’t much care about the details of Trump trying to steal the 2020 election, because the court was writing “a rule for the ages.” And how that rule for the ages cashes out is Renee Good getting shot in the head, her blood splattered over her kid’s stuffed animals in the family car. That’s how the “rule for the ages” ends up transforming our country into a place where Hispanic people have to carry proof of citizenship and any protester can be executed for no reason.

All of this flows from the president’s own claim to represent the ultimate will of the people, to have total immunity for himself and his agents for any kind of criminal wrongdoing. When Trump started bombing the boats, we should have known that it would very quickly lead to his agents assassinating American citizens in the streets. And there has to be a groundswell of opposition to this conception of the law, because if you squint, you can see how they’re trying to call this “law.” It’s the “law” as whatever the president claims is necessary and correct, as he told the New York Times—whatever he believes the country needs, that becomes legal. We have to refuse to buy into the shared reality that the White House is demanding we all buy into.

I’ve been thinking a lot about one of the tropes we saw after the Minnesota shooting—a lot of people seemed to say: Wait, she’s a mom, just like me! She was at school drop-off, just like me! And not that long ago, an appeals court judge talking about the president renditioning people to CECOT said: If they designate anybody as a gang member, they can do it to me. For a lot of us, that seemed like a stretch, right? You’re a federal appeals court judge. Nobody’s going to rendition you to CECOT.

But the category error you’re identifying isn’t “The victim reminds me of me this time and therefore I’m horrified.” It’s that once you give the president the right to declare that people are gang members or drug runners or domestic terrorists—once you have the power to designate entire classes of people, like Somalis and Haitians, as enemies of the state—it can happen to you. I really want to lift that up as a way to think about why we are horrified at what happened to Renee Good. It’s not simply because her life is familiar to us. It’s because the taking of her life has been batted away on the grounds that she is of a class of people that’s subhuman and thus not deserving of the protections of the law. And we all need to realize that if the president can do this to her, the president can do it to me.

I guess what makes me despair is that, of course, everything you just said is correct, but it’s a lesson that we have to keep learning over and over again somehow. People always trot out Martin Niemöller’s poem about the Holocaust—first they came for them, and I didn’t speak out; then they came for me. I fear that we’ve reached the end of the usefulness of that poem, because what we’ve seen is that people have endless excuses for why it won’t be them. They think we live in a different time. We’ve learned it. We can move on.

But we haven’t learned it. Because there are still many people on the right, it seems, who defend the execution of Renee Good, even if they could relate to her on some level. There are a lot of moms out there who are MAGA, who voted for Donald Trump, and who evidently support this murder. So even now, they can’t make the connection that if it could happen to that woman, it could happen to me. I don’t know how we fix that. I really don’t have an answer. Many people just do not have the appropriate fear that we have handed the power over to this president to kill almost anyone he wants.

The videos of Renee Nicole Good’s killing are the stuff of nightmares. On Wednesday, according to footage shot by bystanders, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross appears to shoot Good in the face at point-blank range while she attempts to drive away from another ICE agent prying at her car door. Her wife was reportedly in the seat beside her. “We stopped to videotape, and they shot her in the head,” Good’s wife sobs in one of the most upsetting videos from the encounter. “We have a 6-year-old at school.”

The normal reaction to this incident is horror, rage, and sorrow. A woman is dead, killed by the government under unimaginably traumatic circumstances, her wife mere inches away. She leaves behind three children. Photos from the scene of her death show kids’ toys spilling out of her glove compartment.

The response from Republican officials seemed to describe a different event altogether. This wasn’t a poet, wife, and mother whose life was cut short by a bullet, but, according to Donald Trump, a “professional agitator” who “violently, willfully, and viciously” ran over her killer. (She didn’t.) In lockstep, GOP leaders lied about Good’s death and to absolve Ross of culpability, then demonized his victim. In their tale, Good was a domestic terrorist who was responsible for her own death. When GOP Sen. Pete Ricketts was asked for his reaction to the shooting on Newsmax, he said, “it’s terrible.” Not Good’s death, mind you, but “these attacks on law enforcement.”

Among their base, today’s GOP is trying to drum out any natural impulses toward compassion, such that there is no imperative to feel—let alone express—any dismay at the killing of an ideological adversary. If Good wasn’t on Trump’s side, the party line goes, she got what was coming to her. The rush to defend Ross is more than a political move to justify Trump’s personal militia run amok. It’s another round in the right wing’s mounting war on empathy.

For the past few years, influential Christian conservatives have been loudly proclaiming that empathy is toxic, a sin, and a tool of the devil. In their view, progressives use the human inclination to care for others as a way to sway evangelicals toward liberal causes, such as tackling racism or saving USAID, the dissolution of which some analysts say has already caused the deaths of 500,000 children worldwide. The innate desire among well-adjusted people to wish their neighbors happy, healthy lives is a political liability for the party of Medicaid cuts, SNAP freezes, ICE raids, refugee bans, and forced childbirth. Elon Musk has called empathy “the fundamental weakness of Western civilization.”

J.D. Vance has endorsed this perspective, too. In a Fox News interview last year, he laid out a warped version of a medieval Catholic doctrine, ordo amoris, to defend the administration’s brutal crackdown on immigrants. “You love your family, and then you love your neighbor, and then you love your community, and then you love your fellow citizens in your own country,” Vance said. “And then after that, you can focus and prioritize the rest of the world.” (Pope Francis later published a letter condemning the deportations that seemed to directly reject Vance’s view: “Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons and groups.”)

In this worldview, anyone who poses a danger to those within the inner circles of human worthiness does not warrant much empathy. And it’s easy enough to argue that just about anyone is a threat to one’s family, town, or country, thus exempting them from our responsibilities of care. A drag queen, let’s say. A liberal judge. Someone wearing a Zohran Mamdani T-shirt at the grocery store. A concerned Minnesotan who stopped to film the agents plucking people out of her community.

Once a person is no longer worthy of empathy, they become a justifiable casualty in service to any political aim. There is no need to consider proportionality; killing someone for distracting ICE agents is just as defensible as ending a life on a battlefield. From the right’s perspective, Good’s political views made her fair game, so her gruesome, untimely death by the gun of a masked federal agent need not be met with outrage or remorse. Any empathy for her or her family imperils a greater project: cleansing Minneapolis of immigrants.

It’s a short distance from believing someone’s death is unworthy of mourning to believing they deserved to die, and a short distance from there to inciting more death. The Trump administration’s knee-jerk defense of the ICE agent who killed Good bears echoes of Kyle Rittenhouse, the right-wing wannabe vigilante who, at 17, traveled across state lines to fight Black Lives Matter protesters and ended up killing two of them. In the six years since then, Rittenhouse has become a GOP hero—and, wouldn’t you know, he chimed in just a few hours after Good died. “After thinking about it, should I travel across the state line to Minnesota?” he posted on X with a laughing emoji.

The instinct to recoil at the killing of a fellow person, and to feel some vicarious pain as we consider the loss, is part of what makes us human. Historically, we have pathologized people who lack such impulses; they are known as psychopaths, and their qualities have been deemed incompatible with a functioning society. Empathy is the bedrock of what it means to have a society. To live together under some form of shared governance, we have to start from a place of believing our neighbors should not be shot dead in their cars, and being upset when they are.

Over the past two days, as Republican officials have applauded Ross for killing Good, they have repeatedly lied about the videos of the shooting, insulting the intelligence of observers who know what it looks like to be run over by a car. The lies have been instantaneous, effortless, and shameless: Just look at this photo of Trump aide Natalie Harp in the Oval Office, smugly playing a video for assembled New York Times reporters, as if she could convince them they were seeing something they were not.

Every falsehood spun by Trump and his acolytes is an attempt to degrade their followers’ capacity for empathy past the point of flinching at an innocent woman’s death. The goal is to diminish the ghastliness of Good’s death, and with it, the value of her life.

The scale extends far beyond these high-profile cases: the NCSC reports that 40 percent of attacks it managed between September 2020 and August 2021 targeted the public sector, a figure expected to grow.

Given this threat landscape, why does the UK&#39;s flagship Cyber Security and Resilience (CSR) Bill exclude both central and local government?

Sir Oliver Dowden, former digital secretary and current shadow deputy PM, led calls in the House of Commons this week urging Labour to rethink its stance on excluding central government from the Cyber Security and Resilience (CSR) Bill.

&quot;I would just urge the minister, as this bill passes through Parliament, to look again at that point, and I think there is a case for putting more stringent requirements on the public sector in order to force ministers&#39; minds on that point.&quot;

The CSR bill was announced days into Sir Keir Starmer&#39;s tenure as Prime Minister, aiming to provide an essential refresh of the country&#39;s heavily outdated NIS 2018 regulations.

It proposed to bring managed service providers into scope, as was scheduled in 2022 before those plans fell by the wayside, and datacenters, among many other aspects.

Parallels can be drawn with the EU&#39;s NIS2. However, the CSR bill&#39;s scope is narrower, excluding public authorities, unlike the EU&#39;s equivalent regulatory refresh.

Ian Murray, minister of state across two government departments and responsible, in part, for data policy and public sector reform, thanked Dowden for his suggestions and promised to take them on board.

In responding to the shadow deputy PM, Murray also pointed to the Government Cyber Action Plan, which it launched hours before the CSR bill was set for a second reading in the Commons.

This plan will ostensibly hold government departments to equal security standards as the CSR bill... just without any of the legal obligations.

Cynics may see it as a tool to quell any criticisms of the bill&#39;s scope not extending to central government, all without making any hard security commitments.

As Dowden noted in the Commons on Tuesday, cybersecurity is a matter that is often deprioritized quickly in government. &quot;I welcome the minister&#39;s comments about the obligation on the public sector. However, I would caution him that, in my experience, cybersecurity is one of those things that ministers talk about but then other priorities overtake it. And the advantage of legislative requirements is that it forces ministers to think about it.&quot;

&quot;I do think that more pressure needs to be brought to bear on ministers in terms of their accountability for cybersecurity. I fear that if we don&#39;t put this into primary legislation, it&#39;s something that can slip further and further down ministers&#39; in-trays. Whilst [some] ministers may have a desire to address it, other, more pressing, immediate problems distract their attention.&quot;

One could argue that if the government is serious about holding itself to the same standards as the critical service providers in scope of the CSR bill, it would just bring itself and local authorities also into scope.

Neil Brown, director at British law firm decoded.legal, told The Register: &quot;The argument is that government departments will be held to standards equivalent to those set out in the bill, and so do not need to be included. This does not fill me with confidence.

&quot;If the government is going to hold itself to standards equivalent to those set out in the bill, then it has nothing to fear from being included in the bill since, by definition, it will be compliant.&quot;

Labour MP Matt Western, who also chairs the National Security Strategy joint committee, suggested that the CSR bill would not be a cure-all, but the first of many pieces of bespoke legislation the government will pass to improve national security.

This suggests the government is considering specific legislation to shore up public sector security further down the line. Perhaps this is wishful thinking.

Brown told us &quot;separate legislation does not sound like a terrible idea,&quot; and notes that existing UK telecoms law is separated for effect.

The Telecommunications (Security) Act 2021 and the Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Act 2022, for example, both seek to improve security in the telco space, but target different organizations. Security requirements often differ between types of organization, so potentially reserving a public sector-specific cybersecurity bill could be the way to go.

Ministers&#39; plans also include a provision in the bill to introduce new legislative amendments as needed, to meet the demands of a rapidly shifting cybersecurity landscape, leaving behind the Brexit-related hindrances that delayed the previous NIS updates in the first place.

However, the likelihood of being able to deliver on effective legislative amendments at pace is uncertain.

Arguably, if the government wanted to do it correctly, it would carry out a comprehensive (and lengthy) industry consultation before pushing any amendments through the two Houses, another typically arduous process.

Whether this way of iterating on existing law could balance speed with comprehensiveness in unanswered.

For Brown, the approach taken by Labour – to legislate in smaller steps – seems like the smarter choice.

&quot;My preference is to legislate little and often, iterating as needed, rather than trying to create one piece of legislation which is all things to all people,&quot; he says. &quot;Legislation inevitably entails compromise, and often reflects the divergent interests of numerous interested parties (including lobbying groups) – I look, for instance, at the Online Safety Act 2023. Smaller bills/acts, more targeted in scope, responding to a clearly-articulated problem statement, seems more sensible to me.

&quot;As to whether the CSR would result in a better outcome than NIS2, I&#39;m afraid I do not know.&quot;

Given the scale of the cyber threat facing the UK&#39;s public sector, failing to account for this in the CSR bill could open the government up to intense scrutiny.

The National Audit Office&#39;s report into UK government security improvements in January 2025 laid bare the sorry state of its systems. Of the 72 most critical systems run by various departments, 58 were reviewed; auditors found a litany of security flaws across them and noted a staggeringly slow pace at which the issues were being addressed.

That is not an assessment which goes hand-in-hand with a public sector free from regular cyberattacks.

Each time a central authority, arm&#39;s-length body, local council, or NHS trust is compromised, the government&#39;s decision not to include the public sector within the scope of the CSR bill hands the opposition another opportunity to question its commitment to cybersecurity.

Labour does, at least, have some ammo to fire back if this scenario were to ever become reality, with the Conservatives having failed to enact the cybersecurity recommendations from its 2022 consultation, despite having had more than two years to do so.

Even with the government&#39;s Cyber Action Plan, its reluctance to bring the public sector into the scope of its flagship cyber legislation fails to inspire any confidence that it has serious ambitions to improve security in this problem area. ®

            <h2>Artificial brains could point the way to ultra-efficient supercomputers</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/09/artificial_brains_supercomputer/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">New research from Sandia National Laboratories suggests that brain-inspired neuromorphic computers are just as adept at solving complex mathematical equations as they are at speeding up neural networks and could eventually pave the way to ultra-efficient supercomputers.

Running on around 20 watts, the human brain is able to process vast quantities of sensory information from our environment without interrupting consciousness. For decades, researchers have been trying to replicate these processes in silicon, in what is commonly referred to as neuromorphic computing.

Sandia has been at the center of much of this research. The lab has deployed numerous neuromorphic systems from the likes of Intel, SpiNNaker, and IBM over the past several years.

Much of the research around these systems has focused on things like artificial intelligence and machine learning. But as it turns out, these brain-inspired chips are much more versatile.

The brain is performing complex computations even if we don&#39;t realize it, researchers James Aimone and Brad Theilman explained in a recent Sandia news release.

&quot;Pick any sort of motor control task — like hitting a tennis ball or swinging a bat at a baseball. These are very sophisticated computations. They are exascale-level problems that our brains are capable of doing very cheaply,&quot; Aimone explained.

In a paper recently published in the journal Nature Machine Intelligence, the boffins at Sandia demonstrated a novel algorithm for efficiently running a class of problems called partial differential equations (PDEs) on neuromorphic computers, including Intel&#39;s Loihi 2 neurochips.

PDEs are at the heart of some of the most complex scientific computing workloads today. They&#39;re used to model all manner of phenomena including electrostatic forces between molecules, the flow of water through a turbine, and the way radio frequencies propagate through buildings, the researchers explain.

These problems can be incredibly computationally demanding, often requiring the full grunt of modern supercomputers to solve. Neuromorphic computing presents a potential alternative that promises to be far more efficient if it can be made to scale reliably.

While still in their infancy, neuromorphic computers have already demonstrated strong efficiency gains over conventional CPU- and GPU-based systems. Intel&#39;s Loihi 2 systems deployed in Sandia&#39;s Hala Point and Oheo Gulch systems are reportedly capable of delivering 15 TOPS per watt of efficiency, around 2.5x that of modern GPUs like Nvidia&#39;s Blackwell chips.

More modern systems, such as the SpiNNaker2-based system deployed at Sandia last summer, tout even greater efficiency, claiming 18x higher performance per watt than modern GPUs.

As exciting as that might sound, the in-memory compute architecture inherent to neuromorphics is notoriously difficult to program, often requiring researchers to invent new algorithms for existing processes.

Here, the researchers were able to develop an algorithm called NeuroFEM, which implements the finite element method (FEM) commonly used to solve PDEs on spiking neuromorphic hardware. Perhaps more importantly, this research wasn&#39;t just theoretical, though, as we understand it the PDEs being solved here are intended more as a proof of concept than to demonstrate neuromorphic superiority.

The researchers were able to solve PDEs using actual neuromorphic hardware, specifically, Intel&#39;s Oheo Gulch system, which features 32 of its Loihi 2 neurochips.

In testing, the lab demonstrated near ideal strong scaling, which means that each time the core count is doubled, the time to solution is halved. This scaling isn&#39;t immune to Amdahl&#39;s law, which describes the limit to which workloads can be efficiently parallelized. But in testing, NeuroFEM was still shown to be 99 percent parallelizable.

What&#39;s more, the paper&#39;s authors argue the algorithm mitigates many of the programmability problems with neuromorphic systems.

&quot;An important benefit of this approach is that it enables direct use of neuromorphic hardware on a broad class of numerical applications with almost no additional work for the user,&quot; they wrote. &quot;The user friendliness of spiking neuromorphic hardware has long been recognized as a serious limitation to broader adoption and our results directly mitigate this problem.&quot;

By moving to an analog-based neuromorphic system - Loihi 2 is still a digital computer - the researchers speculate that even more complex PDEs could be solved even faster while also using less power.

With that said, neuromorphics may not be the only path forward. Researchers are increasingly exploring ways to use machine learning and generative AI surrogate models to accelerate conventional HPC problems.

&quot;It remains an open question whether neuromorphic hardware can outperform GPUs on deep neural networks, which have largely evolved to benefit from GPUs&#39; single instruction, multiple data architecture,&quot; the researchers wrote. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Accenture is betting that the future of retail will run through AI with an investment in Profitmind, an agent-based platform that automates pricing decisions, inventory management, and planning.

&quot;Profitmind bridges the gap between insight and action through agentic AI,&quot; Accenture global retail lead Jill Standish said in a statement that announced Accenture&#39;s buy in. &quot;It mirrors how retailers run their businesses, linking data from multiple sources for clear, prioritized recommendations that can be trusted and executed quickly in response to an increasingly competitive industry.&quot;

Neither party released the terms of the investment. Accenture Ventures, the company&#39;s venture capital arm that focuses on early stage startups in AI, provided the funding.

&quot;Profitmind brings a transformative technology that identifies and quantifies performance opportunities across a retail business,&quot; the startup&#39;s CEO Mark Chrystal told The Register via email. &quot;Because AI is increasingly automating merchandising and pricing, you need a system like Profitmind to stay on top of the market and respond to it. Further, Profitmind, within its Marketing Agent, has the ability to create Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) optimized product copy that increases the likelihood that AI search agents will find and recommend their products.&quot;

Count Salesforce among those who agree that the next wave of retail will be dependent on AI, both behind the scenes and in front of the customers.

The CRM platform released a look at online holiday sales data on Thursday that it says shows 2025 marked a turning point for AI-assisted shopping as the share of global and US traffic from third-party AI search doubled over last year.

The study found that AI and AI agents drove $262 billion, or about 20 percent of 2025&#39;s holiday spend amid what it said was a record breaking year for online sales that amounted to $1.29 trillion globally.

Salesforce said that, even amid higher prices, online holiday sales grew seven percent globally and four percent in the US where online sales reached $294 billion. And organizations which deployed their own AI agents – Pandora, SharkNinja and Funko – saw an average growth of 6.2 percent in holiday sales year over year, compared to 3.9 percent growth among those companies that did not.

&quot;Beyond answering their questions, these agents also took direct action on behalf of customers, handling 142% more tasks than they had in the prior two months. These tasks include updating delivery addresses and initiating returns, which are manual, resource-intensive tasks for human reps,&quot; Salesforce&#39;s study found.

Chrystal said that the Salesforce study reinforces the need for his platform which monitors the prices, assortments, and marketing of competitors in real-time. He also posited that, by teaming with Accenture, the company can scale to global customers and identify areas where they need to build new capabilities.

&quot;Accenture brings their expertise in transformation, business process change, implementation and business case development,&quot; he told us via email. &quot;Together, we believe we offer the full capability set to both deliver tools and transformation to positively impact any retail business.&quot;

During the National Retail Federation show next week, Microsoft will demonstrate Profitmind deployed on Azure at its booth. Redmond will also explain how its customers can gain faster access and support for the implementation of Profitmind through their partnership platform, Chrystal said. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">While watching us now seems like the least of its sins, the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was once best known (and despised) for its multi-billion-dollar surveillance tech budget.

Clever hackers and digital privacy advocates are fighting back against the snooping activities of Kristi Noem&#39;s masked agents. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has rounded up several of these counter surveillance projects, and perhaps unsurprisingly many of these have to do with Flock, best known for its automated license plate reader (ALPR).

Flock operates the largest network of surveillance cameras in America, and, while it has contracts with thousands of police departments and municipalities across the US, sometimes ICE gains access to this footage, according to US Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) and those who have looked into Flock&#39;s misuse.

We should also note that EFF and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) have sued the city of San Jose, California, over its alleged abuses of this technology.

One YouTuber discovered a way to prevent your license plate being recorded and logged by Flock&#39;s AI readers by screen printing &quot;tiny bits&quot; of adversarial noise and putting the sticker on your license plate. These &quot;abstract invisible license plate overlay patterns … cannot be detected by humans but make license plate recognition systems utterly shit the bed,&quot; Benn Jordan said on his video.

We&#39;ll note that this is illegal in California and some other states, and The Register does not advocate breaking the law.

Jordan also uncovered a massive Flock security snafu involving hundreds of misconfigured Flock cameras that exposed non-password protected admin interfaces to the public internet, allowing anyone to view live surveillance feeds, download videos, and view logs. &quot;Like a Netflix for stalkers,&quot; is how Jordan described it.

There are also open source tools like deflock.me, which has mapped more than 61,000 license plate readers in the US, and alpr.watch, which scans local city council and other meeting agendas for keywords like &quot;flock,&quot; &quot;license plate reader,&quot; and &quot;alpr,&quot; and more. It then maps where these meetings are happening so people can attend, and you can sign up for email alerts in your area.

Plus, apps including Stop ICE Alerts, ICEOUT.org, and ICEBlock allow users to report local ICE sightings.

Apple delisted ICEBlock from the App Store in the fall after the Trump administration turned up the heat on the iThings maker. Its developer, Joshua Aaron, has sued Attorney General Pam Bondi, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, ICE director Todd Lyons, and others, accusing them of infringing on his First Amendment right to free speech.

Also in response to the ban, the EFF filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit to disclose federal government officials&#39; communications with tech companies aimed at removing immigration enforcement apps and websites.

In October, Apple also banned Eyes Up, an app to securely record and archive ICE raids. But it&#39;s still available on Google Play.

&quot;It&#39;s important to remember that we are not powerless,&quot; EFF security researcher Cooper Quintin wrote. &quot;Even in the face of a domestic law enforcement presence with massive surveillance capabilities and military-esque technologies, there are still ways to engage in surveillance self-defense.&quot;

Now, if ICE would just stop shooting people. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Talk about letting things go! Ninety-six percent of software developers believe AI-generated code isn&#39;t functionally correct, yet only 48 percent say they always check code generated with AI assistance before committing it.

This conveniently self-validating statistic comes from Sonar, a company that sells code review and verification software, in its State of Code Developer Survey.

Based on data from more than 1,100 developers worldwide, the survey finds that AI coding tools have become the norm, with 72 percent of developers who have tried these tools using them every day or multiple times a day. And only six percent report occasional usage, meaning less than once a week.

Devs say 42 percent of their code includes significant assistance from AI models, a share they expect will reach 65 percent by 2027, up from just six percent in 2023.

The types of software projects where these developers are using AI tools range from prototypes (88 percent) to internal production software (83 percent), production software for customer-facing applications (73 percent), and production software for critical business services (58 percent).

The most commonly used code tools are: GitHub Copilot (75 percent), ChatGPT (74 percent), Claude/Claude Code (48 percent), Gemini/Duet AI (37 percent), Cursor (31 percent), Perplexity (21 percent), OpenAI Codex (21 percent), JetBrains (17 percent), Amazon Q Developer (12 percent), Windsurf (8 percent), and others (37 percent).

But the growing usage of AI tooling has, according to Sonar, created a verification bottleneck.

&quot;This verification step isn&#39;t trivial,&quot; the report says. &quot;While AI is supposed to save time, developers are spending a significant portion of that saved time on review. Nearly all developers (95 percent) spend at least some effort reviewing, testing, and correcting AI output. A majority (59 percent) rate that effort as &#39;moderate&#39; or &#39;substantial.&#39;&quot;

According to the survey, 38 percent of respondents said reviewing AI-generated code requires more effort than reviewing human-generated code, compared to 27 percent who said the opposite.

&quot;We are witnessing a fundamental shift in software engineering where value is no longer defined by the speed of writing code, but by the confidence in deploying it,&quot; said Tariq Shaukat, CEO of Sonar, in a statement. &quot;While AI has made code generation nearly effortless, it has created a critical trust gap between output and deployment.&quot;

Sonar cites remarks by Amazon CTO Werner Vogels to buttress the company&#39;s argument for more robust code verification.

Speaking at AWS re:Invent 2025, Vogels said, &quot;Now, the world is changing. You will write less code, &#39;cause generation is so fast, you will review more code because understanding it takes time. And when you write a code yourself, comprehension comes with the act of creation. When the machine writes it, you&#39;ll have to rebuild that comprehension during review. That&#39;s what&#39;s called verification debt.&quot;

That, said Vogels, is one of the two challenges he hears about from developers. The other, he explained, is hallucination. That&#39;s the anthropomorphic term for the tendency of AI models to make errors.

There are other challenges though for the companies employing these developers. Thirty-five percent of devs report using AI coding tools from personal accounts rather than corporate ones – perhaps unsurprising given Microsoft&#39;s recent call to take personal Copilot subscriptions to work, a position it subsequently argued against.

Developers say the shift toward AI tools has both benefits (93 percent) and drawbacks (88 percent). They appreciate, for example, that AI helps make the documentation process better (57 percent) and helps with creating test coverage (53 percent). They&#39;re less thrilled about code that looks correct but isn&#39;t (53 percent) or is unneeded or redundant (40 percent).

The report also notes that despite 75 percent of developers saying that AI reduces the amount of unwanted toil (managing technical debt, debugging legacy or poorly documented code, etc.), the reality is that AI tools just shift that work to new areas, like &quot;correcting or rewriting code created by AI coding tools.&quot;

&quot;Interestingly, the amount of time spent on toil (an average of 23-25 percent) stays almost exactly the same for developers who use AI coding tools frequently and for those who use them less often,&quot; the report says. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">From disposable electric candy to voice-activated refrigerators without physical handles, CES was crammed full of enshittified, intrusive, insecure, and wasteful technology this year – just like it is every year.

As regularly as bad tech shows up in Las Vegas in January, Repair.org and its allies in the repairability and tech responsibility movement were there to award a list of the worst things on display this year.

As was the case in 2025, there&#39;s a lot of AI on this list – but not just AI. There&#39;s some literal garbage on it, too.

Public Interest Research Group&#39;s right to repair campaign director Nathan Proctor had an obvious choice to make when it came to the worst environmental impact: Lollipop Star.

Literally a piece of e-waste in waiting, Lollipop Stars are suckers with an integrated battery and tiny speaker that, when placed in one&#39;s mouth, transmit sound through jaw vibrations, delivering what the brand calls &quot;music you can taste.&quot;

The device is non-rechargeable, gets about 60 minutes of battery life, plays a single song, and once the sucker is gone, it&#39;s garbage.

&quot;We need to stop making so many disposable electronics which are full of toxic chemicals, require critical minerals to produce, and can burn down waste facilities,&quot; Proctor said, noting that there are thousands of garbage fires every year due to improper disposal of batteries.

A Chinese company called Merach was in Las Vegas this week showing off its smart treadmill that comes with a conversational AI coach. In and of itself, that&#39;s nothing special – there&#39;s plenty of smart home fitness equipment with embedded AI available.

As Secure Resilient Future Foundation president and Securepairs founder Paul Roberts pointed out, it&#39;s not the tech that earned the worst in show cybersecurity award this year – it&#39;s the company&#39;s outright statement that your data just isn&#39;t safe.

&quot;In addition to personal information, network and online behavior, financial information … Merach&#39;s treadmills are also collecting biometric data, fitness and performance data, and the inferences that can be drawn from that information,&quot; Roberts explained in a video highlighting the ignominious awardees.

&quot;That&#39;s not surprising, but what is surprising was the security statement,&quot; Roberts continued, pointing to the Merach&#39;s privacy policy, which includes the rather bold admission that &quot;we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.&quot;

That alone, said Roberts, was enough to earn a place in the list.

Ever want to put a surveillance device on your desk that you can pretend is your girlfriend? No?

Well, neither did those who weighed in on the people&#39;s choice award for CES 2026 worst in show, which was awarded to the Lepro Ami AI &quot;Soulmate.&quot;

Take that creepy Stan Lee hologram, shrink it down to fit on your desk, and turn it into an anime waifu and you have the Lepro Ami AI. As CES visitors pointed out, it has an always-on camera and microphone, and while one can physically shutter the camera, users weren&#39;t impressed with the mental health-damaging privacy intrusion that is this unnecessary device.

Tech critic Cory Doctorow, who coined the term &quot;enshittification&quot; to describe how once-useful tech gradually becomes worse for users in a bid to extract maximum profit, was the natural choice to present the 2026 enshittification award. He handed it out to German tech firm Bosch for its eBike antitheft system that&#39;s basically just a parts-pairing nightmare waiting to happen.

Per Bosch, the new system allows users to report their eBikes as stolen through a mobile app, which is configured with serial numbers of the components on the bike. This naturally requires all the eBike&#39;s components to be registered to a specific user.

The catch? Bosch has total control over how parts are registered and reused.

&quot;Bosch can flip a switch and then you wouldn&#39;t be able to do independent repair using parts unless Bosch says they like the part that you were using,&quot; Doctorow said. &quot;Every manufacturer that started with parts pairing said they were fighting theft and counterfeiting and ended up using it to block independent repair.&quot;

We reported on the downright dystopian wildfire detection feature Amazon Ring unveiled at CES this week, but that wasn&#39;t why Electronic Frontier Foundation executive director Cindy Cohn chose Ring AI as the worst in show for privacy this year.

Citing the &quot;sheer expansion of surveillance capabilities that [Amazon] is supporting this year,&quot; Cohn expressed concern with facial recognition in Ring cameras, commercially deployable surveillance towers, and a new app store she said is &quot;going to let people develop even sketchier apps for the doorbell than ones that Amazon already provides.&quot;

More surveillance, Cohn added, doesn&#39;t always make us safer.

Bosch gets a second mention on the list of the CES 2026 worst in show with its 800 Series Personal AI Barista, a coffee maker that integrates Alexa+ to brew drinks on demand and is touted as the first espresso machine in the world to be powered by Amazon&#39;s new natural language AI tech.

The machine earned the &quot;who asked for this&quot; award, as – quite honestly – this sounds like more work than it&#39;s worth.

&quot;Adding voice control to a fancy coffee maker so you can tell it to make you a macchiato without having to learn the details&quot; is a good idea &quot;in theory,&quot; Consumer Reports director of technology policy Justin Brookman said. &quot;But in reality many people don&#39;t actually want to have a conversation with their coffee maker. It&#39;s too early for that – they just want to hit a couple buttons and get a nice cup of coffee.&quot;

In addition, as an Alexa+ device, it requires a Prime subscription, so even if you do love Alexa being your personal barista, cancelling your Prime account to save $139 a year would turn it into a simple dumb coffeemaker. And heaven forbid if Bosch decides to stop supporting it in a few years - not that such a thing has ever happened before.

For the second year running, a smart refrigerator has earned top honors for bringing garbage tech into consumers&#39; homes, though this time Samsung is stealing the crown from LG.

In this case, Samsung&#39;s Family Hub Smart Fridge earns double honors for being the worst in show for repairability and the overall worst in show, largely for the same reasons.

As iFixit chief Kyle Wiens explained, the new Samsung Smart Fridge doesn&#39;t actually have any physical handles, and is opened and closed entirely by voice command, quite possibly one of the stupidest things this vulture has ever heard of.

Noisy kitchen? Good luck opening the fridge. Mechanism breaks? Good luck opening the fridge. Internet outage? You know the drill.

As Wiens noted, Samsung has a poor track record when it comes to the quality of its fridges, with touchscreens (of course there&#39;s one on this one, too), compressors, and other components regularly failing.

Digital Right to Repair Coalition executive director Gay Gordon-Byrne said that the Samsung fridge was the worst thing she&#39;d seen at CES this year thanks to its excessive points of failure, connectivity dependence, and the fact that Samsung is serving ads on users&#39; refrigerators.

&quot;The one thing a refrigerator should do is keep things cold,&quot; Gordon-Byrne said. &quot;It needs to do that all the time; it needs to do that without difficulty.&quot;

Gordon-Byrne noted that Samsung&#39;s refrigerator is anything but that, with any number of situations leading to inaccessible food.

&quot;These things should not interfere with your use of a very simple device,&quot; Gordon-Byrne said. ®

The sketchy notification promised users Betterment would ‘triple your crypto.’

Betterment, a financial app, sent a sketchy-looking notification on Friday asking users to send $10,000 to Bitcoin and Ethereum crypto wallets and promising to “triple your crypto,” according to a thread on Reddit. The Betterment account says in an X thread that this was an “unauthorized message” that was sent via a “third-party system.”

Here’s the notification that some people got, per a screenshot in the Reddit thread (some reported getting a similar notification over email, too):

We’re celebrating our best-performing year yet by tripling Bitcoin and Ethereum deposits for the next three hours.

For example, if you send $10,000 in Bitcoin or Ethereum, we’ll send you right back $30,000 to your sending Bitcoin or Ethereum address.

Earlier this evening you may have received a message referencing a crypto-related Betterment promotion. This was an unauthorized message sent via a third-party system we use for marketing and other customer communications.

Please note that this is not a real offer and should be disregarded. We apologize for any confusion.

After closing dozens of physical stores, Amazon is planning a 229,000-square foot supercenter.﻿

Amazon could be taking another, even bigger swing at physical stores, this time with a Walmart-like supercenter. On Tuesday, the Orland Park Plan Commission in the Chicago suburb Orland Park, Illinois voted 6-1 to approve Amazon’s proposal to develop 35 acres of land for a 229,000-square foot retail center, as reported by The Information.

The development would include a brick-and-mortar supercenter selling groceries, general merchandise, and prepared foods. It would also double as an Amazon fulfillment center, like a department store with an Amazon warehouse in back. Customers would be able to pick up Amazon orders there, as well.

The proposed development is far from Amazon’s first attempt at launching a brick-and-mortar retail location. Over the past few years, it’s been closing its physical stores in droves. In 2022, it shuttered all 68 of its brick-and-mortar book stores, 4-star stores, and Pop Up shops. It also shut down both of its Amazon Style clothing stores in 2023. Recently, Amazon has been focusing its brick-and-mortar store efforts on Whole Foods Market, which Amazon purchased in 2017, but it looks like it still has physical store ambitions of its own.

X claims the NMPA and music publishers attempted to pressure the platform into industrywide licensing deals.

X is suing music publishers and their trade group, the National Music Publishers’ Association (NMPA), accusing them of attempted coercion in their ongoing battle over licensing, as reported earlier by The Hollywood Reporter. The Elon Musk-owned platform accuses music publishers of colluding with the NMPA to “coerce X into taking licenses to musical works from the industry as a whole, denying X the benefit of competition between music publishers.”

In the antitrust lawsuit filed on Friday, X claims that the NMPA and music publishers “weaponized” the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) with requests to take down allegedly infringing content. The lawsuit claims that in 2021, the NMPA began “bombarding X with takedown notices every single week related to thousands of posts,” to “gain leverage and pressure X” into industrywide licensing deals.

X has had problems with copyright and piracy following Musk’s takeover. In 2023, for example, the entire Super Mario Bros. Movie kept getting posted to X.

This filing is the latest wrinkle in a years-long legal battle between X and the NMPA, which sued X for $250 million in 2023 for “massive” copyright infringement involving more than 1,700 songs.. A judge upheld parts of the still-pending lawsuit in 2024, and a November 2025 filing stated X and the NMPA “have made very substantial progress toward settlement,” according to The Hollywood Reporter.

X is asking the court for monetary damages and for the judge to block the NMPA from allegedly forcing X to collectively negotiate with the publishers.

            <div id="article-text">﻿With Apple staying quiet on the Bluetooth feature, this solution adds the functionality to the iPhone.

﻿With Apple staying quiet on the Bluetooth feature, this solution adds the functionality to the iPhone.

One of the issues holding Auracast back from wider mainstream use is some companies’ lack of support for the Bluetooth technology — Apple being a prime example. With iOS having 58 percent of the market share in North America and nearly 28 percent worldwide, a decision by Apple to enable native Auracast support would potentially put millions of Auracast devices into the world with a firmware update. As of yet, Apple has made no comment on Auracast, and I’m not hopeful that we’ll get one anytime soon.

But the audio technology company Atitan thinks it has the solution. It’s developing a small disc-shaped transceiver — the splitR — that can attach to an iPhone’s MagSafe and turn it into an Auracast device capable of either transmitting or receiving an Auracast broadcast. The company’s connectR app, which will be available on both the Apple App Store and Google Play this coming summer, will allow you to see broadcasts around you, your connected devices, and create your own Auracast channels or group listening sessions. You’ll be able to interact with all of your streaming platforms to play songs and playlists. Atitan is adding in a social component, too, allowing posts and chats with friends.

The splitR isn’t meant just for an Apple device, though. While the device will fit a MagSafe connection (although the early version I saw was still a little small for one), you can connect any non-Auracast product to it with a USB-C or 3.5mm cable to give that device Auracast capability. And Atitan tells me the next iteration will be able to pair wirelessly to translate a classic Bluetooth connection into a Bluetooth LE Auracast transmission.

The splitR can connect to a speaker to play content from your phone or Auracast-capable TV, or your turntable setup to send an Auracast broadcast out to play on headphones or speakers. If you get enough splitR transceivers, you could create an entire whole-home Auracast system. And unlike some Auracast-compatible companies that restrict their devices to work only within their ecosystem, the splitR broadcasts are open to any Auracast headphones or speakers allowed to receive them.

What I saw during my demo at CES was encouraging. Beyond sharing music broadcasts with friends, Auracast has the potential to help those in need of hearing assistance, either while out and about at concerts, airports, church, or lectures or just at home watching TV. The more Auracast can get into products — either natively or with adapters like the splitR — the more its accessibility uses become mainstream.

Other Auracast transmitters on the market that I have tried can be clunky to use, but the Atitan team is invested in making a product that’s easy to use and brings all your services and devices together in a single app. The company will be launching a Kickstarter campaign in the next few months for the splitR transceiver and currently has a waitlist for the connectR app.

            <p><strong>The Verge | 2026-01-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/859994/ai-collectibles-funko-pops-amiibo-buddyo-heymates-ces-2026">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI toys, companions, and robots have been everywhere at CES this year, but among the horde of waddling plushies and light-up emoji eyes, two stood out to me. HeyMates and Buddyo are each betting that the collectible figurine boom is going to come back with an AI-powered vengeance, letting us chat to sports stars and superheroes from our desks.

The core concept to both is this: Take a cutesy figurine and stick it onto a smart base with a speaker, microphone, and maybe a flashing ring of light or two. Then use an accompanying app to power a basic LLM chatbot based on the figurine, so you can talk to Albert Einstein about relativity, or Darth Vader about crushing dissident forces, with some fun wake words and a cheesy joke or two.

Beyond that, the two startups I met this week differ. Olli is the more established of the two. It already provides its AI-driven BuddyOS to a number of other toy companies, but it now wants to build its own devices. With that in mind, it’s launching HeyMates, Funko-esque figurines with RFID chips in their bases, which become interactive AI characters when placed on the accompanying stand.

Olli intends to launch HeyMates on Kickstarter later this year, starting with three figurines: Einstein, who chats about science and creativity; Zara, a tarot reader who gives advice with a hint of mysticism; and Chandler, a bold choice of name for a toy who “brings the dry, sarcastic charm of a ’90s sitcom character,” given the 2023 death of Friends star Matthew Perry.

The company wants to build its own toys for the sake of creative control, and to get ahead of what CEO Hai Ta predicts is a market about to boom, with imitators and rivals likely on the way. He sees a future involving licensed characters and celebrity likenesses, along with Olli’s own line of HeyMates IP. In short, he wants to build the next Funko Pops, but make it AI.

Yijia Zhang, CEO of Buddyo, sees things differently. He doesn’t want to replace Funko Pops, but build a platform that might sit alongside them. In fact, it’s not even Funko Pops he really has in mind, but Nintendo’s Amiibo. Zhang describes himself as a Nintendo “superfan,” and Buddyo is his effort to get more out of his own Amiibo collection.

Instead of selling figurines, Buddyo is launching a stand it calls an AI Pod, with a slot the exact size of a standard Amiibo base. The Pod uses the same NFC tech as Nintendo’s figurines to recognize specific characters, and Buddyo will also sell its own NFC-equipped bases onto which you can place Funko Pops, bobbleheads, and (of course) Labubus, with plans for a larger Pod down the line capable of supporting bigger figures.

Since existing figurines don’t come with chatbot personalities baked in, Buddyo has developed an app to create a character for each figurine. Take a photo and give the character a name, and the app’s AI will analyze it, pulling up a backstory and personality. It’s capable of recognizing existing IP, so it knew that Stitch was a cartoon alien, and that Mario is a plumber with a questionable Italian accent who loves to say “It’s-a-me!” And it does deliver that exact accent, letting you pick the voice from a library of different sounds including sound samples matching copyrighted characters. Zhang is quick to emphasize these are all provided by the community, not the company, a loophole he clearly hopes will keep the infamously litigious Nintendo at bay.

Zhang’s background is in AI — he was once a software engineer at Google, working on Google Assistant, and currently heads up an AI and platforms team at Plaud. Perhaps that explains his focus on building an AI platform and base, rather than designing new toys from scratch. But he says it’s also about taking advantage of the fact that people already have a “deep connection” with their collections, which would be missing from new toys or new IP.

Once they’re up and running, HeyMates and Buddyo feel similar. Both emphasize fun, lighthearted chitchat with the AI avatars — “tell me a joke” remains everyone’s favorite demo question — though Zhang says Buddyo’s hybrid ChatGPT / Gemini AI stack can be used as a full AI assistant, just with a little more character. That’s not an option with HeyMates, which are each designed to do one thing well, with plans down the line for specific figurines to chat about movies, or cooking, or K-pop.

It’s still an open question whether there’s a meaningful market for AI toys and chatbot companions, but combining the tech with collectibles is the most convincing case I’ve seen yet.

Neither HeyMates nor Buddyo has any involvement from Funko, which has its own problems to deal with — just two months ago it warned investors that there was “substantial doubt” over its ability to continue operating, as sales slow and tariffs bite. Will we see a desperate Funko turn to AI for its salvation, or will its inaction provide the opening for a new company to take over the space? Either way, it’s clear chatty collectibles are coming — and soon.

﻿X’s deepfake porn feature clearly violates app store guidelines. Why won’t Apple and Google pull it?

Since X’s users started using Grok to undress women and children using deepfake images, I have been waiting for what I assumed would be inevitable: X getting booted from Apple’s and Google’s app stores. The fact that it hasn’t happened yet tells me something serious about Silicon Valley’s leadership: Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai are spineless cowards who are terrified of Elon Musk.

Here’s the relevant Apple App Store developer guideline: “Apps should not include content that is offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, in exceptionally poor taste, or just plain creepy.” Huh! How about that.

They sold their principles for power, and now they don’t even control their own companies

Here’s Google’s version of the same guideline, which is even clearer: “Apps that do not prohibit users from creating, uploading, or distributing content that facilitates the exploitation or abuse of children will be subject to immediate removal from Google Play. This includes all child sexual abuse materials.”

But booting X from these app stores for its flagrant violation of policy means upsetting Musk and the entire right-wing media ecosystem he controls through X — and with it, directly upsetting the clout-chasing content vampires who currently run the United States. Cook’s Apple has a massive dependency on China, and smartphones, computers, and chips are currently exempt from the tariffs on China. Cook can present Donald Trump with as many golden gifts as he wants, but those tariffs don’t have to stay that way.

Google’s Pichai is similarly weak. Trump has threatened Google numerous times over his placement in search results, and so far YouTube has managed to mostly avoid scrutiny over its content moderation policies because Pichai has been content to coddle Trump with promises that everything he does is the biggest thing in Google search history. Google also can’t risk upsetting Trump while AI policy remains deeply contested, and having an unhappy Musk influencing that policy is a nightmare of corruption.

This is the trap these men have gotten themselves into: They sold their principles for power, and now they don’t even control their own companies. Welcome to gangster tech regulation!

Apple’s lawyers heavily implied that a naked bananaman called Mr. Peely was somehow inappropriate for court

Apple and Google did not respond to requests for comment.

Less than five years ago, I sat through the interminable Epic v. Apple antitrust trial. Real heads will remember that Apple’s lawyers heavily implied that a naked bananaman called Mr. Peely was somehow inappropriate for court. This came after a week where Apple argued that an indie storefront that users could install via Epic was a problem because it hosted porny games, calling games on Itch.io “offensive and sexualized.”

You know what’s “offensive and sexualized,” you worthless fucking cowards? Nonconsensual AI-generated images of women in bikinis spreading their legs, and of children with so-called “donut glaze” on their faces — which, by the way, were being generated at a rate of one per minute. I’d also call that “offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, in exceptionally poor taste” and especially “just plain creepy”! Do you need a back brace to stand up straight, buddy? Because at this point, I am certain you haven’t got a single vertebra.

Hey, does anyone else remember when Tumblr got booted from the App Store over pornographic images of children? I guess the real problem was that Tumblr wasn’t owned by Musk, not its violation of App Store policy. Whoopsie!

Can Apple and Google even identify their values beyond their commitment to “shareholder value”?

It is genuinely unbelievable to me that I wasted hours of my actual life on a court case where Apple explained it needed total control of its App Store to protect its users. Total control of the App Store was Apple’s main argument against antitrust enforcement: The company insisted that its monopolistic control of what users could install on their phones was essential to create a walled garden where it could protect children from unsafe content.

Does Google have the same problem with its app store, Google Play? Of course it does, and of course it has made all the same arguments as Apple, although it does allow sideloading apps on Android. But it still hasn’t enforced its rules and pushed X to alternative app stores. Why? Hey Google, show me the photo of Sundar Pichai giggling with Elon Musk at Donald Trump’s inauguration!

The only consolation here is that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg almost certainly has steam coming out of his ears. Remember when Apple yanked Meta’s App Store enterprise certificate because it was taking too much data? Ah yes, those were the days. At this point, it kinda seems like Alex Roman wasn’t the only Apple witness brazenly lying on the stand.

I never want to hear any moral grandstanding from these boys ever again. The next time Tim Cook says “privacy is a human right,” the only possible response is to laugh in his face. I mean, Apple and Google are fine distributing an app that has created an undressed image Grok made of Renee Nicole Good, the mother who was shot by ICE in Minneapolis. How do you plan to defend getting rid of the ICEBlock app while allowing X to generate degrading images of a woman ICE killed? Can Apple and Google even identify their values beyond their commitment to “shareholder value”? What’s your fucking endgame here, guys?

How I learned to stop worrying and love AI slop

If I were to locate the moment AI slop broke through into popular consciousness, I’d pick the video of rabbits bouncing on a trampoline that went viral last summer. For many savvy internet users, myself included, it was the first time we were fooled by an AI video, and it ended up spawning a wave of almost identical generated clips.

My first reaction was that, broadly speaking, all of this sucked. That’s become a familiar refrain, in think pieces and at dinner parties. Everything online is slop now—the internet “enshittified,” with AI taking much of the blame. Initially, I largely agreed. But then friends started sharing AI clips in group chats that were compellingly weird, or funny. Some even had a grain of brilliance.

I had to admit I didn’t fully understand what I was rejecting—what I found so objectionable. To try to get to the bottom of how I felt (and why), I spoke to the people making the videos, a company creating bespoke tools for creators, and experts who study how new media becomes culture.

America’s new dietary guidelines ignore decades of scientific research

The first days of 2026 have brought big news for health. On Wednesday, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his colleagues at the Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture unveiled new dietary guidelines for Americans. And they are causing a bit of a stir.That’s partly because they recommend products like red meat, butter, and beef tallow—foods that have been linked to cardiovascular disease, and that nutrition experts have been recommending people limit in their diets.These guidelines are a big deal—they influence food assistance programs and school lunches, for example. Let’s take a look at the good, the bad, and the ugly advice being dished up to Americans by their government.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Here at MIT Technology Review we’ve been writing about the gene-editing technology CRISPR since 2013, calling it the biggest biotech breakthrough of the century. Yet so far, there’s been only one gene-editing drug approved. It’s been used commercially on only about 40 patients, all with sickle-cell disease.

It’s becoming clear that the impact of CRISPR isn’t as big as we all hoped. In fact, there’s a pall of discouragement over the entire field—with some journalists saying the gene-editing revolution has “lost its mojo.”

So what will it take for CRISPR to help more people? A new startup says the answer could be an “umbrella approach” to testing and commercializing treatments. Aurora Therapeutics, which has $16 million from Menlo Ventures and counts CRISPR co-inventor Jennifer Doudna as an advisor, essentially hopes to win approval for gene-editing drugs that can be slightly adjusted, or personalized, without requiring costly new trials or approvals for every new version.

The need to change regulations around gene-editing treatments was endorsed in November by the head of the US Food and Drug Administration, Martin Makary, who said the agency would open a “new” regulatory pathway for “bespoke, personalized therapies” that can’t easily be tested in conventional ways.

Aurora’s first target, the rare inherited disease phenylketonuria, also known as PKU, is a case in point. People with PKU lack a working version of an enzyme needed to use up the amino acid phenylalanine, a component of pretty much all meat and protein. If the amino acid builds up, it causes brain damage. So patients usually go on an onerous “diet for life” of special formula drinks and vegetables.

In theory, gene editing can fix PKU. In mice, scientists have already restored the gene for the enzyme by rewriting DNA in liver cells, which both make the enzyme and are some of the easiest to reach with a gene-editing drug. The problem is that in human patients, many different mutations can affect the critical gene. According to Cory Harding, a researcher at Oregon Health Sciences University, scientists know about 1,600 different DNA mutations that cause PKU.

There’s no way anyone will develop 1,600 different gene-editing drugs. Instead, Aurora’s goal is to eventually win approval for a single gene editor that, with minor adjustments, could be used to correct several of the most common mutations, including one that’s responsible for about 10% of the estimated 20,000 PKU cases in the US.

“We can’t have a separate clinical trial for each mutation,” says Edward Kaye, the CEO of Aurora. “The way the FDA approves gene editing has to change, and I think they’ve been very understanding that is the case.”

A gene editor is a special protein that can zero in on a specific location in the genome and change it. To prepare one, Aurora will put genetic code for the editor into a nanoparticle along with a targeting molecule. In total, it will involve about 5,000 gene letters. But only 20 of them need to change in order to redirect the treatment to repair a different mutation.

“Over 99% of the drug stays the same,” says Johnny Hu, a partner at Menlo Ventures, which put up the funding for the startup.

The new company came together after Hu met over pizza with Fyodor Urnov, an outspoken gene-editing scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, who is Aurora’s cofounder and sits on its board.

In 2022, Urnov had written a New York Times editorial bemoaning the “chasm” between what editing technology can do and the “legal, financial, and organizational” realities preventing researchers from curing people.

“I went to Fyodor and said, ‘Hey, we’re getting all these great results in the clinic with CRISPR, but why hasn’t it scaled?” says Hu. Part of the reason is that most gene-editing companies are chasing the same few conditions, such as sickle-cell, where (as luck would have it) a single edit works for all patients. But that leaves around 400 million people who have 7,000 other inherited conditions without much hope to get their DNA fixed, Urnov estimated in his editorial.

Then, last May, came the dramatic demonstration of the first fully “personalized” gene-editing treatment. A team in Philadelphia, assisted by Urnov and others, succeeded in correcting the DNA of a baby, named KJ Muldoon, who had an entirely unique mutation that caused a metabolic disease. Though it didn’t target PKU, the project showed that gene editing could theoretically fix some inherited diseases “on demand.”

It also underscored a big problem. Treating a single child required a large team and cost millions in time, effort, and materials—all to create a drug that would never be used again.

That’s exactly the sort of situation the new “umbrella” trials are supposed to address. Kiran Musunuru, who co-led the team at the University of Pennsylvania, says he’s been in discussions with the FDA to open a study of bespoke gene editors this year focusing on diseases of the type Baby KJ had, called urea cycle disorders. Each time a new patient appears, he says, they’ll try to quickly put together a variant of their gene-editing drug that’s tuned to fix that child’s particular genetic problem.

Musunuru, who isn’t involved with Aurora, does not think the company’s plans for PKU count as fully personalized editors. “These corporate PKU efforts have nothing whatsoever to do with Baby KJ,” he says. He says his center continues to focus on mutations “so ultra-rare that we don’t see any scenario where a for-profit gene-editing company would find that indication to be commercially viable.”

Instead, what’s occurring in PKU, says Musunuru, is that researchers have realized they can assemble “a bunch” of the most frequent mutations “into a large enough group of patients to make a platform PKU therapy commercially viable.”

While that would still leave out many patients with extra-rare gene errors, Musunuru says any gene-editing treatment at all would still be “a big improvement over the status quo, which  is zero genetic therapies for PKU.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The new year has barely begun, but the first days of 2026 have brought big news for health. On Monday, the US’s federal health agency upended its recommendations for routine childhood vaccinations—a move that health associations worry puts children at unnecessary risk of preventable disease.

There was more news from the federal government on Wednesday, when health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his colleagues at the Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture unveiled new dietary guidelines for Americans. And they are causing a bit of a stir.

That’s partly because they recommend products like red meat, butter, and beef tallow—foods that have been linked to cardiovascular disease, and that nutrition experts have been recommending people limit in their diets.

These guidelines are a big deal—they influence food assistance programs and school lunches, for example. So this week let’s look at the good, the bad, and the ugly advice being dished up to Americans by their government.

The government dietary guidelines have been around since the 1980s. They are updated every five years, in a process that typically involves a team of nutrition scientists who have combed over scientific research for years. That team will first publish its findings in a scientific report, and, around a year later, the finalized Dietary Guidelines for Americans are published.

The last guidelines covered the period 2020 to 2025, and new guidelines were expected in the summer of 2025. Work had already been underway for years; the scientific report intended to inform them was published back in 2024. But the publication of the guidelines was delayed by last year’s government shutdown, Kennedy said last year. They were finally published yesterday.

Nutrition experts had been waiting with bated breath. Nutrition science has evolved slightly over the last five years, and some were expecting to see new recommendations. Research now suggests, for example, that there is no “safe” level of alcohol consumption.

We are also beginning to learn more about health risks associated with some ultraprocessed foods (although we still don’t have a good understanding of what they might be, or what even counts as “ultraprocessed”.) And some scientists were expecting to see the new guidelines factor in environmental sustainability, says Gabby Headrick, the associate director of food and nutrition policy at George Washington University’s Institute for Food Safety & Nutrition Security in Washington DC.

Many of the recommendations are sensible. The guidelines recommend a diet rich in whole foods, particularly fresh fruits and vegetables. They recommend avoiding highly processed foods and added sugars. They also highlight the importance of dietary protein, whole grains, and “healthy” fats.

But not all of them are, says Headrick. The guidelines open with a “new pyramid” of foods. This inverted triangle is topped with “protein, dairy, and healthy fats” on one side and “vegetables and fruits” on the other.

There are a few problems with this image. For starters, its shape—nutrition scientists have long moved on from the food pyramids of the 1990s, says Headrick. They’re confusing and make it difficult for people to understand what the contents of their plate should look like. That’s why scientists now use an image of a plate to depict a healthy diet.

“We&#39;ve been using MyPlate to describe the dietary guidelines in a very consumer-friendly, nutrition-education-friendly way for over the last decade now,” says Headrick. (The UK’s National Health Service takes a similar approach.)

And then there’s the content of that food pyramid. It puts a significant focus on meat and whole-fat dairy produce. The top left image—the one most viewers will probably see first—is of a steak. Smack in the middle of the pyramid is a stick of butter. That’s new. And it’s not a good thing.

While both red meat and whole-fat dairy can certainly form part of a healthy diet, nutrition scientists have long been recommending that most people try to limit their consumption of these foods. Both can be high in saturated fat, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease—the leading cause of death in the US. In 2015, on the basis of limited evidence, the World Health Organization classified red meat as “probably carcinogenic to humans.”

Also concerning is the document’s definition of “healthy fats,” which includes butter and beef tallow (a MAHA favorite). Neither food is generally considered to be as healthy as olive oil, for example. While olive oil contains around two grams of saturated fat per tablespoon, a tablespoon of beef tallow has around six grams of saturated fat, and the same amount of butter contains around seven grams of saturated fat, says Headrick.

“I think these are pretty harmful dietary recommendations to be making when we have established that those specific foods likely do not have health-promoting benefits,” she adds.

Red meat is not exactly a sustainable food, and neither are dairy products. And the advice on alcohol is relatively vague, recommending that people “consume less alcohol for better overall health” (which might leave you wondering: Less than what?).

There are other questionable recommendations in the guidelines. Americans are advised to include more protein in their diets—at levels between 1.2 and 1.6 grams daily per kilo of body weight, 50% to 100% more than recommended in previous guidelines. There’s a risk that increasing protein consumption to such levels could raise a person’s intake of both calories and saturated fats to unhealthy levels, says José Ordovás, a senior nutrition scientist at Tufts University. “I would err on the low side,” he says.

Some nutrition scientists are questioning why these changes have been made. It’s not as though the new recommendations were in the 2024 scientific report. And the evidence on red meat and saturated fat hasn’t changed, says Headrick.

In reporting this piece, I contacted many contributors to the previous guidelines, and some who had led research for 2024’s scientific report. None of them agreed to comment on the new guidelines on the record. Some seemed disgruntled. One merely told me that the process by which the new guidelines had been created was “opaque.”

“These people invested a lot of their time, and they did a thorough job [over] a couple of years, identifying [relevant scientific studies],” says Ordovás. “I’m not surprised that when they see that [their] work was ignored and replaced with something [put together] quickly, that they feel a little bit disappointed,” he says.

Researchers are getting organoids pregnant with human embryos

At first glance, it looks like the start of a human pregnancy: A ball-shaped embryo presses into the lining of the uterus then grips tight, burrowing in as the first tendrils of a future placenta appear. This is implantation—the moment that pregnancy officially begins.

Only none of it is happening inside a body. These images were captured in a Beijing laboratory, inside a microfluidic chip, as scientists watched the scene unfold.

In three recent papers published by Cell Press, scientists report what they call the most accurate efforts yet to mimic the first moments of pregnancy in the lab. They’ve taken human embryos from IVF centers and let these merge with “organoids” made of endometrial cells, which form the lining of the uterus. Read our story about their work, and what might come next.

LLMs contain a LOT of parameters. But what’s a parameter?

A large language model’s parameters are often said to be the dials and levers that control how it behaves. Think of a planet-size pinball machine that sends its balls pinging from one end to the other via billions of paddles and bumpers set just so. Tweak those settings and the balls will behave in a different way.

OpenAI’s GPT-3, released in 2020, had 175 billion parameters. Google DeepMind’s latest LLM, Gemini 3, may have at least a trillion—some think it’s probably more like 7 trillion—but the company isn’t saying. (With competition now fierce, AI firms no longer share information about how their models are built.)

But the basics of what parameters are and how they make LLMs do the remarkable things that they do are the same across different models. Ever wondered what makes an LLM really tick—what’s behind the colorful pinball-machine metaphors? Let’s dive in.

What new legal challenges mean for the future of US offshore wind

For offshore wind power in the US, the new year is bringing new legal battles.

On December 22, the Trump administration announced it would pause the leases of five wind farms currently under construction off the US East Coast. Developers were ordered to stop work immediately.

The cited reason? Concerns that turbines can cause radar interference. But that’s a known issue, and developers have worked with the government to deal with it for years.

Companies have been quick to file lawsuits, and the court battles could begin as soon as this week. Here’s what the latest kerfuffle might mean for the US’s struggling offshore wind industry.

Inside the strange limbo facing millions of IVF embryosMillions of embryos created through IVF sit frozen in time, stored in cryopreservation tanks around the world. The number is only growing thanks to advances in technology, the rising popularity of IVF, and improvements in its success rates.At a basic level, an embryo is simply a tiny ball of a hundred or so cells. But unlike other types of body tissue, it holds the potential for life. Many argue that this endows embryos with a special moral status, one that requires special protections.The problem is that no one can really agree on what that status is. So while these embryos persist in suspended animation, patients, clinicians, embryologists, and legislators must grapple with the essential question of what we should do with them. What do these embryos mean to us? Who should be responsible for them? Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Enterprises are sitting on vast quantities of unstructured data, from call records and video footage to customer complaint histories and supply chain signals. Yet this invaluable business intelligence, estimated to make up as much as 90% of the data generated by organizations, historically remained dormant because its unstructured nature makes analysis extremely difficult.

But if managed and centralized effectively, this messy and often voluminous data is not only a precious asset for training and optimizing next-generation AI systems, enhancing their accuracy, context, and adaptability, it can also deliver profound insights that drive real business outcomes.

A compelling example of this can be seen in the US NBA basketball team the Charlotte Hornets who successfully leveraged untapped video footage of gameplay—previously too copious to watch and too unstructured to analyze—to identify a new competition-winning recruit. However, before that data could deliver results, analysts working for the team first had to overcome the critical challenge of preparing the raw, unstructured footage for interpretation.

Unstructured data presents inherent difficulties due to its widely varying format, quality, and reliability, requiring specialized tools like natural language processing and AI to make sense of it.

Every organization’s pool of unstructured data also contains domain-specific characteristics and terminology that generic AI models may not automatically understand. A financial services firm, for example, cannot simply use a general language model for fraud detection. Instead, it needs to adapt the model to understand regulatory language, transaction patterns, industry-specific risk indicators, and unique company context like data policies.

The challenge intensifies when integrating multiple data sources with varying structures and quality standards, as teams may struggle to distinguish valuable data from noise.

When the Charlotte Hornets set out to identify a new draft pick for their team, they turned to AI tools including computer vision to analyze raw game footage from smaller leagues, which exist outside the tiers of the game normally visible to NBA scouts and, therefore, are not as readily available for analysis.

“Computer vision is a tool that has existed for some time, but I think the applicability in this age of AI is increasing rapidly,” says Jordan Cealey, senior vice president at AI company Invisible Technologies, which worked with the Charlotte Hornets on this project. “You can now take data sources that you&#39;ve never been able to consume, and provide an analytical layer that&#39;s never existed before.”

By deploying a variety of computer vision techniques, including object and player tracking, movement pattern analysis, and geometrically mapping points on the court, the team was able to extract kinematic data, such as the coordinates of players during movement, and generate metrics like speed and explosiveness to acceleration.

This provided the team with rich, data-driven insights about individual players, helping them to identify and select a new draft whose skill and techniques filled a hole in the Charlotte Hornets’ own capabilities. The chosen athlete went on to be named the most valuable player at the 2025 NBA Summer League and helped the team win their first summer championship title.

Before data from game footage can be used, it needs to be labeled so the model can interpret it. The x and y coordinates of the individual players, seen here in bounding boxes, as well as other features in the scene, are annotated so the model can identify individuals and track their movements through time.

From this successful example, several lessons can be learned. First, unstructured data must be prepared for AI models through intuitive forms of collection, and the right data pipelines and management records. “You can only utilize unstructured data once your structured data is consumable and ready for AI,” says Cealey. “You cannot just throw AI at a problem without doing the prep work.”

For many organizations, this might mean they need to find partners that offer the technical support to fine-tune models to the context of the business. The traditional technology consulting approach, in which an external vendor leads a digital transformation plan over a lengthy timeframe, is not fit for purpose here as AI is moving too fast and solutions need to be configured to a company’s current business reality.

Forward-deployed engineers (FDEs) are an emerging partnership model better suited to the AI era. Initially popularized by Palantir, the FDE model connects product and engineering capabilities directly to the customer’s operational environment. FDEs work closely with customers on-site to understand the context behind a technology initiative before a solution is built.

“We couldn&#39;t do what we do without our FDEs,” says Cealey. “They go out and fine-tune the models, working with our human annotation team to generate a ground truth dataset that can be used to validate or improve the performance of the model in production.”

Second, data needs to be understood within its own context, which requires models to be carefully calibrated to the use case. “You can&#39;t assume that an out-of-the-box computer vision model is going to give you better inventory management, for example, by taking that open source model and applying it to whatever your unstructured data feeds are,” says Cealey. “You need to fine-tune it so it gives you the data exports in the format you want and helps your aims. That&#39;s where you start to see high-performative models that can then actually generate useful data insights.”

For the Hornets, Invisible used five foundation models, which the team fine-tuned to context-specific data. This included teaching the models to understand that they were “looking at” a basketball court as opposed to, say, a football field; to understand how a game of basketball works differently from any other sport the model might have knowledge of (including how many players are on each team); and to understand how to spot rules like “out of bounds.” Once fine-tuned, the models were able to capture subtle and complex visual scenarios, including highly accurate object detection, tracking, postures, and spatial mapping.

Lastly, while the AI technology mix available to companies changes by the day, they cannot eschew old-fashioned commercial metrics: clear goals. Without clarity on the business purpose, AI pilot programs can easily turn into open-ended, meandering research projects that prove expensive in terms of compute, data costs, and staffing.

“The best engagements we have seen are when people know what they want,” Cealey observes. “The worst is when people say ‘we want AI’ but have no direction. In these situations, they are on an endless pursuit without a map.”

            <h2>What new legal challenges mean for the future of US offshore wind</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/08/1130868/legal-challenges-offshore-wind/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For offshore wind power in the US, the new year is bringing new legal battles.

On December 22, the Trump administration announced it would pause the leases of five wind farms currently under construction off the US East Coast. Developers were ordered to stop work immediately.

The cited reason? National security, specifically concerns that turbines can cause radar interference. But that’s a known issue, and developers have worked with the government to deal with it for years.

Companies have been quick to file lawsuits, and the court battles could begin as soon as this week. Here’s what the latest kerfuffle might mean for the struggling offshore wind industry in the US.

This pause affects $25 billion in investment in five wind farms: Vineyard Wind 1 off Massachusetts, Revolution Wind off Rhode Island, Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind off New York, and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind off Virginia. Together, those projects had been expected to create 10,000 jobs and power more than 2.5 million homes and businesses.

In a statement announcing the move, the Department of the Interior said that “recently completed classified reports” revealed national security risks, and that the pause would give the government time to work through concerns with developers. The statement specifically says that turbines can create radar interference (more on the technical details here in a moment).

Three of the companies involved have already filed lawsuits, and they’re seeking preliminary injunctions that would allow construction to continue. Orsted and Equinor (the developers for Revolution Wind and Empire Wind, respectively) told the New York Times that their projects went through lengthy federal reviews, which did address concerns about national security.

This is just the latest salvo from the Trump administration against offshore wind. On Trump’s first day in office, he signed an executive order stopping all new lease approvals for offshore wind farms. (That order was struck down by a judge in December.)

The administration previously ordered Revolution Wind to stop work last year, also citing national security concerns. A federal judge lifted the stop-work order weeks later, after the developer showed that the financial stakes were high, and that government agencies had previously found no national security issues with the project.

There are real challenges that wind farms introduce for radar systems, which are used in everything from air traffic control to weather forecasting to national defense operations. A wind turbine’s spinning can create complex signatures on radar, resulting in so-called clutter.

Previous government reports, including one 2024 report from the Department of Energy and a 2025 report from the Government Accountability Office (an independent government watchdog), have pointed out this issue in the past.

“To date, no mitigation technology has been able to fully restore the technical performance of impacted radars,” as the DOE report puts it. However, there are techniques that can help, including software that acts to remove the signatures of wind turbines. (Think of this as similar to how noise-canceling headphones work, but more complicated, as one expert told TechCrunch.)

But the most widespread and helpful tactic, according to the DOE report, is collaboration between developers and the government. By working together to site and design wind farms strategically, the groups can ensure that the projects don’t interfere with government or military operations. The 2025 GAO report found that government officials, researchers, and offshore wind companies were collaborating effectively, and any concerns could be raised and addressed in the permitting process.

This and other challenges threaten an industry that could be a major boon for the grid. On the East Coast where these projects are located, and in New England specifically, winter can bring tight supplies of fossil fuels and spiking prices because of high demand. It just so happens that offshore winds blow strongest in the winter, so new projects, including the five wrapped up in this fight, could be a major help during the grid’s greatest time of need.

One 2025 study found that if 3.5 gigawatts’ worth of offshore wind had been operational during the 2024-2025 winter, it would have lowered energy prices by 11%. (That’s the combined capacity of Revolution Wind and Vineyard Wind, two of the paused projects, plus two future projects in the pipeline.) Ratepayers would have saved $400 million.

Before Donald Trump was elected, the energy consultancy BloombergNEF projected that the US would build 39 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2035. Today, that expectation has dropped to just 6 gigawatts. These legal battles could push it lower still.

What’s hardest to wrap my head around is that some of the projects being challenged are nearly finished. The developers of Revolution Wind have installed all the foundations and 58 of 65 turbines, and they say the project is over 87% complete. Empire Wind is over 60% done and is slated to deliver electricity to the grid next year.

To hit the pause button so close to the finish line is chilling, not just for current projects but for future offshore wind efforts in the US. Even if these legal battles clear up and more developers can technically enter the queue, why would they want to? Billions of dollars are at stake, and if there’s one word to describe the current state of the offshore wind industry in the US, it’s “unpredictable.”

            <div id="article-text">The term Artificial Intelligence (AI) is well known, often evoking futuristic movies like Robocop, Terminator and The Matrix. Yet what many don’t realize is that AI has been part of our lives for decades.

When you finish watching a movie on a streaming platform and instantly see recommendations for similar content, that’s AI. When you’re shopping online and an entire page of suggested products appears, that’s AI. Even the digital ads you see are powered by machine-learning algorithms designed to optimize engagement, clicks, and conversions.

Companies have relied on AI rule-based automation, routines, and machine-learning algorithms for years to power their systems and business processes.

So when you hear conversations about the “urgent need to start using AI,” pause for a moment. AI itself isn’t new, the real transformation we’re witnessing comes from Generative AI, a newer branch of deep learning, which itself is a subset of machine learning.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Artificial Intelligence broadly covers machines that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence. Machine Learning trains systems to learn from data. Deep Learning uses multi-layered neural networks to recognize complex patterns. Generative AI goes one step further. It doesn’t just analyze data or perform tasks, it creates new content: text, images, code, music, and more.

I was among the early adopters of ChatGPT, just a few months after its public launch in late 2022. It was a defining moment in the history of technology, the first time we could produce analyses, insights, and even complete outputs simply by typing natural-language prompts, without programming or complex tools.

I knew immediately that this would change the world. However, this accessibility has created a double-edged sword. Today, the digital landscape is flooded with “AI experts,” unverified tutorials, and get-rich-quick schemes that often promote the misuse of these tools.

There is a vast amount of misinformation circulating, ranging from overhyped capabilities to fundamental misunderstandings of how Large Language Models (LLMs) process truth and data.

To move beyond the noise, it’s important to seek out education from rigorous, academically backed sources rather than social media trends. The goal when using Generative AI tools shouldn’t be just to generate text, but to understand the capabilities and limitations well enough to apply it securely.

I was in university when the Internet first became commercialized. My first job, in 1996, was selling Internet access to individuals and companies. I witnessed firsthand the anxiety, resistance, and eventual transformation that followed. Yes, the Internet eliminated certain jobs, but it created far more, and often better ones.

Generative AI is bringing a similar paradigm shift today. The key is not to fear it but to learn it, to develop the literacy and critical understanding to use it responsibly. A sentiment often shared among industry leaders during my Generative AI research has stayed with me ever since: “AI will not steal your job; a human using AI will.”

That sentence should be a constant reminder for everyone: life is an ongoing evolution. Technologies disrupt, jobs disappear, and new ones emerge. So the next time you hear someone say, “We need to get into AI,” ask, “Which AI?”

Traditional AI analyzes what already exists, and chances are, you and your company are already using it. Generative AI creates what’s next. This distinction matters. If you treat Generative AI like a search engine or a calculator, you miss its true potential. If you treat it as an absolute source of truth, you risk misuse.

That is why deep literacy is essential. Understanding the specific capabilities of these tools is an act of digital responsibility. By educating ourselves, grounding our knowledge in fact, and embracing change with intention, we prepare to lead this next technological era, not be replaced by it.

            <div id="article-text">This is one of the most concerning questions for sales teams at the beginning of 2026: are tech giants killing cold outreach? The answer is that we do not know yet, but here is a perspective from someone working in sales.

Apple and Google have recently introduced two features that show a clear tendency toward the decline of cold outreach.

Apple’s new feature, “Ask Reason for Calling,” is a game changer. It effectively turns cold calling into another form of messaging. No more dynamism, no element of surprise, no offhandedness. Human touch is at the core of sales, but how can that element still exist if interaction is reduced to reading a few short phrases?

The magic of cold calling was always the surprise factor. No expectations for the person answering, no prior knowledge of who is calling or what the subject is, and no immediate cues such as where the caller is from, their accent, or how they pitch.

Does this feature mean that all the books and courses salespeople take to understand psychology, master tone, and capture attention are becoming worthless?

Google has announced a new AI inbox tool that offers personalized summaries of received emails and to-do items. What does this mean? As soon as a decision-maker notices that you are trying to sell something out of the blue, your email may be ignored, deleted, or your sequence may receive the old-fashioned “unsubscribe.”

This feature is not surprising, as Google has been tightening regulations around bulk and cold emails for some time. However, these measures have pushed salespeople toward increasingly extreme tactics, redefining what “off the wall” really means.

At this point, B2B email, Gmail, and LinkedIn are starting to resemble Instagram, TikTok, and WhatsApp. Less focus, less quality content, less valuable information, and more distraction.

While many people, especially decision-makers, blame salespeople for damaging the business landscape, particularly in terms of trust and distraction, and while endless tirades against cold calling and cold emailing continue on LinkedIn, sales and outreach remain fundamental to building a company.

All of us have something valuable to say and worth listening to, regardless of our role or the company we belong to. Time is indeed the most valuable resource, but taking a five-minute call or reading a three-minute email is not an eternity. It can offer more value than expected and open new opportunities.

In a world increasingly driven by AI, with clear shifts across all business sectors, human touch remains at the foundation of every company. Networking, meeting new people, and sharing ideas are the pillars of business.

So, are tech giants really killing cold outreach? Time will tell. For now, the answer is no.

            <h2>ChatGPT Health has arrived</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-08</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">I’ve said this many times: the products we see on the market are rarely visionary leaps. Most of the time, they are mirrors. They reflect people’s habits, shortcuts, fears, and small daily behaviours. Design follows behaviour. Always has.

Think about it. You probably know at least one person who already uses ChatGPT for health-related questions. Not occasionally. Regularly. As a second opinion. As a place to test concerns before saying them out loud. Sometimes even as a therapist, a confidant, or a space where embarrassment does not exist.

When habits become consistent, companies stop observing and start building. At that point, users are no longer just customers. They are co-architects. Their behaviour quietly shapes the product roadmap.

That context matters when looking at what OpenAI announced on January 7, 2026: the launch of ChatGPT Health, a dedicated AI-powered experience focused on healthcare. OpenAI describes it as “a dedicated experience that securely brings your health information and ChatGPT’s intelligence together.”

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Access is limited for now. The company is rolling it out through a waitlist, with gradual expansion planned over the coming weeks. Anyone with a ChatGPT account, Free or paid, can sign up for early access, except users in the European Union, the UK, and Switzerland, where regulatory alignment is still pending.

The stated goal is simple on paper: help people feel more informed, more prepared, and more confident when managing their health. But the numbers behind that decision say more than the press language ever could. According to OpenAI, over 230 million people worldwide already ask health or wellness questions on ChatGPT every week.

That figure raises uncomfortable questions.

Why do so many people turn to an AI for health questions? Is it speed? The promise of an immediate answer? The way our expectations have shifted toward instant clarity, even for complex or sensitive issues? Is it discomfort, the reluctance to speak openly with a doctor about certain topics? Or something deeper, a quiet erosion of trust in human systems, paired with a growing confidence in machines that do not judge, interrupt, or rush?

ChatGPT Health does not answer those questions. It simply formalises the behaviour.

According to OpenAI, the new Health space allows users to securely connect personal health data, including medical records, lab results, and information from fitness or wellness apps. Someone might upload recent blood test results and ask for a summary. Another might connect a step counter and ask how their activity compares to previous months.

The system can integrate data from platforms such as Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, Peloton, AllTrails, and even grocery data from Instacart. The promise is contextual responses, not generic advice. Lab results explained in plain language. Patterns highlighted over time. Suggestions for questions to ask during a medical appointment. Diet or exercise ideas grounded in what the data actually shows.

What ChatGPT Health is careful not to do matters just as much as what it can do.

OpenAI is explicit: this is not medical advice. It does not diagnose conditions. It does not prescribe treatments. It is designed to support care, not replace it. The framing is intentional. ChatGPT Health positions itself as an assistant, not an authority. A tool for understanding patterns and preparing conversations, not making decisions in isolation.

That distinction is crucial. And, frankly, it is one I hope users take seriously.

Behind the scenes, OpenAI says the system was developed with extensive medical oversight. Over the past two years, more than 260 physicians from roughly 60 countries reviewed responses and provided feedback, contributing over 600,000 individual evaluation points. The focus was not only accuracy, but tone, clarity, and when the system should clearly encourage users to seek professional care.

To support that process, OpenAI built an internal evaluation framework called HealthBench. It scores responses based on clinician-defined standards, including safety, medical correctness, and appropriateness of guidance. It is an attempt to bring structure to a domain where nuance matters and mistakes carry weight.

Privacy is another pillar OpenAI insists on emphasising. ChatGPT Health operates in a separate, isolated environment within the app. Health-related conversations, connected data sources, and uploaded files are kept entirely separate from regular chats. Health data does not flow into the general ChatGPT memory, and conversations in this space are encrypted.

OpenAI also states that health conversations are not used to train its core models. Whether that assurance will be enough for all users remains to be seen, but the architectural separation signals an awareness of how sensitive this territory is.

In the United States, the system goes a step further. Through a partnership with b.well Connected Health, ChatGPT Health can access real electronic health records from thousands of providers, with user permission. This allows it to summarise official lab reports or condense long medical histories into readable overviews. Outside the US, functionality is more limited, largely due to regulatory differences.

There are potential downstream effects for healthcare providers as well. If patients arrive at appointments already familiar with their data, already aware of trends, already prepared with focused questions, consultations could become more efficient. Less time decoding numbers. More time discussing decisions.

And inevitably, the question surfaces: should doctors be worried?

AI is not a medical professional. It does not examine patients. It does not carry legal responsibility. It cannot replace clinical judgement, experience, or accountability. ChatGPT Health does not change that. It is not a shortcut to self-diagnosis, and it should not be treated as one.

What it does change is the starting point of the conversation.

Used responsibly, ChatGPT Health can help people engage with their own health information instead of avoiding it. Misused, it could reinforce false certainty or delay necessary care. The responsibility, as always, is shared between the tool and the person using it.

Users should stay aware of privacy implications, seek professional advice when it matters, and treat AI guidance as one input among many, not a final answer.

One thing is clear, though. 2026 did not arrive quietly.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The AI industry has become adept at measuring itself. Benchmarks improve, model scores rise, and every new release arrives with a list of metrics meant to signal progress. And yet, somewhere between the lab and real life, something keeps slipping.

Which model actually feels better to use?
Which answers would a human trust?
Which system would you put in front of customers, employees, or citizens and feel comfortable standing behind it?

That gap is where LMArena has quietly built its business, and why investors just put $150 million behind it at a $1.7 billion valuation, in a Series A round. The lead investors were Felicis and UC Investments, with participation from major venture firms (Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed, The House Fund, Laude Ventures).

For years, benchmarks were the currency of AI credibility: accuracy scores, reasoning tests and standardized datasets. They worked until they didn’t. As models grew larger and more similar, benchmark improvements became marginal. Worse, models began to optimize for the tests themselves rather than real use cases. Static evaluations struggled to reflect how AI behaves in open-ended, messy human interactions.

At the same time, AI systems moved out of labs and into everyday workflows: drafting emails, writing code, powering customer support, assisting with research and advising professionals. The question shifted from “Can the model do this?” to “Should we trust it when it does?”

That’s a different kind of measurement problem.

LMArena’s answer was simple and radical: stop scoring models in isolation. On its platform, users submit a prompt and receive two anonymized responses. No branding. No model names. Just answers. Then the user picks the better one, or neither.

One vote. One comparison. Repeated millions of times.

The result isn’t a definitive “best,” but a living signal of human preference , how people respond to tone, clarity, verbosity and real-world usefulness. When the prompt isn’t clean or predictable, that signal changes. And it captures something benchmarks often miss.

LMArena isn’t about whether a model produces a factually correct answer. It’s about whether humans prefer it when it does. That distinction is subtle but meaningful in practice. Rankings on the Arena leaderboard are now referenced by developers and labs before releases and product decisions. Major models from OpenAI, Google and Anthropic are regularly evaluated there.

Without traditional marketing, LMArena became a mirror the industry watches.

The $150 million round isn’t just a vote of confidence in LMArena’s product. It signals that AI evaluation itself is becoming infrastructure. As the number of models explodes, enterprise buyers face a new question: not how to get AI, but which AI to trust. Vendor claims and classical benchmarks don’t always translate to real-world reliability. Internal testing is expensive and slow.

A neutral, third-party signal, something that sits between model builders and users  is emerging as a critical layer. That’s where LMArena lives. In September 2025, it launched AI Evaluations, a commercial service that turns its crowdsourced comparison engine into a product enterprises and labs can pay to access. LMArena says this service achieved an annualized run rate of about $30 million within months of launch.

For regulators and policymakers, this kind of human-anchored signal matters too. Oversight frameworks need evidence that reflects real usage, not idealized scenarios.

LMArena’s approach isn’t without debate. Platforms that rely on public voting and crowdsourced signals can reflect the preferences of active users, which may not align with the needs of specific professional domains. In response, competitors like Scale AI’s SEAL Showdown have emerged, aiming to offer more granular, representative model rankings across languages, regions and professional contexts.

Academic research also notes that voting-based leaderboards can be susceptible to manipulation if safeguards aren’t in place, and that such systems may favor superficially appealing responses over technically correct ones if quality control isn’t rigorous.

These debates highlight that no single evaluation method captures every dimension of model behavior, but they also underscore the demand for richer, human-grounded signals beyond traditional benchmarks.

There’s a quiet assumption in AI that trust will emerge naturally as models improve. Better reasoning, so the logic goes, will lead to better outcomes. That framing treats alignment as a technical problem with technical solutions.

LMArena challenges that idea. Trust, in real contexts, is social and contextual. It’s built through experience, not claims. It’s shaped by feedback loops that don’t collapse under scale. By letting users, not companies, decide what works, LMArena introduces friction where the industry often prefers momentum. It slows things down just enough to ask, “Is this actually better, or just newer?”

That’s an uncomfortable question in a market driven by constant release cycles. It’s also why LMArena’s rise feels inevitable.

LMArena doesn’t promise safety. It doesn’t declare models good or bad. It doesn’t replace regulation or responsibility. What it does is simpler and more powerful: it keeps score in public. As AI systems become embedded in everyday decisions, tracking performance over time becomes less optional. Someone has to notice regressions, contextual shifts and usability patterns.

In sports, referees and statisticians fill this role. In markets, auditors and rating agencies do. In AI, we’re still inventing that infrastructure.

LMArena’s funding round suggests investors believe this role won’t stay marginal for long. Because when AI is everywhere, the hardest questions aren’t what it can do. They are who we trust when it does it, and how we know we’re right.

            <div id="article-text">For years, the tech industry equated success with scale. Bigger stages, larger crowds, more logos, more panels, more noise. Five thousand people became ten thousand. Ten thousand became the goal.

Somewhere along the way, that stopped making sense.

Founders and executives didn’t announce a boycott. They simply stopped showing up.

What we see today is not a rejection of events, but a correction in how people who actually run companies choose to spend their time. The shift is subtle, but consistent. Fewer large conferences. More small, curated gatherings. More closed rooms. More dinners. More tables of twelve.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Big tech events struggle because they optimize for visibility, not usefulness. A founder does not need three days of generic content, dozens of panels with no real interaction, or networking sessions where relevance is left to chance.

At scale, everything becomes superficial by default. Conversations shorten. Access disappears. The signal is drowned by the format itself.

What founders look for instead is simple. Context. Trust. Direct access. Conversations without performance. The kind of environment where people can speak honestly, not publicly.

Even when larger conferences still make sense, there is a clear psychological ceiling. Around one thousand participants, in exceptional cases. Beyond that point, quality becomes impossible to control. The event stops being a place where decisions are made and turns into a product designed for mass consumption.

And tech, especially at the founder and executive level, no longer behaves like a mass industry. It behaves like a precision one.

This is why smaller, niche conferences outperform larger ones on every meaningful metric. Ten relevant people in a room will always create more value than a thousand irrelevant ones in a hall.

At a small table, access is natural. No one needs to chase anyone. Trust forms faster. Real conversations happen because there is no audience to impress.

The most important discussions in tech have never happened on stage. They happen before the lights turn on and after the microphones are off.

In parallel with this shift, we have been preparing a private community limited to one thousand founders and executives. It is strictly invite only. Not a platform. Not a public group. Not designed for scale. Designed for relevance. Quality is protected precisely by limitation.

One thing we can say publicly is that TNW will return with an event in 2026. Details, format, and the official launch will be announced soon, but not here. What matters is that this return will not mirror the old model. It will reflect how the industry actually operates today.

Big events are not disappearing. They are simply no longer where important decisions are made.

Across the industry, the shift is already happening. Smaller rooms. Sharper conversations. People who actually need to be there.

            <div id="article-text">Five stars used to mean something. People still read reviews before buying software. They just don’t trust them the way they used to. And no, this isn’t about fake reviews or obvious scams. Those are easy to spot. The real problem is more uncomfortable. The review economy didn’t collapse. It slowly drifted away from its original purpose.

User reviews began as authentic buyer guidance, but they’ve morphed into strategic assets for businesses. Scroll through any app store or e-commerce site: everything is “top-rated” and lavished with praise. If every product gleams with a 4.8/5 rating, those stars start to lose their meaning.

Consumers aren’t fooled, in fact, the share of people who trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations plummeted from nearly 80% in 2020 to just 42% in 2025

We read the glowing comments, but we’ve learned to read between the lines.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

It’s not hard to see why trust has eroded. Companies have figured out that great reviews drive sales, so they’ve turned the whole system into a numbers game. High ratings aren’t just social proof now, they’re a growth tactic.  In other words, more stars = more money. So of course businesses are chasing stars like their life depends on it. And in a way, it does.

Behind the scenes, many companies actively engineer their review scores. One common tactic is to time the ask just right. For instance, some businesses send out a Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey to gauge your sentiment “How likely are you to recommend us?”

If you rate them a 9 or 10 (a promoter), you’re immediately nudged to post a public review. If you give a lukewarm or low score, the feedback form quietly thanks you and never mentions writing a review at all.

Only the happiest customers get the gentle push to “Share your experience!” This practice is so widespread it even has a name: “review gating.”

It’s essentially filtering which customers get invited to leave a review based on their initial feedback. Platforms officially frown on it (Google outright forbids “selectively soliciting positive reviews”), but behind closed doors it remains a growth hacker’s favorite trick.

Then there’s the outright incentivization. Perhaps you’ve received an email offering a discount, gift card, or free month of service in exchange for writing a review. It’s framed as a thank-you for your time, of course – “Share your honest feedback and get 10% off your next purchase!” – but the intent is clear.

In an economy of fake praise, even regulators have had to step in to remind everyone that trust isn’t a commodity to be bought. Companies know how to play the game from the other side too: suppressing negativity.

Unhappy customer feedback is quietly diverted to support teams or private channels, where it can be resolved (or simply contained) out of public view. The result is a skewed reality, a glossy wall of five-star testimonials that obscure any hint of dissatisfaction. It’s a great sales tool. It’s terrible for the truth.

Why go to such lengths to manicure the ratings? Because the platforms themselves reward it. The algorithms that sort and highlight products aren’t trying to surface the most truthful review; they’re trying to maximize engagement and conversion.

High ratings and large volumes of reviews make people more likely to click “Buy Now.” That means more conversion for sellers and more commission for the marketplace. In other words, the algorithm is biased toward whatever boosts the platform’s monetization metrics.

A bunch of five-star reviews isn’t just ego bait,  it’s algorithm bait.

Think about it: products with a 4.7-star average and hundreds of reviews tend to appear at the top of search results and recommendation lists. They convert better, so the system pushes them more.

More visibility leads to more sales, which reinforces the high ranking. It’s a feedback loop powered by positive feedback (pun intended). If a vendor can game their way into that virtuous cycle, via perfectly timed prompts or purchased praise, the platform’s code will happily amplify them.

Authenticity doesn’t earn you a top slot; performance does. The incentive is clear: keep it positive, and keep it plentiful. In the review economy, volume and sentiment are king.

Worse, some marketplaces have blurred the line between genuine high-rated listings and paid placement. It’s an open secret that many platforms offer sponsored spots or pay-to-play schemes, think “featured” placements, ads masquerading as top picks, or vendor subscriptions that subtly boost visibility.

Money talks, even if it speaks over the voice of authentic customer feedback. (To be fair, a few holdouts still refuse to monetize their review rankings or sell out their star system, but they’re the exception, not the rule).

Consumers aren’t sitting idly by in this charade. We’ve become savvy at sniffing out over-polished BS. The modern buyer knows how the game is played, and many are adapting their behavior to cope with the broken review system.

First, there’s a migration of trust to private networks and off-platform channels. Instead of relying on the star-average on a marketplace, people turn to friends, colleagues, and niche communities for real advice.

Think about the last time you were unsure about a purchase, maybe you shot a quick message to a group chat, or asked in a private Slack channel, “Hey, has anyone used this product? Is it actually any good?” Personal recommendations feel reliable again, precisely because they’re not part of the public review circus.

Second, savvy consumers cross-check everything. Rather than trusting one site’s reviews, they compare across multiple sources, the product might be 4.8 on the official store, but what’s it rated elsewhere?

Is there a discrepancy between the slick website testimonials and the chatter on Reddit? More often than not, shoppers now triangulate information. In fact, three out of four people use two or more sites when reading reviews, rather than putting all their faith in one platform’s word. We instinctively seek a consensus of truth across the noise.

Finally, many have decided the best judge is themselves. “Try before you buy” has made a comeback as a defense against dubious reviews. Free trials, freemium tiers, generous return policies, consumers leverage them all to test products firsthand.

If a software platform promises the world in its curated testimonials, a savvy buyer will take the 14-day free trial and see if it lives up to the hype. In sectors like enterprise software, where choices are costly and critical, buyers might run a pilot program or proof-of-concept rather than trust glossy case studies. Essentially, experience has become the new review.

All this has serious implications for platforms and software marketplaces. These businesses built their empires on user-generated trust, turning customer opinion into a key part of the shopping experience.

If that trust evaporates, the model cracks. We’re already seeing the early signs: users skipping the review tab, or treating every five-star rating with a healthy dose of skepticism.

If the review economy continues on its current path, platforms risk becoming mere transaction processors rather than trust brokers.

For the marketplaces, this is both a crisis and an opportunity. The crisis is obvious: loss of credibility. If people no longer believe what they read on your platform, they’ll seek validation elsewhere, and your influence over purchase decisions diminishes.

But the opportunity lies in reform. Platforms could double down on authenticity as a feature, verifying purchases, cracking down harder on fraudulent and incentivized reviews, and highlighting more qualitative, nuanced feedback instead of simple star counts.

There’s even a chance to innovate with new trust signals (some are experimenting with things like verified buyer badges, AI analysis for suspicious patterns, or weighted ratings that account for reviewer reputation). The platforms that find ways to genuinely restore faith in their review systems will win back weary consumers. Those that don’t will see their communities drift away, bit by bit.

Importantly, not all platforms have given in to the dark side. A handful still refuse pay-for-play tactics, no paid reviews, no under-the-table boosting of rankings for advertisers.

These holdouts demonstrate that integrity in reviews is possible, even if it means slower growth in the short term.

In the end, the broken review economy is forcing a rebalance of how we decide what to trust. Buyers are adapting, finding new ways to cut through the noise. And the platforms that once thrived on being the ultimate source of truth in purchasing may have to rethink their approach if they want to stay relevant.

Trust, once lost, is hard to regain. The five-star system doesn’t shine as bright as it used to; perhaps it’s time for the next evolution in how we share and earn trust online.
