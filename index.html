            <h2>Software leaks point to the first Apple Silicon “iMac Pro,” among other devices</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/leaked-debug-kit-suggests-apple-is-testing-a-new-imac-pro-among-many-other-macs/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple doesn’t like to talk about its upcoming products before it’s ready, but sometimes the company’s software does the talking for it. So far this week we’ve had a couple of software-related leaks that have outed products Apple is currently testing—one a pre-release build of iOS 26, and the other some leaked files from a kernel debug kit (both via MacRumors).

Most of the new devices referenced in these leaks are straightforward updates to products that already exist: a new Apple TV, a HomePod mini 2, new AirTags and AirPods, an M4 iPad Air, a 12th-generation iPad to replace the current A16 version, next-generation iPhones (including the 17e, 18, and the rumored foldable model), a new Studio Display model, some new smart home products we’ve already heard about elsewhere, and M5 updates for the MacBook Air, Mac mini, Mac Studio, and the other MacBook Pros. There’s also yet another reference to the lower-cost MacBook that Apple is apparently planning to replace the M1 MacBook Air it still sells via Walmart for $599.

For power users, though, the most interesting revelation might be that Apple is working on a higher-end Apple Silicon iMac powered by an M5 Max chip. The kernel debug kit references an iMac with the internal identifier J833c, based on a platform identified as H17C—and H17C is apparently based on the M5 Max, rather than a lower-end M5 chip. (For those who don’t have Apple’s branding memorized, “Max” is associated with Apple’s second-fastest chips; the M5 Max would be faster than the M5 or M5 Pro, but slower than the rumored M5 Ultra.)

This device could be the long-awaited, occasionally-rumored-but-never-launched replacement to Apple’s 27-inch iMac, which was discontinued in 2022 with no direct replacement. An M5 Max chip would also make this machine the closest thing we’ve seen to a direct replacement for the iMac Pro, a 27-inch iMac variant that was launched in late 2017 but likewise discontinued without an update or replacement.

The current M4 Max chip includes 14 or 16 CPU cores, 32 or 40 GPU cores, and between 36GB and 128GB of unified memory, specs we’d expect an M5 Max to match or beat. And because the Max chips already fit into the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros, it should be no problem to fit one into an all-in-one desktop PC.

For most of the Intel era, the 27-inch iMac was Apple’s main workhorse desktop, situated in between the underpowered Mac mini and the expensive, oft-ignored Mac Pro. It used high-end multi-core CPUs and midrange dedicated GPUs, and combined them with a high-end color-accurate 5K screen that was good enough for all kinds of professional photo and video editing and design work.

But the Apple Silicon era saw the iMac revert to its roots as a less-powerful, colorful, consumer-friendly system aimed at less-demanding users. The current Apple M4 iMac is pleasant to use and plenty fast for everyday computing tasks, but it can’t stack up to desktops like the M4 Pro Mac mini or the Mac Studio.

For several years, rumors persisted that Apple was working on an upgraded iMac—Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman said in 2023 that a 32-inch version of the iMac could possibly launch at some point in 2024 or 2025. That timeline ended up being optimistic, but the presence of an M5 Max in this testing model suggests that a 2026 launch could be a real possibility.

Apple offers products that can replace a 27-inch iMac in its lineup today—either a Mac mini or Mac Studio, connected to a 27-inch 5K Studio Display or the 32-inch 6K Pro Display XDR. But that combination can’t replace an iMac for the people who enjoy the all-in-one’s clean look or its lack of cable clutter, and both of those aging standalone displays are missing support for the kinds of technologies offered in modern high-end screens, including mini LED or OLED panels or ProMotion refresh rates.

That this iMac and these other devices are present in these internal software builds doesn’t mean that they’re things Apple intends to release—just that Apple is testing some version of them in its headquarters somewhere, and that work has progressed to the point where Apple is supporting them with internal software releases. They could see the light of day soon, or years from now, or never at all. But for anyone who’s still keeping hope alive about a 27-inch iMac replacement, this is another piece of kindling you can use to try and keep that fire burning.</div>

            <h2>Reporter suggests Half-Life 3 will be a Steam Machine launch title</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/12/journalist-insists-half-life-3-will-launch-with-steam-machine-in-spring-2026/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you can take your mind way back to the beginning of 2025, you might remember a fresh wave of rumors suggesting that Half-Life 3 was finally reaching the final stages of production, and could be announced and/or released at any moment. Now, though, 2025 seems set to come to a close without any official news of a game fans have been waiting literal decades for.

That doesn’t necessarily mean a Half-Life 3 announcement and/or release isn’t imminent, though. On the contrary, veteran journalist Mike Straw insisted on a recent Insider Gaming podcast that “everybody I’ve talked to are still adamant [Half-Life 3] is a game that will be a launch title with the Steam Machine.”

Straw—who has a long history of reporting gaming rumors from anonymous sources—said this Half-Life 3 information is “not [from] these run-of-the-mill sources that haven’t gotten me information before. … These aren’t like random, one-off people.” And those sources are “still adamant that the game is coming in the spring,” Straw added, noting that he was “specifically told [that] spring 2026 [is the window] for the Steam Machine, for the Frame, for the Controller, [and] for Half-Life 3.”

Tying the long-awaited Half-Life 3 to a major hardware push that has already been announced for an “early 2026” window certainly sounds plausible, given previous leaks about the game’s advanced state of development. But there are still some reasons to doubt Straw’s “adamant” sources here.

For one, Straw admitted that the previous information he had received on potential Half-Life 3 launch and/or announcement dates was not reliable enough to report in detail. “I had been told a date. I was not going to report that date because they weren’t 100 percent confident in that date,” he said. “That date has since passed.”

“It was one of those situations where I guarantee a bunch of people were just giving out dates to see who would post a date to catch who was leaking said information,” Straw added. “The date they told me, there’s a reason why they said, ‘Don’t report it.’ I didn’t write a story on it because there just was not enough on the date itself to run a story… I didn’t feel comfortable officially reporting that.”

And even if Straw’s information about a “spring 2026” window for Half-Life 3 is currently correct, the ever-shifting nature of Valve Time means those plans could still change. That is especially true if the game’s launch is linked to hardware plans that might be impacted by the spiking price of RAM.

Straw said that kind of component uncertainty—and negative reactions to reports of PC-style pricing for the Steam Machine—are likely pushing Valve toward “holding back the idea or holding back the announcement of anything else” surrounding Steam Machine launch details. “There’s no doubt in my mind Valve is still trying to make decisions because of what’s going on on the component side,” he added.

Timing specifics aside, Straw said his sources have him convinced that the long wait for Half-Life 3 is coming to an end in the near future. “The game’s real,” he said. “At the end of the day, the game is real. There’s no denying it. It’s just a ‘when’ and not an ‘if’ at this point.”</div>

            <h2>Utah leaders hinder efforts to develop solar energy supply</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Utah Gov. Spencer Cox believes his state needs more power—a lot more. By some estimates, Utah will require as much electricity in the next five years as it generated all last century to meet the demands of a growing population as well as chase data centers and AI developers to fuel its economy.

To that end, Cox announced Operation Gigawatt last year, declaring the state would double energy production in the next decade. Although the announcement was short on details, Cox, a Republican, promised his administration would take an “any of the above” approach, which aims to expand all sources of energy production.

Despite that goal, the Utah Legislature’s Republican supermajority, with Cox’s acquiescence, has taken a hard turn against solar power—which has been coming online faster than any other source in Utah and accounts for two-thirds of the new projects waiting to connect to the state’s power grid.

Cox signed a pair of bills passed this year that will make it more difficult and expensive to develop and produce solar energy in Utah by ending solar development tax credits and imposing a hefty new tax on solar generation. A third bill aimed at limiting solar development on farmland narrowly missed the deadline for passage but is expected to return next year.

While Operation Gigawatt emphasizes nuclear and geothermal as Cox’s preferred sources, the legislative broadside, and Cox’s willingness to go along with it, caught many in the solar industry off guard. The three bills, in their original form, could have brought solar development to a halt if not for solar industry lobbyists negotiating a lower tax rate and protecting existing projects as well as those under construction from the brunt of the impact.

“It took every dollar of political capital from all the major solar developers just to get to something tolerable, so that anything they have under development will get built and they can move on to greener pastures,” said one industry insider, indicating that solar developers will likely pursue projects in more politically friendly states. ProPublica spoke with three industry insiders—energy developers and lobbyists—all of whom asked to remain anonymous for fear of antagonizing lawmakers who, next month, will again consider legislation affecting the industry.

The Utah Legislature’s pivot away from solar mirrors President Donald Trump taking a more hostile approach to the industry than his predecessor. Trump has ordered the phaseout of lucrative federal tax incentives for solar and other renewable energy, which expanded under the Biden administration. The loss of federal incentives is a bigger hit to solar companies than the reductions to Utah’s tax incentives, industry insiders acknowledged. The administration has also canceled large wind and solar projects, which Trump has lamented as “the scam of the century.” He described solar as “farmer killing.”

Yet Cox criticized the Trump administration’s decision to kill a massive solar project in neighboring Nevada. Known as a governor who advocates for a return to more civil political discourse, Cox doesn’t often pick fights. But he didn’t pull punches with the decision to halt the Esmeralda 7 project planned on 62,300 acres of federal land. The central Nevada project was expected to produce 6.2 gigawatts of power—enough to supply nearly eight times the number of households in Las Vegas. (Although the Trump administration canceled the environmental review of the joint project proposed by multiple developers, it has the potential to move forward as individual projects.)

“This is how we lose the AI/energy arms race with China,” Cox wrote on X when news surfaced of the project’s cancellation. “Our country needs an all-of-the-above approach to energy (like Utah).”

But he didn’t take on his own Legislature, at least publicly.

Many of Utah’s Republican legislators have been skeptical of solar for years, criticizing its footprint on the landscape and viewing it as an unreliable energy source, while lamenting the retirement of coal-generated power plants. The economies of several rural counties rely on mining coal. But lawmakers’ skepticism hadn’t coalesced into successful anti-solar legislation—until this year. When Utah lawmakers convened at the start of 2025, they took advantage of the political moment to go after solar.

“This is a sentiment sweeping through red states, and it’s very disconcerting and very disturbing,” said Steve Handy, Utah director of The Western Way, which describes itself as a conservative organization advocating for an all-of-the-above approach to energy development.

The shift in sentiment against solar energy has created a difficult climate for an all-of-the-above approach. Solar projects can be built quickly on Utah’s vast, sun-drenched land, while nuclear is a long game with projects expected to take a decade or more to come online under optimistic scenarios.

Cox generally supports solar, “in the right places,” especially when the captured energy can be stored in large batteries for distribution on cloudy days and after the sun goes down.

Cox said that instead of vetoing the anti-solar bills, he spent his political capital to moderate the legislation’s impact. “I think you’ll see where our fingerprints were,” he told ProPublica. He didn’t detail specific changes for which he advocated but said the bills’ earlier iterations would have “been a lot worse.”

Cox’s any-of-the-above approach to energy generation draws from a decades-old Republican push similarly titled “all of the above.” The GOP policy’s aim was as much about preserving and expanding reliance on fossil fuels (indeed, the phrase may have been coined by petroleum lobbyists) as it was turning to cleaner energy sources such as solar, wind, and geothermal.

As governor of a coal-producing state, Cox hasn’t shown interest in reducing reliance on such legacy fuels. But as he slowly rolls out Operation Gigawatt, his focus has been on geothermal and nuclear power. Last month, he announced plans for a manufacturing hub for small modular reactors in the northern Utah community of Brigham City, which he hopes will become a nuclear supply chain for Utah and beyond. And on a recent trade mission to New Zealand, he signed an agreement to collaborate with the country on geothermal energy development.

Meanwhile, the bills Cox signed into law already appear to be slowing solar development in Utah. Since May, when the laws took effect, 51 planned solar projects withdrew their applications to connect to the state’s grid—representing more than a quarter of all projects in Utah’s transmission connection queue. Although projects drop out for many reasons, some industry insiders theorize the anti-solar legislation could be at play.

Caught in the political squeeze over power are Utah customers, who are footing higher electricity bills. Earlier this year, the state’s utility, Rocky Mountain Power, asked regulators to approve a 30 percent hike to fund increased fuel and wholesale energy costs, as well as upgrades to the grid. In response to outrage from lawmakers, the utility knocked the request down to 18 percent. Regulators eventually awarded the utility a 4.7 percent increase—a decision the utility promptly appealed to the state Supreme Court.

Juliet Carlisle, a University of Utah political science professor focusing on environmental policy, said the new solar tax could signal to large solar developers that Utah energy policy is “becoming more unpredictable,” prompting them to build elsewhere. This, in turn, could undermine Cox’s efforts to quickly double Utah’s electricity supply.

Operation Gigawatt “relies on rapid deployment across multiple energy sources, including renewables,” she said. “If renewable growth slows—especially utility-scale solar, which is currently the fastest-deploying resource—the state may face challenges meeting demand growth timelines.”

Rep. Kay Christofferson, R-Lehi, had sponsored legislation to end the solar industry’s state tax credits for several legislative sessions, but this was the first time the proposal succeeded.

Christofferson agrees Utah is facing unprecedented demand for power, and he supports Cox’s any-of-the-above approach. But he doesn’t think solar deserves the advantages of tax credits. Despite improving battery technology, he still considers it an intermittent source and thinks overreliance on it would work against Utah’s energy goals.

In testimony on his bill, Christofferson said he believed the tax incentives had served their purpose of getting a new industry off the ground—16 percent of Utah’s power generation now comes from solar, ranking it 16th in the nation for solar capacity.

Christofferson’s bill was the least concerning to the industry, largely because it negotiated a lengthy wind-down of the subsidies. Initially it would have ended the tax credit after Jan. 1, 2032. But after negotiations with the solar industry, he extended the deadline to 2035.

The bill passed the House, but when it reached the Senate floor, Sen. Brady Brammer, R-Pleasant Grove, moved the end of the incentives to 2028. He told ProPublica he believes solar is already established and no longer needs the subsidy. Christofferson tried to defend his compromise but ultimately voted with the legislative majority.

Unlike Christofferson’s bill, which wasn’t born of an antipathy for renewable energy, Rep. Casey Snider, R-Paradise, made it clear in public statements and behind closed doors to industry lobbyists that the goal of his bill was to make solar pay.

The bill imposes a tax on all solar production. The proceeds will substantially increase the state’s endangered species fund, which Utah paradoxically uses to fight federal efforts to list threatened animals for protection. Snider cast his bill as pro-environment, arguing the money could also go to habitat protection.

As initially written, the bill would have taxed not only future projects, but also those already producing power and, more worrisome for the industry, projects under construction or in development with financing in place. The margins on such projects are thin, and the unanticipated tax could kill projects already in the works, one solar industry executive testified.

“Companies like ours are being effectively punished for investing in the state,” testified another.

The pushback drew attacks from Snider, who accused solar companies of hypocrisy on the environment.

Industry lobbyists who spoke to ProPublica said Snider wasn’t as willing to negotiate as Christofferson. However, they succeeded in reducing the tax rate on future developments and negotiated a smaller, flat fee for existing projects.

“Everyone sort of decided collectively to save the existing projects and let it go for future projects,” said one lobbyist.

Snider told ProPublica, “My goal was never to run anybody out of business. If we wanted to make it more heavy-handed, we could have. Utah is a conservative state, and I would have had all the support.”

Snider said, like the governor, he favors an any-of-the-above approach to energy generation and doesn’t “want to take down any particular industry or source.” But he believes utility-scale solar farms need to pay to mitigate their impact on the environment. He likened his bill to federal law that requires royalties from oil and gas companies to be used for conservation. He hopes federal lawmakers will use his bill as a model for federal legislation that would apply to solar projects nationwide.

“This industry needs to give back to the environment that they claim very heavily they are going to protect,” he said. “I do believe there’s a tinge of hypocrisy to this whole movement. You can’t say you’re good for the environment and not offset your impacts.”

One of the more emotional debates over solar is set to return next year, after a bill that would end tax incentives for solar development on agricultural land failed to get a vote in the final minutes of this year’s session. Sponsored by Rep. Colin Jack, R-St. George, the bill has been fast-tracked in the next session, which begins in January.

Jack said he was driven to act by ranchers who were concerned that solar companies were outbidding them for land they had been leasing to graze cows. Solar companies pay substantially higher rates than ranchers can. His bill initially had a slew of land use restrictions—such as mandating the distance between projects and residential property and creeks, minimum lot sizes and 4-mile “green zones” between projects—that solar lobbyists said would have strangled their industry. After negotiating with solar developers, Jack eliminated the land use restrictions while preserving provisions to prohibit tax incentives for solar farms on private agricultural land and to create standards for decommissioning projects.

Many in rural Utah recoil at rows of black panels disrupting the landscape and fear solar farms will displace the ranching and farming way of life. Indeed, some wondered whether Cox, who grew up on a farm in central Utah, would have been as critical of Trump scuttling a 62,300-acre solar farm in his own state as he was of the Nevada project’s cancellation.

Peter Greathouse, a rancher in western Utah’s Millard County, said he is worried about solar farms taking up grazing land in his county. “Twelve and a half percent is privately owned, and a lot of that is not farmable. So if you bring in these solar places that start to eat up the farmland, it can’t be replaced,” he said.

Utah is losing about 500,000 acres of agricultural land every 10 years, most of it to housing. A report by The Western Way estimated solar farms use 0.1 percent of the United States’ total land mass. That number is expected to grow to 0.46 percent by 2050—a tiny fraction of what is used by agriculture. Of the land managed by the Utah Trust Lands Administration, less than 3,000 of the 2.9 million acres devoted to grazing have been converted to solar farms.

Other ranchers told ProPublica they’ve been able to stay on their land and preserve their way of life by leasing to solar. Landon Kesler’s family, which raises cattle for team roping competitions, has leased land to solar for more than a decade. The revenue has allowed the family to almost double its land holdings, providing more room to ranch, Kesler said.

“I’m going to be quite honest, it’s absurd,” Kesler said of efforts to limit solar on agricultural land. “Solar very directly helped us tie up other property to be used for cattle and ranching. It didn’t run us out; it actually helped our agricultural business thrive.”

Solar lobbyists and executives have been working to bolster the industry’s image with lawmakers ahead of the next legislative session. They’re arguing solar is a good neighbor.

“We don’t use water, we don’t need sidewalks, we don’t create noise, and we don’t create light,” said Amanda Smith, vice president of external affairs for AES, which has one solar project operating in Utah and a second in development. “So we just sort of sit out there and produce energy.”

Solar pays private landowners in Utah $17 million a year to lease their land. And, more important, solar developers argue, it’s critical to powering data centers the state is working to attract.

“We are eager to be part of a diversified electricity portfolio, and we think we bring a lot of values that will benefit communities, keep rates low and stable, and help keep the lights on,” Rikki Seguin, executive director of Interwest Energy Alliance, a western trade organization that advocates for utility-scale renewable energy projects, told an interim committee of lawmakers this summer.

The message didn’t get a positive reception from some lawmakers on the committee. Rep. Carl Albrecht, R-Richfield, who represents three rural Utah counties and was among solar’s critics last session, said the biggest complaint he hears from constituents is about “that ugly solar facility” in his district.

“Why, Rep. Albrecht, did you allow that solar field to be built? It’s black. It looks like the Dead Sea when you drive by it,” Albrecht said.

            <h2>We’re Bracing for an Accident Now That Tesla Is Taking the Safety Drivers Out of Its Robotaxis</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/advanced-transport/tesla-removing-safety-drivers-robotaxis">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tesla is preparing for its Robotaxis to go fully driverless and ditch its human safety monitors, according to CEO Elon Musk, while the rest of us prepare for an accident.

Over the weekend, footage circulated on social media showing at least two different Tesla Robotaxis roaming the streets of Austin, Texas, without anyone in the driver’s seat. Musk soon stepped in to confirm what his fans were seeing.

“Testing is underway with no occupants in the car,” Musk wrote in a tweet Sunday.

If true, then the automaker is finally gearing up to belatedly deliver on Musk’s grand promise to get rid of the safety monitors, who have always been a conspicuous and embarrassing inclusion, by the end of 2025. Musk has insisted that Tesla included monitors because it was “paranoid” about safety, but the service’s delayed launch this June, plus Tesla’s struggles with its existing self-driving tech, added to the feeling that they were really there to paper over the Robotaxi’s dubious capabilities.

That the safety monitors are now set to be removed will raise serious questions about whether the tech is reliable enough to operate on its own. The human supervisors have already had to make a number of interventions to prevent a potential accident or stop them breaking road laws. They’ve even taken complete control of the vehicles on occasion.

It doesn’t help that Tesla isn’t nearly as transparent about its tech as robot cab leader Waymo. Tesla heavily censors its crash reports sent to regulators under the guise of protecting “confidential business information,” making it impossible to determine what occurred during the accidents. Many of the reports come in months after the fact, and the automaker has been investigated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for failing to report crashes on time.

The data that we are privy to, though, isn’t flattering. As of this week, as spotted by Electrek, the automaker has reported eight crashes since launching the service in late June (and to give an idea of how tardy the updates are, the latest reported crash occurred in October.) Four crashes occurred in a single month.

Electrek crunched the numbers and estimated that based on Tesla’s November announcement that its fleet had traveled a combined 250,000 miles, the Robotaxis were crashing once every 40,000 miles. For comparison, Waymo’s over 2,500 autonomous taxis, which operate across several major metropolitan areas, like Los Angeles, the Bay Area, and Austin, have racked up over 100 million fully driverless miles — with no safety monitor or driver — and crash every 98,600 miles on average, per Electrek.

All that being said, Musk has a storied track record of making grand promises he can’t deliver on. Originally, he declared that the Robotaxi service would launch with fully “unsupervised” rides with “no one in the car,” thus making it a huge embarrassment when the cabs eventually rolled out with safety monitors’ in the front passenger seat.

Musk also claimed that over 1,000 Tesla Robotaxis would be patrolling Austin “within a few months” of launching, and estimated that over a million self-driving Teslas would be deployed across the US by the end of 2026 after he releases the Robotaxi software to Tesla owners. Right now, there’s only around 30 Robotaxis in operation.

In other words, we wouldn’t put it past Musk to yoink the safety monitors, but it could very well be the case he’s just throwing a bone to his fans-slash-investors to keep stringing them along. And it worked: Tesla shares soared by up to five percent to an almost year-high after Musk’s announcement, Reuters reported.

“The news Tesla is testing Robotaxis without the safety monitors is in line with our expectations that the company is making progress in its testing, in line with management’s statements during the third quarter earnings call,” Seth Goldstein, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, told the newswire. “The market is cheering the progress.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In what can only be described as a too-on-the-nose metaphor for the United States’ weakening influence on the world, a video making the rounds on social media shows a giant replica of the Statue of Liberty toppling over in a Brazilian parking lot, backdropped by a McDonald’s and other ephemera of urban decay.

The clip shows the statue succumbing to strong winds in the city of Guaíba, which is located across the bay from the much larger port city of Porto Alegre in Southern Brazil. A number of vehicles appear to flee the falling Lady Liberty, with one bewildered pedestrian quickening his step to avoid being crushed.

The replica once stood at 110 feet, making it just over a third as tall as the iconic structure that inspired it.

WATCH: Replica of the Statue of Liberty topples due to strong winds in Guaíba, Brazil

According to the Weather Channel, the statue became a landmark in the city in 2020, and belongs to a large department store chain called Havan. The chain is known for its stores that feature Neo-Greek architecture — along with giant replicas of the Statue of Liberty that adorn almost every single branch.

Guaíba mayor Marcelo Maranata has since acknowledged the toppling, praising Havan staff and emergency teams for ensuring nobody was hurt, as Gulf News reports. Investigations are ongoing as the franchise tries to determine why the statue succumbed to the high winds.

Many social media users were first alarmed at the sight before realizing it wasn’t the original located on Liberty Island in New York City’s harbor.

“As a New Yorker, this was WILD TO WATCH,” one user tweeted.

Others pointed out the rather obvious symbolism.

“A replica of the Statue of Liberty collapsing in front of a McDonald’s perfectly sums up the state of the world right now,” a user called Proud Socialist tweeted.

Some celebrated the toppling, calling it “art” and asserting that the video “goes hard asf.”

“Just looked up metaphor in the dictionary and this was the image,” one user on Bluesky wrote.

Many pointed out that Havan is owned by eccentric free-market evangelist Luciano Hang, a strong supporter of former president Jair Bolsonaro, who began serving a 27-year prison sentence last month for leading a coup.

“We’re a country of losers,” Hang told Bloomberg in 2019. “We can be winners.”

Hang, seen as the poster child of “Bolsonomics,” has also been an ardent supporter of president Donald Trump.

Political scientist Eduardo Grin called him a “very controversial character” in comments to Bloomberg, arguing that he has become the voice of a “business elite that is very aligned with rising conservative forces.”

In other words, it’s only fitting that his business empire is attempting to erect gaudy replicas of the Statue of Liberty across Brazil.

However, an attempt to install a similar behemoth at the Havan megastore in the Brazilian capital of Brasilia eventually failed. The statue was barred from being erected, as the Financial Times reported in 2018, because of limits on the maximum height of advertising in the city’s bylaws.

Now that Bolsonaro has started serving his decades-long prison sentence, the latest video takes on a whole new layer of meaning. It’s not just a ham-fisted metaphor for the United States losing its reputation on the world stage; it’s also symbolic of a major shift in power in Brazilian politics away from far-right, free market populism.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI misinformation isn’t just for the right-wing boomers anymore. What once was mostly the domain of Facebook-bound conservatives desperate to believe welfare recipients are scamming the system has also seeped into the other side of the partisan divide.

Though research shows conservatives are much more likely to share misinformation than any other political persuasion, liberals seem to be playing catchup. Over the weekend, an AI-generated photo of Donald Trump using a walker went mega-viral on X-formerly-Twitter, gathering some 13.5 million views, according to the app’s admittedly dubious metrics.

Even if you don’t trust the view count, it’s hard to dismiss the nearly 100,000 likes and 6,000 comments on the post, which ranged from sarcastic missives about Trump’s health to angry rants about his policies. The post, uploaded by Democrat Party strategist Keith Edwards, was clearly meant as a jab at Trump’s executive order meant to halt all AI regulation at the state level.

“BREAKING: an image has leaked showing Trump using a walker moments after he signed an executive order banning states from regulating AI,” Edwards wrote, along with the lifelike image.

Though many of the posters under Edward’s post seemed to either be aware it was AI or simply notcare, it quickly broke containment, spreading to more credulous corners of the net. “Trump pictured using a walker after signing EO to deny state regulations against AI companies,” one anti-Trump poster parroted to its followers.

“Trump’s health can no longer be ignored now,” wrote the account Resist Persist on Facebook, gathering over 800 likes. “A picture was leaked of him using a walker, White House sources say he has been using a wheelchair at times, and we have all seen him sitting more over the past few months.”

Other examples of this kind of libslop abound, like California Governor Gavin Newsom’s AI-generated deepfake showing Trump, Pete Hegseth, and Stephen Miller being led away by the FBI in handcuffs. “Why are Democrats using the same AI slop that Republicans started using in the fall,” one commenter said. “We all agreed this is cringy shit.”

Back in 2024, some Democratic Party hopefuls spread an AI-modified image of Kamala Harris in a McDonalds uniform, apparently to boost her middle-class bonafides. “Hey MAGA cultists, explain this,” one poster challenged on Threads. In reality, the image had actually been generated by a pro-Trump poster and shared on X as a joke, where it soon spread beyond its original confines.

Other cases have involved generative AI voices, like the Joe Biden deepfake encouraging voters to “save their votes” for the November election, as opposed to the Democrat Party primary.

Whichever way you slice it, it seems that as generative AI becomes more sophisticated, the number of AI hoaxes on both sides of the aisle are only going up.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/slate-crosses-150000-reservations-despite-waning-ev-truck-enthusiasm/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Slate Auto, the electric truck startup backed by Jeff Bezos, has now collected more than 150,000 refundable reservations for its low-cost EV due out at the end of 2026.

The company shared the figure in a new Q&A video with CEO Chris Barman, where she answers questions from those reservation holders about the company’s plans for self-driving (there are none), or whether owners will be able to affix a car seat to the optional rear seats (they will).

Reservations are a somewhat helpful metric for gauging general interest in a new car, but they are by no means a signal of sure success. Time and again over the last few years, we have seen EV companies tout reservation figures only to go bust, either because they weren’t able to get through the difficult process of standing up production, or because they weren’t ready to have cars on the road.

For Slate, it’s promising that the number has continued to climb, meaning that new reservations are coming in faster than any attrition the company might be seeing. That said, Slate crossed the 100,000 reservation mark all the way back in May, right after it came out of stealth, so it took a good seven months to grow the list by 50%. And looking forward, Slate plans to make 150,000 of these EVs per year at the factory it’s refurbishing in Warsaw, Indiana, so it will need to attract far more buyers if it plans to succeed in the market.

Any continued enthusiasm for Slate’s EV has to be a reassuring sign for the company, given the state of electric trucks overall these days. Just yesterday, Ford announced it is ending production of the all-electric F-150 Lightning, the first major battery-powered pickup truck to hit the U.S. market a few years ago. (It’s being replaced by a version with a gas generator attached.) The company said the Lightning simply wasn’t making enough money — a fact exacerbated by how Ford was never able to sell more than a few thousand per quarter. Sales of other electric trucks, like Tesla’s Cybertruck and General Motors’ Silverado EV, have also struggled to stay above that mark.

Of course, the Lightning was a sort-of Frankenstein’s monster of a vehicle, with Ford shoehorning EV technology into a design that was originally meant for gas powertrains. Slate’s truck has been designed from the ground up to be an EV, and the company is hyper-focused on selling it for a price tag in the mid-$20,000 range. The decline of offerings from Ford and others may help clear the way for Slate to find early success — that is, until Ford’s real shot at a low-cost EV hits the market in 2027.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/doordash-rolls-out-zesty-an-ai-social-app-for-discovering-new-restaurants/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">DoorDash is launching a new AI-powered social app that’s designed to help users quickly find local restaurants. The app, called Zesty, is initially available in the San Francisco Bay Area and New York.

With the app, DoorDash is branching out beyond food delivery and stepping into the social and discovery space. The idea behind the app is to get rid of the need to read a bunch of different reviews, look up different menus, or browse TikTok when looking for a new place to eat.

Once people open the app and sign in with their DoorDash accounts, they can ask an AI chatbot for personalized recommendations based on what they’re looking for. In an Instagram promo post, the company shared that users can type prompts like, “A low-key dinner in Williamsburg that’s actually good for introverts” to find specific recommendations. Users will also see suggested prompts, such as “Brunch spots good for groups,” and “Romantic dinner with a vintage feel.”

DoorDash co-founder Andy Fang wrote in an X post that the app aggregates info across DoorDash, Google Maps, TikTok, and more to “curate the best suggestions from the web.”

The app also learns your tastes to figure out what you do and don’t like. Once you come across a recommendation you’re interested in, you can save it and share it with others.

Users can view and share photos and comments about restaurants they’ve visited, discover content from others, and follow people just like on any social network.

“At DoorDash, we’re always looking for new ways to help people connect with the best of their communities,” a DoorDash spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch. “We’re piloting an app called Zesty to make it easier to discover great nearby restaurants, coffee shops, bars, and more through personalized search and social sharing. We’re excited to learn from early testers as we keep shaping what local discovery can look like.”

News of the app’s launch was first reported by Bloomberg.

Of course, some people may not want to download a whole new app to find new restaurants when they could simply use Google. For people who have already embedded AI into their daily lives, they may already be using services like ChatGPT and Gemini to discover new restaurants. However, the app could be a welcome launch for people who want to be part of a social network that’s all about discovering new restaurants.

The launch of the new app marks DoorDash’s latest effort to branch beyond delivery services, as the company earlier this year launched features that allow customers to make reservations for in-person dining and earn in-store rewards.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Meta announced on Tuesday an update to its AI glasses that will allow you to better hear people talking when you’re in a noisy environment. The feature will initially become available on Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses in the U.S. and Canada, the company says. In addition, the glasses are getting another update that lets you use Spotify to play a song that matches what’s in your current view.

For instance, if you’re looking at an album cover, the glasses could play a song by that artist. Or if you’re looking at your Christmas tree with a pile of gifts, you could play holiday music. This addition is more of a gimmick, of course, but it demonstrates how Meta is thinking about connecting what people see with actions they can take in their apps.

The conversation-focus feature, meanwhile, seems more practical. First announced at Meta’s Connect conference earlier this year, the feature uses the AI glasses’ open-ear speakers to amplify the voice of the person you’re talking to. Meta says smart glasses wearers will also be able to adjust the amplification level by swiping the right temple of their glasses, or via the device settings. This will allow them to set the level more precisely to match their current environment, whether that’s a busy restaurant or bar, club, commuter train, or anything else.

How well the feature works, of course, will still need to be tested. However, the idea of using smart accessories as tools to help with hearing isn’t limited to Meta. Apple’s AirPods already offer a Conversation Boost feature designed to help you focus on the person you’re talking to, and the Pro models more recently added support for a clinical-grade Hearing Aid feature as well.

While the conversation-focus feature is limited to the U.S. and Canada, the Spotify feature is offered in English in a larger number of markets, including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Norway, Spain, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates, the U.K., and the U.S.

The software update (v21) will first become available to those who are enrolled in Meta’s Early Access Program, which requires first joining a waitlist and being approved. It will later roll out more broadly.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Midway through William Greaves’s documentary Nationtime, which follows the 1972 National Black Political Convention, a woman named Audley Moore stands in a busy hallway preaching to people’s backs. She is clad in a burgundy-and-navy-floral kaftan and matching headwrap. Her voice rings out amid the bustling crowd of convention-goers: “Now let me tell you: Benjamin Franklin said, ‘Those who seek temporary security rather than basic liberty deserve neither.’ I’m demanding reparations. That’s all I can see now. That’s the answer for our people.” She is paraphrasing Franklin’s quote, one whose meaning is frequently misconstrued, but the invocation of the Founding Father lends both heft and irony to her calls for redress from the American government. Moore catches a few passersby and jokes with them, shoving a typewritten paper in their hands as they walk away. A few stay to listen. This scene aptly encapsulates the life of Audley “Queen Mother” Moore, an often-overlooked Black-nationalist organizer who fought vociferously for Black self-determination until her death in 1997.

A laudable new biography, Queen Mother: Black Nationalism, Reparations, and the Untold Story of Audley Moore, by the historian Ashley D. Farmer, uses Moore’s story to chart a trajectory of Black-nationalist activism in the United States, from Garveyism in the 1920s (Moore belonged to the New Orleans chapter of Garvey’s Universal Negro Improvement Association, or UNIA) to the 1995 Million Man March for Black-male unity and self-empowerment. Moore’s radical ideas—including her desire for a separate Black nation in the South—earned her ridicule at times, but her sharp critiques of American white supremacy also found purchase, influencing activists such as Malcolm X, Muhammad Ahmad, and Charles J. Ogletree Jr.

Despite her prolific political organizing and wide reach during her lifetime, Moore has largely been omitted from the history of civil-rights activism. Her exclusion from traditional archives is a familiar story to scholars of Black American life, especially those who study the contributions of women. Farmer writes that her book, which she spent a decade researching and writing, required painstaking effort to locate traces of Moore in personal papers, land deeds, files from the FBI and the House Un-American Activities Committee, oral-history tapes, and lingering memories (much of Moore’s ephemera were lost in a house fire). The resulting work, which examines her involvement in a strikingly diverse roster of organizations, is a portrait of a woman with uncanny savvy and flexibility.

Moore worked with nationalists, Communists, and moderate liberals, white and Black alike—whatever it took to pursue goals such as fair housing regulations, just labor laws, and equitable resource distribution. She was sometimes self-contradicting as an activist, which isn’t to say she wasn’t singularly dedicated to her cause. She seems to have simply understood that achieving her objectives—in all their multiplicity—required maximal fluidity. Activists with unchanging missions might be easier to pin down (and thus less likely to be forgotten). But Moore’s story shows that the Black-nationalist movement also encompassed people who were willing to find areas of compromise in order to get the job done.

Moore was born in 1898 in New Iberia, Louisiana, to a well-off family that descended from both enslaved and free Black communities. But both her parents died before she reached adulthood, and she was forced to turn to domestic work in white households, one of the few economic avenues available to her at the time. In the violent, segregated South during World War I, Moore “looked on as America made its grand debut on the world stage as a great emancipator—a masterful public performance as liberty’s beacon shining from the West, all while extending white supremacy’s tendrils across the globe,” Farmer writes. Having noticed that the Army didn’t offer as much support for Black soldiers as it did for white ones, Moore and her two sisters provided meals and recreation space to these troops in Anniston, Alabama. Losing the protection of Black elite society that her parents had afforded her, and witnessing the contradiction between America’s actions abroad and at home, helped shape Moore’s lifelong advocacy for civil rights and for working-class concerns.

It is difficult to overstate the influence on Moore’s development of Marcus Garvey, the foremost Black nationalist of the 20th century. Garvey sought to revitalize “Africa for the Africans,” and to repatriate people of African descent to their motherland. He also championed Black pride, self-reliance, and racial separatism on the basis that white people would never recognize Black people’s human rights. His teachings showed the fledgling activist how to analyze Black people’s social conditions and gave her the desire to unify Black people everywhere. In 1922, Moore joined the UNIA in New Orleans, attending meetings and studying the history of the global African diaspora. She and her then-husband once even packed up all of their possessions, planning to expatriate to Liberia as part of one of Garvey’s “Back to Africa” initiatives, before ultimately deciding to stay in the United States.

After Garvey was deported in 1927 following a mail-fraud conviction, Moore was forced to channel her activism into vehicles beyond the declining UNIA. A move to Harlem brought her into the orbit of the Communist Party. A card-carrying member by 1936, Moore cut her teeth protesting racist and sexist discrimination across New York City, forming tenants’ rights organizations, and sending aid to Ethiopia after a 1935 invasion by Italy. In response to Black Communists’ demands that the party address both class and race oppression, Communist leaders had come to believe that Black people constituted an oppressed nation, and that it was within the party’s interest to fight for their rights. But Moore’s association with the Communists was less of an ideological commitment, Farmer writes, than a practical way to work toward Garvey’s “anti-imperialist, pro-Black” goals. Collaborating with the moderate NAACP, Moore advocated for the freedom of five of the Scottsboro Boys, a group of nine Black teens falsely accused of raping two white women in Alabama.

Moore also worked on many causes tangential to Black nationalism, including lowering the price of milk for children and boycotting goods from Nazi Germany. Among her other “strange bedfellows,” Farmer mentions Mary McLeod Bethune’s respectable, middle-class National Council of Negro Women, “an unlikely place for a Black Nationalist and Communist” who was primarily self-educated. But Moore’s success in organizing with Communists had taught her that, as Farmer writes, “an organization need not be explicitly Black Nationalist in its mission to advance the cause.”

“The cause” itself, for Moore—and, truthfully, for many Black nationalists—couldn’t be distilled into a clear, unified goal. As James Edward Smethurst, a scholar of 20th-century Black radical movements, writes in his book The Black Arts Movement, the actual definitions and tactics of Black nationalism were secondary to the belief that, without self-determination, Black people would be “oppressed and exploited second-class (or non-) citizens in the United States.” Moore’s activism exemplifies how, as Smethurst writes, “old Left and old Nationalist spaces often intersected with each other and with those of the New Left, the Civil Rights Movement, and the new nationalists,” particularly Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam, “in surprising ways.”

In 1950, Moore fell out with the Communist Party because of its shifting focus away from Black equality. Over the next two decades, her politics would harden; she mentored many young nationalists, including Malcolm X and Ahmad, a founder of the Revolutionary Action Movement. But as Farmer writes, guiding all of Moore’s work was a single overarching dream, rooted in her early days with the UNIA: gaining reparations. In 1962, Moore launched a campaign to persuade the U.S. government to pay reparations to descendants of enslaved Africans, which she timed for the centennial of the Emancipation Proclamation the following year. She and her fellow activists charged that the country owed Black Americans $500 trillion, to be paid in land and cash distributed to individuals annually. She even sought the formation of a separatist Black nation in the U.S.—what she called a “national territory in a country developed by our blood and tears and unrequited slave labor.” This was groundbreaking at a time when the zeitgeist prioritized inclusion in the American body politic rather than separation and redress.

In the 1960s, Moore would become known by the honorific “Queen Mother Moore,” in recognition of her role as an elder stateswoman to Black organizers across the political spectrum. During a trip to Ghana in 1972, she was crowned with the title in an Asante ceremony. In the ’70s, she reached the height of her influence in the Black Power Movement, becoming a mentor figure to a Detroit-based separatist group, the Republic of New Afrika, that advocated for five Black Belt states to be given to Black Americans as a nation-state. In spite of the group’s unrealized dreams—as well as struggles with surveillance and violent disruption from the FBI’s Counterintelligence Program, or COINTELPRO—Farmer writes that Moore still affirmed, at the end of the ’70s, “I’m a hard nationalist.”

Read: A book that puts the life back into biography

In Queen Mother, Farmer takes a clear-eyed look at Moore’s foibles, noting her absenteeism during her son’s formative years, her embrace of patriarchal hierarchy in Black communities, and her exhortations for Black women to embrace polygyny to facilitate nation building. Farmer acknowledges that Black nationalists sometimes took violent action, claiming the “right to govern themselves and to defend themselves.” But she also seeks to correct a common misunderstanding of the ideology, arguing that it’s not the “violent, incoherent, and nihilistic inverse of the Civil Rights Movement,” but a campaign with the very same goals, sought through different means (separation from white society, rather than integration). Still, many of Moore’s ideas “were on the fringe then,” Farmer writes, “as they are now.” The historian doesn’t explain away Moore’s infatuation and personal association with the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, who in 1975 invited her to attend a meeting of the Organization of African Unity in Kampala. As Farmer writes, Moore was “thrilled” by him and seemed to ignore the fact that his rule had become known for its corruption and human-rights abuses.

But Farmer doesn’t need to justify all of Moore’s beliefs and goals to make a case for her influence. Her meticulous study of the many figures, movements, and organizations Moore worked with shows that her contributions were pivotal, rather than peripheral. Moore was a Garveyite through line—what Farmer calls a midwife—to many 20th-century Black-nationalist activists, a lot of them men, who remain more famous than her. Queen Mother establishes her as a titan in her own right, a central influence in nearly a century of global Black-liberation struggles, and a reminder for modern activists of a persistent truth: that cooperation does not have to mean compromising one’s values, and that those who dream of freedom have more than one way of achieving it.

            <div id="article-text">“Open it the fuck back up!” the muscular Matt Honeycutt commands, mic gripped in his left fist, mustache prickling with indignation. He is balefully slash lovingly surveying the crowd and finding it a little sluggish and closely packed for his taste. “I need all my primitive, low-IQ motherfuckers!” Behind him, his band, Kublai Khan TX, rears and slumps into its next song. And the crowd lurches; the crowd flexes; the crowd feels its core, which is both a sucking emptiness and a site of repellent energy, like the space cleared by a fistfight.

“Build myself in the dirt!” Honeycutt roars. “Sacred right, sacred curse.”

“I’d hate to be in that pit right now,” someone says behind me.

Hot autumn night has fallen over Worcester, Massachusetts, over the huge, baked asphalt lot behind the Palladium, the ancestral seat of the Northeast’s heavy-metal kingdom. This is the New England Metal and Hardcore Festival, 25 bands on three stages, 10 unbroken hours of heavy music, and all day, I’ve been watching the pit—the mosh pit, the area close to the stage where inflamed dancers whirl and collide. I’ve been watching it, and skulking around it journalistically, because I am possessed by an idea: What if the pit, this ritualized maelstrom at the heart of the hardcore-metal crowd, could teach us something about how to live together in 2025—about how to be?

Heavy metal, of all music, knows just how sick we are. Just how pinned down by depression, addiction, insanity, technology, the machine of society and the thumb of God. Metal has been telling us this—gleefully, monstrously—since Ozzy Osbourne first sang, “Back on Earth, the flame of life burns low / Everywhere is misery and woe.” It’s a message that never goes out of style. But right now in America—what with the digital splatteration, the black-hole subjectivity, and the goon squad crouched in a van behind Dunkin’—it has, shall we say, an especial piquancy.

Metalfest, as I like to call it, has been running at the Palladium since 1999, reliably showcasing the best and the brightest, the worst and the darkest, from across the spectrum of metal and hardcore punk. When I say “10 unbroken hours of heavy music,” I’m not kidding. Metalfest is immaculately organized and relentlessly programmed, and the heaviness is continuous.

Inside the Palladium, there’s a small, explosive room for the bands at the jumpier and more hardcore-punk end of the spectrum, bands such as Hard Target, from Central Massachusetts, and New York City’s Madball. Outside in the lot, where the metal hordes are gathered, two large stages face each other across an expanse of a few hundred yards, and when a band (say, Gideon) stops playing at one end, another band (say, Full of Hell) starts up—immediately—at the other end. As one set finishes, in other words—THANK YOU, WOOST-AAAAAH!—its last chord still decaying and its ions still swimming in the afternoon air, you hear behind you a scuttle of drums and a squawk of feedback and an AWRIGHT! LET’S FUCKING GO! All you have to do is turn around.

Perfect. Perfect for this crowd. For this is the deepest and most unassuaged desire of all metalheads: to live in a state of continuous heaviness.

And heaviness is …? I’ll hazard some definitions. It’s a sense of cosmic tragedy, a love of the low end, an affinity for the thicker frequencies of existence, a paradoxically joyful desolation. It’s the compression of Time in a riff. It’s the weight of experience and the curve of space. It’s the caped shadow of Ozzy, his wings spread, crying, “Lost in the wheels of confusion.” It’s the mood conveyed by the slogans on the backs of the various band T-shirts that everyone at Metalfest is wearing: FUCK YOUR LIFE; SORROW WILL PREVAIL; YOU WILL DIE MY ENEMY.

The pit is an institution, at least 40 years old. Who started it? Where? Was it birthed in the skinhead cauldron of New York’s Lower East Side, or in Southern California, with the punk-rock surfers and skaters of Huntington Beach? The legends abound, but somewhere (or more likely in several places at once), around the beginning of the 1980s, the crowd at U.S. hardcore shows opened up. Where there had been a crush or a scrum, there was suddenly and dramatically a space: for violence, for collision, for expression, for the hardest of the hardcore. The pit. And as the aggression and acceleration of hardcore migrated into metal, and into the roomier, boomier venues of the metal circuit, the pit got bigger.

(And not every hardcore or post-hardcore band was pro-pit. Fugazi, of Washington, D.C., would regularly stop their shows mid-song, the set’s momentum quiveringly arrested, to address thuggish behavior in the space in front of the stage.)

As to who’s in the pit, who’s making the pit happen, let’s take a look. There are big boys throwing their weight around, and there are wild skinnies with flying arms and spinning back-kicks, chopping out their emergency version of personal space. There are cheerful barging amateurs, happy to be bounced about, and there are prowling malevolences, waiting for the moment to blindside someone or chuck an elbow in their face. There is the occasional fearless woman. Like America, the pit is just barely a democracy. But you need youth, and you need strength: It’s no country for old men.

And here’s something interesting. The amount of fights, bloody noses, chest-to-chest confrontations, bouncer interventions I spot at Metalfest: zero. A self-policing environment, to a remarkable degree. Although I do overhear one young woman in post-pit distress—“That was the stupidest shit I’ve ever seen, girl! I am livid! Like, who is this bitch? I’ve never seen her before!”—while her partner murmurs indecipherable sounds of consolation.

Part of being a metal or hardcore front man in 2025 is knowing how to work the pit, appointing yourself a specialist in mob physics. All day at Metalfest, you could hear them calling out the moves: “Make a circle pit!” (a vortex); “Two-step! TWO-STEPPP!” (a dance, a kind of hobbit-y stomp); “Side to fuckin’ side!” (self-explanatory). The crowd will obediently convulse, or it won’t. “Okay, now we’re gonna play a game called Wall of Death,” the singer of Despised Icon announces during their early-evening set. “The game’s pretty simple. I’m gonna count to four—”

“TOO HARD!” one wag bellows in front of us.

The Wall of Death, incidentally, involves splitting the crowd down the middle, creating a channel of space, and then having the two sides charge across it like clashing medieval armies.

Mid-afternoon, battered by metal, away from the melee, I have a chat with the least metal-looking person I can find—Black, nonbinary, softly and secretly smiling, in pants and combat boots but with floating diaphanous layers. “I’m tripping balls,” they tell me, which partly explains their air of conspicuous apartness: They are on a private journey, drifting through Metalfest on luminous drug filaments. They show me their sketchbook, full of tarot-like images of aliens and birds.

“I saw you in the pit,” I say. “How did it feel in there?”

The soft, secret smile. “It’s all hugging; it’s all love. They want the contact.”

You’re wondering about the politics. Metal itself, being essentially a sensation in the brain stem, is apolitical, but metalheads are human, and they have their opinions. And if you want to listen to this elemental, unreconstructed music, you’re going to have to take your dose of illiberalism. In the pit, you’re going to have to deal with the guy whose T-shirt reads I STAND FOR THE FLAG AND KNEEL FOR THE CROSS. The front men are demagogues; the crowd is suggestible, fanatical; and between one downstroked chord and the next, you can hear the eclipse of the Enlightenment.

But love abides. Care abides. “I’ve got 15 seconds ’til I say some real shit,” Mychal Soto, a guitarist for Oklahoma’s PeelingFlesh, shouts, wiping his face mid-set with a towel in the afternoon glare and looking out at the crowd. “This set right here goes out to anybody that’s a minority or a person of color that’s had to battle some real shit,” he continues. “Even though that’s not your problem? Make it your problem—make it your fucking problem. I think it’s time for us as a people to become human again. It’s time to give a shit about the people next to us. We have to stop this madness, because if we don’t, this country is going to be over in our lifetime. This ain’t a cry for either side; this is a cry for love and compassion for human beings. So LET’S DO THIS SHIT.”

Five hours later, Honeycutt doffs his baseball hat to the audience. “This next track,” he declares, “goes out to all the ladies in the house!” But this isn’t some sexist rave-up. This isn’t “Girls, Girls, Girls,” by Mötley Crüe. This one’s about truck-stop sex workers, exploitation, and generational abuse. This is Kublai Khan TX’s “Swan Song”: “To all the ladies working Iowa 80 …” Could it be the most savagely empathetic pro-woman song ever produced by a bunch of big hairy metal dudes? If you’d heard the chorus of women’s voices singing along at Metalfest—“For all the fear, every tear / Slowly burning your sight / For every moment in the light / I fucking see you tonight”—you wouldn’t hesitate to say yes, yes, yes. “Wonderful!” Honeycutt growls contentedly.

There is a set by Cannibal Corpse at one end of the Palladium lot, a set by Lorna Shore at the other end. Then Metalfest wraps up, and we drift off, vibrationally pummeled, numb and gladdened, into the heavy-metal night. Reality will come with the dawn: normal life, the 2025 model, with its warpings of ambient pressure and its weightless panics. For now, we’re held in the sweet penumbra of heaviness. As for my big idea—that we can heal ourselves in the pit—well, let’s just say that it’s the kind of idea only a journalist would have. But I can still see them whirling and colliding, the dancers, and my mind slows it all to half speed, and shafts of beauty beam out, dazzlingly, from the blur of the limbs and the ecstatic, grimacing faces.

It looks like chaos, but there’s no real chaos, is there? Everything’s cause and effect, if you know where to look.</div>

New buildings for AI datacenters are clearly the plan.  The weight per rack and the rack height are minor considerations compared to the electricity and cooling requirements.  This is obviously the approach Tesla is taking, having custom-built the Cortex datacenter, and now with construction well underway for Cortex 2.

With 350kW/rack, a large datacenter is looking at hundreds of MW.  No wonder Tesla had to build a new substation for Cortex 2.  I haven&#39;t looked at what the other companies are doing, but it c

They should be building entire power plants on-site.  If they can&#39;t build a power plant at a given site, then build the whole thing, power plant and battery storage included, somewhere else.

An alternative to on-site power is a power plant that&#39;s close by (within tens of miles) then build dedicated power-transmission lines from the power plant to the data center.

Both solutions avoid the &quot;we are going to bust the electrical grid with our power demands&quot; problem.

If they are able to achieve their goals with the AI, then in another seven or eight years they&#39;ll finally have figured out how to optimize personalized mattress sales.

I&#39;m not sure why there aren&#39;t competent engineers working at these places. They keep making the dumbest decisions possible, it seems.

Like, put the datacenter underground and it doesn&#39;t need as much cooling.

Put the datacenter in an underground chamber built like a yakchal and it needs even less cooling.

The problem is that the datacenter engineers don&#39;t seem to know very much about how to build things, as evidenced by their continued massive use of power and freshwater. And their validation of the classic &quot;th

Have US tech companies considered following the laws in the countries in which they wish to operate?

Full support. Please save us from EU overreaching dystopian digital directives and censorship.

Trump and his supporters only claim to support law enforcement when they aren&#39;t the ones being investigated/prosecuted for crimes.   Trump is a criminal and with recent activities, shows the current US government is a rogue state.

Trump even attacks US citizens these days, so it&#39;s NOT good.

Almost like US companies have problems operating lawfully or ethically.

Everyone remembers the pool scene from Caddyshack. Except now the world is the pool and there&#39;s an orange turd floating.This reality won&#39;t have quite as happy of an ending as that scene. Our turd won&#39;t end up being a chocolate bar.

They are used as a destabilisation tool in Europe for the profit of fascists. I don&#39;t even understand why they don&#39;t ban them and put a red notice on the arse of their CEO ? Russia Today was outright banned in the EU. The responsibles for Radio Television Libre des Milles Collines were not fined, but jailed for life. That&#39;s where Elon belongs: In jail.

It would also make the repulsive people who invest in those companies lose money, which would be a good thing.

Fortunately, the Europeans understand much better now the US will not protect them when NATO will be attacked so i don&#39;t think that lever is that strong now. And that the morals of a child rapist are exactly what they should have expected.

It&#39;s called giving people the freedom to use whatever they want to use, as long as the &quot;whatever they want to use&quot; isn&#39;t breaking the laws that are put in place to protect consumers.

&quot;European Union has not walked back broader regulation of company business practices while also proceeding with investigations of major American tech firms like Google, X, Amazon and Meta....  .... because the impotent USA isn&#39;t investigating said American tech firms, instead opting to accept bribes from them.&quot; There FTFY

In one of the more horrific weekends in recent memory, a mass shooting rocked Rhode Island’s Brown University. It hit hard on the campus where we teach and study, Amherst College, located as it is two hours away. Brown is not exactly a sister school of Amherst, but many of the students here have friends there, as do many faculty members. And like Brown, Amherst has an open campus.

Less than 12 hours after the mass shooting at Brown, a terror attack stunned Sydney’s Bondi Beach, targeting Jews. This was another blow to us as Jews at Amherst. Between Bondi Beach and Brown, 17 are dead, and more than 40 wounded. And we are left thinking about what can be done in this country to make it possible for students and faculty not to have to look over their shoulders during classes or final examinations?

We want to be able to teach and learn without the fear that the horror of Bondi Beach or Brown will happen here or on any other campus, to Jews and not Jews alike. Despite what many are arguing in the wake of these two tragedies, reasonable gun regulations help make classrooms like ours safer.

It’s true that Rhode Island’s gun control laws already are stronger than those of most American states. Sandy Hook Promise says Rhode Island has experienced just two of the country’s over 3,000 mass shootings since 2020 and has America’s fourth-lowest firearm death rate. And Australia’s gun laws are stricter than any in this country.

Surely, we will hear that guns don’t kill, people do. If gun control is so effective, gun rights activists will ask, why did it fail twice this weekend?

That’s the wrong question. We know that even the best policies don’t work perfectly. And in the United States, people can get around the strict laws in one state by getting guns in other states. History, though, tells us that gun control works.

In the 18 years leading up to the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, Australia experienced 12 mass shootings. Then, on April 28 of that year, Martin Bryant went on a shooting spree in the Tasmanian tourist town, killing 35 and wounding another 23.

That made 18 years, marked by 13 mass shootings. The Australian government was finally ready to respond.

Less than two weeks after Port Arthur, on May 10, Australia adopted its National Firearms Agreement. The NFA has several provisions not found in any state’s gun laws in America. Australians wishing to purchase a firearm must first establish a “genuine reason” for ownership. Importantly, their reason cannot be personal protection and is instead limited to occupational use, hunting, sport shooting, or being a “bona fide collector.” If at any point a gun owner no longer has a genuine reason, their license and firearms are removed.

The NFA contains a compensatory firearm buyback program, a limit of one gun purchase per 28 days, and does not allow for private ownership of “self-loading” (semi-automatic or automatic) firearms. When the NFA was agreed to in 1996, 15.3 percent of Australian households owned guns. By 2005, this number fell to 6.2 percent.

And for two decades, the country experienced virtually no mass shootings. Still, critics of the NFA argue it’s been ineffective, saying the decline in gun-related homicides post-NFA was a continuation of an already existing trend.

While it is true that it’s difficult to definitively prove that the NFA is solely responsible for the decline in Australia’s gun-related homicide rate, it’s hard to contest the NFA’s profound effect on mass shootings.

Since January 2020, according to an Associated Press report, there have been two mass shootings in Australia. In the U.S., that number is 3,499. That means that faculty and students at Australian universities don’t have the burden of teaching and learning in fear.

But in the United States, they do. Our mass shooting problem has long been a problem on our campuses.

As the Voice of America’s report on college campus shootings notes, “The first mass shooting in modern U.S. history at a college or university took place in 1966 at the University of Texas at Austin. Fifteen people were killed and 31 others injured.” Since then, they have occurred at places like Florida State University, the University of Virginia, Virginia Tech, and Northern Arizona University.

Australia’s National Firearms Agreement works because it functions universally—not by state—demonstrating the need for a national-level solution in the United States. Why haven’t we done what Australia has done?

The usual answer is the Second Amendment and our distinctive gun culture. But even former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a famous supporter of gun rights, recognized that it’s still possible to regulate guns in adherence with his own extremely gun-rights friendly view of the Second Amendment.

For example, Massachusetts, where we work and study, does not currently honor the concealed carry permits of other states. To own a gun you must be at least 21, take a firearm safety course, and pass a thorough background check to obtain a “license to carry.” Everytown has found substantial increases in gun violence in states with weaker permit requirements.

Or take regulations like the Gun Control Act of 1968. Among other things, it includes licensing requirements and “prohibited persons” who cannot buy guns. In addition, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, in place since 1998, has led to denials in over 2 million potential firearm sales. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act of 2022 enhanced background checks and extended prohibitions on individuals convicted of certain offenses.

It is clear that avenues exist for Congress to regulate firearms. For the sake of students, teachers, and Americans everywhere, they need to use them. We need our own version of Australia’s National Firearms Agreement.

It would be a hard sell to our current pro-gun Supreme Court. But as activists have learned in other areas, what seems implausible now may someday seem like a common-sense reading of the Constitution.

We know that the 1999 shooting at Columbine High School that killed 13 and wounded 24, or the 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech that left 32 dead, 17 injured—to say nothing of Sandy Hook, 2012, 26 dead; the Pulse Nightclub, 2016, 49 dead; or in 2018 at Tree of Life Synagogue, 11 dead—didn’t spur the kind of change we are advocating. But we can’t give up.

We are afraid, and we want to do something to alleviate it. We are not the only ones.

Surveys taken last year found that 1 in 3 college students fear that an outbreak of gun violence will occur on their campus. After last weekend, it will only get worse.

If Port Arthur could be enough to spur Australia to act, why can’t a weekend in which students and faculty on college campuses, and all Americans, had to bear witness to mass murder at Bondi Beach and Brown, be enough for us?

My governor wants Americans to stop shouting “Fire!” in a crowded theater.

Generally wise advice, that. But it is hard to take him seriously when the theater is, indeed, on fire. And he has come to support one of the worst political arsonists in American history.

To be fair, Spencer Cox, the Republican governor of Utah, faces a dilemma that burdens many of his party’s leaders, especially those who were active before the rise of Donald Trump and may wish to do meaningful work after he is gone. How to behave so as to have hope that the MAGA beast you deplore might eat you last.

Cox has earned himself a lot of national media attention recently for what he calls the “Disagree Better” campaign, launched a couple of years ago with a bipartisan collective of other U.S. governors. He has appeared with Democrats including Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, and Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania to promote the idea.

The initiative took on added significance in September when the right-wing firebrand Charlie Kirk was murdered while giving an open-air talk at Utah Valley University in Orem.

Cox was right to seize the occasion to repeat his call for Americans to reject political violence, turn down the temperature, get off social media algorithms that deliberately fry your brain, and learn to talk rather than fight. He took advantage of the increased media focus to take his message to such prominent news outlets as 60 Minutes on CBS and NPR’s Morning Edition.

“I’m not asking anybody to hold hands and hug it out,” he told CBS correspondent Scott Pelley. “I’m trying to get people to stop shooting each other.”

Sensible people can raise no argument to that. And it is difficult to watch or listen to Cox and argue that he is anything but sincere.

But the governor’s peace message is all but overwhelmed by the fact that he is a member of the political party that has thrice nominated, and twice elected, as president of the United States a man whose popularity and power exist only on rising air currents of fear, prejudice, division, and violence.

Trump is a hate vampire who would instantly dissolve in the sunlight if America suddenly became a peaceful nation practicing respectful politics.

Cox seemed to see that, saying in 2016 that he was not supporting Trump due to the obvious flaws in his character.

“I think he represents the worst of what our great country stands for,” Cox said at the time.

Cox didn’t vote for Trump in 2020 either, though he recognized the president as the head of his party. He rightly and courageously blamed Trump for the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol and said the president should resign because of it.

Early on, Cox said he wasn’t going to vote for Trump (or Joe Biden) in 2024, either.

Then, after Trump survived an assassination attempt, Cox turned around. He sent a letter to the president, saying he believed that Trump had been spared death for a reason and calling on him to do the one thing that every sentient being should know Trump will never do: Bring peace.

Cox now risks seeming less visionary than gullible. Like Franklin Roosevelt imagining he could reason with Stalin at Yalta. (The Soviet dictator was, in FDR’s hopeful mind, “get-atable.”)

Maybe Cox decided not to mount what would likely be a futile frontal assault on Trump’s hateful pronouncements and policies and chose to start working a quieter long game.

Maybe he just wanted to be reelected governor.

As an opinion writer and editor for the Salt Lake Tribune, I’ve been following Cox’s career since 2013, when he was plucked from relative obscurity to fill a vacant spot as lieutenant governor.

He’s no newcomer to political comity, and has always seemed sincere promoting it.

In Utah, being lieutenant governor, which Cox was from 2013 to 2021, is a real job. It includes such administrative duties as running the state’s election mechanisms, which Cox took to heart by promoting voter registration—sometimes featuring himself in goofy person-on-the-street videos—and flawlessly implementing the state’s vote-by-mail process.

When his boss, Gov. Gary Herbert, didn’t run again in 2020, Cox rode his jus’ folks, alfalfa-farmer persona (he’s also a lawyer and a telecom executive who served as a small-town mayor and state legislator in a fast-rising political career) into the governor’s mansion.

That was also the beginning of his reputation as a political peacemaker.

He and his Democratic opponent that year, a law professor named Chris Peterson, ran a joint advertisement somewhat stylistically reminiscent of the Mac vs. PC spots from about 2006. In it, each candidate asked for your vote, but spent more time calling for political harmony.

“We can debate issues without degrading each other’s character,” Peterson said.

“We can disagree without hating each other,” Cox answered.

It was a YouTube sensation. #StandUnited.

Utah hasn’t elected a Democrat to statewide office since 1996, so whoever carries the GOP nomination has long been considered a shoo-in come November. Thus Cox was not risking anything by giving his underfunded Democratic rival some oxygen that he otherwise would not have had.

In 2024, the path to reelection was a little more fraught. Cox drew a right-wing, MAGA primary challenger and was denied the endorsement of the Utah State Republican Convention. But Cox gathered enough signatures on a nominating petition to still be on the ballot in the Republican primary, which he won with 55 percent of the vote.

In November, with that same MAGA opponent drawing 13.5 percent in a write-in bid, Cox won reelection with 53 percent of the vote.

Between the primary and the general, when politicians are generally expected to crabwalk from the extremes to the center, Cox shifted from a quiet Never Trump Republican to a supporter of Trump’s campaign to return to the White House. He went so far as to join Trump for a cringe-inducing—and, because it was so blatantly political, illegal—visit to Arlington National Cemetery.

As governor, Cox has held moderate to right-wing Republican positions that should have made renomination an easy matter. He signed legislation allowing Utahns to carry firearms without a permit. He favors reducing federal environmental regulations and rescinding the designation of national monuments—a big deal in a state where 64 percent of the land is federally owned.

He has backed attempts in the Legislature to gerrymander the state’s four congressional districts in favor of Republicans and signed a law banning the fluoridation of drinking water in the state.

He has flip-flopped on diversity, equity, and inclusion policies in state government and education institutions—was supportive, now opposes—and supports the state’s attempts to basically ban abortion.

Cox had also given touchingly humane voice to the idea that LGBTQ+ people deserve respect and in 2022 vetoed a bill that would have prohibited transgender youth from participating in school sports. (The veto was quickly overridden by the Republican supermajority in the Utah Legislature. And Cox has since signed other legislation seen as curtailing transgender rights.)

It drew national attention and led Time magazine to dub him “The Red-State Governor Who’s Not Afraid to Be ‘Woke.’ ”

Such sentiments, along with his opposition to Trump, earned him a round of boos when he addressed the Utah Republican State Convention in 2024. “Maybe you just hate that I don’t hate enough,” Cox told the delegates.

To all outward appearances, Spencer Cox has little hate in him. But if he won’t more forcefully call out the would-be dictator who thrives on negative emotions, the cure for all this political rancor won’t be disagreeing better. It will be a country where people aren’t allowed to disagree at all. And more violence will be assured.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Concerned over continually rising energy costs linked to AI datacenter construction projects, three Democratic Senators are asking leading bit barn operators to explain why their promises of not passing grid expansion costs onto consumers are falling short.

Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) sent letters to Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, CoreWeave, Digital Realty, and Equinix on Monday, demanding answers on their contributions to rising utility rates, which the lawmakers blame firmly on the explosion of datacenter construction projects.

Because the massive scale of AI datacenters requires more power than most grids can supply, the Senators explain in their letters, utility companies have to build out their grids to the tune of billions of dollars.

&quot;Tech companies have paid lip service in support of covering their data centers&#39; energy costs, but their actions have shown the opposite,&quot; the trio wrote.

They cite a number of studies and reports that conclude US electricity prices are most definitely rising, with much of the increase driven, unsurprisingly, by datacenters.

The electrical grid in many regions was not designed to accommodate the hundreds of megawatts, and in some cases approaching a gigawatt, that large modern datacenters are projected to draw, meaning utilities in areas targeted for new facilities often have to invest in new generation, transmission, and local grid upgrades.

&quot;When utilities expand their grid infrastructure, they incorporate the cost of expansion into their utility rates, passing the extra costs onto their customers,&quot; the Senators wrote.

According to the trio of lawmakers, and the research they cite in the letters, the promises from datacenter operators to offset rate increases caused by power infrastructure buildout continually fall flat.

One piece of research cited in the letters from Harvard Law School&#39;s Electricity Law Initiative found that, across 50 regulatory proceedings they reviewed about datacenter utility rates, technology companies continually find a way to avoid having to pay their share of infrastructure buildouts. Confidential contracts between datacenter operators and utility companies make it even harder to know how rate increases are being passed on to residential customers.

&quot;Contracts between data centers and utility companies that set electricity prices and other terms are typically confidential,&quot; the Senators wrote. &quot;Tech companies searching for a site for a new data center reportedly employ hard-nosed tactics to achieve lower rates … and then [pressure] utilities to give them favorable rates by suggesting they may build elsewhere instead.&quot;

Coincidentally or not, Amazon chose Tuesday to release the findings from a third-party report it commissioned, claiming that its datacenters not only don&#39;t increase electricity costs, but can even benefit ratepayers.

The study, performed by Energy and Environmental Economics (E3), largely couches its findings in terms of potentialities and projections rather than actual data, though.

&quot;E3 compared each facility&#39;s projected utility revenue to the estimated utility cost to serve the facility,&quot; E3 noted. &quot;E3 found that the data centers generate sufficient revenue to cover their costs and, in many instances, generated surplus revenue, providing a potential net benefit to other ratepayers.&quot;

With plenty of anecdotal evidence and documented rate increases contradicting Amazon&#39;s claims, however, it&#39;s hard to believe the company&#39;s proclamation that its datacenter projects are helping, instead of harming, consumers who are facing increasing energy bills that most are directly attributing to datacenter projects.

Per the Senators&#39; letters, driven by the combined energy demands of AI datacenters and cryptocurrency miners, US electricity costs are projected to rise 8 percent nationwide by 2030, and up to 25 percent in states like Virginia with a high concentration of bit barns. Some areas of &quot;significant datacenter activity&quot; have seen wholesale electricity prices rise by as much as 267 percent in the past five years.

The datacenter energy consumption boom isn&#39;t really up for debate at this point, though Amazon&#39;s statements make it seem as if they are. We reached out to the companies that received letters from the trio, but didn&#39;t immediately hear back from any. ®

            <h2>Nvidia fills the void of American open-weights models with some of its own</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-16</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For many, enterprise AI adoption depends on the availability of high-quality open-weights models. Exposing sensitive customer data or hard-fought intellectual property to APIs so you can use closed models like ChatGPT is a non-starter.

Outside of Chinese AI labs, the few open-weights models available today don&#39;t compare favorably to the proprietary models from the likes of OpenAI or Anthropic.

This isn&#39;t just a problem for enterprise adoption; it&#39;s a roadblock to Nvidia&#39;s agentic AI vision that the GPU giant is keen to clear. On Monday, the company added three new open-weights models of its own design to its arsenal.

Open-weights models are nothing new for Nvidia — most of the company&#39;s headcount is composed of software engineers. However, its latest generation of Nemotron LLMs is by far its most capable and open.

When they launch, the models will be available in three sizes, Nano, Super, and Ultra, which weigh in at about 30, 100, and 500 billion parameters, respectively.

In addition to the model weights, which will roll out on popular AI repos like Hugging Face over the next few months beginning with Nemotron 3 Nano this week, Nvidia has committed to releasing training data and the reinforcement learning environments used to create them, opening the door to highly customized versions of the models down the line.

The models also employ a novel &quot;hybrid latent MoE&quot; architecture designed to minimize performance losses when processing long input sequences, like ingesting large documents and processing queries against them.

This is possible using a combination of the Mamba-2 and Transformer architectures throughout the model&#39;s layers. Mamba-2 is generally more efficient than transformers when processing long sequences, which results in shorter prompt processing times and more consistent token generation rates.

Nvidia says that it&#39;s using transformer layers to maintain &quot;precise reasoning&quot; and prevent the model from losing context of the relevant information, a known challenge when ingesting long documents or keeping track of details over extended chat sessions.

Speaking of which, these models natively support a million token context window — the equivalent of roughly 3,000 double spaced pages of text.

All of these models employ a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture, which means only a fraction of the total parameter count is activated for each token processed and generated. This puts less pressure on the memory subsystem, resulting in faster throughput than an equivalent dense model on the same hardware.

For example, Nemotron 3 Nano has 30 billion parameters but only 3 billion are activated for each token generated.

While the nano model employs a pretty standard MoE architecture not unlike those seen in gpt-oss or Qwen3-30B-A3B, the larger Super and Ultra models were pretrained using Nvidia&#39;s NVFP4 data type and use a new latent MoE architecture.

As Nvidia explains it, using this approach, &quot;experts operate on a shared latent representation before outputs are projected back to token space. This approach allows the model to call on 4x more experts at the same inference cost, enabling better specialization around subtle semantic structures, domain abstractions, or multi-hop reasoning patterns.&quot;

Finally, these models have been engineered to use &quot;multi-token prediction,&quot; a spin on speculative decoding, which we&#39;ve explored in detail here, that can improve inference performance by up to 3x by predicting future tokens each time a new one is generated. Speculative decoding is particularly useful in agentic applications where large quantities of information are repeatedly processed and regenerated, like code assistants.

Nvidia&#39;s 30-billion-parameter Nemotron 3 Nano is available this week, and is designed to run efficiently on enterprise hardware like the vendor&#39;s L40S or RTX Pro 6000 Server Edition. However, using 4-bit quantized versions of the model, it should be possible to cram it into GPUs with as little as 24GB of video memory.

According to Artificial Analysis, the model delivers performance on par with models like gpt-oss-20B or Qwen3 VL 32B and 30B-A3B, while offering enterprises far greater flexibility for customization.

One of the go-to methods for model customization is reinforcement learning (RL), which enables users to teach the model new information or approaches through trial and error, where desirable outcomes are rewarded while undesirable ones are punished. Alongside the new models, Nvidia is releasing RL-datasets and training environments, which it calls NeMo Gym, to help enterprises fine-tune the models for their specific application or agentic workflows.

Nemotron 3 Super and Ultra are expected to make their debut in the first half of next year. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A new, modular infostealer called SantaStealer, advertised on Telegram with a basic tier priced at $175 per month, promises to make criminals&#39; Christmas dreams come true. It boasts that it can run &quot;fully undetected&quot; even on systems with the &quot;strictest AntiVirus&quot; and those belonging to governments, financial institutions, and other prime targets.

Its Russian-speaking operators released the credential- and wallet-stealing malware on Monday, and while infostealers are never welcome news, it does come with a gift to defenders: the samples seen to date are &quot;far from undetectable&quot; and very easy to analyze.

This is according to Rapid7 security researcher Milan Špinka, who posted a blog about the stealer shortly before the malware developers released their shiny new tool.

&quot;It&#39;s difficult to tell if the samples we observe now are the latest builds of SantaStealer, or if there might be a delay and we are only now seeing earlier versions,&quot; Špinka told The Register. &quot;Either way, the payloads we analyzed lacked significantly in anti-analysis and evasion capabilities, only implementing a very basic anti-VM/anti-debugging check.&quot;

He added that the samples analyzed by the malware-hunting team &quot;include original names of functions and global variables and do not perform any kind of string encryption or code obfuscation, making analysis rather simple.&quot;

Still, it is an infostealer, and this type of malware is a favorite of ransomware gangs and other financially motivated criminals to gain initial access to victims&#39; IT systems. So it&#39;s not something that you want to inadvertently download and run on your computer, thus giving attackers your stored usernames and passwords for sensitive accounts and corporate networks.

We recommend avoiding unrecognized links and email attachments as well as watching out for fake human verification or tech support instructions to run commands on your computer

&quot;SantaStealer goes after sensitive documents, credentials, and crypto wallets,&quot; Špinka said. &quot;We recommend avoiding unrecognized links and email attachments as well as watching out for fake human verification or tech support instructions to run commands on your computer.&quot;

The Rapid7 team first spotted SantaStealer earlier this month and analyzed unobfuscated and unstripped samples. The malware, a 64-bit DLL, contained more than 500 exported symbols with self-explanatory names such as &quot;payload_main,&quot; &quot;check_antivm,&quot; &quot;browser_names,&quot; &quot;notes_config_size,&quot; and &quot;notes_config_data,&quot; plus &quot;a plethora&quot; of unencrypted strings indicating credential-stealing capabilities.

One of these strings contained a link to the SantaStealer Telegram channel, which announced it as a rebranding of an earlier stealer called Blueline Stealer, operated by a pair of anonymous developers with the Telegram handles @weuploaddata (display name &quot;Cracked&quot;) and @furixlol (display name &quot;Furix&quot;).

&quot;It is unclear why they decided to rename the stealer pre-launch; however, it could be part of the rebrand effort as a means of drawing attention through a catchy name,&quot; Špinka told The Register. &quot;We can trace the activities of Blueline Stealer back to July 2025 when the developers were sharing proof of logs in their dedicated Telegram channel for this.&quot;

The developers for Blueline Stealer are an actor with the handle &quot;Cracked&quot; and a partner with the handle &quot;Furix.&quot;

From the Telegram channel, the researchers found the affiliate web panel with pricing info: the basic variant costs $175 per month, while the premium variant carries a $300 monthly charge.

In addition to Telegram, the developers also advertise SantaStealer on a Russian-speaking hacker forum, Lolz.

&quot;The use of this Russian-speaking forum, the top-level domain name of the web panel bearing the country code of the Soviet Union (su), and the ability to configure the stealer not to target Russian-speaking victims (described later) hints at Russian citizenship of the operators — not at all unusual on the infostealer market,&quot; Špinka wrote in the blog.

Based on the samples analyzed, the stealer appears to be moving toward a fileless collection, with the modules and the Chrome decryptor DLL being loaded and executed in-memory. This helps the malware avoid file-based detection.

After stealing users&#39; data, the malware compresses it and splits it into 10 MB chunks before sending it to a command-and-control server over unencrypted HTTP.

In addition to the technical analysis, Rapid7&#39;s write-up includes a list of indicators of compromise, so be sure to check those out and, as Špinka urges heading into the holidays: &quot;stay safe and off the naughty list!&quot; ®

Hollyland, a company best known for affordable wireless microphones that are popular with creators, has announced its first webcam, the small 4K Lyra. While it lacks advanced features like the Insta360 Link’s tracking gimbal, it’s one of the first webcams we’ve seen that’s designed to improve how you sound by connecting directly to one of Hollyland’s wireless lav mics.

The Lyra features a built-in receiver for Hollyland’s Lark A1 wireless microphone that includes AI-powered noise reduction. It’s not as small as the Lark M2S microphone the company announced earlier this year, but it will definitely be an upgrade over the mic built into your laptop. The A1 is also cheap. You can find it on Amazon with a smartphone receiver for $29.90, or get one even cheaper, bundled with the new Lyra. The webcam on its own is now available through Hollyland’s website for $149, but for an extra $10, the company will include a single Lark A1 mic.

Inside the Lyra, you’ll also find a 1/1.5-inch sensor paired with an f/1.8 lens that Hollyland says “captures vivid color and exceptional clarity even in dimly lit environments.” Video quality maxes out at 4K/30fps, but that can be boosted to 60fps if you drop the resolution to 1080p.

There’s a collection of AI-powered features to further improve image quality, including automatic brightness, contrast, and exposure adjustments based on the environment where you’re recording, and a “beauty mode” to further enhance your appearance.

There’s a proprietary algorithm for removing and replacing green screens, so you don’t need additional software, and while the camera can’t move while perched atop your screen using a magnetic clip-on mount, it can track people in frame and adjust the framing to always keep them centered. When you’re done with a call or a livestream and want to ensure that Lyra isn’t still watching you, there’s also a physical rotating lens cover for privacy, so you can save your sticky notes for keeping track of passwords.

If you’re shopping for a book lover, it’s hard to beat a Kindle, especially if your giftee already owns a library of Kindle books. Amazon’s latest sale makes them even easier to recommend: the last-gen Kindle Scribe with 32GB of storage and ads is matching its best price to date starting at $279.99 ($140 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. Meanwhile, the ad-supported versions of the Kindle (Amazon, Best Buy, and Target), Kindle Paperwhite (Amazon, Best Buy, Target), and Kindle Colorsoft (Amazon, Best Buy, Target) are all near record-low prices, starting at $89.99 ($20 off), $134.99 ($25 off), and $189.99 ($60 off) respectively.

If you’re looking to gift a note-taking e-reader, the last-gen Kindle Scribe remains a terrific option, even without the new Scribe Colorsoft’s color E Ink display. It offers a sharp, spacious 10.2-inch, 300ppi display and — unusual for a note-taking e-reader — an adjustable warm light for comfortable nighttime reading. You can jot down notes directly on Kindle books using the included stylus, which conveniently features an eraser and a customizable shortcut button. Plus, the Scribe doubles as a standalone digital notebook, with premade templates and AI-powered tools that can summarize your notes or clean up messy handwriting.

Amazon’s other Kindles are also solid gifts, particularly if you prioritize price or portability. While they don’t offer note-taking capabilities like the Scribe, they’re amongst the best e-readers on the market, delivering an excellent reading experience thanks to their sharp 300ppi displays. Each weighs about the same as an iPhone 17 Pro Max, making it easy to slip into a bag; the entry-level Kindle’s small six-inch design is even pocketable. All offer long battery life with convenient USB-C charging, while the Colorsoft stands out by adding a 150ppi color mode that’s especially appealing for fans of graphic novels. And, with the exception of the Kindle, they’re all IPX8-rated for water resistance, so you don’t need to worry about winter storms or spills.

The 2024 Kindle Scribe is a 10.2-inch e-reader with a stylus for taking notes. It’s faster than its predecessor and offers a host of new features, including one that lets you jot notes directly in your book. Read our review.

Amazon’s latest Kindle Paperwhite — aka our favorite ebook reader — is waterproof, has a seven-inch display, and lasts weeks per charge. Read our review.

Amazon’s latest entry-level Kindle retains a six-inch, 300ppi display and USB-C charger. It’s brighter and slightly faster than its predecessor, though, and features longer battery life.

The 16GB Kindle Colorsoft is Amazon’s latest color e-reader. It features a 7-inch 300ppi screen, an adjustable frontlight, and a battery that can last up to eight weeks.

            <div id="article-text">A plan so astonishingly dumb, even Warner Bros. doesn’t believe it’ll happen.

A plan so astonishingly dumb, even Warner Bros. doesn’t believe it’ll happen.

Media is a business about dreams, and Larry Ellison’s son is dreaming big. This might explain why the case for Paramount Skydance to buy Warner Bros. Discovery is so incoherent.

In October, Warner Bros. put itself up for sale, leading to a number of bids. The two we are concerned with are a bid from Netflix and another from two nepo babies: David Ellison and Jared Kushner. David Ellison is the head of Paramount, but most famous for being Larry’s son. Jared Kushner is most famous for being Donald Trump’s son-in-law, though he also got his start in business by taking over his felon father’s firm when Charles was in prison; his firm is involved in the financing.

Netflix won the bidding. Warner Bros. made an agreement to sell most of its business — the studio part — to the streaming giant for $83 billion, including debt. (That figure is a bit more than five times Paramount’s market cap.) Warner Bros. felt that spinning itself into two companies, the Netflix acquisition and the cable networks, gave shareholders a value of $31 to $32 a share, rather than the $30 a share Paramount was offering, according to The Wall Street Journal.

If the elder Ellison is serious about this, I’d like some of what he’s smoking

Nonetheless, Paramount announced a hostile bid to take over Warner Bros. for $30 per share, which puts the total at $108.4 billion, including debt. Apparently, Paramount has been after Warner Bros. for the last two years, even before Ellison père et fils entered the picture. But now, it’s backstopped the deal with the Ellison family trust, which includes a war chest of about 1.16 billion Oracle shares. The current offer from Paramount is not the “best and final” — at least, according to The New York Times — so this dumb fight is likely to drag on for a while.

Let’s pause here and notice that what Paramount is doing doesn’t make any fucking sense. At least, not business sense. Maybe I can see a case for consolidation among the streamers, rolling HBO Max into Paramount Plus, and acquiring a larger library. But HBO Max isn’t that big, and its library isn’t exclusive. So why would Larry Ellison trade Oracle stock (with, at maximum, AI-rules-the-world multiples) for garbage media multiples? If the elder Ellison is serious about this, I’d like some of what he’s smoking.

Warner Bros., in fact, also appears concerned about how serious Ellison senior is. Part of the reason Warner Bros. went with the Netflix bid was that its board was “worried that Mr. [Larry] Ellison did not personally guarantee the bid under his name and is planning to contribute equity for the deal through a trust with holdings that could be modified at any time,” wrote The New York Times. Yeah, I’d worry about that shit too!

And there are signs Larry Ellison doesn’t see his son’s vision as a sure thing, since he’s not the sole bankroll involved. The deal relies on third parties’ money, which includes $24 billion from three Middle Eastern funds. That’s in addition, of course, to Kushner’s Affinity Partners and Apollo Global Management, both of which manage significant money from other Middle Eastern investors. Larry Ellison’s trust, which he can change at any time, is only a backstop on this financing.

Still, Larry Ellison has called the White House to whine about antitrust concerns in the Netflix/Warner Bros. deal, which is not nothing.

At this point, you may be wondering what David Ellison’s case is for combining Paramount and Warner Bros. Here’s what he has to say: “Unless you can build a tech product that is truly competitive with what’s coming out of Silicon Valley, you can’t compete,” David Ellison said, according to The Hollywood Reporter. “And that has been one of the big problems that’s been facing legacy media, is they don’t actually understand that skill set and how critical that is, and that it is actually a combination of great content working with tech product hand in hand, that is how you actually get this business growing and scaling again, and you need both.”

First, David Ellison wants the Netflix multiple on his company. Second, he doesn’t understand how anything works.

This is vacuous nonsense. In an open letter about his company Skydance’s acquisition of Paramount, David Ellison pitched a plan to combine Pluto TV with Paramount Plus — wowee zowie, combining streaming platforms! There’s also some manner of plan to use AI slop to “supercharge” the company’s intellectual property and “content.” (Hear that, directors? You don’t make TV shows or movies. You make slop for the slop machine.) And improving recommendations will probably mean attempting to use the TikTok algorithm, since Daddy is involved — at least, if the TikTok deal ever goes through. So that’s the Paramount pitch. It is also, most likely, the Warner Bros. pitch.

David Ellison’s plan for Paramount, insofar as it is one, reveals two things. First, David Ellison wants the Netflix multiple on his company. Second, he doesn’t understand how anything works.

If I wanted to turn Paramount into a tech company, I might try linking product placement in Paramount’s existing library to actual shopping, for a modest fee to the brand, and perhaps a cut of any sales made. Or figure out how to make streaming faster and more reliable, or come up with new methods of compression to make delivery less costly. Perhaps I’d move into streaming video games, unlocking a huge market for my platform — which for the record is exactly what Netflix is doing right now. To do all — or any! — of that, I’d probably make a big impressive tech hire.

Instead, Ellison’s flashy hire is fellow know-nothing Bari Weiss. Weiss is the head of CBS News, who for some reason is appearing on television to record flop interviews instead of doing her actual job, which is running a news organization. Hey, did you hear that David Ellison has been promising the White House it’ll do to CNN what it did to CBS News? It’s very funny that he is offering to pay a premium to drive the TV business into the ground faster, don’t you think?

Without any actual ideas, no Netflix multiple is going to be forthcoming on the Paramount stock

I guess we could get caught up in the culture war argument: both Ellisons simply buy into Trump’s desire to destroy the supposed left-wing bastion of TV news. (The revanchist right has been particularly infuriated by their inability to dominate cultural products as they dominate politics.) But as a business decision, it is so stupid. Broadcast TV has been declining in importance for some time now. As of October, streaming has taken over nearly half of monthly TV viewing. In the streaming wars, there are only really two important platforms: Netflix and YouTube. Those two streamers combined account for a bit over 20 percent of the entire TV audience; broadcast TV as a whole accounts for 23 percent. Paramount Plus and Pluto TV together account for about 2 percent of the market.

Netflix, as a streaming platform, is stealing viewers from cable and broadcast television. David Ellison’s big idea to compete is combining streaming platforms and making vague noises about AI — and, I guess, TV? Without any actual ideas, no Netflix multiple is going to be forthcoming on the Paramount stock.

Now let’s consider Netflix, which actually is a tech company. Making a direct comparison of the deals is slightly complicated by the fact that Paramount wants the whole of Warner Bros. and Netflix wants to spin off the declining cable holdings, which include CNN. This is probably smart! What Netflix gets in the deal is a huge movie library it doesn’t have to negotiate rights for — and which it might be able to generate royalties from, should it choose to continue licensing to rivals. Historically, though, Netflix doesn’t do that, which may mean it’ll give consumers a fairly powerful reason to switch streaming services.

By comparison, it’s just not clear what the Ellisons think they’re doing. Sure, combining with HBO Max and forming one streaming service might be helpful, but that takes Paramount Plus from 2 percent of the market to 3.5 percent of the market. Paramount could similarly make a bunch of Hollywood history exclusive to its streaming service, but so what? It’s already got movies and TV shows and the means to make more. Is David Ellison really just trying to buy his way to importance?

We’ve got a real-life Kendall Roy on our hands

One more thing about Netflix. It has two CEOs: Ted Sarandos, who is Mr. Hollywood, and Greg Peters, who explicitly handles tech. David Ellison has the experience and talents of neither. Before founding Skydance, Ellison personally paid for a third of the $60 million budget for the bomb Flyboys, which costarred Ellison and James Franco. The movie made $18 million. Next, he founded Skydance, and his dad put in $150 million of the initial $350 million the company raised to finance movies with Paramount. Skydance’s trajectory has been uneven, with hits such as True Grit and stinkers such as Terminator: Dark Fate. Ellison quit acting in 2010, when Taylor Lautner backed out of a movie Ellison had written after finding out that Ellison also planned to costar.

So David Ellison took his imagination elsewhere. It seems his new vision is to become a mogul on par with Sumner Redstone, Barry Diller, or Rupert Murdoch; we’ve got a real-life Kendall Roy on our hands. The question now is how committed Larry Ellison is to buying that dream for his son. Sure, he was involved in the early negotiations for Warner Bros.. Yes, he phoned the White House to try to scupper the Netflix deal. But neither of those are nearly as serious as Oracle shares. Acquiring Warner Bros. doesn’t do what’s needed to pivot Paramount into a tech company, either. So, much like Warner Bros.’ board, I don’t believe that Larry Ellison is going to trade Oracle shares for a media company. It just doesn’t make sense.

Under what circumstances would Larry Ellison decide to do it anyway? There are two things I can think of. Both of them have to do with Oracle, which has pivoted toward an enormous AI bet, taking on a tremendous debt load in the process. The company is spending a frankly shocking amount to build out data centers, based on revenue it expects from OpenAI — which may not be able to meet its obligations.

We are in the era of gangster tech regulation. Buying up the parent company of CNN, which President Donald Trump famously loathes, and reworking it to flatter him could maybe get Larry Ellison the political capital he’d need to get bailed out if OpenAI fails on its obligations. It might also get him the first line on federal contracts. Who can say? For our TV-addled president, maybe owning a couple channels is the most effective form of lobbying there is. But if this is true, Paramount’s bid for Warner Bros. isn’t about making a media company into a tech company — it’s about figuring out another way to butter up an astonishingly corrupt administration. It’s also a pretty risky gamble that no one who opposes Trump will come into power any time soon.

The second possibility is that Larry Ellison has already recognized AI isn’t going to live up to its hype. If that is the case, he might as well spend money while he has it. Maybe buying his son’s love is worth it. After all, Larry Ellison is already the most important shareholder of Paramount. Why not expand the playhouse a little?

Correction: The Netflix bid is worth $31 to 32 per share, not $31 to $31.

            <h2>Creating psychological safety in the AI era</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/16/1125899/creating-psychological-safety-in-the-ai-era/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Rolling out enterprise-grade AI means climbing two steep cliffs at once. First, understanding and implementing the tech itself. And second, creating the cultural conditions where employees can maximize its value. While the technical hurdles are signiﬁcant, the human element can be even more consequential; fear and ambiguity can stall momentum of even the most promising initiatives.

Psychological safety—feeling free to express opinions and take calculated risks without worrying about career repercussions1—is essential for successful AI adoption. In psychologically safe workspaces, employees are empowered to challenge assumptions and raise concerns about new tools without fear of reprisal. This is nothing short of a necessity when introducing a nascent and profoundly powerful technology that still lacks established best practices.

“Psychological safety is mandatory in this new era of AI,” says Rafee Tarafdar, executive vice president and chief technology officer at Infosys. “The tech itself is evolving so fast—companies have to experiment, and some things will fail. There needs to be a safety net.”

To gauge how psychological safety influences success with enterprise-level AI, MIT Technology Review Insights conducted a survey of 500 business leaders. The ﬁndings reveal high self-reported levels of psychological safety, but also suggest that fear still has a foothold. Anecdotally, industry experts highlight a reason for the disconnect between rhetoric and reality: while organizations may promote a safe to experiment message publicly, deeper cultural undercurrents can counteract that intent.

Building psychological safety requires a coordinated, systems-level approach, and human resources (HR) alone cannot deliver such transformation. Instead, enterprises must deeply embed psychological safety into their collaboration processes.

AI tools that may have been used were limited to secondary production processes that passed thorough human review.

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you’ll see it’s a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

A conversation with a chatbot can shift people&#39;s political views—but the most persuasive models also spread the most misinformation.

            <div id="article-text">This is today&#39;s edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what&#39;s going on in the world of technology.

Some disillusionment was inevitable. When OpenAI released a free web app called ChatGPT in late 2022, it changed the course of an entire industry—and several world economies. Millions of people started talking to their computers, and their computers started talking back. We were enchanted, and we expected more.Well, 2025 has been a year of reckoning. For a start, the heads of the top AI companies made promises they couldn’t keep. At the same time, updates to the core technology are no longer the step changes they once were.To be clear, the last few years have been filled with genuine “Wow” moments. But this remarkable technology is only a few years old, and in many ways it is still experimental. Its successes come with big caveats. Read the full story to learn more about why we may need to readjust our expectations.

This story is part of our new Hype Correction package, a collection of stories designed to help you reset your expectations about what AI makes possible—and what it doesn’t.

Quantum navigation could solve the military’s GPS jamming problem

Since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thousands of flights have been affected by a far-reaching Russian campaign of using radio transmissions that jammed its GPS system.The growing inconvenience to air traffic and risk of a real disaster have highlighted the vulnerability of GPS and focused attention on more secure ways for planes to navigate the gauntlet of jamming and spoofing, the term for tricking a GPS receiver into thinking it’s somewhere else.One approach that’s emerging from labs is quantum navigation: exploiting the quantum nature of light and atoms to build ultra-sensitive sensors that can allow vehicles to navigate independently, without depending on satellites.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Can I ask you a question: How do you feel about AI right now? Are you still excited? When you hear that OpenAI or Google just dropped a new model, do you still get that buzz? Or has the shine come off it, maybe just a teeny bit? Come on, you can be honest with me.

Truly, I feel kind of stupid even asking the question, like a spoiled brat who has too many toys at Christmas. AI is mind-blowing. It’s one of the most important technologies to have emerged in decades (despite all its many many drawbacks and flaws and, well, issues).

At the same time I can&#39;t help feeling a little bit: Is that it?

If you feel the same way, there’s good reason for it: The hype we have been sold for the past few years has been overwhelming. We were told that AI would solve climate change. That it would reach human-level intelligence. That it would mean we no longer had to work!

Instead we got AI slop, chatbot psychosis, and tools that urgently prompt you to write better email newsletters. Maybe we got what we deserved. Or maybe we need to reevaluate what AI is for.

That’s the reality at the heart of a new series of stories, published today, called Hype Correction. We accept that AI is still the hottest ticket in town, but it’s time to re-set our expectations.

As my colleague Will Douglas Heaven puts it in the package’s intro essay, “You can’t help but wonder: When the wow factor is gone, what’s left? How will we view this technology a year or five from now? Will we think it was worth the colossal costs, both financial and environmental?”

Elsewhere in the package, James O’Donnell looks at Sam Altman, the ultimate AI hype man, through the medium of his own words. And Alex Heath explains the AI bubble, laying out for us what it all means and what we should look out for.

Michelle Kim analyzes one of the biggest claims in the AI hype cycle: that AI would completely eliminate the need for certain classes of jobs. If ChatGPT can pass the bar, surely that means it will replace lawyers? Well, not yet, and maybe not ever.

Similarly, Edd Gent tackles the big question around AI coding. Is it as good as it sounds? Turns out the jury is still out. And elsewhere David Rotman looks at the real-world work that needs to be done before AI materials discovery has its breakthrough ChatGPT moment.

Meanwhile, Garrison Lovely spends time with some of the biggest names in the AI safety world and asks: Are the doomers still okay? I mean, now that people are feeling a bit less scared about their impending demise at the hands of superintelligent AI? And Margaret Mitchell reminds us that hype around generative AI can blind us to the AI breakthroughs we should really celebrate.

Let’s remember: AI was here before ChatGPT and it will be here after. This hype cycle has been wild, and we don’t know what its lasting impact will be. But AI isn’t going anywhere. We shouldn&#39;t be so surprised that those dreams we were sold haven’t come true—yet.

The more likely story is that the real winners, the killer apps, are still to come. And a lot of money is being bet on that prospect. So yes: The hype could never sustain itself over the short term. Where we’re at now is maybe the start of a post-hype phase. In an ideal world, this hype correction will reset expectations.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.

            <div id="article-text">This article was published on September 29, 2025

A few decades ago, when I was raising funding for a startup, I made a lasting impression on an investor by not only talking about how successful we would be, but also highlighting what would happen if we weren’t. Later, in an informal setting, I asked him what had persuaded him to invest in us. He told me that during the pitch, I had said, “And if all our predictions and expectations are wrong, we will use the last of our funding for a magnificent farewell dinner for all our investors. You’ll have lost your money, but at least you’ll get a great evening for it in return.”

I don’t recall this being part of the original pitch or my strategy. I probably just blurted it out to break the ice, but it impressed the investor. He told me it was refreshing to speak to an entrepreneur who was not blinded by his own pitch. The fact that I had a scenario ready for both success and failure told him that I was honest and realistic.

Now, the startup was not successful, but we still had a nice, opulent dinner with the investors at the end — and we did them one better. As soon as we realised that our predictions and expectations were wrong, we made our investors an offer: we could struggle and pivot and hope for a miracle, or we could return what was left of our funding to our investors. We preferred option two, and so did they, so everybody got some money back (about 40% of what they had invested), as well as a lovely evening with excellent food and drinks. When we raised money for another startup a few years later, almost all of them signed up in our first round.

Obviously, I would have preferred to have made this startup a success instead, but I still regard it as a successful endeavour. I gave it a try and had a plan ready for when my experiment didn’t work out, and in the process, I built relationships that outlasted that one startup.

As you may have read, The Next Web, the company I founded in 2006, is nearing the end of its lifecycle. The events and media business is being wound down, and only TNW Spaces will live on. TNW Programs was sold off a while ago and will continue as well. There won’t be another TNW Conference, and soon there won’t be new articles on the site; people are losing their jobs, including me. It’s a painful process, but I guess I’m taking it well because it also feels natural and logical. When we sold TNW to the FT in 2019, we were very ambitious and optimistic, and surely I would’ve liked for the company and brand to outlive me. However, when the business struggled, I also felt very comfortable with the company ending graciously.

When you’re reading a good book, there’s a moment near the end when you’ll start reading slower because you don’t want it to end. I love those moments, because I’ll know it’s been a good experience. But then you also know that good stories need good endings. So, this is the ending of a great story that I’ve enjoyed participating in.

I’ll keep writing, but this will be my last official TNW story. I’d love it if you would subscribe to my writing over at Substack. It will be less tech-focused, more unpredictable, but just as insightful as before.
