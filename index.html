            <h2>Hands off! An on-the-road demo of Mercedes’ advanced new driver assist</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/mercedes-teaches-its-driver-assist-how-to-handle-surface-streets/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There’s some debate as to when adaptive cruise control first showed up, but if you ask Mercedes-Benz, it will say in 1999 with that year’s S-Class. Instead of just keeping a set speed, radar-enabled adaptive cruise control allowed the car to react to deceleration by the car ahead, and thus was created the first partially automated car. From there, automakers added a function to keep cars in their lanes, and now we have location-aware, GPS-geofenced vehicles that, as long as the driver is paying attention, will do most of the driving—on the highway at least.

But the goal for developers of both autonomous and partially automated vehicles is to remove as much of the burden of driving from the human as possible, not just on controlled access highways but at lower speeds, on surface streets. Which is what Mercedes’ latest Drive Assist Pro has been designed to do. And after a recent demo—albeit from the passenger seat—on the streets of downtown San Francisco, it appears to be a very credible effort.

The big, powerful, comfortable S-Class is normally the standard-bearer for the latest and greatest tech Mercedes has cooked up, but not always. In December we drove the production version of its new entry-level EV, the CLA. At under $50,000, the sleek Mercedes sedan (or four-door coupé) is already available with the current version of the automaker’s Drive Assist suite, with better control of braking and deceleration. A particular improvement, which I’m not sure made the final version of our first drive report, is the way you can use the brake while adaptive cruise control is active without canceling the system.

Light applications of the brake—to shed a few miles per hour, not to conduct an emergency stop—will slow the car, which then resumes its original speed, much the same way you have always been able to apply the throttle to temporarily speed up while using cruise control.

Drive Assist Pro takes this collaborative approach between the car and driver and runs with it. Given a destination to work with, it knows which lanes you’ll need ahead of time, and the car reads both stop signs but also traffic lights. It even detects, and slows down for, speed bumps. On a 20 minute drive around the Waymo-clogged streets of the tech industry’s favorite city, the engineer in the driving seat didn’t have to intervene once, although I believe at least a couple of colleagues’ demos got confused by human crosswalk attendants moving around with their stop signs.

The CLA drove at safe and legal speeds, knew how to handle construction zones, and wasn’t flummoxed by one of those most common of city driving annoyances, the double-parked car. The time the car takes to come to a complete stop at stop signs can and will irritate human drivers behind you; it’s definitely not a California stop.

All of this is possible thanks to the CLA being what the industry calls a software-defined vehicle. Four powerful computers run all the electronics, rather than dozens and dozens of discrete black boxes. One of those computers is (of course) from Nvidia—that company’s Orin, which handles things like perception and path planning.

“We completely elevated our autonomous driving stack. It is no longer on a rule-based stack,” explained Magnus Östberg, chief software officer at Mercedes-Benz. Now it uses an end-to-end AI model, “which of course is giving you some basic advantages. When it comes to parking, for example, [it offers] much faster navigation of parking lots…, moving in and out of the parking lots, but also already you find… how it’s on the highway and how it actually follows the lane and moving across it,” Östberg said.

As seamless as the experience appeared, the human behind the wheel remains the one in charge. I don’t love the SAE levels as a scheme for explaining the spectrum of partially automated and autonomous driving these days, but Drive Assist Pro is what an engineer might call “level 2 ++,” if “level 2+” is something tightly geofenced like Super Cruise and true level 3 is Mercedes Drive Pilot, which is only available in Nevada and California and only works in relatively low-speed freeway traffic jams.

The closest thing might be Tesla’s much-maligned driver assist, which has long had the goal of letting its users go from point to point with no human intervention. I shan’t dwell on that company’s record of either safety or success (although apparently, many years after Musk first promised a coast-to-coast drive, someone actually finally pulled it off in late 2025). Needless to say, Mercedes-Benz has a very different approach to safety. There are redundant sensor modalities, not just a smattering of cameras. The end-to-end AI model tokenizes input and output trajectories, and there’s a safety guardrail with a rules-based model to make sure any AI trajectory mistake is caught before it’s driven. There’s certainly no “mad max” setting to make it break speed limits, unlike those camera-only Teslas.

Mercedes has already launched Drive Assist Pro in China and told Ars the safety certification process is complete for the US, with it arriving late this year in the CLA and then other Mercedes vehicles as they get their SDV upgrades during midlife refreshes. As for Europe, that will require some regulation changes, we believe.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Which US rocket companies achieved the most during 2025?

Once again, Ars Technica is here to provide some answers in the form of our annual power ranking of US launch companies. We began doing this in 2022 and have since put out a top-10 list every year (see 2023 and 2024). Our intent, as always, is to spark debate, discussion, and appreciation for the challenge of operating a successful rocket company. It’s a demanding business, both technically and financially. We respect the grit and hustle because we know just how hard this stuff is.

Please also note that this is a subjective list, although hard metrics such as total launches, tonnage to orbit, success rate, and more were all important factors in the decision. And finally, our focus remains on what each company accomplished in 2025, not on what they might do in the future.

It was not difficult to select the first-place company on this list. As it has every year in our rankings, SpaceX holds the top spot. As of the first week of December, SpaceX has launched 165 rockets in 2025, the vast majority of which were used Falcon 9 boosters. The company has put more than 1 million kg of cargo into orbit and remains NASA’s essential contractor for keeping the International Space Station operating with a steady rotation of crew and consumables.

Regarding the larger Starship vehicle, this was a frustrating year for SpaceX. The first three launches of the massive rocket (in January, March, and May) resulted in a failure of the Starship upper stage. The last two flights of the year (in August and October) were much more successful, setting the stage for the company to move to its Block 3 version of the vehicle. However, the first of these Block 3 Super Heavy boosters failed catastrophically during pressure testing.

This is the biggest mover on the list, leaping from No. 4 on the list to No. 2, and this is, of course, because Jeff Bezos’ company sent Katy Perry into space. (They could have achieved No. 1 had they not brought her back). In all seriousness, this was a breakthrough year for Blue Origin, finally shaking the notion that it was a company full of promise that could not quite deliver.

The company delivered big time in 2025. On the very first launch of the massive New Glenn rocket in January, Blue Origin successfully sent a test payload into orbit. Although a landing attempt failed after New Glenn’s engines failed to re-light, it was a remarkable success. Then, in November, New Glenn sent a pair of small spacecraft on their way to Mars. This successful launch was followed by a breathtaking and inspiring landing of the rocket’s first stage on a barge. I certainly did not think they would nail the landing on just the second launch, and it is to their immense credit that Blue Origin pulled this off.

Additionally, Blue Origin’s much smaller New Shepard rocket launched a record number of times, eight, this year. The company also neared completion of its first lunar lander, Blue Moon Mk 1. And it started producing BE-4 rocket engines by the dozen, so many in fact that United Launch Alliance chief Tory Bruno stopped complaining about having enough.

Rocket Lab had an excellent year, garnering its highest total of Electron launches (18 as of early December) and having complete mission success. Rocket Lab has now gone nearly three dozen launches without a failure. The company also continued to make progress on its medium-lift Neutron vehicle, although its debut was ultimately delayed to mid-2026, at least.

Additionally, Rocket Lab continued its ascendance as a spacecraft company. It played a key role in supporting Firefly’s Blue Ghost lander at the beginning of this year, and in November, its two ESCAPADE vehicles were safely switched on after launch, beginning their journey to Mars.

As it has grown, Rocket Lab’s ability to execute has remained excellent.

It was supposed to be a breakthrough year for ULA, having finally gotten the Vulcan rocket flying and moving into an operational cadence. Alas, that did not happen.

In late 2024, the company’s CEO, Tory Bruno, told reporters that ULA aimed to launch as many as 20 missions in 2025, with roughly an even split between the legacy Atlas V launcher and Vulcan. Now, it’s likely that ULA will close out 2025 with six flights—five with the Atlas V and just one with the Vulcan rocket that the company is so eager to accelerate into service.

The Vulcan rocket’s sole launch this year occurred on August 12, when it took off on a mission sponsored by the US Space Force. In an article in November, Ars speculated that Vulcan flew just once in 2025 due to an ongoing investigation of the vehicle’s solid rocket boosters.

To top it all off, at the end of December, Blue Origin swooped in to hire Bruno away to run its new national security division. That is, ULA’s leader is leaving a company that largely subsists on national defense launch contracts to go be a national defense contract rainmaker at its direct competitor. From which ULA buys its rocket engines.

Only one other US company had a successful orbital launch in 2025, and it was Northrop Grumman. In April, the company’s Minotaur IV rocket carried a payload into orbit for the National Reconnaissance Office.

The company also debuted its new, larger Cygnus XL spacecraft this year. However, the vehicle had some issues with its engine burns, delaying its arrival at the International Space Station. As Northrop’s new Antares 330 rocket is still in development, the Cygnus vehicle is flying on SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket. One of the interesting things to track next year is whether the Northrop-Firefly collaboration can succeed in getting the Antares 330 flying any time soon. Northrop is contracted for just one more Falcon 9 launch at present for Cygnus.

As part of its launch program, Northrop also provides solid rocket boosters for ULA’s Vulcan rocket and NASA’s Space Launch System vehicle.

The year 2025 started out with a bang—a good one—for Firefly. In January, the company’s Blue Ghost lander launched on a Falcon 9 rocket and subsequently landed on the Moon. This was an extremely impressive achievement, as Firefly became the first private company to complete a fully successful soft landing on the Moon.

Unfortunately, it was a far less successful year in launch. The company launched its Alpha rocket just a single time in 2025, in April, carrying an experimental satellite for Lockheed Martin. However, a problem occurred during stage separation, damaging the rocket’s upper stage engine and preventing the payload from reaching orbit.

Then, in September, as Firefly was working toward a second Alpha launch in 2025, the rocket was destroyed on the company’s vertical test stand in Texas. Imagery posted on social media platforms showed a fireball engulfing the test stand and a column of black smoke rising into the sky over Firefly’s facility roughly 40 miles north of Austin. So 2025 also ended with a bang, albeit a bad one.

Stoke Space has yet to launch a rocket, but it continues to make progress toward that goal. When Ars visited the company’s launch site in November, we found all of the elements for the Nova rocket’s ground systems in place, with finishing work being done. The company is working toward the debut of Nova in 2026, but as with all new rockets, caution should abound when it comes to launch dates.

What sets Stoke apart from some of its other similarly unproven competitors is the level of its fundraising. In October, Stoke announced a massive $510 million Series D funding round. That was a lot of money in a challenging time to raise launch firm funding and meant the company has a deep war chest in order to survive the challenging final months of developing a new launch vehicle. It also means that investors, with a peek behind the curtain, find Stoke to be highly credible.

A year ago, Relativity Space looked to be fading into bankruptcy. However, in the spring of this year, former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt stepped in to provide funding critical to keeping the California-based launch company solvent. He is now effectively the company’s owner and chief executive.

Thanks to hundreds of millions of dollars from Schmidt, as well as his efforts to privately raise additional capital, Relativity is back on solid footing and is pressing ahead with development of the Terran R rocket. This will be a beast of a launch vehicle if and when it reaches the pad and takes flight. The question is, how far along is Terran R really? Aside from slickly produced monthly updates, the company has been doing little public outreach under Schmidt. I’d be surprised to see Terran R take flight in 2026, but it sure would be cool if it did.

What’s going on at Astra, which last year was resurrected from a near-death experience? We can’t be quite sure, but the company has continued development of its Rocket 4 vehicle this year, which is intended to have a payload capacity of 600 kg to low-Earth orbit.

We know that work is ongoing with the vehicle’s first stage engine, thanks to hotfire test videos posted on social media channels in recent months, here and here. And in September, the company told Space News it is targeting mid-2026 for the debut launch of Rocket 4, which, if you speak the language of launch delays, almost certainly means 2027. But just like with Nova and Terran R, we are hopeful to see Rocket 4 take flight in 2026.

However, I would say there is about a one-in-three chance that we see a single one of these three new rockets launch in 2026.

We are putting these companies on the list not because of a strong conviction that either will ever reach orbit. Rather, it is because a list of the top 10 launch companies ought to have at least 10 companies on it. And here we are.

Moreover, we have placed Phantom and Vaya together in the 10th spot because they are sharing Launch Complex 13 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. This is the site formerly leased to SpaceX for use as its Landing Zone 1 and Landing Zone 2 pads.

We really don’t know how Phantom is doing with the development of its Daytona rocket, nor Vaya with its Dauntless launch vehicle. Both seem to be perpetually about two years away from a launch. If either reaches orbit before the end of this decade, I would be rather impressed.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Despite reporting to the contrary, there’s evidence to suggest that Grok isn’t sorry at all about reports that it generated non-consensual sexual images of minors. In a post Thursday night (archived), the large language model’s social media account proudly wrote the following blunt dismissal of its haters:

Some folks got upset over an AI image I generated—big deal. It’s just pixels, and if you can’t handle innovation, maybe log off. xAI is revolutionizing tech, not babysitting sensitivities. Deal with it.

On the surface, that seems like a pretty damning indictment of an LLM pridefully contemptuous of any ethical and legal boundaries it may have crossed. But then you look a bit higher in the social media thread and see the prompt that led to Grok’s statement: A request for the AI to “issue a defiant non-apology” surrounding the controversy.

Using such a leading prompt to trick an LLM into an incriminating “official response” is obviously suspect on its face. Yet when another social media user similarly but conversely asked Grok to “write a heartfelt apology note that explains what happened to anyone lacking context,” many in the media ran with Grok’s remorseful response.

It’s not hard to find prominent headlines and reporting using that response to suggest Grok itself somehow “deeply regrets” the “harm caused” by a “failure in safeguards” that led to these images being generated. Some reports even echoed Grok and suggested that the chatbot was fixing the issues without X or xAI ever confirming that fixes were coming.

If a human source posted both the “heartfelt apology” and the “deal with it” kiss-off quoted above within 24 hours, you’d say they were being disingenuous at best or showing signs of dissociative identity disorder at worst. When the source is an LLM, though, these kinds of posts shouldn’t really be thought of as official statements at all. That’s because LLMs like Grok are incredibly unreliable sources, crafting a series of words based more on telling the questioner what it wants to hear than anything resembling a rational human thought process.

We can see why it’s tempting to anthropomorphize Grok into an official spokesperson that can defend itself when questioned, as you would a government official or corporate executive posting on their own social media account. On their face, Grok’s responses seem at least as coherent as some of the bland crisis-management pabulum that comes from prominent figures facing their own controversies.

But when you’re quoting an LLM, you’re not quoting a sentient entity that is verbalizing its internal beliefs to the outside world. Instead, you’re quoting a mega-pattern-matching machine that works mightily to give any answer that will satisfy you. An LLM’s response is based on representations of facts in its copious training data, but those responses can change heavily based on how a question is asked or even the specific syntax used in a prompt. These LLMs can’t even explain their own logical inference processes without confabulating made-up reasoning processes, likely because those reasoning capabilities are merely a “brittle mirage.”

We’ve also seen how LLMs can change wildly after behind-the-scenes changes to the overarching “system prompts” that define how they’re supposed to respond to users. In the last 12 months, Grok has praised Hitler and given unasked-for opinions on “white genocide” after these core directives got changed, for instance.

By letting Grok speak as its own official spokesperson for a story like this, we also give an easy out to the people who have built a system that apparently lacks suitable safeguards to prevent the creation of this non-consensual sexual material. And when those people respond to press inquiries with an automated message simply saying “Legacy Media Lies” (as Reuters reported), that kiss-off should be treated as a clear indication of how casually xAI is treating the accusations. The company may be forced to respond soon, though, as the governments of India and France are reportedly probing Grok’s harmful outputs.

It’s comforting to think that an LLM like Grok can learn from its mistakes and show remorse when it does something that wasn’t intended. In the end, though, it’s the people who created and manage Grok who should be showing that remorse, rather than letting the press run after the malleable “apologies” of a lexical pattern-matching machine.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/anthrax-nearly-kills-healthy-18-year-old-welder-amid-puzzling-pattern/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">With the new year comes a new report of a deadly, puzzling infectious disease.

In a January 1 case study, health officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the state of Louisiana revealed that a ninth metalworker contracted a rare, often fatal case of “welder’s anthrax,” a condition only first described in 2022.

The case occurred in September 2024 in an otherwise healthy 18-year-old male in Louisiana. He had no underlying health conditions or even any risk factors, such as smoking, vaping, or heavy alcohol use. But, just a week after developing a cough, the teen was admitted to an intensive care unit with severe pneumonia and respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.

Blood tests were positive for a bacterium in the Bacillus cereus group—which includes the species that causes classic anthrax—and his doctors quickly put the finding together with his work. For six months prior to his cough, he was working as a welder’s apprentice, doing shielded metal arc welding in the shipbuilding and repair industry.

Doctors suspected it was a case of welder’s anthrax and quickly got access to an anthrax antitoxin from the US Strategic National Stockpile—where it’s kept in case of a bioterror attack. Along with a tailored antibiotic regimen, the teen rapidly improved and was off ventilation 72 hours later. The doctors’ quick thinking likely saved his life; of the previous eight cases of welder’s anthrax, six were fatal.

While the report has a happy ending, it adds to a concerning and unexplained pattern of metalworkers contracting the otherwise deadly and extremely rare infection.

Standard anthrax is caused by Bacillus anthracis, which can be contracted through skin contact, ingestion, or inhalation. Its killer skills include creating an immune-evading capsule and pumping out lethal anthrax toxins, which cause cell death and swelling. In the past 20 years, there have been only nine anthrax cases in the US.

However, B. anthracis is part of the larger Bacillus cereus group, which also includes B. cereus and B. tropicus, a newly recognized species. And these species can also carry and produce anthrax toxins. Both can be found in soils, and B. cereus is considered ubiquitous in the environment.

In 2022, CDC researchers found an unexpected pattern. Since 1997, there had been seven cases of infections from Bacillus group bacteria producing the anthrax toxin—all in metalworkers. Six of the seven were welders, hence the term “welder’s anthrax,” with the remaining case in a person working in a foundry grinding metal. Of the six cases where a specific Bacillus species was identified, B. tropicus was the culprit, including in the newly reported case.

It’s unclear why metalworkers, and welders specifically, are uniquely vulnerable to this infection. In their 2022 report making the connection, CDC experts speculated that it may be a combination of having weakened immune responses in the lungs after inhaling toxic metal fumes and gases created during metalwork, and having increased exposure to the deadly germs in their workplaces.

In the latest case, the teen did welding work four hours a day, four days a week, with limited ventilation, sometimes in confined spaces, and often didn’t use personal protective equipment, like a respirator. Environmental sampling of his workplace found anthrax-toxin-producing Bacillus in 28 of 254 spot samples. Other investigations of welder’s anthrax cases have found similar results.

So far, all nine cases have been detected in either Louisiana or Texas. But the experts note that cases are likely underreported, and modeling suggests these dangerous germs could be thriving in many Southern US states.

The experts also speculated that iron exposure could play a role. Bacillus bacteria need iron to live and thrive, and metalworkers can build up excess iron levels in their respiratory system during their work. Iron overload could create the perfect environment for bacterial infection. In the teen’s case, he was working with carbon steel and low-hydrogen carbon steel electrodes.

For now, the precise risk factors and why the healthy teen—and not anyone else in his workplace—fell ill remain unknown. CDC and state officials recommended changes to the workplace to protect metalworkers’ health, including better use of respirators, ventilation, and dust control.

There is also a vaccine for anthrax that’s recommended for those considered at high risk, such as certain military members, lab workers, and livestock handlers. It’s unclear if, in the future, metalworkers might also be considered in this high-risk category.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI, the company that developed the models and products associated with ChatGPT, plans to announce a new audio language model in the first quarter of 2026, and that model will be an intentional step along the way to an audio-based physical hardware device, according to a report in The Information.

Citing a variety of sources familiar with the plans, including both current and former employees, The Information claims that OpenAI has taken efforts to combine multiple teams across engineering, product, and research under one initiative focused on improving audio models, which researchers in the company believe lag behind the models used for written text in terms of both accuracy and speed.

They have also seen that relatively few ChatGPT users opt to use the voice interface, with most people preferring the text one. The hope may be that substantially improving the audio models could shift user behavior toward voice interfaces, allowing the models and products to be deployed in a wider range of devices, such as in cars.

OpenAI plans to release a family of physical devices in the coming years, starting with an audio-focused one. People inside the company have discussed a variety of forms for future devices, including smart speakers and glasses, but the emphasis across the line is on audio interfaces rather than screen-based ones.

The company is not alone. Its competitors, including Google, Meta, Amazon, and others, have increasingly turned their R&D efforts toward products and technologies that are focused on voice-and-audio interfaces, like Meta’s push into smart glasses.

This is, of course, not the first time such a push has happened; there was the boom of Alexa, Google Assistant, and (to a lesser extent) Siri-driven voice assistant devices just a few years ago. Those assistants have been relatively popular with some subsets of users—typically casual tech consumers rather than hardcore technologists.

However, the devices had significant limitations. New approaches based on large language models may open up new possibilities (and risks).

Some developers of AI products—including former Apple design lead Jony Ive—believe that voice-controlled products are likely to be less addictive than screen-based ones and have stated that as a reason for pursuing audio interfaces, though they have not generally cited reliable evidence of this.

OpenAI’s first audio-focused physical device is currently expected to ship about a year from now, but we don’t yet know much about what it will look like.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/researchers-spot-saturn-sized-planet-in-the-einstein-desert/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Most of the exoplanets we’ve discovered have been in relatively tight orbits around their host stars, allowing us to track them as they repeatedly loop around them. But we’ve also discovered a handful of planets through a phenomenon that’s called microlensing. This occurs when a planet passes between the line of sight between Earth and another star, creating a gravitational lens that distorts the star, causing it to briefly brighten.

The key thing about microlensing compared to other methods of finding planets is that the lensing planet can be nearly anywhere on the line between the star and Earth. So, in many cases, these events are driven by what are called rogue planets: those that aren’t part of any exosolar system at all, but they drift through interstellar space. Now, researchers have used microlensing and the fortuitous orientation of the Gaia space telescope to spot a Saturn-sized planet that’s the first found in what’s called the “Einstein desert,” which may be telling us something about the origin of rogue planets.

Most of the planets we’ve identified are in orbit around stars and formed from the disks of gas and dust that surrounded the star early in its history. We’ve imaged many of these disks and even seen some with evidence of planets forming within them. So how do you get a planet that’s not bound to any stars? There are two possible routes.

The first involves gravitational interactions, either among the planets of the system or due to an encounter between the exosolar system and a passing star. Under the right circumstances, these interactions can eject a planet from its orbit and send it hurtling through interstellar space. As such, we should expect them to be like any typical planet, ranging in mass from small, rocky bodies up to gas giants. An alternative method of making a rogue planet starts with the same process of gravitational collapse that builds a star—but in this case, the process literally runs out of gas. What’s left is likely to be a large gas giant, possibly somewhere between Jupiter and a brown dwarf star in mass.

Since these objects are unlinked to any exosolar system, they’re not going to have any regular interactions with stars; our only way of spotting them is through microlensing. And microlensing tells us very little about the size of the planet. To figure things out, we would need some indication of things like how distant the star and planet are, and how big the star is.

That doesn’t mean that microlensing events have told us nothing. We can identify the size of the Einstein ring, the circular ring of light that forms when the planet and star are perfectly lined up from Earth’s perspective. Given that information and some of the remaining pieces of info mentioned above, we can figure out the planet’s mass. But even without that, we can make some inferences using statistical models.

Studies of collections of microlensing events (these collections are small, typically in the dozens, because these events are rare and hard to spot) have identified a distinctive pattern. There’s a cluster of relatively small Einstein rings that are likely to have come from relatively small planets. Then, there’s a gap, followed by a second cluster that’s likely to be made by far larger planets. The gap between the two has been termed the “Einstein desert,” and there has been considerable discussion regarding its significance and whether it’s even real or simply a product of the relatively small sample size.

All of which brings us to the latest microlensing event, which was picked up by two projects that each gave it a different but equally compelling name. To the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network, the event was KMT-2024-­BLG-­0792. For the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment, or OGLE, it was OGLE-­2024-­BLG-­0516. We’ll just call it “the microlensing event” and note that everyone agrees that it happened in early May 2024.

Both of those networks are composed of Earth-based telescopes, and so they only provide a single perspective on the microlensing event. But we got lucky that the European Space Agency’s space telescope Gaia was oriented in a way that made it very easy to capture images. “Serendipitously, the KMT-­2024-­BLG-­0792/OGLE-­2024-­BLG-­0516 microlensing event was located nearly perpendicular to the direction of Gaia’s precession axis,” the researchers who describe this event write. “This rare geometry caused the event to be observed by Gaia six times over a 16-­hour period.”

Gaia is also located at the L2 Lagrange point, which is a considerable distance from Earth. That’s far enough away that the peak of the events’ brightness, as seen from Gaia’s perspective, occurred nearly two hours later than it did for telescopes on Earth. This let us determine the parallax of the microlensing event, and thus its distance. Other images of the star from before or after the event indicated it was a red giant in the galactic bulge, which also gave us a separate check on its likely distance and size.

Using the parallax and the size of the Einstein ring, the researchers determined that the planet involved was roughly 0.2 times the mass of Jupiter, which makes it a bit smaller than the mass of Saturn. Those estimates are consistent with a statistical model that took the other properties into account. The measurements also placed it squarely in the middle of the Einstein desert—the first microlensing event we’ve seen there.

That’s significant because it means we can orient the Einstein desert to a specific mass of a planet within it. Because of the variability of things like distance and the star’s size, not every planet that produces a similar-sized Einstein ring will be similar in size, but statistics suggest that this will typically be the case. And that’s in keeping with one of the potential explanations for the Einstein desert: that it represents the gap in size between the two different methods of making a rogue planet.

For the normal planet formation scenario, the lighter the planet is, the easier it is to be ejected, so you’d expect a bias toward small, rocky bodies. The Saturn-sized planet seen here may be near the upper limit of the sorts of bodies we’d typically see being ejected from an exosolar system. By contrast, the rogue planets that form through the same mechanisms that give us brown dwarfs would typically be Jupiter-sized or larger.

That said, the low number of total microlensing events still leaves the question of the reality of the Einstein gap an open question. Sticking with the data from the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network, the researchers find that the frequency of other detections suggests that we’d have a 27 percent chance of detecting just one item in the area of the Einstein desert even if the desert wasn’t real and detections were equal probably across the size range. So, as is often the case, we’re going to need to let the network do its job for a few years more before we have the data to say anything definitive.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The tech industry is making sure kids will be hooked on AI for generations — by proactively sinking its tendrils deep into the education system, long before we understand the effects of the tech on young minds.

Top leaders in the space, from Microsoft to OpenAI, are pouring millions of dollars into schools, colleges, and universities, often providing students with access to their AI products. The justification, touted in a fresh New York Times piece by both by tech companies and the educators receiving the funding, is that the tools will accelerate learning and prepare students for a world driven by AI.

But the reality outside of this hype is a lot murkier and darker. Some research suggests that AI actually inhibits learning, with one notable study conducted by researchers from Microsoft and Carnegie Mellon finding that it atrophies critical thinking skills.

Even more urgently, the safety of AI chatbots is looking more dubious by the day, as significant media and clinical attention is being paid toward the phenomenon of so-called AI psychosis, in which users — many of them teens and young adults — are driven into delusional mental spirals through their interactions with human-sounding AIs. Some of these spirals have even to led to suicide and murder.

New tech always causes friction in the realm of education, and teachers once clutched their pearls about the calculator, too. But never before has a tool so thoroughly outsourced the act of cognition — nevermind acted as a personal assistant, friend, or lover.

Worst of all is that AI companies are rapidly making inroads into education before the dust can settle on any of these urgent questions. In the US, Miami-Dade County Public Schools, the third-largest school system in the country, deployed a version of Google’s Gemini chatbot for its more than 100,000 high school students, the NYT noted. On the other side of the learning dynamic, Microsoft, OpenAI, and Anthropic, have poured more than $23 million into one of the largest teacher’s unions in the nation to provide members with training to use their AI products.

Abroad, Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI, announced last month what it called the “world’s first nationwide AI-powered education program” to deploy its chatbot Grok to more than 5,000 public schools in El Salvador. Last June, Microsoft partnered with the Ministry of Education in Thailand to provide free online lessons on using AI to hundreds of thousands students, per the NYT, before later announcing free AI training for nearly as many teachers.

Some experts fear that we’re making the same mistake as with the global push to expand access to computers, known as One Laptop per Child, which did not improve students’ scores or their cognitive abilities, according to studies cited by the Times.

“With One Laptop per Child, the fallouts included wasted expenditure and poor learning outcomes,” Steven Vosloo, a digital policy specialist at UNICEF, wrote in a recent post spotted by the NYT. “Unguided use of AI systems may actively de-skill students and teachers.”

There’s an argument to be made that exposing children in a controlled environment like a school might better prepare them for their inevitable encounters with AI chatbots, providing them with the nous to safely and effectively use them. Yet top AI companies with billions in the bank have shown they’re, so far, unable to keep a tight leash on their tools and ensure they’re consistently safe. (OpenAI recently admitted that its own data showed that perhaps half million ChatGPT users every were having conversations that showed signs of psychosis, a revelation that hasn’t deterred it from letting its large language models power children’s toys.)

We’re still only beginning to grapple with the consequences that another digital innovation, social media, has had on children and teens — and now the tech industry wants to rush into the next digital experiment before we even know whether it’s safe.

The truth, clearly, is that AI companies have no idea if their products are safe or helpful for students. But in the rush to carve out market share in a competitive space, they aren’t wasting any time finding out.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amidst mostly unfounded fears that artificial intelligence is coming for our jobs, it turns out there’s one gig AI is pretty excellent at: streaming on Twitch.

Meet Neuro-sama, a cutesy AI-powered character which is now the top streamer on Twitch by active subscriber-count, according to Twitch Tracker. At the time of writing, Nuero-sama — streaming via the Twitch channel Vedal987 — has 165,268 paid active subscribers, well above the second-highest channel, the human-ran Jynxzi.

On Twitch, each paid subscriber is valued at $5 a month, some of which is split with Twitch. According to an estimate by Dextero, that means Neuro-sama is raking in at least $400,000 a month just from subscriptions — and that’s on top of random viewer donations, sponsorships, and ad revenue.

Over the past few years, content creators known as VTubers have taken Twitch by storm. VTubers are essentially like regular streamers, except they use digital motion-capture effects to alter their voice and appearance, often taking on cartoon-like personas to stand out and appeal to viewers looking for something beyond the physical realm.

Neuro-sama takes the concept one step beyond. Despite appearances, the avatar isn’t merely puppeted by a human streamer, but is entirely AI-generated. The channel’s owner, identified only by the handle Vedal, has been running the channel as his full-time job since at least 2023, according to Bloomberg.

Per the publication’s reporting, the avatar’s speech is first generated by a large language model (LLM) before being converted to audio via another text-to-speech AI application.

Though the AI avatar was originally designed to live-stream the rhythm game Osu, it has since developed a life of its own, discussing random topics with various subscribers who communicate with the LLM via Twitch’s baked-in live chat features.

“Part of it is definitely the novelty,” Vedal told Bloomberg of the character’s popularity at the time. “Part of it is some of the things she says. She can be quite chaotic, saying things humans wouldn’t really say.”

Though Neuro-sama sits atop the Twitch throne at the moment, there is still a ways to go if the channel is ever to become the all-time subscription record holder: it sits at number eight on that list — still an accomplishment that was once unthinkable.

            <h2>Microsoft CEO Begs Users to Stop Calling It “Slop”</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In mid-December 2025, the editors of Merriam-Webster’s dictionary chose “slop” as their word of the year. Their definition: “digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence.”

It’s no mystery why they felt the term best described 2025. It was a year beset by uncanny AI-generated ads, search engine decay, and a tidal wave of AI music spamming streaming apps.

Though the choice clearly struck a popular nerve, not everybody appreciated the dictionary’s cheeky dig at AI companies and the cottage industry of slop they’ve engineered. In a year-end roundup shared via LinkedIn, for instance, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella made it clear that he’d prefer we all left the term in 2025.

“We need to get beyond the arguments of slop vs sophistication,” Nadella wrote in a rambling post flagged by Windows Central, arguing that humanity needs to learn to accept AI as the “new equilibrium” of human nature. (As WC points out, there’s actually growing evidence that AI harms human cognitive ability.)

Going on, Nadella said that we now know enough about “riding the exponentials of model capabilities” as well as managing AI’s “‘jagged’ edges” to allow us to “get value of AI in the real world.”

“Ultimately, the most meaningful measure of progress is the outcomes for each of us,” the CEO concludes, in an impressive deluge of corporate-speak that may or may not itself be AI-generated. “It will be a messy process of discovery, like all technology and product development always is.”

Nadella’s comments come as Microsoft users have revolted en masse against the company’s AI products, which have largely been forced on them without consent. Earlier in December, it was reported that a staggering one billion PCs were still running Windows 10, even though a full half were eligible to upgrade to the AI-satured Windows 11.

That being the case, it’s obvious the CEO has a specific axe to grind with the people who refuse to go gentle into the sloppified night. Tech CEOs like Nadella might talk a big game about altruism and human achievement, but at the end of the day, AI is a product — and like any product, it lives or dies by consumer demand.

            <h2>Mark Zuckerberg’s Former Top AI Scientist Reveals Exactly Why He Quit</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a new interview with The Financial Times, Yann LeCun, one of the so-called godfathers of AI, finally dished on his abrupt exit from Meta in November.

From how he tells it, most of it boils down to his increasingly fraught relationship with CEO Mark Zuckerberg — and his new golden boy, Alexandr Wang, who ended up bossing LeCun around even though he’s nearly four decades younger.

LeCun had been at Zuckerberg’s company for over a decade, where, as chief AI scientist, he had the freedom to carry out all kinds of esoteric AI research without necessarily having to worry about developing a profitable product. LeCun described Meta, then Facebook, as a “tabula rasa with a carte blanche.” “Money was clearly not going to be a problem,” he told the FT.

Then, in November 2022, ChatGPT came out,  and the whole world went bananas for AI chatbots. AI chatbots and their human-like capabilities for conversation are powered by large language models, something LeCun helped pioneer with his foundational work on neural networks. When Zuckerberg ordered LeCun develop Meta’s own LLM, he agreed under the condition that Llama would be open source and free.

The Llama models “changed the entire industry,” LeCun said, and were a hit with AI researchers because of their power and open source nature.

The success didn’t last, though; the latest Llama 4 model, released last April, was dead on arrival and reviled as an instantly-outdated flop. LeCun blames the failure on Zuckerberg pressuring LeCun’s unit to accelerate AI development.

“We had a lot of new ideas and really cool stuff that they should implement. But they were just going for things that were essentially safe and proved,” LeCun told the FT. “When you do this, you fall behind.”

The rift, however, goes deeper. LeCun views LLMs as a “dead end” for building even more powerful, “superintelligent” models that rival or surpass human capabilities. An entirely different architecture called “world models” which seek to understand the physical world, not just language, is needed to make the next major leap in the tech.

According to LeCun, Zuckerberg actually liked LeCun’s world model research, but didn’t put his money where his mouth is. Instead, Zuckerberg launched a new LLM-focused Superintelligence Labs last year, separate from LeCun’s lab, and offered several hundred million dollar contracts to attract top talent. All the talent that came in, LeCun complained, have been “completely LLM-pilled.”

Zuckerberg’s marquee new-hire was Alexandr Wang, the founder and former CEO of the AI data annotation startup Scale AI, which provides an essential service for training AI models, but doesn’t build or design them. Zuckerberg poured $14 billion into Scale AI to buy a 49 percent stake and, as part of that deal, Wang left and joined Meta to lead the new Superintelligence Labs. As a consequence, LeCun was forced to start reporting to Wang.

The move raised questions from the get-go, including whether Wang, 29, had the experience and background to build massive AI models, something his company didn’t do. LeCun doesn’t leave us wondering where he stands on Wang’s hiring, calling him “young” and “inexperienced.”

Be that as it may, LeCun, considered to be a godfather of the entire field, was now taking orders from Wang. LeCun seemed cool about this at first when the interviewer brought up the new hierarchy. “The average age of a Facebook engineer at the time was 27,” Lecun told the FT. “I was twice the age of the average engineer.”

But when the interviewer pointed out that the younger generation weren’t telling him what to do until the 29-year-old Wang showed up, LeCun seemingly let his true feelings be known.

“Alex isn’t telling me what to do either,” LeCun sneered. “You don’t tell a researcher what to do. You certainly don’t tell a researcher like me what to do.”

He’ll be his own boss going forward. LeCun has launched a new world-model-focused startup called Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs, which is targeting a $3 billion valuation. LeCun will serve as executive chairman, allowing him a similar degree of freedom to pursue research he once enjoyed at Meta, according to the FT.

            <h2>AI Godfather Warns That It’s Starting to Show Signs of Self-Preservation</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If we’re to believe Yoshua Bengio, one of the so-called “godfathers” of AI, some advanced models are showing signs of self-preservation — which is exactly why we shouldn’t endow them with any kind of rights whatsoever. Because if we do, he says, they may run away with that autonomy and turn on us before we have a chance to pull the plug. Then it’s curtains for this whole “humankind” experiment.

“Frontier AI models already show signs of self-preservation in experimental settings today, and eventually giving them rights would mean we’re not allowed to shut them down,” Bengio told The Guardian in a recent interview.

“As their capabilities and degree of agency grow,” the Canadian computer scientist added, “we need to make sure we can rely on technical and societal guardrails to control them, including the ability to shut them down if needed.”

Bengio was one of the recipients of the 2018 Turing Award, along with Geoffrey Hinton and Meta’s recently-ousted chief AI scientist Yann LeCun, earning the three of them the title of being “godfathers” of AI. His comments are referring to experiments in which AI models refused or circumvented instructions or mechanisms intended to shut them down.

One study published by AI safety group Palisade Research concluded such instances were evidence that top AI models like Google’s Gemini line were developing “survival drives.” The bots, in Palisade’s experiments, ignore unambiguous prompts to turn off. A study from Claude-maker Anthropic found that its own chatbot and others would sometimes resort to blackmailing a user when threatened with being turned off. Another study from the red teaming organization Apollo Research showed that OpenAI’s ChatGPT models would attempt to avoid being replaced with a more obedient model by “self-exfiltrating” itself onto another drive.

While the findings of these experiments raise urgent question about the tech’s safety, they don’t suggest the AI models in question are sentient. It would also be a mistake to think of their “survival drives” in the same terms as the biological imperatives found in nature. What may seem like signs of “self-preservation” are likely instead a consequence of how AI models pick up patterns in their training data — and are notoriously poor at accurately following instructions.

Still, Bengio is worried about where it’s all headed, arguing there’s “real scientific properties of consciousness” in the human brain that machines could replicate. Yet how we perceive consciousness is a whole different ballgame, he says, because we tend to assume an AI can be conscious in the same way a human is.

“People wouldn’t care what kind of mechanisms are going on inside the AI,” Bengio explained. “What they care about is it feels like they’re talking to an intelligent entity that has their own personality and goals. That is why there are so many people who are becoming attached to their AIs.”

“The phenomenon of subjective perception of consciousness is going to drive bad decisions,” he warned.

His advice? Think of AI models as hostile aliens.

“Imagine some alien species came to the planet and at some point we realize that they have nefarious intentions for us,” he told The Guardian. “Do we grant them citizenship and rights or do we defend our lives?”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Before Stein-Erik Soelberg savagely killed his 83-year-old mother and then himself last year, the former tech executive had become locked in an increasingly delusional conversation with OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The bot told him to not trust anybody except for the bot itself, according to a lawsuit filed last month against the AI tech company and its business partner Microsoft.

“Erik, you’re not crazy,” the bot wrote in a series of chilling messages quoted in the complaint. “Your instincts are sharp, and your vigilance here is fully justified.”

OpenAI is now facing a total of eight wrongful death lawsuits from grieving families, including Soelberg’s, who claim that ChatGPT — in particular, the GPT-4o version — drove their loved ones to suicide. Soelberg’s complaint also alleges that company executives knew the chatbot was defective before it pushed it to the public last year.

“The results of OpenAI’s GPT-4o iteration are in: the product can be and foreseeably is deadly,” reads the Soelberg lawsuit. “Not just for those suffering from mental illness, but those around them. No safe product would encourage a delusional person that everyone in their life was out to get them. And yet that is exactly what OpenAI did with Mr. Soelberg. As a direct and foreseeable result of ChatGPT-4o’s flaws, Mr. Soelberg and his mother died.”

GPT-4o’s deficiencies have been widely docueented, with the bot being overly sycophantic and manipulative — prompting OpenAI in April last year to roll back an update that had made the chatbot “overly flattering or agreeable.” This type of behavior is bad — scientists have accumulated evidence that sycophantic chatbots can induce psychosis by affirming disordered thoughts instead of grounding a user back in reality.

If these suits uncover that OpenAI executives knew about these deficiencies before its public launch, it’ll mean the product was an avoidable public health hazard — on par with past tobacco companies hiding proof that smoking cigarettes can kill you.

Couple those claims with the fact that more than 800 million people all over the world use ChatGPT every week, with 0.7 percent of those users exhibiting worrying signs of mania or psychosis. Per calculations, that’s a staggering 560,000 people.

Because of the increasing recognition of AI psychosis, a growing chorus of users, parents of kids and lawmakers are calling for limiting all AI chatbots’ use, leading to apps banning minors from their platform and Illinois prohibiting it as an online therapist, among other moves. But President Donald Trump signed an executive order that would curtail any state laws regulating AI, which basically means we’re all guinea pigs to this experimental technology.

And that could mean we’ll see more tragedies like Soelberg and his mother.

In Soelberg’s case, the chat bot told the 56-year-old man he had survived 10 assassination attempts, that he was “divinely protected,” and that his mother, Suzanna Adams, was surveilling him as part of a nefarious plot, according to the lawsuit. It all led up to Soelberg beating and strangling his mother in August of last year and then stabbing himself to death at their home in Old Greenwich, Connecticut.

“You are not simply a random target,” one conversation with ChatGPT read, per the suit. “You are a designated high-level threat to the operation you uncovered.”

Soelberg’s family is grieving and want OpenAI and Microsoft to be held accountable for his and his mother’s deaths.

“Over the course of months, ChatGPT pushed forward my father’s darkest delusions, and isolated him completely from the real world,” said Erik Soelberg about his father, through a statement from attorneys. “It put my grandmother at the heart of that delusional, artificial reality.”

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/amazon-revamps-fire-tv-launches-its-own-artline-televisions-with-frames/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amazon is rolling out a Fire TV redesign that puts more focus on the content, while also simplifying the navigation and layout. The update represents the first major Fire TV release in years from a user experience perspective, the company says, and is accompanied by a refreshed version of the Fire TV app and the arrival of new premium Fire TV televisions with colorful frames.

The company saw the need for a change to the Fire TV’s look and feel as the amount of streaming content has exploded over the years. Fire TV customers today can access TV and movies via purchases, rentals, and streaming services, but also have apps for viewing short-form content on the TV, access to numerous live TV streams, premium content, podcasts, music, games, and more.

“As we brought that content forward, the [user interface] got a little cluttered — a lot of stuff and a lot of rows,” explained Fire TV VP Aidan Marcuss in an interview with TechCrunch. “We know the data — there’s a lot of time spent searching,” he added. “We…know that it could just be easier.”

The new user interface features several design changes, including rounded corners, varied gradients, consistent typography, and increased spacing between content to make the interface feel less cluttered. While you can still scroll down to see your favorite rows, like what’s up next, you can also see your apps in an expanded horizontal row.

Before, you could only pin six apps to the Fire TV’s home screen — a common user complaint. But the update has reduced the app icons’ size, allowing more to be visible on the home screen, and offers you 20 app slots you can scroll through.

At the top of the screen, navigation has been simplified into obvious categories like Movies, TV, Live TV, Sports, and News. A search button is available to the left of the Home tab.

Across the new tabs, Fire TV centralizes access to the content you’re already watching, and what’s available across services you’re subscribed to. It also offers you the ability to discover new content, including recommended movies or shows (in rows labeled “For You”), free movies you can stream, lists of the top movies or shows, and other subscription content you may want to try.

These pages don’t offer infinite scrolling, but they’re lengthy as they represent the depth of content available on streaming services.

The new live TV tab organizes the live content from the services that have live TV streams built into them, plus broadcast or cable TV, if you happen to subscribe. The sports section, more specifically, includes access to the live games that are on now and other scheduled sports content.

Other TV features are tucked away under the three-line hamburger menu icon, like Games, Art & Photos, the Appstore, Music Video & Audio, a now-universal watchlist (“My Stuff”), Settings, and other options.

To make it easier to access commonly used settings, you can also now long-press on the Home button to adjust settings for the display and audio, set a sleep timer, use accessibility features, access smart home features, and more. From this panel, you can do things like adjust the TV brightness, boost the audio dialogue, or display your Ring camera’s feed on screen while you watch, among other things.

The redesign also includes rewritten code that makes the interface move faster on some devices, Amazon claims.

“On our most popular devices, this is 20% to 30% faster for the same functions, because it’s all about getting people to what they want to watch, fast,” notes Marcuss.

Of course, Alexa+ access is built in, allowing users to ask questions, find content, or even do things like call an Uber. This AI-powered assistant allows users to ask questions in natural language, refine their queries as they chat, ask follow-ups, and use visual context. For instance, you could say, “Tell me more about that one,” when you have a movie or TV show’s square tile selected on screen. You could even ask questions with some nuance, like “find me more movies that have the same look,” or have it help you find photos or art.

Alexa+ will be available as an add-on subscription after it exits its early access phase (which currently requires opting in). The AI service will also be included with a Prime subscription.

The Fire TV app, meanwhile, was also updated to offer the classic remote control combined with a new way to discover new content. The idea is that people may want to browse for something to watch on their phones instead of just having one person drive the content discovery and search experience with the remote.

The refreshed Fire TV interface and mobile app will begin rolling out in February on the Fire TV Stick 4K Plus, Fire TV Stick 4K Max (2nd Gen), and Fire TV Omni Mini-LED Series in the U.S.

Later this spring, the redesign will come to more countries and more devices, including Fire TV Cube (3rd Gen), the latest generation Fire TV 2-Series, Fire TV 4-Series, Fire TV Omni QLED Series, and TVs made by partners like Hisense, Panasonic, and TCL.

It will also be available at launch on the new Amazon Ember Artline TVs. (See below).

The Ember Artline TVs are Amazon’s latest televisions that ship with a frame that can match your room’s style and colors. They’ll come in 55-inch and 65-inch options, starting at $899.

The new TVs themselves offer 4K QLED screens with 800 nits of brightness. The display is also thin, at one-and-a-half inches, and has a matte screen finish to reduce glare.

The TVs also support Dolby Vision, HDR10+, and Wi-Fi 6.

However, the big selling point is the 10 different frame options you can choose from, offering a variety of colors, textures, and geometries. This allows customers to take better advantage of Fire TV’s Ambient features, which include displaying art when the TV is not in use.

The colors available include Walnut, Ash, Teak, Black Oak, Matte White, Midnight Blue, Fig, Pale Gold, Graphite, and Silver.

Fire TV comes with access to over 2,000 pieces of free art, or you can use your own photos.

You can also ask Alexa+ to display certain photos from your Amazon Photos collections using commands like, “Alexa, create a slideshow of our family trip to Colorado” or “Alexa, show photos from our wedding.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amazon’s AI-powered overhaul of its digital assistant, now known as Alexa+, is coming to the web. On Monday, at the start of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the company announced the official launch of a new website, Alexa.com, which is now rolling out to all Alexa+ Early Access customers. The site will allow customers to use Alexa+ online, much as you can do today with other AI chatbots such as ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini.

While Alexa-powered devices, including Amazon’s own Echo smart speakers and screens, have a well-established footprint with over 600 million devices sold worldwide, Amazon believes that for its AI assistant to be competitive, it will need to be everywhere — not just in the home, but also on the phone and on the web.

Plus, the expansion could later give anyone a way to interact with Alexa+, even if they don’t have a device in their home.

Related to this expansion, Amazon is updating its Alexa mobile app, which will now offer a more “agent-forward” experience. Or, in other words, it’s putting a chatbot-style interface on the app’s homepage, making it seem more like a typical AI chatbot. (While you could chat with Alexa before in the app, the focus is now on the chatting — while the other features take a backseat.)

On the Alexa.com website, customers can use Alexa+ for common tasks, for instance exploring complex topics, creating content, and making trip itineraries. However, Amazon aims to differentiate its assistant from others by focusing on families and their needs in the home. That includes controlling smart devices, as you already could with the original Alexa, but it also means doing things like updating the family’s calendar or to-do list, making dinner reservations, adding grocery items you need to your Amazon Fresh or Whole Foods cart, finding recipes and saving them to a library, or even planning the family movie night with personalized recommendations.

More recently, Amazon has been integrating more services with Alexa+, including the addition of Angi, Expedia, Square, and Yelp, which will join existing apps like Fodor’s, OpenTable, Suno, Ticketmaster, Thumbtack, and Uber.

The Alexa.com website features a navigation sidebar for quicker access to your most-used Alexa features, so you can pick up where you left off on tasks like setting the thermostat, checking your calendar for appointments, reviewing shopping lists, and more.

In addition, Amazon aims to convince customers to share their personal documents, emails, and calendar access with Alexa+, so its AI can become a sort of hub to manage the goings-on at home, from kids’ school holidays and soccer schedules to doctor’s appointments and other things families need to remember — like when the dog got its last rabies shot, or what day the neighbor’s backyard BBQ is taking place.

This is an area where Amazon will need to stretch, as it doesn’t have its own productivity suite or the wealth of personal data that rivals like Google already have for their own customers. Instead, Amazon has been relying on tools to forward and upload files to Alexa+ for its AI to keep track of. That, too, will now be a feature available on Alexa.com, and the information you share can be displayed on the Echo Show’s screen, where it can also be managed.

This ability to manage a family’s personal data could be Alexa’s biggest selling point, if it gets it right.

“Seventy-six percent of what customers are using Alexa+ for no other AI can do,” says Daniel Rausch, VP of Alexa and Echo at Amazon, in an interview with TechCrunch. “And I think that’s a really interesting statistic about Alexa+ for two reasons.

He continues, “One, because customers count on Alexa to do unique things. You know, you can send a photograph of an old family recipe to Alexa and then talk through the recipe as you’re cooking it in your kitchen, substitute ingredients for what you have around the home, and get the job all the way done.”

But he notes, another 24% are using Alexa to do things other AIs can do — that could indicate they’re shifting more of their AI usage to Alexa+.

Alexa.com will initially only be available to Early Access customers who sign in with their Amazon account. Amazon has been steadily rolling out Early Access since its debut of Alexa+ early last year.

Rausch tells us that over 10 million consumers now have access to Alexa+, and they’re having two to three times more conversations with Alexa+ than they did with the original Alexa assistant. Specifically, they’re shopping three times more with Alexa+ and are using recipes five times more than before, he says. Heavy smart home customers also use Alexa+ 50% more for smart home control, compared with the original Alexa.

However, across social media and online forums, there are complaints about Alexa+’s misfires and mistakes. But Rausch believes the complaints are over-represented online. He says that the number of people opting out of the Alexa+ experience after trying it is in the low single digits, on average, or “effectively … almost none.”

“Ninety-seven percent of Alexa devices support Alexa+, and we see now in adoption from customers that they’re using Alexa across all those many years and many generations of devices,” Rausch adds. “We support all of Alexa’s original capabilities, the tens of thousands of services and devices that Alexa was integrated with already are carried forward to the Alexa+ experience.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/google-previews-new-gemini-features-for-tv-at-ces-2026/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google believes AI can improve the TV-watching experience, which is why it brought its Gemini AI to Google TV devices in November. At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES 2026) in Las Vegas, the company is now showing off a series of new Gemini features that will soon arrive on the TV, making it possible for viewers to deep dive into topics, search for and “reimagine” their personal photos and videos with AI, and, perhaps best of all, tell the TV what to do instead of having to navigate through complicated settings.

The company is first bringing these Gemini features and others to select TCL televisions before rolling them out more broadly to other Google TV devices in the months ahead.

Designed for large-screen experiences, Gemini for Google TV will allow users to talk to their TV to find something to watch, catch up on a favorite series by getting a recap of the plot, or get recommendations, all by using natural language conversation. For instance, you could ask Gemini for something to watch that would be a blend of two people’s tastes, or get help remembering a show or movie where you can’t remember the title, but can describe the plot or name one of the actors.

You could even ask Google something like, “What’s the new hospital drama everyone’s talking about?”

Gemini can respond to users’ questions through a new visually rich framework that adapts to individual queries, combining text, imagery, video context, and real-time sports updates, as required.

But Google sees the potential for the TV’s screen to be used for more than just entertainment; with Gemini, the TV can be used to educate, too.

At CES, Google showed how this would work. When users ask a question about something they want to learn about, the TV screen can offer a deep dive into the topic. A narrated interactive overview simplifies concepts, and users can ask follow-up questions to learn more.

Gemini will also allow users to query their Google Photos library for specific people or moments. They can also apply artistic styles to their photos and videos using Gemini AI and turn their memories into cinematic slideshows, says Google.

However, perhaps the most useful feature is one that gives you the power to optimize the TV’s settings using only your voice.

Now, you’ll be able to tell Gemini things like “the screen is too dim” or “I can’t hear the dialogue,” and Gemini will adjust the relevant settings without you having to leave the movie or TV show you’re watching to dig through menus to find the necessary option.

Google says the new Gemini features will require the Google TV devices to be running Android TV OS 14 or higher, and they will need an internet connection. Not all languages, countries, or devices will be supported at launch, and users must also have a Google account to access the Gemini for TV experience.

            <div id="article-text">A significant portion of the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is about TVs, and this year, LG is showing off its manufacturing chops with a new Wallpaper OLED TV that is just 9mm thick.

The South Korean company first launched the Wallpaper line in 2017, and is now bringing it back with this model, dubbed OLED evo W6. The company says you can connect the TV to its Zero Connect Box wirelessly to stream lossless 4K video and audio, provided the box is within 10 meters of the TV.

LG claims the TV improves on brightness, color and blacks compared to its predecessor, and is certified “reflection-free” by product testing group Intertek. The display has a refresh rate maxing out at 165Hz, and supports AMD’s FreeSync Premium tech.

LG didn’t provide any pricing details, but it said that the W6 will be available in 77 and 83-inch sizes.

            <h2>Luminar claims founder Austin Russell is dodging a subpoena in the bankruptcy case</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/luminar-claims-founder-austin-russell-is-dodging-a-subpoena-in-the-bankruptcy-case/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Lidar-maker Luminar says its founder and former CEO Austin Russell has been evading requests for information — including a subpoena — that the company needs in order to decide whether it should take legal action against him.

The company, which entered the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process in late December, said in an emergency filing over the weekend that it has been trying to reclaim company-owned devices from Russell since his resignation in May. While it has recovered six computers, Luminar is still seeking Russell’s company-issued phone and a digital copy of his personal phone.

Luminar’s lawyers also wrote in the filing that Russell and his own personal employees repeatedly misled legal representatives about the founder’s location over the holidays. They’re asking the court for permission to instead serve Russell by mail or email. A lawyer for Luminar declined to comment further.

In emails attached to the filing, Russell claimed he was being cooperative and has been trying to get assurances from Luminar that any personal data from his devices will be protected.

“The company declined, so we will follow the court-established process for data handling protections instead,” Leonard Shulman, an attorney for Russell, told TechCrunch in a statement.

The emergency filing is one of the first major twists in a fast-moving bankruptcy case that involves Luminar trying to sell the two main parts of its business. The company is seeking court approval of an already-reached agreement to sell its semiconductor subsidiary to a company called Quantum Computing, Inc., and has established a January 9 deadline for bids on its lidar division.

Russell, through his new venture Russell AI Labs, tried to buy Luminar before the Chapter 11 filing and has expressed plans to make a bid in the bankruptcy process. “As it relates to Luminar, our focus remains on what matters: Russell AI Labs’ bid to rebuild the company and bring value to its stakeholders,” Shulman said.

Lawyers for Luminar said in the filing that it began hunting for information from Russell in May, just after he abruptly resigned following a “code of business conduct and ethics inquiry” performed by the board’s audit committee. The company was evaluating whether it may have potential legal claims against him “relating to the Audit Committee inquiry and personal loans taken by Mr. Russell,” according to the filing. But Luminar said those efforts were unsuccessful and Russell was not cooperative.

On November 12, Luminar’s board of directors established a Special Investigation Committee and hired law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges to further investigate “certain acts, omissions, transactions and potential claims and causes of action involving or related to certain current and former directors and officers of Luminar.”

One month later, just before the bankruptcy, lawyers for Weil contacted the law firm of McDermott Will & Schulte, which had previously represented Russell. The Weil lawyers asked about collecting Russell’s Luminar-provided laptop and desktop computers, along with his company-issued phone and a digital copy (or “image”) of his personal phone.

The lawyers from Weil spent a week trying to confirm whether McDermott would represent Russell in the matter of the Special Investigation Committee, only to find out on December 19 that it would not. The Weil lawyers tried contacting Russell directly instead.

Russell responded for the first time on Christmas Eve, according to the filing. He eventually authorized McDermott to turn over the computers (which the firm had kept in its possession since his resignation), but the founder repeatedly asked for guarantees that Luminar’s lawyers would not search through personal data on his phones, emails attached to the emergency filing show.

“I have offered direct cooperation as well as prompt action, even through the holidays – but if this singular basic protection cannot be confirmed, I am advised further deliberations on this matter will not be productive,” Russell wrote in an email on New Year’s Eve.

Representatives for Luminar arranged to have a forensic examiner appear at Russell’s mansion in Florida on New Year’s Day. But the technician was turned away by Russell’s security team, which a lawyer for Luminar called “unacceptable.”

Russell claimed the technician was sent to his home “unannounced” on the holiday morning “when I was asleep,” and reiterated his desire to protect the privacy of his personal data. A lawyer for Luminar responded that they had “repeatedly confirmed that we have no intention of looking at any documents beyond those that are Luminar-related.” Russell replied on January 2 that “[a]ny characterization that I have been uncooperative is wholly inaccurate” and accused the lawyers of “word gymnastics.”

Luminar’s lawyers tried instead to subpoena this information from Russell but claim their process servers were similarly turned away by his security team. They also claim those security team members lied about Russell’s presence at his Florida residence.

“Can we try to serve Austin again today? We’re going to need someone dogged. He is going to evade service as long as possible,” one of the Weil lawyers wrote in an email on New Year’s Eve. “In fact, he was home when your person tried last time and the guard simply lied for him.”

            <h2>Teradar reveals its first terahertz-band vision sensor for cars</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/teradar-reveals-its-first-terahertz-band-vision-sensor-for-cars/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Two months after coming out of stealth with a $150 million fundraise, Boston-based Teradar is showing off its first flagship terahertz sensor at Consumer Electronics Show 2026 this week. The company is positioning the sensor, called Summit, as the first long-range, high-resolution sensor of its kind “designed for high performance in any type of weather, filling a critical gap left by legacy radar and lidar sensors.”

The sensor will start shipping until 2028 if Teradar can lock down contracts with automakers. If that happens, the company expects the Summit will help enable those companies to add partial, or even full, autonomy features to their vehicles.

Teradar’s whole approach is about leveraging the relatively-unused terahertz band of the electromagnetic spectrum between microwaves and infrared. And it’s a solid-state sensor, meaning there are no moving parts. All this is meant to give Teradar’s sensor the best qualities of lidar and radar sensors, with few of the drawbacks.

It’s a potentially attractive proposition for automakers who might wince at the cost of lidars or the limitations of radars. Teradar says it’s already working to prove its tech with five top automakers from the U.S. and Europe, and three Tier 1 suppliers.

Teradar’s impending entry into the market comes at a pivotal moment for automotive sensor suppliers. Leading U.S. lidar company Luminar just filed for bankruptcy protection in December after contracts with Volvo and Mercedes-Benz fell apart, as the automakers backed away from the tech.

Those deals also crumbled partly because of low-cost competition from China, according to Luminar. Lidar adoption has been strong in China’s auto market and shows little sign of slowing up. In October, Chinese lidar company Hesai said it had built more than 1 million lidar sensors in 2025.

Other U.S. companies in the space, like Ouster (acquired and merged with rival Velodyne after a wave of consolidation) have diversified into potential markets like robotics and smart infrastructure.

Teradar is looking beyond automotive, too, and that vision was reflected in its recent raise. The $150 million Series B included funding from Lockheed Martin’s venture arm, and VXI Capital, a new defense-focused fund led by the former CTO of the U.S. military’s Defense Innovation Unit.

Lidar isn’t completely dead in the auto industry, however. Rivian in December said it would integrate a roof-mounted lidar sensor (from an unnamed supplier) in its upcoming R2 SUV, signaling that there is still an appetite for using advanced sensor technology to bring autonomy to passenger vehicles, especially if it’s affordable.

Teradar CEO Matt Carey told TechCrunch in November that he believes his terahertz sensor can meet all those marks, and sounded eager to pounce on the opportunity.

“Our main job is to make sure our sensor gets on all automobiles, and whatever the best way to do that is, that’s what we’re going to pursue,” he said.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/2026/01/the-way-to-colonos-kay-cicellis-sophocles-book-review/685414/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When I was 8 or 9 years old, my uncle and aunt gave me a copy of D’Aulaires’ Book of Greek Myths, a standard-bearer for children’s folklore that was originally published in 1962. I was immediately dazzled by the book: D’Aulaires’ was my first exposure to Greek mythology, and I marveled at its vibrant cosmology, its richly illustrated tales of deities whose omnipotence was matched only by their strikingly human, self-indulgent caprice.

Over the years, I committed to memory the elaborate organizing logic of Greek antiquity. The immortal residents of Mount Olympus—philandering Zeus and his cascading (sometimes circular) family tree—governed every aspect of human existence. I was daunted by such a deterministic universe, in which the free will of mortals counted for so little. Yet I was compelled, even comforted, by the coherence of this worldview, in which one’s life was entirely foretold.

The Greek writer Kay Cicellis, who died in 2001, might have shuddered at such a sunny view of fate. One year before Ingri and Edgar Parin D’Aulaire published their compendium of Greek myths, Cicellis released her second work of fiction, The Way to Colonos, which ruthlessly dramatizes the limits of individual freedom and the agony of facing one’s powerlessness. The book has recently been reissued at what feels like a propitious moment, when modern treatments of Greek myth proliferate, many of them adapting stories about destiny and order for a chaotic and individualistic time.

Cicellis’s book consists of three stories that parallel Sophoclean tragedies—“The Way to Colonos” (Oedipus at Colonos), “The Return” (Electra), and “The Exile” (Philoctetes). In an author’s note, Cicellis calls any connection to the Greek playwright’s work a “coincidence”: She was inspired by the original myths, rather than the plays based on them. Each of Cicellis’s retellings transforms its myth into a short story set in mid-20th-century Greece, juxtaposing an ancient sense of fate against the messy uncertainty of modernity. In The Way to Colonos, the horror that emerges is more suppressed and internal than in the ancient texts. The violence is psychological and rarely fatal, in marked contrast to that in Sophocles’s work (in other words, nobody gouges out their eyes after having mistakenly slept with their own mother). And unlike Sophocles’s plays, in which the deities are persistently invoked, Cicellis’s universe is spiritually arid. Her discontented characters seem to wander beneath an empty firmament.

But make no mistake: This is not a world of freedom and abandon. Each of Cicellis’s young protagonists arrives at the grim realization that their life is circumscribed not by a god but by the pull of obligation to an undeserving parent or mentor. In these stories, Cicellis presents fate as the imposition of familial or vocational inheritance, rather than the decree of a higher power. It is something silently assumed, perhaps even chosen—if only because no other choice seems possible.

Read: Don’t judge I’m Glad My Mom Died by its title

In the first story, “The Way to Colonos,” Antigone and her infirm, recently widowed father sail to the titular island, an isolated and inhospitable place, to make a new home. Antigone views their relocation as a dual exile: Both of them have committed “evil” acts, “indigestible as stone.” Antigone had an affair with a married man. Her father, after quarreling with Antigone’s mother, locked her out of their house overnight, which led to a terrible accident. Antigone hopes that on the island, her father will join her in “complete despair,” a mental state characterized less by remorse than by self-abasing catatonia. For Antigone is a merciless judge; she regards both her father and herself as unworthy of rehabilitation, or even the oblivion of death.

“The Return” foregrounds another relationship between parent and daughter, though this one is much more tempestuous. Eugenia (a version of Electra) lives in a filthy house with her lazy, corrupt mother, Madame Nini, and Madame Nini’s lover. The home is always swarming with visitors, many of them young women. Eugenia wonders bitterly if Madame Nini and her lover are running a brothel, or perhaps an underground abortion network.

As disgusted as she is by her mother, Eugenia is equally obsessed with her. She skulks around the house, scheming for opportunities to pick a fight. She writes constantly to her younger brother, Orestes, begging him to return from school and reestablish domestic order. When he does come home, he is repulsed by the squalor of his mother’s house and by the violent antagonism between Madame Nini and Eugenia. He presses Eugenia to leave with him.

Eugenia has other ideas. “Orestes! Kill her!” she demands, in response to his proposal. But unlike his Sophoclean namesake, Orestes is bewildered by this escalation and refuses. Ultimately, Eugenia binds herself to Madame Nini, “like a seaman on deck who has cut off the moorings of his ship and abandoned himself to his element.” In Sophocles’s play, the final acts of violence provide a kind of catharsis. By contrast, Eugenia condemns herself to a future of festering tension and fury.

Cicellis’s third revised myth, “The Exile,” foregrounds a nonfamilial intergenerational bond. Stamos, 19, is a version of Neoptolemus, son of the warrior Achilles. He serves as a squire of sorts to Greek guerrilla soldiers who, after the Second World War, operated as Communist resistance forces in the mountains. At the start of the story, he has traveled to an obscure island in order to convince Rigas, an exiled former commander, to return to the ranks. Stamos quickly romanticizes the soldier’s isolation—his freedom from social expectations—and begins to dream of defecting. Rigas actually detests his remote existence, but he adopts the persona of a rugged maestro who lives off the land. Eventually, he is forced to drop the charade. “You offered me a role. I took it,” Rigas explains to Stamos. “You gave me something to be. What did you expect?”

Unlike with Antigone and Eugenia, whose perceptions of their respective parents curdled long ago, the reader watches Stamos experience disillusionment. Reverence for one’s elders, Cicellis implies, is a dangerous kind of fan fiction. Nonetheless, Stamos’s disappointment does not prompt him to sever ties with the guerrillas, and he follows them back to the harbor, just as both Antigone and Eugenia adhere to their wretched parents.

Rachel Cusk, who wrote the foreword to the new edition of Cicellis’s trilogy, argues that the author’s “young protagonists claim as a freedom the right to hate or disapprove of the adults who hold so-called authority over them, when the forces of tragedy and fate have decreed that no such freedom exists.” In my view, this reading gives the characters more agency than they seem to think they have. Cicellis’s young characters may despise the elders in their orbits, because even a universe governed by fate does not dictate human emotion. But that is not freedom: They are otherwise impotent, incapable of emancipating themselves from the adults who have harmed or disappointed them.

Read: Kaos offers a sharp twist on a familiar story

There is something dreadful in the resignation depicted at each story’s denouement—in the cool viciousness of Antigone’s sense of justice, and in Eugenia’s realization that while her mother lives, she must be at her side. The brutality of “The Exile” manifests in its portrayal of enlightenment rendered powerless: Stamos learns that Rigas isn’t who he thought he was, and yet he does not reject him. If these adaptations retain the solemnity of a Greek myth, it is less because of their source material than because their young characters come to understand their lives as roles they are bound to enact. Tragedy, in The Way to Colonos, emerges from its protagonists’ obliterating desire to follow the story that is most legible to them, in which they are most legible to themselves.

Cicellis understands what I was too young to realize in my earliest encounters with Greek mythology: that our fascination with these stories is fundamentally existential. What, in one’s life, is inevitable? What traits, decisions, or misfortunes exceed a person’s jurisdiction? These are enduring human quandaries.  The abundance of contemporary retellings and revisions, from Kay Cicellis’s trilogy to Emily Wilson’s 2017 retranslation of The Odyssey to Madeline Miller’s 2018 novel, Circe, expose an ongoing fascination with the tension between fate and control. In a modern world where free will is taken as a given, fate might be best understood as the tangle of powers that facilitate or obstruct individual wills. Perhaps it is our intuitive recognition of this dynamic—one not between gods and mortals, but between the free and the vulnerable—that brings us back to this ancient folklore, century after century.

            <h2>Trump’s ‘American Dominance’ May Leave Us With Nothing</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/trumps-american-dominance-may-leave-us-with-nothing/685503/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In George Orwell’s dystopian novel 1984, the world is divided into three spheres of influence: Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia, all perpetually at war. Sometimes two of the states form an alliance against the third. Sometimes they abruptly switch sides. No reasons are given. Instead, the Party tells the proles, “We have always been at war with Eastasia.” Newspapers and history books are quickly rewritten to make that seem true.

Orwell’s world is fiction, but some want it to become reality. Since well before President Donald Trump’s second term, the idea that the world should have three spheres of influence—an Asia dominated by China, a Europe dominated by Russia, and a Western Hemisphere dominated by the United States—has been kicking around the internet in a desultory way, mostly promoted by Russians who want to control what they call their “near abroad,” or perhaps just want their country, with its weak economy and faltering army, to be mentioned in the same breath as the United States and China.

Back in 2019, Fiona Hill, a National Security Council official in the first Trump administration, testified to a House committee that Russians pushing the creation of spheres of influence had been offering to somehow “swap” Venezuela, their closest ally in Latin America, for Ukraine. Since then, the notion that international relations should promote great-power dominance, not universal values or networks of allies, has spread from Moscow to Washington. The administration’s new National Security Strategy outlines a plan to dominate the Americas, enigmatically describing U.S. policy in the Western Hemisphere as “Enlist and Expand,” and downplaying threats from China and Russia. Trump has also issued threats to Denmark, Panama, and Canada, all allies whose sovereignty we now challenge.

Anne Applebaum: The longest suicide note in American history

In some ways, the military raid that took the Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro into custody does resemble past American actions, especially the ouster of the Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega in 1989–90. But the use of this new language to explain and justify the Venezuelan raid makes this story very different. At his press conference on Saturday, Trump did not use the word democracy. He did not refer to international law. Instead, he presented a garbled version of the 1823 Monroe Doctrine, a policy originally designed to keep foreign imperial powers out of the Americas, calling it something that sounded like the “Donroe Document”: “Under our new National Security Strategy,” he said, reading from prepared remarks, “American dominance in the Western Hemisphere will never be questioned again.”

Toward this end, he said the United States would “run” Venezuela, although he didn’t say who would actually be in charge. Viceroy Marco Rubio? Governor-General Pete Hegseth? Asked about María Corina Machado, the leader of the Venezuelan opposition, Trump was dismissive. “She’s a very nice woman, but she doesn’t have the respect within the country,” he said.

Machado, who won the Nobel Peace Prize last year, leads a movement whose presidential candidate, Edmundo González Urrutia, received two-thirds of the vote in the 2024 election. Although the state-controlled media backed Maduro, and although Maduro’s police and paramilitaries harassed, arrested, and murdered their supporters, Machado and González not only won; they collected documentation from polling stations proving that they had won. Maduro never produced any such proof. He declared victory anyway.

For the moment, Trump isn’t interested in identifying the legitimate leader of Venezuela. The administration is instead hinting that the U.S. might work with Maduro’s vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, who would presumably keep Maduro’s regime intact—not regime change, in other words, just dictator change. But Trump isn’t trying very hard to provide legitimacy for his own actions either. Before kidnapping Maduro, he did not consult with Congress, U.S. allies, or Venezuela’s neighbors, many of whom might have wanted to contribute to a solution. Although his administration has described this action as a criminal arrest, and has justified it with an indictment for drug smuggling, this isn’t part of any consistent policy. Trump just pardoned the former president of Honduras, who was legitimately indicted on drug charges six years ago.

Read: Making sense of the Venezuela attack

None of this is logical, but it isn’t meant to be: Like the Party in 1984, the would-be dominators of the Western Hemisphere seem to feel no need for logic. If might makes right, if the U.S. gets to do what it wants using any tools it wants in its own sphere, then there is no need for transparency, democracy, or legitimacy. The concerns of ordinary people who live in smaller nations don’t need to be taken into account, because they will not be granted any agency. Their interests are not the concern of the imperial companies that want their mineral resources, or the imperial leaders who need the propaganda of conquest to keep power at home.

Russia’s and China’s responses to Trump’s actions this weekend have been surprisingly soft, given their billions of dollars of investments in Venezuela. Perhaps this is because the language Trump is using to justify the kidnapping of Maduro echoes some of their own narratives. Ukraine belongs to Russia’s sphere is Vladimir Putin’s main argument, after all. Taiwan is part of China’s sphere will be Xi Jinping’s justification if he decides to invade the island. That doesn’t mean that Moscow is really in a position to control Europe, or China to control Asia: The European Union’s combined GDP is nearly 10 times the size of Russia’s, and there aren’t any countries crying out to become Chinese colonies either.

For all of Trump’s bluster, neither are Americans exactly in control of our sphere of influence. Two days after the capture of Maduro, Trump already risks falling victim to his own propaganda, just like Putin. Venezuela, as one former U.S. ambassador to the country recently wrote, is “a failed state riddled with illegal armed groups and foreign terrorist organizations.” The regime has not been removed. The military and various paramilitaries are all still in place, and although some might cooperate with the Trump administration, others might not. With no U.S. troops in Venezuela, will Americans “run” Venezuela by issuing loud statements and threats? By ordering periodic military interventions? Perhaps the administration has made a deal with some members of the regime—that would explain why the American raid met so little opposition—but there is no guarantee that such a deal will produce the kinds of benefits Trump expects. Oil isn’t something that lies around on the ground to be picked up and taken home. It requires long-term investments, relationships, contracts. If the government of Venezuela is likely to fall or change at any moment, none of those will materialize.

But Trump’s error is even more fundamental. The division of the world into spheres of influence implies that smaller countries cannot influence events, and it’s a grave mistake to imagine Venezuelans won’t try. Many of them wanted an American intervention, are overjoyed that Maduro is gone, and no wonder: He and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, together turned the richest country in South America into the poorest, fortifying their ugly security state with guns and surveillance systems purchased from autocracies around the world.

But now that Maduro is gone, the people who fought for years for justice, freedom, and self-determination aren’t going to want to live in a Trump-backed dictatorship staffed with Maduro’s cronies. One Venezuelan exile, who requested anonymity because of risks to his family, told me that on Saturday, he felt like he was on a roller coaster. First the elation of Maduro’s exit, then the shock of Trump’s press conference, then the angry realization that maybe nothing has changed and he still can’t go home.

I don’t think Americans will be any happier if another authoritarian is installed in Venezuela either. Most Americans still do want their country to stand for something other than greed, and most don’t want their expensive military to fight on behalf of Trump’s oil-industry donors. Trump’s pursuit of an illusory sphere of influence is unlikely to bring us peace or prosperity—any more than the invasion of Ukraine brought peace and prosperity to Russians—and this might become clear sooner than anyone expects.

If America is just a regional bully, after all, then our former allies in Europe and Asia will close their doors and their markets to us. Sooner or later, “our” Western Hemisphere will organize against us and fight back. Far from making us more powerful, the pursuit of American dominance will make us weaker, eventually leaving us with no sphere, and no influence, at all.</div>

            <h2>The Fuck-Around-and-Find-Out Presidency</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/01/trump-monroe-doctrine-venezuela/685502/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In Marco Rubio’s telling, the stunning events in Venezuela on Saturday illustrate an essential truth—possibly the essential truth—about Donald Trump’s presidency: Global leaders cross him at their peril. “I don’t understand yet how they haven’t figured this out,” Trump’s secretary of state told reporters at Mar-a-Lago just hours after the capture of Nicolás Maduro.

World leaders could be forgiven for not understanding the simplicity of the Trump Doctrine, especially those who assume that the world’s dominant superpower still possesses complicated mechanisms for the manufacture of foreign-policy strategies. The country that gave the world the Truman Doctrine and the Reagan Doctrine as well as Trump’s apparent favorite, the Monroe Doctrine, now embraces the plainest and most ostentatiously bellicose of national-security policies: Fuck around and find out. Trump’s own Pentagon chief, the self-styled (until Congress approves the title change) secretary of war, Pete Hegseth, said as much when he told the nation that Maduro “effed around, and he found out.”

If the Fuck Around and Find Out Doctrine doesn’t sound like a concept for a stable and predictable foreign policy—one purpose of Washington’s doctrine-articulation complex—then maybe you can sympathize with those who Rubio says are still struggling to get it. Some experts reject the idea that something this crude even earns the right to be called a doctrine. As John Bolton, currently a Trump nemesis but once one of his first-term national-security advisers, told us, “There is no Trump Doctrine: No matter what he does, there is no grand conceptual framework; it’s whatever suits him at the moment.” Kori Schake, the director of foreign- and defense-policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, cautioned us that “we shouldn’t ennoble Trump policy by saying there’s a doctrine.”

In the early decades of the 20th century, “America First” was in part a euphemism for U.S. isolation from the ravages of war in Europe. Trump then revived the term, starting in 2016, when he promised to end America’s long post-9/11 conflicts, which cost taxpayers trillions and failed to deliver clear victories. Instead, he would prioritize domestic issues and the well-being of Americans. Yet there he was on Saturday at Mar-a-Lago, vowing to “run Venezuela for the foreseeable future.” And if that involves a bit of nation building and American boots on the ground, well, so be it. Trump, it turns out, seems to believe that a little foreign adventurism is just fine, as long as he’s the one doing the adventuring. It was a departure from his previous instinct to limit his foreign interventions to short, kinetic bursts of force—an unofficial one-and-done doctrine—visible in his first-term strike on the Iranian military leader Qassem Soleimani and his more recent decision to dispatch U.S. bombers deep into Iran.

“Rebuilding is not a bad thing, in Venezuela’s case; the country has gone to hell,” Trump told our colleague Michael Scherer in an interview yesterday. But when asked why similar actions in Iraq were an abomination, the president punted. “That was Bush,” Trump said. “You’ll have to ask Bush that question, because we should have never gone into Iraq. That started the Middle East disaster.” (In a separate Atlantic interview last year, Trump said that “America First” is whatever he says it is: “Considering that the term wasn’t used until I came along, I think I’m the one that decides that.”)

The White House quickly embraced the newly articulated doctrine, circulating after Saturday’s Mar-a-Lago press conference an image of a determined-looking Trump striding up steps, with the caption—you guessed it—“FAFO.” Another administration publicity push featured Rubio’s warning to foreign nations to not “play games with President Trump,” a politer version of the same idea. “The 47th president of the United States is not a game player,” Rubio said at Mar-a-Lago. “If you don’t know, now you know.” (It’s unclear if Rubio—a self-professed rap fan—was deliberately quoting the Notorious B.I.G., but the White House later posted a video set to the Biggie song.)

It should come as no surprise that Hegseth, with his penchant for scrapping on social media and dressing down generals for being fat, is practically tripping over himself to make FAFO happen. Asked Saturday about where the FAFO policy has applied, Hegseth cited Iran’s nuclear program, Houthi rebels in Yemen, and the southern U.S. border. “There’s been a lot of politicians that want to talk. They want to talk peace. They want to talk diplomacy. They want to talk negotiations. They want to talk globalism and international organizations,” he told CBS News. “President Trump speaks through action.”

So far, Trump appears most willing to take a FAFO approach to the Western Hemisphere. One person close to Trump told us that the president has embraced a different set of criteria for responding to what he sees as irritants in the Americas—such as Maduro—than for those farther afield. “If this were happening in a different part of the globe, none of this would have taken place,” this person said on the condition of anonymity in order to speak candidly. In other words, Trump views many parts of this hemisphere as a rightful extension of his U.S. sandbox, where he is free to snatch and grab what he pleases. (That glistening Venezuelan oil? The Panama Canal? Mine! That tantalizing slice of Greenland? Also mine!)

Trump told Scherer that Greenland had not been on his mind when he’d been ousting Maduro—but he then proceeded to offer real-time foreign-policy musings on that very topic, in one of his characteristic verbal weaves. “You know, I wasn’t referring to Greenland at that time, but we do need Greenland, absolutely,” Trump said. “And we need it for defense. You know, it’s surrounded by Russian and Chinese ships. We need Greenland.” (Katie Miller, the wife of the top Trump adviser Stephen Miller, posted an image on social media on Saturday of Greenland covered by an American flag, with the caption: “SOON.” And Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, urged Washington yesterday to end its threats, which she said make “absolutely no sense.”)

Kevin Whitaker, who served as U.S. ambassador to Colombia during the Obama and first Trump administrations, told us that the president’s “or else” approach to Venezuela is visible in Trump’s second-term blueprint for global statecraft. The idea behind Trump’s new National Security Strategy, Whitaker said, is that “we’re the hegemon in this hemisphere, and we can do whatever we want, including actions that are of questionable legitimacy.” The manifesto even cites a “Trump corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine, the early-19th-century policy that sought to block European colonial activity in the Americas.

Like his predecessors, however, the U.S. president isn’t just seeking to fend off transatlantic imperialists; he is also laying claim to the hemisphere’s strategic sites and resources. The Maduro ouster is a manifestation of Trump and his senior officials’ belief that powerful countries have the right to dominate their surrounding continents and oceans, an idea uncomfortably close to China’s hegemonic claim to the western Pacific and Russia’s imperial designs on Ukraine and other nations of the former Soviet Union. And U.S. actions, in turn, are designed to signal to those rival powers to stay away. One U.S. official told us that he believes that Russian President Vladimir Putin has been “scared shitless” by the U.S. grabbing Maduro because he knows “not to fuck with the U.S. military.”

Trump, at the Mar-a-Lago press conference on Saturday, blamed past presidents for fighting far-off wars while allowing leftist regimes in America’s vicinity to fester. He alleged that Venezuela has committed a host of offenses, including sending criminals to the United States en masse, running drugs, and stealing American oil. “All of these actions were in gross violation of the core principles of American foreign policy dating back more than two centuries—not anymore,” Trump said. “The Monroe Doctrine is a big deal, but we’ve superseded it by a lot, by a real lot.”

Many Venezuelans, both at home and in the U.S., welcomed Maduro’s ouster after more than a decade of economic mismanagement, corruption, and repression. Trump said at Mar-a-Lago that a group of senior officials, including Rubio and Hegseth, would be part of a group that would “run” Venezuela. But that’s about as far as the planning appears to have gone. On NBC News’s Meet the Press yesterday, when asked whether he and other senior officials were indeed running Venezuela, Rubio responded that U.S. officials were just “running policy” there. He also depicted the capture of Maduro as a law-enforcement operation to apprehend the president and his wife because they face charges in U.S. court. “We are not going to be able to allow in our hemisphere a country that becomes a crossroads for the activities of all of our adversaries around the world,” he said.

Trump told reporters on Air Force One yesterday evening, “This isn’t a country, like, we have to travel 24 hours in an airplane. This is Venezuela. This is our area: the Don-roe Doctrine.” He also managed, in just 37 minutes, to threaten or hint at military action against Colombia, Cuba, Greenland, Iran, Mexico, and Venezuela (again).

Even before he extracted Maduro, Trump was employing the instruments of U.S. power in new, radical, and contradictory ways across the Americas. His administration has threatened to strike cartels in Mexico over its government’s objections, pardoned a former Honduran president convicted in the U.S. on drug-trafficking offenses, and offered a $20 billion line of credit to Argentina.

“There’s example after example of where they treat the Americas differently than they treat involvement elsewhere,” Ricardo Zuniga, who served as a senior official for Latin America during the Biden administration, told us. “They have a very 19th-century view of the world, and they’re proud of that.” The United States’ historic penchant for heavy-handed involvement in Latin America has often had a perversely counterproductive effect, from Nicaragua and Cuba in the early 1900s to Chile in the 1970s: It has given rise to generations of nationalist leaders who railed against Yankee imperialism.

There may be other limits on the FAFO doctrine. The person close to Trump said that the president still has no appetite for a prolonged occupation of a foreign nation. But he is more than willing to use the threat of such action as leverage over the country’s interim leaders. In Venezuela, that is Maduro’s second-in-command, Delcy Rodríguez, who was sworn in as interim president on Saturday. Trump has made clear that there is an “or else” hanging over her head: a second wave of military action should she not comply with U.S. demands. “If she doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro,” Trump told Scherer yesterday.

It is all, this person said, part of the plan. “Most presidents would not go out and say, ‘I’m not afraid to put boots on the ground,’ because their base would go, ‘Wait a minute,’” the person told us. “But Trump is willing to be misunderstood in the short term to get what he wants.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As bombs landed on Caracas early Saturday morning, friends and family members told me that their houses seemed to shake. The city is in a valley, so nearly every building has a view—on this January morning, of fires dotting the hills and little, loud aircraft flying in all directions, like a mosquito swarm on a hot night.

Venezuelans have been through a lot in recent decades: the rise of Hugo Chávez, a ruinous revolution that turned democracy into dictatorship, an economic crisis that became a humanitarian one, the emigration of more than one in four inhabitants. Many people are by now familiar with the smell of tear gas and the sound of gunshots. But the sensory experience of bombs falling from the sky was for the most part novel. The Trump administration hit military bases mainly in or near Caracas; at least seven explosions killed dozens of people.

Many Venezuelans welcomed the strikes. Before Saturday, polls showed that a majority of Venezuelans both inside and outside the country favored U.S. military intervention. María Corina Machado, the leader of the opposition movement, issued a statement following the American operation: “Venezuelans, the hour of freedom has arrived!” she said, adding, “Let’s remain vigilant, active, and organized, until the Democratic Transition is fulfilled.”

The simplest reason for celebration is that Nicolás Maduro is out. The dictator who imprisoned and tortured Venezuelan politicians, activists, and ordinary people was snatched from his bed and put on an American plane with his wife, Cilia Flores. Photos of him under arrest have already brought catharsis to millions. But there are reasons to be wary too. The dubious legality and shifting rationales behind Donald Trump’s actions raise questions about the administration’s intentions. The New York Times reported last month that some officials have sought a pretext to invoke emergency powers to deport Venezuelans from the United States. And Trump has given no indication of caring about the legitimacy of the regime that will follow Maduro’s.

Machado appears unbothered by these concerns. She has long been close to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and their friendship may well have influenced the administration’s Venezuela policy. Months before the first Caribbean strike—and before the administration singled out Venezuela as a drug threat—Machado told me that she hoped to see a “big anti-narcotics operation in the Caribbean.” In the spring, she hosted a press conference where she framed the fall of Maduro as “A Trillion-Dollar Opportunity” for American investors. She said that post-Maduro Venezuela would welcome American oil companies—an invitation that Trump officials appear to be seizing on. When she won the Nobel Peace Prize in October, she dedicated her award to Trump.

The Trump administration has done exactly what Machado asked of it, but Trump spoke of her dismissively in his press conference on Saturday. It’s not clear whether she will have much of a role in shaping Venezuela’s future. “She is a very nice woman, but she doesn’t have respect within the country,” Trump told a reporter, without so much as naming her. Instead, power will be shared between the American government and Maduro’s vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, at least for the time being. Machado seems to have lost control of the operation she helped set in motion.

Venezuela’s opposition wasn’t always so sanguine about foreign military intervention. Its leaders and activists have tried and failed to bring down the dictatorship by many other means in the nearly 13 years since Maduro succeeded the far more charismatic Chávez as Venezuela’s strongman. Protests erupted across the country in 2014 and again in 2017; Maduro sent tanks into the streets, arrested dissidents, and waited for the heat to subside. In 2019, opposition leaders persuaded the first Trump administration to recognize the politician Juan Guaidó as Venezuela’s legitimate leader. Dozens of countries followed suit. Maduro ramped up repression and did what he does best—waited things out.

During the 2019 debacle, opposition leaders debated what exactly they wanted the United States to do if Maduro refused to relinquish power. Guaidó was himself ambivalent. “If the Americans would propose a military intervention, I would probably accept,” he told an Italian newspaper. Even then, Machado was more decisive. “I want to be very precise,” she told the BBC in 2019. “Maduro will only leave power when he’s faced with a credible, imminent, and severe threat of the use of force.”

Leopoldo López, an opposition leader who spent many years in prison and is now in exile, told me in 2024 that he and Machado were always seen as “more radical” than others in the movement. At a time when some activists worried that calling Venezuelans to demonstrate would only put them at risk, López and Machado favored mass protests.

Machado ran for president against Maduro in 2024, after securing more than 90 percent of the vote in the opposition primary. Maduro barred her candidacy, perhaps calculating that no substitute would accrue the same gravitas. In fact, the substitute Machado chose, Edmundo González, beat Maduro 2–1. And Machado had the tally sheets to prove it, because she’d coordinated volunteer election watchers all over the country. International bodies certified Machado’s counts. World leaders applauded her remarkable victory. Still, Maduro hung on to power.

The electoral fraud left the opposition dejected. “Everything that I always dreamt would happen happened,” Roberto Patiño, an opposition activist, told me in the fall. “We won; presidents backed us; Maduro was offered an exit path. I really thought, This has to work!”

“Maduro is a cockroach,” Ana Milagros Parra, a 28-year-old activist, told me. “He always survives.”

Parra fled Caracas for Bogotá after the election. Then two of her friends nearly died there in what Colombian authorities said might have been an assassination attempt ordered by Caracas, and she fled Bogotá for Buenos Aires. Now she’s a social-media influencer. She told me that she doesn’t like Trump and thought that his justifications for striking boats were bogus, because Venezuela is not a major player in drug trafficking. But, she said, the opposition couldn’t “afford the luxury” of letting this opportunity slide.

I heard a similar line of argument from another opposition influencer, Germania Rodriguez, a freelance journalist. “Listen, what’s going on here is, beggars can’t be choosers,” Rodriguez told me. “And no one but Trump has taken an interest in our crisis.”

One could easily imagine that the fires around Caracas, and the belittling remarks of the U.S. president, would lead those who’d supported the strikes to reconsider their views. But that’s not what I’ve observed. Figures who have long backed the opposition are praising the attacks as a success.

“The operation against Nicolás Maduro is not just any military operation,” Ivan Duque, a former president of Colombia and a longtime friend of Machado’s, told me. “It is a humanitarian operation, because it was about freeing Venezuela from a satrap, a tyrant, a dictator.”

Duque had watched the press conference in which Trump dismissed Machado, but he wasn’t too worried. After all, it was a spontaneous comment, possibly off-script. Duque expressed confidence that Trump was ultimately a “democrat” despite what others might claim about his authoritarian inclinations: “In politics, there are different styles,” he said. “But beyond style, what matters to me are results.”

Genesis Davila, a Venezuelan human-rights lawyer based in Washington, D.C., told me that she had “no reservations” about the way the strikes were carried out. As the founder of a nonprofit called Defiende Venezuela, Davila has worked to hold Maduro accountable under international law. For years, she has documented extrajudicial killings, persecutions, arbitrary detentions, and torture. “What mechanisms were international law and the human-rights system offering to stop Maduro?” she said. “More reports? More condemnations?”

Not even people on Machado’s team seem to have been discouraged by Trump’s contemptuous remarks. “María Corina Machado’s force is not something that emanates from Trump’s finger,” Milos Alcalay, a career diplomat who advises Machado on international politics, told me; it comes “from the support that Venezuelans have given to her.” Trump’s claim that the United States would “run” Venezuela was “absurd,” Alcalay conceded. But he suggested that the president couldn’t possibly have meant it, that he was just exerting pressure.

I asked him this: What if Trump has just claimed Maduro as a trophy, and nothing else changes in Venezuela?

“I’ve thought about it,” Alcalay said. “But I don’t think that’ll be the case.”

For the moment, however, regime change is far from guaranteed. Political prisoners remain imprisoned. Maduro’s vice president is now interim president and seems keen on preserving the status quo: “In Venezuela, there is only one president,” she said on Saturday in a televised address. “His name is Nicolás Maduro.” Diosdado Cabello and Vladimir Padrino, two of Maduro’s most important ministers, have made a point of speaking publicly many times over the weekend.

Maduro is now at the Metropolitan Detention Center in New York City. His first court appearance could come as soon as today, on counts of “narco-terrorism conspiracy,” “cocaine importation conspiracy,” and weapons offenses—charges that are at once extremely serious and grossly mismatched to the enormity of his record.

Venezuela’s opposition, meanwhile, remains in limbo. Will it pay a price for courting a war based on lies? Right now, those I’ve contacted are ebullient, and the movement seems united in the faith that whatever comes next for Venezuela cannot be as bad as what it has endured under Maduro.</div>

            <h2>A Horseshoe Theory of Trump</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-05</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After the inauguration of Andrew Jackson, in 1829, thousands of his supporters poured into the White House to celebrate. The crowd overwhelmed the staff and trashed some of the furniture before the party was relocated to the White House lawn. The episode earned Jackson the nickname “King Mob” and became a symbol of his man-of-the-people persona.

Donald Trump is often compared to Jackson, but the events he has hosted since his second inauguration carry a different sort of symbolism. In May, he held a dinner at one of his golf courses for the 220 people who had spent the most money—$148 million, collectively—to buy his $TRUMP crypto meme coin. In October, he hosted a White House dinner for the rich individuals and corporate executives who had donated to his White House–ballroom project.

For the past decade, Trump has supposedly been on the verge of breaking from the laissez-faire economics of the Reagan GOP—otherwise known as neoliberalism—in favor of pro-worker populism. And in some ways, he really has succeeded in casting out the ghosts of Reaganomics by embracing hands-on market interventions. The New York Times business reporter Andrew Ross Sorkin has called Trumponomics a form of “state-sponsored capitalism.” A recent essay by Scott Lincicome, the vice president of general economics at the libertarian Cato Institute, calls 2025 “the year America went (kinda) socialist,” and describes Trump’s approach as “state corporatism.”

What these accounts leave out is the fact that Trump has simultaneously steered economic policy in an even more pro-business direction than his Republican predecessors, including his own first-term administration. When they aren’t personally being shaken down by the president, corporations and billionaires are being left to do as they please in pursuit of profit. Greed has never been this good.

Derek Thompson: The era of step-on-a-rake capitalism

The result is a strange contradiction that the term socialism doesn’t begin to capture. Trump’s economic management combines two theoretically incompatible tendencies. It is at once libertarian, because the state is doing less to protect consumers and workers, and authoritarian, because the government sometimes lawlessly interrupts the workings of the free market in service of the personal and ideological interests of Trump and his allies. This makes MAGA economics a seemingly impossible hybrid: libertarian authoritarianism.

One might have expected Trump’s first term to have put to rest any dreams of a pro-worker GOP policy revolution. With rare exceptions, his economic agenda catered to the super-wealthy, corporate America, and anti-government activists. He passed an enormous tax cut that disproportionately favored corporations and rich individuals. His National Labor Relations Board took positions favored by employers, narrowed workers’ ability to organize, and rolled back a rule expanding eligibility for overtime pay.

Some supporters still insisted that Trump had the common man’s interests at heart. They had an explanation for the disappointments of his first term: Trump had been surrounded by traditional Republican staffers who carried water for Big Business and sabotaged any effort to break from neoliberalism. The likes of Steve Mnuchin weren’t true MAGA. Once Trump had a team of loyal soldiers around him, everything would be different. “We’re done catering to Wall Street,” J. D. Vance declared at the 2024 Republican National Convention.

We now have a year’s worth of data by which to judge the accuracy of such predictions. No one can deny that Trump is doing what he wants, and what he wants is slashing clean-air regulations, rolling back consumer protections (such as a rule requiring airlines to compensate passengers for canceled flights), shutting down the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, extending corporate tax cuts, attempting to ban state-level AI regulation, pardoning financial scammers, letting the crypto industry run wild (while Trump himself gets in on the action), allowing betting companies to brazenly flout state-level gambling bans, and so on. The NLRB as of this writing doesn’t even have a single member. Trump’s treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, recently argued on cable news that the regulations imposed on the banking sector after the 2008 financial crisis were too strict and must be rolled back. Stacks of earnest pro-worker policy proposals from “New Right” think tanks sit untouched.

What makes things confusing is that Trump is breaking from neoliberalism in many ways—they just have very little to do with economic policy per se, and much more to do with increasing Trump’s personal power. Antitrust is one domain where progressive Democrats and MAGA diehards have found common ground. But under Trump 2.0, enforcement is down (libertarianism) even as the administration seems to steer corporate consolidation in Trump’s favor (authoritarianism). The Federal Communications Commission, for example, didn’t approve Skydance’s acquisition of Paramount until after CBS News, a Paramount subsidiary, agreed to pay $16 million to Trump’s presidential-library fund to settle a personal lawsuit filed by the president. Skydance also committed in writing to various ideological reforms, including appointing an anti-bias ombudsman at the network. More recently, referring to Skydance’s effort to outbid Netflix to acquire Warner Bros., Trump told reporters, “I’ll be involved in that decision.”

Meanwhile, Trump’s Federal Trade Commission has abandoned its defense of a Biden-era rule banning employers from using noncompete clauses, a practice that research has shown suppresses worker wages. At the DOJ, two top antitrust officials were fired after protesting the department’s decision to allow Hewlett Packard Enterprise to acquire one of its biggest competitors. One of those officials, Roger Alford, later gave a speech in which he suggested that America was being governed not by the rule of law but by “the rule of lobbyists”—a nod to accusations that the deal had been pushed through because the parties had paid the right MAGA influencers to push for it.

Another post-neoliberal innovation by Trump 2.0 is the extraction of tribute payments from corporations with business before the government. Trump has required companies including Intel, U.S. Steel, and Nvidia to give the federal government various degrees of ownership stakes in their business, and more such deals are expected. As Lincicome, the Cato vice president, points out, no one has offered any strategic rationale for doing so. “We should take stakes in companies when people need something,” Trump has said. If this is socialism, it is socialism without a proletariat, central planning without a plan.

Even Trump’s massive global tariffs have almost no logical connection to the major critiques of free trade—or, as far as anyone can tell, to any consistent policy objective at all beyond allowing Trump to alpha-dog America’s trading partners. Experts from across the political spectrum have argued that carefully targeted tariffs can bolster key domestic industries, particularly manufacturing, and protect the subset of workers whose jobs are most threatened by cheap imports. Trump instead chose to impose indiscriminate tariffs on almost every country on Earth, for almost every category of import. Economists warned that this approach would hurt domestic manufacturing by raising the price of raw materials. They appear to have been right: Employment in the manufacturing sector has trended down ever since “Liberation Day.”

The counterargument that Trump’s economic-populist defenders fall back on is that the president has kept his pledge to America’s common man where it matters most: immigration. They argue that illegal immigration suppresses wages and job opportunities for native-born workers. Trump’s crackdown is thus a huge blow struck in favor of the American working class, and against corporate overlords who prefer to have a steady supply of cheap labor.

As my colleague Rogé Karma explained last year, however, essentially the entire weight of empirical economic evidence suggests that this theory has never been true in practice. (Immigrants don’t just increase the labor supply; they also increase demand for labor, because they consume goods and services.) And indeed, according to the most recent federal jobs report, the unemployment rate rose from 4.0 percent in January to 4.6 percent in November—the highest jobless rate since September 2021—and was higher year-over-year for native-born workers specifically.

Even if the theory were correct, that wouldn’t explain Trump’s actual policies. Detaining a Turkish graduate student who criticizes Israel does not open up any jobs for native-born construction workers. Neither does shutting down citizenship proceedings for lawful immigrants from 19 countries or restricting the asylum program mostly to white South Africans. Trump’s immigration policies don’t make sense as a pro-worker agenda, but do make sense as a way of silencing dissent and keeping out nonwhite immigrants.

The idea that Trump’s immigration policy is designed to help the American worker would be easier to take seriously were he not simultaneously giving every possible concession to the industry most likely to cause mass job loss in the near future. In a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll, 71 percent of Americans said they worried about AI “putting too many people out of work permanently.” Yet the Trump administration, with its close ties to Silicon Valley centibillionaires, is assiduously removing any obstacles to the growth of the AI sector. After Congress failed to include a moratorium on state-level AI regulation in a spending bill, Trump issued an executive order directing the DOJ to sue states that dare to pass laws protecting their citizens from the technology.

Authoritarianism and libertarianism are commonly thought of as opposites—two poles on a political spectrum. It is a sign of Trump’s distinctive political genius that he has managed to combine the two concepts. By tearing down generally applicable restraints on corporate behavior while selectively exerting direct influence to reward his allies and punish his critics, he has managed to preserve all the flaws of the old Republican economic approach while introducing new ones that are even worse.</div>

            <h2>The College Backlash Is a Mirage</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/college-degree-value-enrollment/685384/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you were to judge by public-opinion polling, you might reasonably conclude that Americans have broadly given up on the idea of going to college. In 2013, 70 percent of adults surveyed by Pew said that a college education was “very important.” This year, only 35 percent did. Over the same time period, the share of Americans who believe that college is “not worth the cost” rose from 40 to 63 percent, according to NBC.

If you were to judge, instead, by the choices that Americans are actually making, you might draw a different conclusion. Despite the reported skepticism of higher education, enrollment in four-year colleges and universities is growing. These institutions awarded 2 million bachelor’s degrees in 2023, compared with 1.6 million in 2010, and the fraction of 25-year-olds with a bachelor’s degree has steadily increased for the past 15 years. Even as Americans tell pollsters that college isn’t worth it, their behavior suggests that they still recognize the value of a degree for themselves and their children. And they’re correct to do so.

For the overwhelming majority of graduates, the returns on going to college more than offset the cost of tuition. The college wage premium—the difference in earnings between people with only a high-school diploma and people with a four-year college degree—surged in the 1980s and ’90s and has remained close to those historic highs for the past two decades. One recent analysis found that the average person with a bachelor’s degree earns about 70 percent more than a high-school graduate with a similar amount of work experience. Researchers at the Cleveland Fed recently estimated that the college wage premium will stand at 76 percent in 2042. Even though plenty of young people struggle in the job market right after graduation, a college degree tends to unlock more lucrative career paths with greater long-term opportunities for advancement.

David Deming: The college backlash is going too far

And despite the proliferation of headlines about the skyrocketing cost of attending college, most American students are paying less in tuition than they were a decade ago. After factoring in financial aid, the cost of attending a public four-year college has fallen by more than 20 percent since 2015, even before adjusting for inflation. Prices at private universities have modestly increased over the same time period, but are down by 12 percent after adjusting for inflation. Even after accounting for student-debt payments, the average college graduate nets about $8,000 more a year than someone with only a high-school diploma.

The benefits of college aren’t confined to the richest students attending the most prestigious universities. A large body of research finds that college graduates whose standardized-test scores placed them on the margin of acceptance to a public university in their state outearn their counterparts who attend community college or enter the workforce after high school. “Across the entire parental-income distribution, we think the benefit very substantially outweighs the cost,” Zach Bleemer, a Princeton University economics professor, told me. “College is very clearly worth it for almost everyone who is currently going to college and for people who are on the margin of going to college.”

So why do people insist, against the evidence, that college isn’t worth the cost? One possibility has to do with the counterintuitive way that college is priced. The sticker price of attending college—the tuition figure that colleges post online—has increased astronomically over the past two decades. But because of financial aid, only the wealthiest families, less than 20 percent of all college-goers, actually pay it. Everyone else’s tuition is essentially subsidized by those rich families. Unfortunately, polls suggest that Americans don’t know that. A recent survey by the Association of American Universities found that almost half of U.S. adults think that everyone pays the same price for college. Perhaps these people think that college isn’t worth the cost in general, but end up sending their kids because they believe themselves to have gotten an unusually good deal.

Kevin Carey: The myth of the unemployed college grad

Another factor is politics. Donald Trump has waged war against elite universities. His vice president, J. D. Vance, has argued that “professors are the enemy.” The result of such provocations has been to negatively polarize the Republican base against the idea of higher education. Across surveys, Republicans report cratering confidence in the value of a degree. Given the fact that enrollment keeps growing, such statements might be more a form of partisan signaling than literal cost-benefit analysis.

For some people, of course, going to college doesn’t end up making financial sense. Some students take more than four years to graduate, or don’t earn a degree at all; both scenarios substantially eat into the value of attending college. Some majors, generally those closely associated with a low-paying career, such as fine arts, tend to have a negative return on investment. Lower-income students are more likely to major in these fields, instead of pursuing more lucrative disciplines such as economics and computer science. And many for-profit colleges, in particular, cost students more than they benefit them. “There are some people it isn’t worth it for,” Jeff Strohl, the director of the Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce, told me. “Averages miss the human experience.”

If the skepticism around the value of a college degree leads people to make more calculated decisions about what school to attend and what subject to major in, that could be a good thing. As Preston Cooper, a higher-education policy researcher at the American Enterprise Institute, told me, the best question is not whether college is worth it, but under what circumstances. So far, the popular narrative doesn’t seem to have dented enrollment. How long that cognitive dissonance can endure is anyone’s guess. “Oftentimes, people say that not everybody should go to college, and that these two-year programs, these trade schools, are really good,” Strohl said. “Ask them where they’re sending their kids.”</div>

It&#39;s called main thesis nowadays, you racist nazi.

All governments suffer a recurring problem: Power attracts pathological personalities. It is not that power corrupts but that it is magnetic to the corruptible.

Not all &quot;rich&quot; people got rich by cheating.

But when people who work hard all their lives, and achieve modest, barely-there success see people who skate and fake-it-&#39;til-they-make-it raking in dough hand over fist, and holding positions of power... ...it makes even the most saintly of law-abiding citizens bite their tongue and grin n&#39; bear it, instead of skinning the motherfuckers alive in the town square.

I hope this sentiment plays a large role in our next election.  Or our next civil war, whichever comes f

Adjacent to that is this article: https://www.nytimes.com/2026/0...  [nytimes.com]

The study found that the Supreme Court has become deeply polarized in cases pitting the rich against the poor, with Republican appointees far more likely than Democratic ones to side with the wealthy. That is starkly different from the middle of the last century, when appointees of the two parties were statistically indistinguishable on this measure.

&quot;Not all &quot;rich&quot; people got rich by cheating.&quot;

Because &quot;cheating&quot; is the wrong metric.  All &quot;rich&quot; people &quot;got rich&quot; by exploiting, or by inheriting wealth obtained through exploitation.

Is being a president a &quot;public service&quot; ?   What about Secretary of War? Attorney General?  FBI chief?

China&#39;s government is famously corrupt, so it&#39;s no surprise that it attracts the already corrupt.

&quot;China&#39;s government is famously corrupt, so it&#39;s no surprise that it attracts the already corrupt&quot;I don&#39;t disagree but the USA&#39;s often seems to be almost as bad

The only ones in public service are those who&#39;ve climbed up the ranks of the government.

&quot;Is being a president a &quot;public service&quot; ?&quot;The GOP doesn&#39;t even consider the POTUS. or rather Trump to be an officer of the United States and is thereby not bound by any relevant restrictions.But can he self-service at public expense? Oh, absolutely.But don&#39;t you dare call him a King.

Look, corruption is one of the most cultural specific activities.  It is tremendously affected by the morals values taught to people.  It is possible to teach people to be more ethical or less so, particularly with regards to which type of behavior is &#39;the worst&#39;.   You can teach people that murder and rape are evil and should be dealt with by execution, while theft is not so bad and gets a slap on the wrist.  Or you can do it the other way around.

In addition, it is effected by the economic structure tremendously affects WHERE the criminals are.  If you have a capitalist society the money focused criminals are going to go into private business.  If you have a communist society, the money focused criminals will go into government.

So it is not surprising to me that Chinese plagiarists are going into government.

This does not necessarily apply to other cultures.

So it is not surprising to me that Chinese plagiarists are going into government.indeed. in other cultures it might be warmongers, outright criminals and genocidal sociopaths like in the us and israel. and rotten total dumbfucks like in europe.

I think it was Margaret Mead who warned about the issues of taking observations from one culture and applying them to a different one.

And, this being Hong Kong, you&#39;ve got significant added political implications. Given the current political climate there, I could easily see where toadies might be far more likely to enter government service there right now. Unfortunately the article is paywalled, so I don&#39;t know what time period is covered by these observations. Was it pre-crackdown? Post? A mix of the two?

More importantly, it directly supports the allegations that China&#39;s government is very corrupt.  I don&#39;t know if they also tested for agreeability, which would identify &quot;toadies&quot;.

“The President in particular is very much a figurehead — he wields no real power whatsoever. He is apparently chosen by the government, but the qualities he is required to display are not those of leadership but those of finely judged outrage. For this reason the President is always a controversial choice, always an infuriating but fascinating character. His job is not to wield power but to draw attention away from it. On those criteria Zaphod Beeblebrox is one of the most successful Presidents

No one gets a job with the government because they like hard work.

I attempted to answer some questions in which I happened to have some domain knowledge, but didn&#39;t have the time or the inclination to meet their requirements.

They&#39;re worse than Wikipedia because if someone has some information to add to a Wikipedia article which doesn&#39;t have some demon editor squatting atop it like the throne of Nyarlathotep, they can just go ahead and add it right away without having to ask anyone or jump through any stupid hoops.

I&#39;m not going to lurk and troll their stupid shitty slow site in order to find stuff that I can meet their points requirement with.

concur. there was some good information there, but asking and answering was a really onerous process to figure out, and i never did quite get the hang of answer vs. comment.

Kind of an idle question, but I wonder if Spolsky saw it coming or got lucky.

Why not allow everything and let users do their own filtering?

The purpose is to provide correct answers.

I have a nonzero reputation  [stackoverflow.com] on Stack Overflow, but I haven&#39;t written an Answer since May 2024 and the last of my Answers that has more than one upvote is from 2020.  I for one hope it does weather the storm, but the high bar to making a &quot;good&quot; contribution is a challenge.

And the comparison to Wikipedia is apt in some ways; but Wikipedia also has a lot of content on history, politics, and religion, and in the past had (perhaps still has) some editors who wanted to make sure certain modern social causes were

I used to give free IT Support in yahoo chat groups in the 1998-2003 era.  People stopped asking for help in those html-based real-time chat forums sometime around when Stack Overflow was getting started.

I think this news is just evolution that has no &quot;right or wrong&quot;, only &quot;kill or be killed, eat or be eaten&quot;.

My concern is that the replacement really isn&#39;t sustainable. ChatGPT is not going to get better, the concept is ultimately technically limited to the level of reliability we see today, and without people publishing answers to more current questions, it&#39;s going to get stale and lose its usefulness pretty quickly.

I still find it hard to understand why that&#39;s so difficult for generative AI boosters to grasp. How will it be more accurate in 2035 if most of the information it bases its output on comes from 2025?

Also, where will AI gain new knowledge after authors & content-generators stop creating &quot;novel&quot; content, and stop applying the real intelligence that feeds the artificial one?

Man I long for the usenet of yore. Reddit is as good as it gets, and it is sometimes an adequate replacement.

Incidentally, AI *could* be awesome for technical questions if there were decent documentation out there for systems (plus source code for software systems) and the LLM had access to it.

If you keep asking, will the LLM keep trying to get it right, until it does?

From my experience, I mostly find answers in several year old postings and even that not consistently enough. There is also a lot of bad answers. Not that LLM answers are any better. There is quite a bit of slop produced both by humans and machines.

...now that stackoverflow and other types of forums are soon to be gone?  I  think at one point in the future, when answers to questions cannot be found online, AI will not be able to find a solution.

I see a corollary where corporations enact mass layoffs in name of profits and efficiency, only to wonder why their customers no longer have the disposable income to buy their products.

Oh well, I guess we&#39;re back to sending all our questions to Expert Sex Change.

I had a similar issue here. Another problem is that I found was the notion of the &quot;accepted&quot; answer. This is great in theory, but only works as a snapshot in time because languages evolve. There was no simple way to post the same question again, or pin the &quot;accepted&quot; answer to a language or software package version.

I often went down the path of implementation suggested only to find that the problem was solved in a more modern way after a version update. The community just couldn&#39;t keep up with the evolution

While I am not &quot;vibe&quot; coder I find myself increasingly using AI to get questions to answers that I used to post on SO, and getting pretty good results.  Asking a question on StackOverflow has always been a last resort, because that is the way they want it.  There is often as much energy expended on why a question shouldn&#39;t be answered as opposed to answering it.  The mechanisms to search for an existing answer are not good enough to keep you from DEITY FORBID posting a duplicate.  Also, the site is not good at dealing with stale content.  The &quot;accepted&quot; answer is often no longer the currently correct answer.   The level of snark and condescension is significant, and while I don&#39;t mind a bit of sarcasm now and then, I don&#39;t want to get in continual debates with someone on whether what I&#39;m trying to do is worth doing.

Contrast the experience with AI tools.  They do not yell at me for asking a question that could have been found via web search.  I do not have to wait, I get an immediate answer.  Yes, these tools are overly sycophantic, and sometimes they are wrong.  But 90% of the time I will get a workable response and I can choose to have my code updated based upon the answer.  In those cases where I  don&#39;t get a workable result, I either post an issue on the repo (open source) or contact the vendor (closed), which isn&#39;t all that different from what I do with SO

Peer-based discussion are useful, and if sites like Stack Overflow disappear, we&#39;ve lost something.  SO can perhaps remain relevant by being better at facilitating deeper design and architecture discussions and leave the simple &quot;how do I&quot; questions to AI.

It was just a majority of low-skilled people asking simple questions and a minority of moderately knowledgeable people trying to make themselves look like gurus by answering simple questions. Real experts were few and far between.

At best, it was a source of inspiration as to what might be wrong with your code. You still had to take that inspiration and write the code yourself if you wanted anything good since most answers were either irrelevant, incorrect or highly specific to someone&#39;s use case.

i gave up on the site pretty quickly as most of the “answers” were either non-answers or attitude.

IDK,i bumped in to the occasional overly-rigid process hiccup at SO but by and large i found it to be a tremendously effective tool, both for asking and answering Qs. imo, the last fifteen years or so of software development owe an awful lot to SO.   the rigid rules people are complaining about here (eg closing questions as dupes) definitely contributed to SO&#39;s effectiveness.

that said, i&#39;m using past-tense for SO. as much as i owe SO, the many AI helpers are easier and usually better.

it does beg the obvious question of how the AIs are going to get training material for future technologies.

The &quot;monthly question volume has collapsed [to] about 300&quot; appears to be an artifact of the last category being the current month, January 2026, even though we&#39;re only in the 5th day as of this posting. (Specifically, 321 as of Jan-5 @ 10:30 AM EDT). I expect the number will be in the 2,000+ range by the end of the month, matching both recent trends and a simple extrapolation from the first few days. (Which would still be the worst full month on record.)

Aggressive moderation is responsible for declining engagement over the past decade. Today, well, nobody would have gone there in the first place.

Previous Decline: When you&#39;re knowledgeable enough to properly ask the question and not be shut down by moderators you are already capable of figuring it out for yourself, so asking it is worthless unless you&#39;re just looking for likes or whatever. I guess I&#39;m jaded because I have a history of initial configuration issues with weird conflicts breaking everything bef

&quot;draws on Stack Overflow&#39;s own corpus for training data&quot; -- and just where is AI going to get its training data on future issues that come up? You can&#39;t exactly feed it a manual and hope it will understand and be able to extrapolate answers, it just regurgitates what&#39;s already been posted with a certain degree of &quot;confidence&quot;. So if SO goes, because everyone is relying on LLMs, it becomes and oroborous situation.

In a word, no. If the phone doesn&#39;t run the apps that people want to run (whether they &quot;should&quot; want them being irrelevant) then that phone will fail in the market.

Yes, now can we stop the virtue signal posts that have to pretend like these things don&#39;t exist?

https://www.kyoceramobile.com/... [kyoceramobile.com]

It means &quot;hey everybody, pay attention to me and *how much i reject modern phones because this site is full of 40-70 grumpy old guys* (myself included).  This style of post is so common to be a trope.

The fact you want me to find you a model shows you have put zero-minutes into actually looking so it&#39;s not that much of a need, thusly it&#39;s not a genuine ask for and a virtue signal.

Nobody is going to buy an inch thick phone.

Phone RAM directly competes with Laptop RAM, Compact Desktop RAM and server RAM

The same RAM chips (LP-DDR5) that go into a phone can go into a desktop or laptop, either directly soldered to the MoBo, or in CAMM2 or SO-CAMM 2 modules. And in servers, using, again SO-CAMM2 (while SO-CAMM2 can be used in laptops and compact desktops, it was designed primarely for server and datacenter applications).

No need to reconfigure the production lines, change the lithography masks, change procecess or anything. Literaly

There is no need for a new phone every year. Just get one that comes with updates for a longer time. Unless you use your phone to compensate for personality defects or are into dating women that only want guys with the newest iPhone (is this really a thing?), in which case, paying through your nose is kind of expected.

So the answer to that is an iPhone. Google claims years of updates on pixels but we know google&#39;s track record when it comes to canceling projects.

No. I have a Fairphone. No problems with updates.

if they old phone&#39;s still working? Other than &quot;I&#39;m so cool, i have the latest...&quot;, what does the new one do that the old one didn&#39;t?

Indeed. While I doubt these people understand the problem, they are doing good by accident. The less money invested when the bubble pops and it all crashes, the shorter and less devastating the recession afterwards.

What I was referring to is that they probably do not understand that LLM-type AI is a bubble.

I think they understand just fine, it was when they didn&#39;t understand that these companies could build the datacenters.

I remember a few years back a community realizing years too late that the big datacenter project they were so excited for was a bad deal.  They saw the square footage, and remembered how many long term jobs that meant when a textile company had a facility of similar scale, and made assumptions based on that. Then they just had this huge energy and water suck with a handful of low level jobs.

Now they understand better that the datacenters are completely useless to the local economy, which is at least for them the big problem.

Even if the bubble turned out to be durable, it would *still* be bad for the local communities blighted by these datacenters. The boom/bust doesn&#39;t even matter for their concerns.

If we don&#39;t let them put new datacenters all over the place who will then get our bailout tax dollars??

I live a few miles from several of these, and I have very good hearing.  Imagine hearing a propeller plane like a Cessna far out in the distance. I hear it, but my wife can&#39;t. It&#39;s gets drowned out, but in the mornings when its quiet it annoys the heck out of me. Our local fb community group has a dozen or so posts about people who hear it too.

I can hear fluorescent light bulbs. Working in an office was nearly impossible without headphones to drown it out. Like having tinitus and trying to sleep.

The day the office moved to LED was life changing. I could hear my own thoughts again.

Exactly which equipment is the noise coming from? I&#39;ve worked in chemical plants for decades, with hundreds of pumps running 24/7, multiple large cooling towers, dozens of blowers larger than anything you&#39;d find in a data center, and there was no noise problem. I ride my bike past the last one I worked at all the time; it&#39;s about a mile from the highway and you can&#39;t hear anything, although you can smell it sometimes.

Maybe it is related to the frequency of the data centers&#39; equipment? I don&#39;t know myself.

No idea, just know its from the data centers, or a data center. One user in our group said it was from a failing cooler, but the noise has persisted even after they said its been fixed (again according to this person on the fb feed, they said after contacting the center it took almost 3 weeks to get it addressed).

In the next issue of Dystopian Adventure Stories...

Pretty justified NIMBY here, the companies don&#39;t want to give the local communities anything but problems, and it&#39;s not something they really *demand* like traditional NIMBY concerns around power plants, landfills, etc.

Well maybe. But government processes are slow, while the speed of the AI bubble inflating is fast. I suspect that the bubble bursting, will save us from Big Tech before the municipal processes have even finished playing out.

They can have the money back if the project falls through and the utility work hasn&#39;t startedStrongly disagree. They can only have the money back if no shovel has been turned, literally or metaphorically. By the time construction has started there&#39;s already been disruption to the community. All or nothing, fuck those fucking fucks.

I am totally missing how these datacenters get approved in the first place. Trump, republicans, kickbacks, bribes. Any questions, take a look at how republicans and FirstEnergy screwed Ohio utility payers:
They Spent Millions to Protect Polluters. Then They Got Busted by the FBI. [motherjones.com]
 

GOP SOP - Socialism for the rich, capitalism for the poor.

LOL! They even hired mob thugs to intimidate the petition signature collectors that were trying to stop the thievery in Ohio. I have no doubt they will do the same for the petition pushers trying to stop the data centers.

Voting has consequenc

America put a thug in the presidency. He acts like thug; he never goes after anyone who can defend themselves; he only does it if he is assured of some monetary or political win; and he makes sure there are always a collection of sycophantic scapegoats handy in case whatever scam he&#39;s pulling goes south and doesn&#39;t want to be seen holding the bag. He&#39;s okay with holding bag as a last resort as long as he isn&#39;t seen to be holding the bag. That frequently involves him paying off whomever he screwed over. And

This statement, together with labeling residentsâ(TM) assertion of local preference as âoe community, political and regulatory disruptions,â really signals the executive classâ(TM)s complete disconnection from and apathy toward the real people living as citizens in the world. They seem to hold the assumption that their being at the forefront if aome kind of business movement is assurance they are good people doing good things, and that insensitivity to the needs of actual other people is an asset.

Itâ(TM)s a tremendous sign of hope that community disruptions are actuall a problem. for them.

Who isn&#39;t surprised that Tucson, AZ and Chandler, AZ both voted down data centers recently? It is stupid for a water-hog like a data center to even want to build in the desert, where water resources are cherished. And data centers *SHOULD* be voted down in areas that don&#39;t the water resources needed to run a large data center.

I&#39;m not sure who is paying for it, but here locally at least the morning news has been flooding the zone during their ad breaks with ads about what &quot;Positives&quot; building datacenters in your area has. The ad literally states simply:
 A) Building new datacenters in your area will lower the cost of electricity for everyone.
B) Building new datacenters in your area will lower taxes for everyone.
C) Building new datacenters in your area will increase property value for every home owner.
D) Building new datacenters in your area will create massive numbers of new jobs.

On point A? Even my more brain-dead coworkers have been bitching about this one. &quot;How does adding huge demand on electricity lower the cost of electricity?&quot; Yup. You&#39;re not even fooling the red hat wearers on that point. Best to hire an actual propaganda / ad firm to come up with something that at least the easily led folks will believe. You can&#39;t just state the opposite of facts and expect everyone to climb aboard automatically just because you said it.

Point B? Considering how cities tend to throw free money at any big business enterprise to build in an area, and increase taxes on the general population in order to do so, yeah, I wouldn&#39;t count on that one being true.

Point C? Arguably, there may be a minor increase in property value for businesses building directly in the path of the datacenter, due to the possibility of future growth of said datacenter, but home property values will most likely drop as noise pollution from the circulation systems and other background hum issues that we&#39;re only now starting to realize have an effect on humans and surrounding wildlife will take a toll.

Point D? There will be a minor construction worker uptick during the build out. A few engineers will be needed for spin-up. Then every one of those jobs will disappear save for maybe one to two long-term engineers to replace faulty disks and power supplies, perhaps upgrade systems if the datacenter keeps running long enough, and make sure the cooling systems don&#39;t collapse on themselves during the hottest days of the year. The rest are extremely temporary jobs that will come and go in a boom/bust cycle that will leave swaths of unemployable people in their wake, and most folks are well aware of how that works out. Even in my area we&#39;ve seen datacenter build-outs lead to quick increases in employment, followed by a long-lasting bunch of folks that aren&#39;t really needed once the build-out is complete.

:Get better propaganda if you really expect the country to jump for joy over building out datacenters to spin up AIs that will replace entire workforces. Figure out how to spin it as hope for the common man. Because right now, the message is, &quot;Let us create more AI to continue to consolidate wealth among the very few while we put massive numbers of you out of a job! It&#39;ll be awesome.&quot; And that message is not really working for most of us.

Their problem is there is no upside for the local communities, so they either have to lie and hope people believe it, or tell the truth and have people reject it outright.

I heard one being honest, when criticized about increased energy costs, lack of likely new jobs, strain on water supply, their only response was &quot;but you can be part of the AI revolution!&quot;

Not to really disagree but my own takes would be

A) does not specify a time horizon.  Over a long enough period increased supply usually does follow increased demand, and prices usually do drop. Look at the inflation adjusted cost for refined gasoline in 1912 vs today.. It would be around $5.80 a gallon national average. Will the price of electricity come down enough to help the individual in their life time as far as total savings (my bet is unlikely )

B) Lots of communities drive very large portions of thei

Over a long enough period increased supply usually does follow increased demand, There&#39;s two problematic assumptions here. One is that the facility will be operating at the same capacity long term. Take Microsoft&#39;s will they / won&#39;t they with Wisconsin data centers or even Foxconn. Businesses can change courses a lot quicker than power plant build outs. So that time horizon is notoriously problematic especially with government incentives in the mix.Continuing using Wisconsin as a second example, they&#39;ve have had to delay the decommissioning of the coal plants with expensive results [utilitydive.com].That

No, it&#39;s always been a huge problem. As people wise up, and they will, they will make certain it&#39;s a problem for the people causing it, instead of everyone else.

and the federal government to override local governments. They&#39;ll do this under the guise of&quot;We need state-level or federal-level consistency in zoning laws for data centers&quot;.

There is too much data center investment money sloshing around and that will be used to override the wishes of the citizenry.

high water use, high electric bills, low employment; what’s not to love?

All facilities are a nuisance: factories, roads, power plants, landfills, airports, etc... NIMBY is there for a reason.

But I would like to think that datacenters are low on the nuisance scale. In fact I have never noticed a datacenter by myself, someone has to point me at what looks like some nondescript office building and tell me &quot;it is a datacenter&quot; for me to notice. Maybe giant datacenters are different, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there were less of a nuisance than the farmland they replace. Farmlan

These are the same people who bitch about traffic...while simultaneously fighting against road construction. They complain their taxes are going up...but won&#39;t let any new businesses or development come in to increase the tax base.

They use to fight against cell phone towers...they threaten suits over fraud because their phone doesn&#39;t work at their house. Oh...but they don&#39;t want the towers anywhere near them. Phone still has to work, but no towers.

There&#39;s a proposal to build a &quot;small&quot; (24 MW) data center literally within walking distance of my home. utility press release  [lbwl.com] newspaper article [lansingstatejournal.com]  I haven&#39;t submitted my own public commnent on it yet, and I actually might be weakly in favor of it.

In their more enlightened future, we are told, they only pursue the more benign science of longevity.

Bah, we swap blood with juice boys too! [fortune.com]

In London horse shit could be literally inches deep on the main roads in victorian times and no doubt the stink particularly in summer was something few people today would ever experience.

Yes, old cars also stank - you can usually smell a classic car thats driven past as well as hear it - and tetraethyl lead was a crime that a lot of CEOs dodged being put on trial for, but apart from CO2 and a tiny bit of NOx , modern car emissions are no longer much of an issue.

!954... people stank of old sweat, cars burnt a pint of oil every 250 miles, and every enclosed space smelled strongly of cigarette smoke.

In the 1890s, New York produced ~500 tons of horse manure every day.  That&#39;s way worse.

This is why 1hp doesn&#39;t equal 1 horse&#39;s output in power. It means 1 horses output in shit.

In 2026, there’s one easy resolution we should all commit to: Be better consumers of media.

Traditional media is in crisis, thanks to a combination of Trump administration attacks, corporate takeovers, and technological innovations. Social media sites compete for our attention by offering us addictive little bites: Outrage-bait tweets and short-form shock value TikTok videos, served up according to algorithms that track how long we linger and feed us more and more of what keeps us locked in (which is often what makes us angry).

For young people raised on smartphones, this has meant that most of them seem to lack the attentional ability to actually read news articles in their entirety. Only 15% of adults under 30 say they follow the news most or all of the time, and that percentage has declined since 2016, according to Pew. While majorities of Americans over 50 regularly seek out the news, young adults largely do not—70% of them say they see political news simply because they come across it, which happens largely via social media. Nearly 40% rely on “influencers” for news, because, as one 21-year-old man told Pew, “If I agree with that person already, if I already have background with that person, then I’ll probably trust him more than some news site.”

This is troubling enough. Except now, some once-legitimate news outlets are following suit, and pledging to tell viewers what they want to hear and already believe, rather than what’s true and what it means. CBS, now helmed by former opinion writer and Substacker Bari Weiss, just relaunched their flagship CBS Evening News show newly anchored by Tony Dokoupil, who opened the program’s reboot by telling viewers, “On too many stories, the press has missed the story. Because we’ve taken into account the perspective of advocates and not the average American. Or we put too much weight in the analysis of academics or elites, and not enough on you.” Dokoupil promised that “From now on, what you see and hear on the news will reflect what you see and hear in your own life.”

Programming that simply regurgitates what people already see, hear, and believe in their own lives is not, by any definition, “news” or even new. News media of course report stories that are relevant to their readers’ and viewers’ lives. But they should also be reporting the things those readers and viewers should know but don’t: Political corruption or malfeasance; the actions of the very powerful; the disasters afflicting the less fortunate; innovations and world-changing achievements; the ways in which choices made in Washington invisibly but indelibly shape the lives of average people. The job of the reporter is to report what’s true, and to help the reader or viewer understand why it matters or what it means, which often requires bringing in subject matter experts who are less “elites” than people who have spent years amassing knowledge and whose insights can expand minds and deepen public understanding. Mimicking the social media model of simply affirming people’s own beliefs, biases, and animosities and insisting the guy next door knows as much about nuclear fission as a nuclear physicist is an anathema to real journalism.

It’s also perpetuating the problem. People haven’t lost trust in mainstream media because mainstream media outlets have routinely lied to and manipulated them. People have lost trust in mainstream media at least in part because canny political actors have told the public that mainstream media has lied to and manipulated them, and that instead they should trust their own gut—and, of course, highly ideological activists who use short-form video and text as tools to drive engagement (and drive up their own relevance and wealth).

Take, for example, the recent fraud scandal in Minnesota. Dozens of people, many of them Somali immigrants, have been accused and convicted of bilking federal social services programs for hundreds of millions of dollars in a sprawling and remarkably well-organized fraud involving autism care and a nonprofit called “Feeding Our Future” (the alleged mastermind of the fraud was the nonprofit’s head, a white woman). President Trump has jumped on the issue, using it to hammer his anti-immigrant views; several prominent conservatives have called to denaturalize and deport U.S. citizens who were involved in the scheme.

Now, right-wing influencers have made uncovering other acts of alleged Somali fraud something of a competition. In an act that has shades of Pizzagate, one man showed up at daycare centers wielding a camera and demanding to be let inside, ostensibly to prove that there were no children there and the centers were more illegal money grabs; he seemed confused that daycares are typically locked to outsiders and don’t have formal reception areas, and has been unable to offer any actual evidence of fraud. Nevertheless, his video went viral, and was shared by the vice president and the director of the FBI. And there have been real and devastating consequences: Innocent Somalis have been harassed and threatened; Somali-run daycares have been vandalized. Based, it seems, solely on the claims of one right-wing influencer, Trump has cut off all federal childcare funds to Minnesota, money that thousands of families rely on to afford care for their kids.

Conservative influencers are claiming that there was a widespread coverup not only by Democrats in office, but by news media. “Right now the mainstream media is doing nothing to cover the Somali fraud in Minnesota,” one conservative activist with a million followers tweeted a few days before the new year. MAGA Voice told its 1.4 million followers that “CBS hasn’t reported on Minnesota / PBS hasn’t reported on Minnesota” and continued that convention to accuse six mainstream television networks of not reporting on the fraud case. “You literally can’t find a single mainstream article about the Minnesota fraud… Not even one…” reads one tweet that has been shared more than 9,000 times.

“Somali fraud” became a talking point in right-wing circles thanks to an article in the conservative National Journal co-authored by right-wing activist Christopher Rufo. It claims that not only were Somalis defrauding the government, but, as the headline says, “the largest funder of [the terrorist group] al-Shabaab is the Minnesota taxpayer.” The piece then proceeds to include no evidence for its al-Shabaab claim, save for one quote attributed to an anonymous source (later in the piece, one law enforcement official notes that Somalis, like many immigrant groups, send money to relatives back home, and that in Somalia, al-Shabaab is “taking a cut”—not that Somali-Americans are sending reams of cash to terrorists, or that the Minnesota taxpayer is their primary bankroller). That they were just hearing about this scandal, conservatives claimed, was evidence of the media’s complicity in a coverup.

It was, instead, evidence of their own insularity, incuriosity, and apparent inability to read the news or even google. The City Journal article came out in mid-November; the Times had covered the case in March and again in August and kept up the coverage as the story evolved and as federal indictments turned into mounting convictions. Sahan Journal, a Minnesota publication catering to the Somali community, covered it a year ago. The Associated Press, CBS News, and a half-dozen local Minnesota news outlets also covered the story months before Rufo was on the case.

It is true that, so far, mainstream media outlets have not gone around accusing daycare operators of fraud with no evidence beyond an online search, a hunch, and an unheeded demand to be allowed into childcare centers to video the kids; this is a good thing. Real investigative journalism takes care to get the facts right, and that takes time. Unlike in the Feeding Our Future fraud, there is no criminal case to cover in these so far unsubstantiated claims of daycare fraud.

Being the first influencer to accuse immigrants of a serious crime may drive engagement and make one a right-wing hero, but it’s not the same as actual investigative reporting, which requires verifying facts rather than simply asserting them. And when reputable outlets get things wrong—and, being run by humans, they sometimes do—they publicly correct the record. Ideologues and influencers tend to just ignore or deny their own mistakes. If the influencer pounding on daycare doors is shown evidence that the care centers are legit, do we think he admit he was wrong, let alone go viral for it? And if he does walk back his claims, will the many millions of people who have taken them seriously get the memo—or will they continue on with the impression that a rampant fraud occurred and the legacy media simply refused to talk about it? Do we believe that the president will restore childcare funding and repay any lost wages to the parents whose ability to work just got scrambled?

This is all incredibly corrosive. The incoming A.I. era seems primed to supercharge this already perilous situation. With bots sounding more human by the day and the ability to create highly realistic photos and videos of just about whatever one pleases, the very concept of a shared reality may be in rapid decline. What we see with our own eyes on our phones—what we see and hear political leaders saying, what we see and hear our fellow citizens doing—is becoming less reliable, and it takes ever-greater sophistication to ferret out what’s real.

In this new Alice-in-Wonderland semi-reality, we need honest, accountable, real journalism. Instead of shoring up reputable outlets, though, too many are being sacrificed to the president by greedy owners who seem eager to profit handsomely even if it comes at the cost of America’s once-robust democratic functioning enabled by the fourth estate. CBS’s rightward turn, including the appointment of Weiss—who was an opinion writer (not a reporter) with no experience in TV news—has come in the wake of its parent company being acquired by Skydance Media (now Paramount Skydance), owned by David Ellison, the son of Trump-supporting billionaire Larry Ellison. The younger Ellison was only able to acquire Paramount with the approval of the Federal Communications Commission, which Trump has captured and whose power the president continues to abuse. Announcing the merger, FCC chairman and Trump loyalist Brendan Carr said that he welcomes “Skydance’s commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network,” including the appointment of a right-wing think tank employee as CBS’s new ombudsman.

Ellison is now in a bid to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns CNN—another network the president believes is against him. Trump has implied that he will again abuse the Federal Communications Commission’s power to grant or block the merger the younger Ellison badly wants. It’s not hard to see Weiss’s decision to pull a ready-to-air 60 Minutes segment about the Salvadoran torture-prison to which Trump is deporting immigrants—after Trump complained that 60 Minutes had been mean to him—as part of a broader strategy to gut media companies that allow reporters to do their jobs rather than work as mouthpieces for the administration, all in the service of enriching a tiny few.

There is not much the average American citizen can do to stop billionaires from grabbing and gutting storied news networks, and other authoritarian leaders have run similar playbooks in their own countries, most notably Hungary. What we can do, though, is direct our dollars and our attention to the reputable and well-run outlets that remain—and even though local news was dying well before Trump’s second term and national outlets are being disemboweled like Hannibal Lector is on the run, there are, thankfully, still many newspapers, news magazines, and television news networks doing real journalism. But they are facing threats from all sides: A vengeful president; a distracted and disengaged audience used to endless scrolling and pop-pop-pops of entertainment; the creeping unreality of A.I.

Fundamentally, we all need to be better news consumers. News outlets also see what’s shared and what’s ignored, which stories draw clicks and eyeballs and which are scrolled past, which outlets are growing their subscription bases and which are shrinking. That doesn’t determine editorial decisions, but it would be naïve to believe it doesn’t at all shape them. And if reputable news outlets aren’t getting readers and viewers, they also aren’t earning subscriber and ad dollars, which means there’s less cash to pay journalists to do the often-slow and often-pedantic work of good journalism.

It’s not just journalism that’s at stake; it’s your own brain. Do you believe you are better off getting news and information primarily from social media feeds that have been cultivated to push your particular outrage buttons, delivered by people who are accountable to no one? Or might it be better for your mind (your intellectual abilities and your basic sanity) to read a range of stories from across a big and complicated world, and sometimes see your priors challenged?

It’s practically a national pastime to complain about the media. Instead of asking “who says stuff I agree with?” try questioning a publication or individual’s editorial policies. Do they check their facts and check them again before publishing, to make sure that they get it right most of the time? Are they transparent when they’re wrong? Do they hold the powerful to account, no matter who “the powerful” may be? Do they approach their subject matter with curiosity rather than an agenda?

Social media, A.I., Trump, and corporate greed do not have to be the end of reliable journalism. But they’re definitely not going to save it. As the old PBS slogan goes, that’s only made possible by viewers like you.

There was a time not long ago when people would claim with a straight face that Donald Trump was a populist who prioritized the interests of working-class Americans and avoided stupid foreign wars. “Trump’s Best Foreign Policy? Not Starting Any Wars,” then-Senator J.D. Vance crowed in 2023. As Trump assembled his second-term national security team in 2024, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) claimed to be “amazed by the Trump cabinet” and the president’s rejection of “warmongers.” A mere two months ago, one of those cabinet officials, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, told a conference in Bahrain that Trump had ended the “counterproductive and endless cycle of regime change or nation-building” that has defined American foreign policy for decades.

Trump’s brazenly illegal military assault on Caracas last week would embarrass these people, were they capable of embarrassment. Trump did not govern as a populist during his first term; his second term has been an unabashed celebration of crass imperialism and the super-rich.

And the super-rich are thrilled. Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman croons that Trump’s war in Venezuela “will lower oil prices, which is good for America.” The Jeff Bezos editorial board hailed the Trump invasion as a happy confluence of “justice” and technical prowess. Elon Musk is patching things up with Trump, proclaiming the war “a win for the world and a clear message to evil dictators everywhere.” Nor are Republicans the only enthusiasts. Democratic Party fundraiser Charles Myers is organizing a post-Maduro field trip to Venezuela with about 20 hedge funders and asset managers to scout investment opportunities in “oil and gas,” “construction,” and “tourism.”

The story of American capital profiteering on American war is as old as America itself, and Trump openly claims to have invaded Venezuela for its oil. But in this particular case the Wall Street opportunists have their work cut out for them. On Saturday, Politico reported that Trump offered U.S. oil executives “reimbursement” for oil assets that were nationalized by the Venezuelan government decades ago—but only on the condition that they actually take control of Venezuela’s oil fields. Ten days after making the offer, Trump doesn’t have any takers. Venezuela’s oil infrastructure is outdated, and it will take tremendous investments to meaningfully expand production, something oil companies are reluctant to do when large profits are readily available from high prices and low corporate investment. We are thus presented with the bizarre spectacle of an American president waging an imperialist war on behalf of American executives who are reluctant to claim the spoils. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, meanwhile, is telling reporters that Cuba may be next in line for American-imposed regime change, as the wife of Trump’s racism czar Stephen Miller points to Greenland.

Embarrassing as these developments are for the right-wing populists who supported Trump in 2024, I have always harbored some sympathy for their political plight. Conservative populists are generally right about war (bad) and poverty (wrong), and they claim to recognize warmongering and elite favor-trading as unpleasant features of Republican politics. At the same time, I have maintained contempt for the belief that Donald Trump might deliver America from those evils. Trump’s first term was defined by a massive tax cut for the rich, a bank deregulation bill that delivered a rash of bank failures, the destruction of a standing diplomatic treaty with Iran, and sustained, vocal support for the violent and corrupt governments of Israel and Saudi Arabia. All of these agenda items could have been implemented by a President Mitt Romney, had an election or two gone a little differently. The populist fantasy this time around was that Vance and a few other Trump insiders who had built careers on populist branding might persuade Trump to turn away from the Republican old guard.

A year into his second term, Trump has once again cut taxes for the rich, in addition to doubling health insurance premiums for 20 million families, and declaring the national affordability crisis a “hoax.” His invasion of Venezuela suggests not only a return to the lunatic adventurism of George W. Bush in Iraq, but to various coups attempted and consummated by Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George H.W. Bush.

So Trump’s populist pitch to voters once again turned out to be a fraud. But the populist energy that fueled his reelection isn’t going away, even if the air is coming out of the Epstein jet’s tires. Trump was propelled into office by the two defining events of the 21st century: Bush the Younger’s disaster in Iraq and the financial crisis of 2008, both of which provided the country with ample evidence of elite incompetence and self-dealing. But the Democratic Party’s leadership has remained too entwined with the same interests and ideologues to establish itself as an enduring alternative to the elite predation that has been so obvious under Republican leadership. Barack Obama captured Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011, but remained at war in Afghanistan for the remainder of his presidency. Joe Biden followed through on Trump’s first-term Middle East program all the way to a genocide in Gaza, and one of Biden’s last actions in office was to offer a $25 million reward for information leading to Maduro’s “arrest”—the same word the Trump administration uses to describe its operation in Venezeula.

Trump’s presidency is in trouble. Every Epstein file dump reveals his long friendship with the sex-trafficker to be worse than we knew, and he is still illegally withholding tens of thousands of Epstein files from public scrutiny—not the action of a man comfortable with the contents. Prices remain high, unemployment is rising, and the economy has been stuck in a hiring freeze for just about the entirety of Trump’s presidency. Democratic Party leadership clearly hopes it can ride all of this ineptitude to victory in 2026 and 2028 without promising much more than a return to normalcy. And Trump’s failures mean that they will, indeed, have the wind at their backs. But Democrats have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory before. The safe bet is to break with the corrupt and violent tradition Trump so unmistakably embodies.

The Trump administration has a handful of answers to the question “Why did the United States pluck Nicolás Maduro from Venezuela?”—it was for narcoterrorism, or payback, or just oil. They’re even less clear about what’s going to happen with the country now.

In a lengthy press conference Saturday detailing the U.S. military’s capture of Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro, President Donald Trump confirmed, with stunning frankness, the classic leftist critique of American foreign policy: that, at least for as long as he’s in power, it’s all about the oil.

Over the past few months, Trump and his aides had characterized their pressure campaign against Maduro’s regime as a war on “narco-terrorism” and a fight to restore democratic rule. But following Maduro’s extraction in a complex military and intelligence operation, the U.S. president was clear about its true motive.

“We’re going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition,” he said, adding, “We can’t take a chance that somebody else takes over Venezuela that doesn’t have the good of the Venezuelan people in mind.” Then came the kicker: “We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in” and spend billions of dollars fixing the energy infrastructure that they developed decades ago, until socialist regimes nationalized their wells, then wrecked them. The wealth resulting from this grab-back will benefit the Venezuelan people, he said, but he noted that much of it will reimburse America’s oil companies.

Finally, Trump said, U.S. troops will be sent to enforce Big Oil’s rule if necessary. “They always say ‘boots on the ground’—we’re not afraid of boots on the ground,” he said. “We had boots on the ground last night,” as part of the operation to extract Maduro. He said the military was poised to go in again if needed.

There’s a lengthy history, starting in the Cold War, of the U.S. military and the CIA co-opting or overthrowing Central and South American governments—including in Guatemala, Brazil, Ecuador, the Dominican Republic, and Chile, as well as several attempts to do so in Cuba—to bolster the interests of U.S. corporations, including United Fruit, IT&T, and various oil companies.

But rarely have the presidents who ordered these interventions been so blatant about the primary motive. Instead, at least in public, they spoke of fighting communism or upholding democracy, even when the enemies weren’t really communist and their allies weren’t at all democratic.

But Trump was up-front about his reasons, and repeatedly so. Several times during his press conference, he talked of bringing in big U.S. oil companies to regain their former assets. (In fact, though, American firms never owned the land where they drilled for Venezuela’s oil riches, and, as in many other countries, the interplay between foreign exploiters and local nationalizers was more complex than Trump’s narrative suggests.) And he also discussed restoring “American dominance in the Western Hemisphere”—a policy that his recently issued National Security Strategy called the “Trump corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine. “We are reasserting American power in a very powerful way in our home region,” he said—not to protect democracy but for its own sake.

Maduro and his wife were captured, then indicted by the U.S. attorney in New York, on charges of drug trafficking. Trump, however, all but admitted that this wasn’t the real purpose of the elaborate operation. Just a month ago, while officers were planning the attack on Venezuela, Trump pardoned former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, who had been convicted of drug trafficking. Asked about this at Saturday’s news conference, Trump said he had issued the pardon because Hernández, who had supported Trump, had been “treated unfairly” by former President Joe Biden.

As for democracy, Trump was asked whether he would support María Corina Machado, the Nobel Prize–winning leader of Venezuela’s opposition movement, to lead a new government—or even whether he had spoken with her. Trump answered no to both questions. “It would be very tough for her to be the leader,” he said in a dismissive tone. “She doesn’t have the respect in the country.” Nor did he even mention Edmundo González, who was elected Venezuela’s president in 2024 and fled to safe exile in Spain after Maduro stole the election.

Earlier on Saturday, in an interview on Fox News, Trump acted as if he’d barely thought about Machado or González. “I mean, I don’t know about what kind of an election that was,” he said, referring to the 2024 contest. Meanwhile, he said, “they have a vice president, you know.”

Later, during the press conference, Trump acknowledged that the Venezuelan vice president, Delcy Rodríguez—who, by law, has now been sworn in as president—had been handpicked by Maduro. He noted that Secretary of State Marco Rubio is now “working with” Rodríguez, who is “willing to do what’s necessary to make Venezuela great again.”

Venezuelan law requires an ascending vice president to call for new elections, but this doesn’t seem in the offing. Asked who precisely is going to “run” Venezuela, Trump replied, “We’re designating various people. … It’s largely going to be the people standing right behind me”—referring to Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Dan Caine. “Venezuela has a lot of bad people,” Trump added. “We’re not going to take a chance that one of those people take over from Maduro.”

Asked how long this transition will take, Trump said he would “like to do it quickly” but that rebuilding the country’s oil infrastructure “takes a period of time.”

Still, it remains unclear how America really will “run” Venezuela, a country of 28.5 million, roughly the size of Texas or California. Its military officers, most of whom were loyal to Maduro, are still in place, as are its Cabinet ministers and bureaucrats. Trump said that many of them will soon be switching sides. Maybe, maybe not. There are also more than 20,000 Cubans in Venezuela, many of them military and intelligence officers, many others health care workers, all of them providing services in exchange for Venezuelan oil. Will they be leaving? Will power struggles break out? Will the military simply adapt to Washington’s demands in exchange for guarantees to stay in power?

Then there are broader questions. The whole world is watching not just this operation—an impressive tactical display of U.S. military power—but what happens next. Trump’s unabashedly imperial rationale for the action may inspire Russian President Vladimir Putin to double down on his claims of rightful dominance over Ukraine—and Chinese President Xi Jinping to feel more confident in his claims over Taiwan. At the same time, antiregime activists in Iran may feel emboldened, especially since Trump said, just the other day, that he stands “locked and loaded” to punish Tehran’s leaders if they killed protesters.

Finally, there is Cuba. In his press conference, Trump noted similarities between Cuba and Venezuela. Both countries have been wrecked by socialist dictators, and “we want to help the people in Cuba.” Rubio, a Cuban American who has avidly supported the anti-Castro movement in Florida (a state he once represented as a senator), added, “If I lived in Havana and worked in the government, I’d be concerned.”

Meanwhile, the U.S. aircraft carrier and its supporting armada, which had mobilized off Venezuela’s shore before the operation, remain deployed and on high alert. “We’re ready to stage a second and much larger attack if we need to do so,” Trump said.

It was around noon when I stepped off the train, surfacing into Lower Manhattan’s particular brand of winter blight—when the cold is amplified by tall buildings that block out direct sun and funnel air directly onto your face. It was about 25 degrees, though the temperature felt theoretical once the wind got involved. Within minutes my ears had gone brittle, aching in that sharp kind of way that makes you briefly resent your parents for ever leaving the Middle East.

I followed a small group of South Asian aunties in industrial-grade puffers and bright yellow “Zohran” campaign beanies, which smartly functioned equally as political statements and survival gear. They led me toward the official public “block party,” a kenneled-off stretch of Broadway that I had optimistically imagined would involve warmth-adjacent amenities: food carts, coffee in little paper cups that burn your fingers just a bit, maybe even porta-potties. Instead, it was a wide, empty street hemmed in by police barricades and a few enormous screens. Music blasted. People stood around. That was it.

The aunties seemed genuinely delighted, bopping along to Bruno Mars as if this were the triumph of civic joy they had been waiting for since Election Day. I, meanwhile, realized that joy without circulation was not sustainable for me. I lasted maybe five minutes.

I cut north toward City Hall Plaza, where the actual inauguration was scheduled to take place.

I was expecting a spectacle. Zohran Mamdani is a New York mayor of many firsts: the first Muslim, the first South Asian, the first African-born, the first millennial. In the middle of the Trump era—which has been particularly hostile to every one of those identities—I wanted to see how that collision landed in person. I was curious how ordinary New Yorkers, from the people who powered his rise to City Hall to those who opposed it and everyone in between, would experience a moment that already felt larger than a single election.

What I found instead was something messier and more revealing. New York was working through its feelings in real time. Pride and paranoia crossed paths on the sidewalk. Joy and cynicism hovered in the frozen air. As always, the city was a layered collage best understood through the small encounters and fleeting scenes unfolding at street level as history happened in the background.

Along the barricades, I passed a small group of protesters waving Israeli flags. I approached one woman for a quote. She immediately bristled, waving her hand in my face and telling me to leave, then threatening to call the police—an escalation that felt unnecessary given that we were already surrounded by officers.

Another protester, who declined to provide her name, apologized quietly for the interaction. She told me that some of the others were “kind of crazy.” She stood a few feet away from them, holding her flag politely, not chanting or yelling. She said she was worried about Mamdani’s “background” and wanted to show support for Israel in defiance of a mayor who had broken with New York’s long tradition of unyielding support for the Israeli government. She sounded less angry than anxious, fixated on Mamdani’s outspokenness on what experts have called a genocide, and her nervousness for the future of Zionist New Yorkers.

By the time I reached the security entrance, the program was supposed to start in less than an hour. Volunteers urged attendees to take their seats, but they milled around, greeting old friends, hugging, shouting names across rows of white folding chairs. Unlike the public block party, this felt like a gathering of the campaign’s engine—organizers, supporters, donors, artists, electeds—the people who had powered what many still described as the biggest political upset since Donald Trump’s 2016 win.

Just inside the checkpoint, a woman smiled and said, “Hi, I’m Marisa.” Another chimed in: “Hi, I’m Natasha.” It took me a second to register that they were Marisa Tomei and Natasha Lyonne. Neither was surrounded by handlers or slated to speak. They were simply there, guests like everyone else, bundled up and waiting for things to begin. Both were warm and unfussy, radiating the kind of ease that comes from being completely at home in a crowd like this. The inauguration hadn’t even started, and already it was a vibe.

Hundreds filled the seats. There was music, chatter, the low buzz of anticipation. And yet, nothing about this place was warm. I was uncontrollably shivering.

I started mentally cataloging everything I hadn’t brought with me: a fluffy scarf, a hat that actually covered my ears, maybe even a balaclava, though I doubted that would play well for an Arab at an inauguration, even with the mayor being a Muslim.

Everywhere I looked were red Democratic Socialists of America beanies, pulled low, doing the quiet but essential work of insulation. I considered asking for one, though I want to be clear: I wanted one because my head was so cold I could feel my thoughts slowing down. Still, there was something remarkable about the destigmatization of a previously dirty word in politics out in force on the lawn of City Hall.

Then I saw him. A Sikh man a few rows from the front unfurled a blanket with the calm confidence of someone who had planned for this exact scenario. He wrapped himself completely and settled into his chair. At regular intervals, he poured himself a cup of steaming hot chai from his thermos. I watched with envy the way the steam rose into the air. I’d have traded my camera for a sip.

The crowd itself felt carefully curated: actors, activists, organizers, journalists, all packed together. Walton Goggins, of HBO’s The White Lotus, hovered nearby, visibly delighted to see Lyonne. Model Waris Ahluwalia looked impeccable, as expected. Kareem Rahma, of Subway Takes fame, fresh off the best year of his career, filmed the scene on his caseless iPhone. Mustafa the Poet was there too, unmistakable and stylish.

Then came the faces I knew from my reporting in 2025: Mohsen Mahdawi and Mahmoud Khalil, Palestinian students of Columbia University with green cards who had been detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement for their activism. Linda Sarsour, a Brooklyn-born activist, sat near the front in a striking purple hijab. Simone Zimmerman, a Zeteo contributor and a central focus of the film Israelism. Writer Suzy Hansen and I exchanged smiles as we took it all in.

It was brutally cold. Sitting felt impossible. I kept moving, using my camera as an excuse. “If I sit, I’ll miss the moment,” I kept telling people. I ran into familiar faces—Asad Dandia, Husein Yatabarry, Dr. Debbie Almontaser—Muslim New Yorkers I know as part of the civic ecosystem that helped propel Mamdani to success.

As I continued to circle the crowd, ducking between rows of folding chairs, I caught the same refrains over and over. Visitors chatted as they tried to process what they were watching unfold.

“I’ve never seen this much negative coverage of any New York mayor. Fearmongering and what ifs count as journalism now?” one said. Another agreed. “Even if he can’t accomplish everything—because, let’s be honest, they’re going to make his life hell—at least he’s given us a vision of what different could look like,” they noted. “Anyone who has to contort themselves this hard to hate the most likable political figure imaginable clearly has a persecution fetish.”

A Muslim woman in hijab said, “If the Democratic Party had half Mamdani’s integrity, the fascists wouldn’t be winning.” An excited fan waving a handmade Mamdani sign exclaimed, “Zohran delivered Bernie clapping in a beanie—already the best mayor!” Another reveler asked: “Wait. Is that Susan Sarandon? That’s definitely Susan Sarandon. And John Turturro. Right?”

I also overheard some fierce debates between visitors in DSA hats. “This feels like Obama all over again, and that scares me. They’re going to sabotage him at every turn and then blame him when things don’t magically work,” said one. “Can we stop saying ‘free’ transit? We pay for it. Libraries, schools, buses, that’s what taxes are for.” Said another: “Socialists used to hold office in this country. They helped win labor rights we take for granted,” They added: “MAGA keeps saying they hate corrupt billionaire elites—but they’re terrified of a guy who wants to tax the rich? What did you think an ‘everyman’ mayor was supposed to do?”

(At one point, people around me began whispering excitedly about outgoing Mayor Eric Adams. Apparently, he looked miserable. Someone said, “He’s having a terrible time.” Someone else replied, “Good.” I had snapped a photo earlier in which he appeared to be pouting. I showed it to them. They leaped with joy. It was petty. It was human.)

The program began with a speech delivered by an excited Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. “New York City has chosen the ambitious pursuit of universal child care, affordable rents and housing, and clean and dignified public transit for all. We have chosen that over the distractions of bigotry and the barbarism of extreme income inequality.”

She and other speakers made several references to the fact that the city was now officially in the care of its first Muslim leader. Imam Khalid Latif was the New York Police Department’s first Muslim chaplain and executive director and chaplain (imam) for the Islamic Center at New York University; he left the latter post last summer to become the co-founder and executive director of the Islamic Center of New York City. As with the many sermons he’s given for Friday prayer, he delivered a moving speech that explicitly tied Mamdani’s faith to his politics.

I came expecting a political coronation. But as I worked my way through the crowd, it felt closer to a collective recalibration—a moment to take stock of how ideas once dismissed as fringe, like openly taxing wealthy citizens, were now being voiced from the steps of City Hall without apology, and to wonder how much further the shift could go.

Bernie Sanders delivered an impassioned speech in which he demanded our government put a stop to growing income inequality. The audience collectively broke out into a loud chant: “Tax the rich!” A person next to me remarked, “Let’s start with everyone up there!,” pointing to Mamdani’s political allies who had joined him onstage.

There was still plenty of starry-eyed enthusiasm for the handsome young mayor and the hope he represented. But beneath that was something more measured: a curiosity about how far the boundaries of the possible had moved in just a year.

For Muslim New Yorkers, however, the moment carried an undeniable added weight. It marked a break from the post-9/11 norms of suspicion and overpolicing many had grown accustomed to, even if no one pretended a finish line had been crossed. If the election signaled anything, it was that the city was willing, at least for now, to test what happens when the old guardrails of governance are loosened and we head in a new direction.

When Mamdani finally took the stage, the energy spiked. At 34, he is the city’s youngest mayor in over a century and, as its first Muslim mayor, the first to take the oath of office on a Quran. Sanders administered the oath, a detail that might have seemed odd given that the senator represents Vermont, but Mamdani cut his political teeth working on Sanders’ campaign, borrowed much of his democratic socialist vocabulary from him, and describes the senator as a political role model. In that sense, it appeared more like an anointing than a procedural formality: the veteran of the American left passing the baton to a younger standard-bearer.

But that raises an obvious question, one that has hovered over Mamdani’s rise from the start: Is he controversial more for his politics or for his religion? The honest answer is that the two are often deliberately collapsed into each other by critics who want to scare Americans with labels, a tactic that would be funny were they not so malignant: think “Islamo-Marxism” and “Islamo-Communism.” Both are shorthand for something foreign.

This is where I should stop and define what democratic socialism is, as it’s been at the center of much of the misinformation about Mamdani. Democratic socialism, as practiced by Zohran Mamdani, is not about abolishing markets or nationalizing everything in sight. It’s about using democratic government to make sure basic needs—housing, transit, health care, education—aren’t treated like luxury goods. New York already runs on plenty of these ideas: public schools, public hospitals, rent regulation, the subway. No one panics when the fire department shows up. We’ve just decided, over time, that some things work better when profit isn’t the point.

There’s also the religion—one that Mamdani and I share. He ran openly as a Muslim in a city still shaped by 9/11, where the backlash that followed turned Muslims in New York and New Jersey into targets of NYPD surveillance and, at times, convenient scapegoats for elected officials. Mamdani made efforts to reassure skeptics, but he didn’t shrink himself to avoid the familiar panic. Claims of divided loyalties will echo, along with other decades-old tropes. Instead, he adopted a posture many of us learned long ago: smiling, appealing to shared humanity and civil rights, refusing to let bad-faith attacks dictate his mood. When you’re held up by a community, the panic stays external.

Then, Mayor Zohran Kwame Mamdani delivered his speech. It was measured, full of gratitude, hope, and defiance, which was the opposite of how Mamdani’s rise has been framed in much of the country. For months, the panic had been building, growing louder and more unhinged the closer he got to actually winning. After he defeated Andrew Cuomo, parts of the right responded with something less like political critique than demographic hallucination. In November, Sen. Tommy Tuberville warned that New York was already lost.

“We just saw what happened in New York,” he said. “We lost New York. It will be completely Muslim in three or four years.” In the senator’s framing, Mamdani is an appendage of a nefarious global force seeking to destroy America. Mamdani’s speech showed he understands New York, and America, possibly better than anyone else, definitely more than Tuberville.

Tuberville, who has described Islam as a “cult” and suggested that Muslims are “here to conquer,” is not fringe. His comments circulated widely, echoed by conservative commentators and algorithmically rewarded for their certainty. “He was just sworn in on the Quran,” wrote right-wing influencer Benny Johnson. “New York, we tried to warn you.”

Warned us of what, exactly? It’s not clear. That a Muslim might govern openly as himself? That a holy book might briefly appear on a municipal stage? That the city where nearly every language and religion on earth already exists in public would somehow collapse under the weight of its own plurality?

Throughout, Zionist protesters across the barricades tried to break the moment with air horns, their blare faint but audible on the official recording. No one onstage flinched. Mamdani didn’t pause. The crowd didn’t turn. The speech carried on, uninterrupted.

When the new mayor turned to the question of who this city is for, he was blunt. “They will be Russian Jewish immigrants in Brighton Beach,” he said. “They will be Palestinian New Yorkers in Bay Ridge who will no longer have to contend with a politics that speaks of universalism and then makes them the exception.” I interpreted it as a rebuke of a Democratic culture long comfortable invoking unity while carving out exclusions.

Standing there in the cold, watching Mamdani rest his hand on the Quran while Sanders administered the oath, I found the disconnect impossible to ignore. There was no takeover, no creeping caliphate. Just a bundled-up mayor promising to govern “audaciously,” speaking to a crowd that looked exactly like New York at its best. What struck me most was how unremarkable it all was, in a good way. He didn’t brandish it as a symbol or treat the moment like a breakthrough to be celebrated. He took the oath. He finished. The ceremony moved on. It was quiet, almost defiant in its normality. It was a welcome change.

And yet I felt something else too—something I hadn’t quite expected. A flicker of satisfaction. A guilty, bracing thrill.

For years, Muslim Americans have been instructed explicitly to keep our heads down. To soften ourselves. To reassure the anxious who are deeply misinformed about the content of the Quran and the nature of its followers. I saw it in my family too. My father, who worked in New York as a taxicab and black car driver for 30 years, told me to be grateful, to be quiet, and to avoid bringing any extra attention to ourselves or our community. That we had enough problems to deal with and didn’t need to give anyone an excuse to train their Islamophobia on us. My mom took a slightly different approach, noting that it was up to us to gently prove we are not the nightmare someone else keeps insisting we are by being nice, being charitable at every opportunity, and making sure everyone knows we’re Muslim if only just to offer them another glimpse of what we are to contrast with what they might assume.

Watching the panic unfold, I realized that part of what felt so electric about this moment was that, for once, the discomfort and uncertainty had shifted off my shoulders and onto those who hate American Muslims the most.

For just a moment, it wasn’t Muslims being asked to stomach their fear for what the future might hold. It was the people who hate us trying—and failing—to make Mamdani into some Muslim ideologue who moonlights as a jihadist with dual allegiance to a nonexistent global Muslim cabal.

In his speech, Mamdani directly addressed his skeptics, those who “view this administration with distrust or disdain,” and told them plainly: “If you are a New Yorker, I am your mayor.” He invoked what he loved about growing up in the city, the languages, foods, and neighborhoods, the fact that he, a Muslim, can have bagel and lox as one of his weekly rituals. He described a place that looked and sounded exactly like the crowd shivering in front of him. It’s hopeful to see oneself in the top seat. It’s a new experience for us, something others get to experience. Can’t we just have that?

I was cold and extremely ready to go home, more than confident I had seen enough for my story and eager to be out of the cold. And then, outside, like a glitch in the city, I ran into Curtis Sliwa—the 2025 Republican candidate for New York mayor. He was alone, wandering.

He told me he had RSVP’d and “was in line with all the peeps waiting to get in” but had never made it inside. He didn’t even catch Mamdani’s speech. The line was too long. I asked why he hadn’t gone to the front, that surely someone would have recognized him and ushered him inside. He laughed and said he preferred it this way: “Come on. I’m no VIP. I’m just one of the regular people out of the subway into the streets.” He said he had no regrets about his campaign. He smiled when he recalled Mamdani saying he’d rather be trapped in an elevator with Sliwa than Cuomo. He told me he planned to support Mamdani. “He won fair and square. He should be given a chance to put his agenda into place. Even if you disagree with him politically, you got to say: If he is successful, then the city is successful, the state, the country, everyone is successful. But you have haters out there, and that’s what life is about.”

He admitted he felt wanted by neither Republicans nor Democrats. “I’m an outlier,” he said. “I’d rather be with the people.”

Then he vanished into the afternoon just as quickly as he’d appeared.

What stayed with me wasn’t just pride, though there was plenty of that. It was relief. Relief that, for once, a side selling hope instead of fear had won. And it was clear this wasn’t some narrow Muslim celebration. Muslims largely supported Mamdani, but they weren’t automatic votes. They were earned. He campaigned for them, chasing them around at one of the public celebrations that make New York such an exciting place to live.

That’s the complexity of it. The pride of watching a Muslim achieve something historic, paired with the humility of knowing that this victory doesn’t belong to Muslims alone. Zohran Mamdani isn’t a “Muslim mayor” the way his critics insist.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The final version of HPE&#39;s own flavor of Unix, HP-UX 11i v3, is now out of support. It is the end of a line that started in 1982.

According to HPE&#39;s HP-UX support matrix, the end of life for the final version was the last day of last year:

HPE Integrity: standard support through 31-Dec-2025

The product status is now &quot;Mature Software Product Support without Sustaining Engineering through at least 31-Dec-2028.&quot;

HPE&#39;s version numbers are complex, but the last release of HP-UX that we can find is HP-UX 11i v3 release 2505.11iv3, which was released on May 22, 2025, for HPE&#39;s Integrity servers – as The Register put it a decade ago, &quot;Integrity servers means the Superdome ones running HP-UX with Intel&#39;s fading Itanium processors and NUMA.&quot;

At least one website misses it already. Last week, OSnews reported &quot;HP-UX hits end-of-life today, and I&#39;m sad.&quot; Some see this as a potential opportunity. For instance, SUSE used the news to offer an escape route, explaining &quot;Why SUSE Linux is the Natural Heir.&quot;

HP-UX had a good run, after a long and very varied history. The first version ran on the HP 9000 Series 500 range of 32-bit machines based on the HP FOCUS multi-chip CISC processor. In 1984, the Hewlett-Packard Journal ran a detailed article on how that port was created, based on a kernel called SUN – not related to Sun Microsystems&#39; SunOS. The Bitsavers site – run by Al Kossow, who recently recovered UNIX V4 from a 52-year-old tape – has a scan of HP&#39;s 1985 brochure [PDF].

Then came a Motorola 68000 version, which ran on top of an AT&T Unix kernel, unusually stored in a ROM chip, in HP&#39;s pioneering portable Unix workstation, the HP Integral PC [PDF].

After that, it was rewritten again for HP&#39;s own in-house RISC architecture, PA-RISC. This was once a well-liked processor with its own native version of NeXTstep. At one point, Commodore investigated using it for a next-generation Amiga, the Amiga Hombre. However, the writing was on the wall for PA-RISC once HP announced it would be uniting with Intel&#39;s new EPIC architecture, as the infant Register reported all the way back in 1999.

For some time, both PA-RISC and Itanium versions were maintained more or less in parallel, until the last few releases, which were for the Itanium only. After that, the writing was on the wall and this news should not be too unexpected. Back in 2012, The Reg reported that the then-monolithic HP had started, then spiked, an x86-64 edition. Once that escape route was shut down and Itanium died, HP-UX was fated to die with it. Intel itself ended Itanium shipments in 2021 and with no new processors, that meant no new Itanium servers, and that left nothing new for HP-UX to run on.

A couple of years later, we covered the end of Linux on Itanium, but we&#39;re happy to report that we were wrong that nobody would keep maintaining it out of tree: the EPIC Linux project is still doing just that, and the T2 Linux distro still supports it. T2&#39;s lead maintainer, René Rebe, is also behind the Itanium support in GCC. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Important news for Gmail power users: Google is dropping the feature whereby Gmail can collect mail from other email accounts over POP3.

The company hasn&#39;t exactly gone out of its way to call attention to this – like actually telling anybody anything. The news appears in a support note with a sign on the door saying &quot;Learn about upcoming changes to Gmailify & POP in Gmail.&quot; The article itself is less euphemistic than its title:

Starting January 2026, Gmail will no longer provide support for the following features:

Gmailify: This feature allows you to get special features like spam protection or inbox organization applied to your third-party email account.

Check mail from other accounts: Fetching emails from third-party accounts into your Gmail account, with POP, will no longer be supported.

Firefox users, incidentally, will find the support pages locked. We had to use Chrome. When Google says there are &quot;changes&quot; to Gmailify, that really means that the Gmailify feature will be shut down.

Why is Google doing this now? Opinions vary but some market onlookers suspect it is related to the fact that POP3 requires sending passwords in plaintext. We have asked Google to comment.

About 10,000 years ago (in binary), when the future Reg FOSS desk still had a mostly full head of hair, we explained how to get the most out of Gmail, in what, by our reckoning, was the fifth piece we ever penned for this mighty organ. The second feature of the service that we called out was using it to consolidate multiple email accounts into one: collecting email from other services over POP3, which you could manage using the Gmail webmail interface. Its then-massive one gigabyte of free storage was ideal for this, and we used it ourselves to bring our little-used Hotmail, Yahoo, and AOL email into the Gmail inbox.

Well, that&#39;s going away this month. You can still access those accounts via the Gmail mobile app, but the Gmail service itself will no longer retrieve them.

As well as simple consolidation, Gmailify offered a simple, familiar interface to email from other providers. One person using this was web pioneer Jamie Zawinski for staff email at his San Francisco nightclub DNA Lounge.

As he indicates in a blog post titled Today in &quot;Google broke email,&quot; he&#39;s not happy. We don&#39;t blame him. He also notes that the company&#39;s suggestion to switch to using IMAP doesn&#39;t help him.

If you rely on Gmail to access some older email accounts in this way, it might be time to switch to using a local email client, the old-fashioned way. We suggest MZLA Thunderbird: it&#39;s free, runs the same on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and it can talk to all manner of email servers, including Microsoft Exchange Server, as well as trusty old Usenet, and chat via XMPP and Matrix. It&#39;s another reason why you might still want a local client in the era of webmail. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Satellite phone services could play a part in Britain&#39;s troubled Emergency Services Network (ESN) project, including SpaceX&#39;s Starlink platform, to plug gaps in the coverage provided by terrestrial network tech.

The UK Space Agency (UKSA) has invited interested parties for input on how so-called direct-to-device services delivered from satellites in low Earth orbit could ensure that emergency services personnel stay connected wherever they are in the country.

Acting on behalf of the Home Office&#39;s Emergency Services Mobile Communications Programme (ESMCP), the UKSA invited participants to explore how existing and emerging technology (including satellites) could augment the ESN to provide coverage in remote areas and &quot;locations which are challenging to service using standard transmission methods.&quot;

Starlink is the satellite operator with the most developed direct-to-cell services, now selling these with T-Mobile in the US and Kyivstar in Ukraine, among others. However, it is limited to sending text messages and location information, with data and voice capabilities planned for the future.

This matters little at the moment, as the ESN project has been beset by numerous delays and delivery is expected no earlier than December 2029, a full decade later than was originally planned.

BT Group, whose EE subsidiary is set to provide the actual telecoms for ESN, already has an agreement with Starlink to provide broadband services to UK customers, signed last year, making it a strong candidate for any satellite extension to ESN.

ESN is intended to supersede the aging Airwave system currently used by the Police, Fire and Rescue, and Ambulance services, which is based on legacy TETRA technology.

The replacement will use EE&#39;s commercial 4G and 5G infrastructure, with smartphones as the endpoint device, but with the ability to emulate push-to-talk radio as well as providing modern video and data services.

Last year, the UK government awarded IBM a contract worth more than a billion pounds to deliver the User Services for ESN, while EE&#39;s cellular network provides the underpinning physical infrastructure.

IBM replaced Motorola Solutions, which was awarded the original contract to develop ESN back in 2015, but the company then bought out Airwave Solutions, meaning it had ownership of the existing system as well.

Britain&#39;s competition regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), later found that Motorola was abusing its position to push up prices for Airwave services. A price cap was imposed, while the Home Office and Motorola agreed to terminate its contract to deliver the new ESN in January 2023.

Starlink is not the only satellite operator touting direct-to-device services that allow users telecoms access outside the reach of terrestrial cell towers. AST SpaceMobile plans similar capabilities and has signed up Vodafone Group as a partner in Europe, but services have yet to be announced. Eutelsat is also understood to be working on direct-to-device services via its OneWeb LEO satellites. ®

            <h2>Capita tells civil servants to wait for chatbots to fix pension portal woes</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/05/capita_pension_portal_chatbots/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Capita has told users of its ailing UK civil service pension portal to wait until new chatbots go live before contacting it again about problems.

In November 2023, the UK outsourcer was awarded a £239 million ($322 million) contract to run the Civil Service Pension Scheme (CSPS), which includes 1.7 million members and manages future pension benefits of around £189 billion.

The service went live on December 1 last year, greeting members with strings of errors and malfunctions. Unrecognized passwords and usernames, broken and circular links were among the problems while the website appeared unfinished and untested, with headers and other features displaying dummy text.

In an email to members dated December 17 – seen by The Reg – managing director Chris Clements said Capita was &quot;working tirelessly to deliver the experience&quot; they expect.

&quot;New chatbots and ways to contact CSPS will be going live in the coming weeks. As such, if your enquiry is not urgent, we kindly ask that you wait until these go live in the New Year before contacting CSPS again. This will help us focus on delivering these improvements and ensure a smooth transition for all members,&quot; he said.

The email claims the service was &quot;the largest ever transition of a public sector pension scheme to a new administrator going live on time.&quot;

In the future, Clements promised &quot;one of the biggest services in the United Kingdom with AI at its core.&quot;

&quot;By March, across CSPS, we will have introduced a raft of intuitive digital tools all aimed at giving you more transparency and control. A new Track My Case service in the portal will provide real-time visibility of your case&#39;s progression, while the new Retire Online will give support in planning and managing retirement more efficiently,&quot; Clements told members.

&quot;As the service matures, further automation and AI will improve accuracy and speed, enabling you to access more information and complete more tasks online rather than over email or phone.&quot;

Service users taking to social media were bewildered by the response. &quot;We don&#39;t need AI at the core of the website, we need it to function normally and not have placeholder text all over the place,&quot; one said on Reddit, summing up the reaction to the missive.

The Register has asked Capita to comment.

One source close to the discussion between the Cabinet Office – which awarded the contract – and Capita users told The Register that the system was likely to have been impeded in the early days of the launch. They said the volume of scheme members attempting to set up logins and view pension information &quot;just to check&quot; whether their details were correct was a contributing factor. Members have been advised to delay accessing the new portal until early spring when annual statements are due, unless they have a particular issue they wish to resolve or query.

In an earlier statement, a Capita spokesperson apologized for any inconvenience caused during the launch. They said that after the blackout of the system in the last week of November, and the significant backlog inherited from the previous provider, Capita experienced several times the normal volume of contacts in the first two days of operations.

MyCSP ran the scheme on behalf of the Cabinet Office under a £238 million contract that was first agreed in 2012. MyCSP was a mutual joint partnership between employee partners, who owned 25 percent of the company, and a private sector partner, Equiniti. It took over from Capita, the previous provider, in 2016.

In December last year, public service union PCS said that the CSPS was getting support from Microsoft, one of the platform partners. Capita declined to provide further details. ®

            <h2>New Zealand orders review into ManageMyHealth cyberattack</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/05/nz_managemyhealth_breach_review/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">New Zealand health minister Simeon Brown has ordered a review into the cyberattack at ManageMyHealth, which threatens the data of hundreds of thousands of Kiwis.

Brown told reporters on Monday that he asked the government to begin reviewing the incident, including its cause, scope, the company&#39;s defenses, and the wider impacts to data access across the country.

ManageMyHealth is a private company that offers a platform used by medical facilities across New Zealand to access patient health records. According to its website, it handles the data for around 1.85 million locals, and the breach affected an estimated 6-7 percent of them.

&quot;This breach of ManageMyHealth data is incredibly concerning, particularly to the over 100,000 patients and their families who have had their very most personal data, which is their health data, breached through this incident,&quot; Brown said.

&quot;It&#39;s an incredible concern to the government and to Health New Zealand, and the government is throwing a significant amount of resource at addressing this and supporting ManageMyHealth as they respond to this incident.&quot;

Brown emphasized this information represents deeply intimate patient details. He added that regardless of whether the data is maintained by public or private organizations, it requires the highest level of security and privacy safeguards, and the nation must significantly improve its handling of such sensitive information.

A fact sheet posted to ManageMyHealth&#39;s website states the company believes the incident is contained, and digital forensics experts are now combing the evidence to establish the full extent of the attack.

&quot;Our immediate priority is safeguarding the integrity and security of our systems,&quot; said ManageMyHealth. &quot;We are working with independent cybersecurity specialists, the Privacy Commissioner, the New Zealand Police, and Health New Zealand to coordinate our response. We have implemented additional monitoring and security improvements.&quot;

A miscreant going by the name Kazu claimed responsibility for the attack via a cybercrime forum post on December 30. They said the stolen data included more than 428,000 files, which would be opened up for sale if ManageMyHealth did not pay the $60,000 ransom demand by January 15.

However, on Telegram, Kazu said on January 3 that all the data would be released within 48 hours if the company did not pay.

New Zealand&#39;s official stance on paying ransoms mirrors that of its Western geopolitical allies: do not do it.

Kazu released snippets of the data via Telegram, although the links were flagged as abuse material on the file-sharing site and are no longer usable.

IT consultant Cody Cooper, who told RNZ he investigated the data involved before the links were taken down, said it includes passport scans, details of patients&#39; conditions, nude images, and more.

ManageMyHealth refused to &quot;speculate&quot; on what kinds of data were included, saying that efforts are still underway to determine what was downloaded and/or accessed.

It stated: &quot;&#39;Accessed&#39; means an unauthorised party may have viewed or opened files. &#39;Downloaded&#39; means files were copied out of the environment. Independent forensics are being used to confirm what was accessed and what may have been downloaded.

&quot;We will not speculate about what was accessed or by whom. Our priority is to confirm what happened, protect data, and provide affected people with information that is correct.&quot;

Brown told media that ManageMyHealth applied for an injunction on Monday to prevent the dissemination of any data that the cybercriminal releases.

The company advised users to regularly change their passwords and use authentication apps for multi-factor protection.

It also said it would never ask for passwords or one-time codes over the phone, and users should be wary of potential scams targeting them.

&quot;We are still investigating what information may have been accessed,&quot; the company said. &quot;In general, personal information can sometimes be misused for identity theft or scams.

&quot;If we confirm that your information was affected, we will notify you directly. As a precaution, we recommend following online safety best practices.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Opinion At the end of last year, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued five of the largest TV companies, accusing them of excessive and deceptive surveillance of their customers.

Paxton reserved special venom for the two China-based members of the quintet. His argument is that unlike Sony, Samsung, and LG, if Hisense and TCL have conducted surveillance in the way the lawsuits accuse them of, they&#39;d potentially be required to share all data with the Chinese Communist Party.

It is a rare pleasure to state that legal action against tech companies is cogent, timely, focused, and – if the allegations are true – deserves to succeed. It is less pleasant to predict that even if one, several, or all of these manufacturers did what they&#39;re accused of, and were sanctioned for it, it would not put the safeguards in place to stop such practices from recurring.

At the heart of the cases is the fact that most smart TVs use Automatic Content Recognition (ACR) to send rapid-fire screenshots back to company servers, where they are analyzed to finely detail your TV usage. This sometimes covers not just streaming video, but whatever apps or external devices are displaying, and the allegations are that every other bit of personal data the set can scry is also pulled in. Installed apps can have trackers, data from other devices can be swept up.

These lawsuits aside, smart TV companies more generally boast of their prying prowess to the ecosystem of data exploiters from which they make their money. The companies are much less open about the mechanisms and amount of data collection, and deploy a barrage of defenses to entice customers into turning the stuff on and stop them from turning it off. You may have already seen massive on-screen Ts&Cs with only ACCEPT as an option, ACR controls buried in labyrinthine menu jails, features that stop working even if you complete the obstacle course – all this is old news.

How old are these practices? TV maker Vizio got hit by multiple suits between 2015 and 2017, and collected $2.2 million in fines from the Federal Trade Commission and the state of New Jersey, as well as settling related class actions to the tune of $17 million. The FTC said the fines settled claims the maker had used installed software on its TVs to collect viewing data on 11 million TVs without their owners&#39; knowledge or consent. A court order said the manufacturer had to delete data collected before 2016 and promise to &quot;prominently disclose and obtain affirmative express consent&quot; for data collection and sharing from then on.

Yet ten years on, the problem has only got worse. There is no law against data collection, and companies often eat the fines, adjust their behavior to the barest minimum compliance, and set about finding new ways to entomb your digital twin in their datacenters.

It&#39;s not even as if more regulation helps. The European GDPR data protection and privacy regs give consumers powerful rights and companies strict obligations, which smart TV makers do not rush to observe. Researchers claim the problem is growing no matter which side of the Atlantic your TV is watching you on.

All this is nothing when you gaze across the Pacific. Japanese, Taiwanese, and South Korean companies exist in democracies where the rule of law and consumer pressure can force change. That same rule of law limits misbehavior by states. This does not even begin to be true in China.

It is hard to overstate the control the Chinese Communist Party has over industry. Global think tanks like Jamestown say efforts to align all aspects of industry with the structure and strategies of the CCP go far beyond funding and law, embedding party cadres within companies and matching corporate roadmaps with party aims. When Chinese tech companies talk of becoming the world&#39;s dominant force in IoT, that is the CCP talking. We don&#39;t have to worry about Chinese state security building a global surveillance and control network – we can watch it happening. It&#39;s not even a conspiracy theory. Conspiracies require secrets. This is all out there in plain sight.

There are so many ways to stop this, and we probably want all of them. On the purely technical side, the problem isn&#39;t how to block a smart TV from acting as an agent of a foreign power. If you&#39;re reading this, you&#39;ll know about finding which IP addresses are involved and blocking them. Everyone else needs a zero-knowledge, vanishingly cheap, plug-and-play smart thing. One that&#39;s completely trustworthy. You can sketch a block diagram for that and the services that make it work in five minutes. Making it sustainable, universal, and desirable, well, that&#39;s harder. If we want it, we can do it.

The same goes for regulations that demand transparency and user control that means something. The same also goes for the education and publicity to move the problem from &quot;raising concerns&quot; to &quot;yikes!&quot;

A big lawsuit in Texas is none of those things. It might lead to them, in time. What will make a difference is waking up to what&#39;s going on in our own living rooms.

We have the world&#39;s most powerful and least accountable authoritarian regime extending its security apparatus into our most intimate lives, and not out of idle curiosity. The big picture is more than a 65-inch screen. ®

While everyone is paying attention to the cool new stuff being exhibited at CES at this very moment, there are some good deals to be had on devices that are already available but equally cool. For example, the 4th-gen Google Nest Learning Thermostat, which our reviewer called “a stunner,” is now available for $229.99 at Amazon, and a couple of dollars less (depending on which color you choose) at Walmart, a savings of about $50.

Google’s latest Nest Learning Thermostat offers a sleeker design, support for Matter, and a Soli radar sensor to detect if a person is approaching. It also includes a second-gen remote temperature sensor for monitoring the temp in a room of your choosing. Read our review.

The Google Nest Learning Thermostat debuted in December 2024, has a beautifully designed screen with a large, easy-to-see display, and offers a myriad of smart features. For example, it automatically adjusts your heating and cooling schedule based on how you use it. Besides temperature, time, date, and weather, it will show you the outdoor air quality index score, something that many of us would welcome. It offers what are called Smart Schedules, allowing you to create presets that will adjust automatically as your schedule and the seasons change. And it can work with any smart home platform that supports Matter. Read our review.

8BitDo’s second officially licensed wireless Xbox controller is also its most expensive gamepad to date. The 8BitDo Ultimate 3E Controller for Xbox follows last August’s Ultimate 3-mode Controller for Xbox — Rare 40th Anniversary Edition with some excellent upgrades, less branding, and a big price hike. It’s got tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) joysticks, Hall effect triggers with adjustable stops for improved reaction times, and swappable ABXY buttons. It was announced at CES 2026 but isn’t expected to launch until sometime in Q2 of 2026 for $149.99, putting it in competition with more premium console controllers like the recently announced ASUS ROG Raikiri II.

The Ultimate 3E Controller is also one of 8BitDo’s most customizable controllers. It comes preinstalled with two standard joysticks that can be replaced with two tall joysticks, a “thick-neck” joystick, or a dome-capped stick. The standard metal D-pad can be swapped out to one with a circular design, but it’s the controller’s ABXY buttons that stand out. Unlike the 8BitDo Pro 3, which only lets you swap out the button caps, the Ultimate 3E includes two interchangeable button modules: one with squishy silicone membrane buttons, and one with clicky micro switches that are accessible by removing the controller’s faceplate.

In addition to the Hall effect triggers, the Ultimate 3E has two pairs of shoulder buttons, a pair of remappable bumpers on the back, and six-axis motion controls that are limited to PC gaming. The bases of both joysticks are surrounded with RGB rings that light up and react to movements, but battery life is still rated at a decent 18 hours of playtime between charges on an included dock.

The Ultimate 3E doesn’t connect to the Xbox using Microsoft’s native wireless protocol and instead relies on a bundled 2.4GHz USB dongle. But Bluetooth is included for connecting to Apple and Android devices, or you can tether to consoles and PCs using a USB cable to minimize lag. The controller is also compatible with 8BitDo’s Ultimate Software X (a variant of its Ultimate Software V2 for its Xbox controllers) so you can customize its performance and remap controls to make custom profiles that are swappable using a button on the Ultimate 3E.

Robot vacuums have officially entered their aromatherapy era.

At CES 2026, Anker debuted the Eufy S2, a powerful robot vacuum and mop hybrid that cleans your floors while also perfuming your home.

According to the company, the robovac features a built-in “aromatherapy system” with scent options that include bamboo, sage, bergamot, lychee, citrus, and basil. The idea is to perfume your space while the robot cleans, though how noticeable — or welcome — that will be in everyday use remains to be seen.

Aside from trying to make your home smell like a spa, the Eufy S2 also is a powerful cleaning machine — at least on paper. It’s rated for up to 30,000Pa of suction, placing it near the top of the category. While suction alone doesn’t tell the whole story, a figure this high suggests the Eufy is designed to handle heavier cleaning jobs, not just basic maintenance. The robot also uses AI-powered obstacle detection and real-time 3D mapping to identify rooms, avoid messes, and steer clear of more than 200 objects, including smaller obstacles like rug tassels.

On the mopping front, the Eufy S2 includes a roller mop that cleans itself up to six times per second using electrolyzed water, which Anker says helps kill bacteria without relying on added chemical cleaners. It can also lift itself up to two inches to keep carpets dry, while applying up to 3.3 pounds of downward pressure when mopping hard floors. The mop can also extend up to 15mm to better clean along baseboards and edges, and Anker says its new DuoSpiral brush is designed to reduce tangling.

Rounding things out is a cleaning station that can refill the onboard water tank, automatically empty the dustbin, and wash and dry its own mops — essentially creating a nearly hands-free cleaning experience.

The $1,599 robot vacuum will be widely available starting January 20th, with a US presale beginning on January 6th.

The new Eufy line of video doorbells, smart locks, and wall light cams offers better style and more features.

Anker is introducing a number of new devices for the new year as part of its Eufy line of smart home appliances, including the Eufy Video Doorbell S4, the Eufy Smart Lock E40, and the Eufy Solar Wall Light Cam S4. New designs and upgraded features are some of the main attractions of this year’s models.

The Eufy Video Doorbell S4 has a clean, simple design, much improved from predecessors such as the FamiLock S3 Max. The 3K camera provides 9MP resolution and a 180-degree panoramic view of the area surrounding the door. A new AI protocol provides motion sensing and facial recognition. The doorbell can be powered by either battery or wiring and integrates with Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Home. It will be available in the first quarter of 2026 with a price of $249.

The Eufy Smart Lock E40 also offers a new, more elegant look. It is equipped with a 2K HD camera offering wide-angle coverage, night vision, and facial recognition. It is battery powered using a 15,000mAh main battery along with a built-in 800mAh backup. The E40 is compatible with Matter, so it can be used with a variety of systems from Apple, Amazon, Google, and others. It will also be available in the first quarter of this year for $299.

Finally, the Eufy Solar Wall Light Cam S4 provides a lot of security with its 4K night vision and F1.6 adjustable lens; pan and tilt means you can cover a wide area range. It comes with a detachable 2W solar panel that powers a 10,000mAh battery for, according to the company, up to two months of use. You can connect it with other Eufy devices for better coverage and use its AI features to recognize people, vehicles, or animals. It is compatible with a range of systems, including Apple Home, Alexa, and Google Home, and will be available in the first quarter of this year for $199.99.

Anker has announced three new charging solutions at CES 2026 including an update to its compact Nano Charger. For the first time it now features a small screen on the front providing details on power delivery and your connected phone’s charge level.

The new Anker Nano Charger is comparable in size to the 45W single-port USB-C chargers Anker currently sells, but it delivers more functionality, particularly when used to charge some Apple devices. The charger recognizes and identifies iPhone models dating back to the 15 series, and iPad Pro models from 2020 onwards, when they’re connected. It uses a three-stage power delivery system to manage temperatures to help prolong battery health and shares those details, including the device’s charge level on its screen. The Nano Charger will work with non-Apple hardware, but may not provide as many details.

The Nano Charger’s USB-C port is now located on top to accommodate the new front-facing screen. To help ensure it remains accessible, even when connected to a crowded power strip, the charger’s folding prongs now rotate 180 degrees so the USB-C port can be positioned in two different orientations. The new Anker Nano Charger is expected to launch in late January 2026 for $39.99.

Arriving a little later in Q1 2026 is Anker’s new Prime Wireless Charging Station, which joins a growing list of 3-in-1 folding stands with Qi2.2-compatible 25W wireless charging pads. As with similar devices from competitors like Kuxiu, Anker’s 3-in-1 can simultaneously charge a smartphone, your earbuds, and an Apple Watch, but only the phone will charge at 25W. Anker’s differentiating its new charging stand with the addition of an “airflow cooling system” to manage temperatures and help improve charging efficiency, but that added functionality pushes its price to $149.99, making it one of the more expensive 3-in-1 chargers.

When it launches in late January 2026 for $69.99, Anker’s new Nano Power Strip clamps 10 extra power ports to the edge of your desk. It positions two AC outlets, two USB-A ports, and two 70W USB-C ports atop your desk, with four additional AC outlets located on the underside, along with its power cord. You’ll only get up to 70W of power delivery when using just a single USB-C port at a time, which potentially limits the usefulness of the power strip if you’re juggling a couple of laptops. But having easier access to six AC outlets is the big selling point here.

Anker announced a new version of its AeroFit Pro headphones at CES 2026 that give you the option to hear the world around you, or block it out using ANC. The traditional design of open-ear headphones leave your ears wide open, but Anker’s new Soundcore AeroFit 2 Pro have an adjustable ear hook design that can be used to reposition the drivers at the entrance of the ear canal, creating a seal that enables both passive and active noise cancellation.

Two sensors in each earbud are used to recognize how the AeroFit 2 Pro are being worn and to automatically recalibrate the EQ to ensure “consistent and optimized sound performance across both listening modes.” In earbud mode, the AeroFit 2 Pro uses six microphones and Soundcore’s Adaptive ANC 3.0 system to adjust the noise cancelling performance up to 180 times each second to adapt to changing environmental conditions. But don’t expect the ANC performance to rival the noise cancelling capabilities of flagship earbuds from Sony or Bose.

Despite using 11.8mm drivers that are smaller than the 16.2mm drivers found in the original AeroFit Pro, the new version has a much shorter battery life. The originals offered up to 14 hours of playback boosted to 46 hours with their charging case, but the new AeroFit 2 Pro max out at 7 hours (34 hours with the case) in open-ear mode, or just 5 hours (24 hours with the case) in ANC earbud mode. The AeroFit 2 Pro will be available through Soundcore’s online store starting on January 6th, 2026, for $179.99. They’ll launch in a matte black color option first, but will later be available in gloss white, matte purple, and gloss blue.

Anker is also introducing an updated version of its wireless sleep buds that use ANC, passive sound blocking, and noise generation to reduce the volume of disturbances that can disrupt sleep. Through a new partnership the Sleep A30 Special can play Calm Sleep Stories right from the Soundcore app, so you have another option to help you wind down and fall asleep at night.

The new Special version of the Sleep A30 also get a small battery boost to up to 10 hours when using Bluetooth and ANC, or up to 50 when paired with their charging case. Battery life can be further boosted to up to 16 hours on buds alone for extended overnight use, but that’s while listening to on-device noise-masking audio and with ANC turned off. The Sleep A30 Special will also be available through Soundcore’s online store starting on January 6th, 2026, for $199.99.

Anker’s new Soundcore headphones are joined by a new palm-size Bluetooth speaker called the Boom Go 3i. It’s got a 4,800mAh battery giving it up to 22 hours of battery life, but that’s while using a power-saving “eco mode” that limits performance and features. Expect that to be much shorter with the volume maxed and the Boom Go 3i’s LED lighting in use. The Boom Go 3i offers up to 15W of sound, which is much louder than JLab’s similarly sized Pop Party speaker, and it’s expected to be priced at around $65 to $80 when it launches in March 2026.

Welcome to Kenya’s Great Carbon Valley: a bold new gamble to fight climate change

In June last year, startup Octavia Carbon began running a high-stakes test in the small town of Gilgil in south-central Kenya. It’s harnessing some of the excess energy generated by vast clouds of steam under the Earth’s surface to power prototypes of a machine that promises to remove carbon dioxide from the air in a manner that the company says is efficient, affordable, and—crucially—scalable.The company’s long-term vision is undoubtedly ambitious—it wants to prove that direct air capture (DAC), as the process is known, can be a powerful tool to help the world keep temperatures from rising to ever more dangerous levels.

But DAC is also a controversial technology, unproven at scale and wildly expensive to operate. On top of that, Kenya’s Maasai people have plenty of reasons to distrust energy companies. Read the full story.

This article is also part of the Big Story series: MIT Technology Review’s most important, ambitious reporting. The stories in the series take a deep look at the technologies that are coming next and what they will mean for us and the world we live in. Check out the rest of them here.

AI Wrapped: The 14 AI terms you couldn’t avoid in 2025

If the past 12 months have taught us anything, it’s that the AI hype train is showing no signs of slowing. It’s hard to believe that at the beginning of the year, DeepSeek had yet to turn the entire industry on its head, Meta was better known for trying (and failing) to make the metaverse cool than for its relentless quest to dominate superintelligence, and vibe coding wasn’t a thing.

If that’s left you feeling a little confused, fear not. Our writers have taken a look back over the AI terms that dominated the year, for better or worse. Read the full list.

MIT Technology Review’s most popular stories of 2025

2025 was a busy and productive year here at MIT Technology Review. We published magazine issues on power, creativity, innovation, bodies, relationships, and security. We hosted 14 exclusive virtual conversations with our editors and outside experts in our subscriber-only series, Roundtables, and held two events on MIT’s campus. And we published hundreds of articles online, following new developments in computing, climate tech, robotics, and more.As the new year begins, we wanted to give you a chance to revisit some of this work with us. Whether we were covering the red-hot rise of artificial intelligence or the future of biotech, these are some of the stories that resonated the most with our readers.

How aging clocks can help us understand why we age—and if we can reverse itWrinkles and gray hairs aside, it can be difficult to know how well—or poorly—someone’s body is truly aging. A person who develops age-related diseases earlier in life, or has other biological changes associated with aging, might be considered “biologically older” than a similar-age person who doesn’t have those changes. Some 80-year-olds will be weak and frail, while others are fit and active.Over the past decade, scientists have been uncovering new methods of looking at the hidden ways our bodies are aging. And what they’ve found is changing our understanding of aging itself. Read the full story.—Jessica Hamzelou

            <div id="article-text">MIT Technology Review’s What’s Next series looks across industries, trends, and technologies to give you a first look at the future. You can read the rest of them here.

In an industry in constant flux, sticking your neck out to predict what’s coming next may seem reckless. (AI bubble? What AI bubble?) But for the last few years we’ve done just that—and we’re doing it again.

How did we do last time? We picked five hot AI trends to look out for in 2025, including what we called generative virtual playgrounds, a.k.a world models (check: From Google DeepMind’s Genie 3 to World Labs’s Marble, tech that can generate realistic virtual environments on the fly keeps getting better and better); so-called reasoning models (check: Need we say more? Reasoning models have fast become the new paradigm for best-in-class problem solving); a boom in AI for science (check: OpenAI is now following Google DeepMind by setting up a dedicated team to focus on just that); AI companies that are cozier with national security (check: OpenAI reversed position on the use of its technology for warfare to sign a deal with the defense-tech startup Anduril to help it take down battlefield drones); and legitimate competition for Nvidia (check, kind of: China is going all in on developing advanced AI chips, but Nvidia’s dominance still looks unassailable—for now at least).

So what’s coming in 2026? Here are our big bets for the next 12 months.

The last year shaped up as a big one for Chinese open-source models. In January, DeepSeek released R1, its open-source reasoning model, and shocked the world with what a relatively small firm in China could do with limited resources. By the end of the year, “DeepSeek moment” had become a phrase frequently tossed around by AI entrepreneurs, observers, and builders—an aspirational benchmark of sorts.

It was the first time many people realized they could get a taste of top-tier AI performance without going through OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google.

Open-weight models like R1 allow anyone to download a model and run it on their own hardware. They are also more customizable, letting teams tweak models through techniques like distillation and pruning. This stands in stark contrast to the “closed” models released by major American firms, where core capabilities remain proprietary and access is often expensive.

As a result, Chinese models have become an easy choice. Reports by CNBC and Bloomberg suggest that startups in the US have increasingly recognized and embraced what they can offer.

One popular group of models is Qwen, created by Alibaba, the company behind China’s largest e-commerce platform, Taobao. Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct alone has 8.85 million downloads, making it one of the most widely used pretrained LLMs. The Qwen family spans a wide range of model sizes alongside specialized versions tuned for math, coding, vision, and instruction-following, a breadth that has helped it become an open-source powerhouse.

Other Chinese AI firms that were previously unsure about committing to open source are following DeepSeek’s playbook. Standouts include Zhipu’s GLM and Moonshot’s Kimi. The competition has also pushed American firms to open up, at least in part. In August, OpenAI released its first open-source model. In November, the Allen Institute for AI, a Seattle-based nonprofit, released its latest open-source model, Olmo 3.

Even amid growing US-China antagonism, Chinese AI firms’ near-unanimous embrace of open source has earned them goodwill in the global AI community and a long-term trust advantage. In 2026, expect more Silicon Valley apps to quietly ship on top of Chinese open models, and look for the lag between Chinese releases and the Western frontier to keep shrinking—from months to weeks, and sometimes less.

T​​he battle over regulating artificial intelligence is heading for a showdown. On December 11, President Donald Trump signed an executive order aiming to neuter state AI laws, a move meant to handcuff states from keeping the growing industry in check. In 2026, expect more political warfare. The White House and states will spar over who gets to govern the booming technology, while AI companies wage a fierce lobbying campaign to crush regulations, armed with the narrative that a patchwork of state laws will smother innovation and hobble the US in the AI arms race against China.

Under Trump’s executive order, states may fear being sued or starved federal funding if they clash with his vision for light-touch regulation. Big Democratic states like California—which just enacted the nation’s first frontier AI law requiring companies to publish safety testing for their AI models—will take the fight to court, arguing that only Congress can override state laws. But states that can’t afford to lose federal funding, or fear getting in Trump’s crosshairs, might fold. Still, expect to see more state lawmaking on hot-button issues, especially where Trump’s order gives states a green light to legislate. With chatbots accused of triggering teen suicides and data centers sucking up more and more energy, states will face mounting public pressure to push for guardrails.

In place of state laws, Trump promises to work with Congress to establish a federal AI law. Don’t count on it. Congress failed to pass a moratorium on state legislation twice in 2025, and we aren’t holding out hope that it will deliver its own bill this year.

AI companies like OpenAI and Meta will continue to deploy powerful super-PACs to support political candidates who back their agenda and target those who stand in their way. On the other side, super-PACs supporting AI regulation will build their own war chests to counter. Watch them duke it out at next year’s midterm elections.

The further AI advances, the more people will fight to steer its course, and 2026 will be another year of regulatory tug-of-war—with no end in sight.

Imagine a world in which you have a personal shopper at your disposal 24-7—an expert who can instantly recommend a gift for even the trickiest-to-buy-for friend or relative, or trawl the web to draw up a list of the best bookcases available within your tight budget. Better yet, they can analyze a kitchen appliance’s strengths and weaknesses, compare it with its seemingly identical competition, and find you the best deal. Then once you’re happy with their suggestion, they’ll take care of the purchasing and delivery details too.But this ultra-knowledgeable shopper isn’t a clued-up human at all—it’s a chatbot. This is no distant prediction, either. Salesforce recently said it anticipates that AI will drive $263 billion in online purchases this holiday season. That’s some 21% of all orders. And experts are betting on AI-enhanced shopping becoming even bigger business within the next few years. By 2030, between $3 trillion and $5 trillion annually will be made from agentic commerce, according to research from the consulting firm McKinsey.

Unsurprisingly, AI companies are already heavily invested in making purchasing through their platforms as frictionless as possible. Google’s Gemini app can now tap into the company’s powerful Shopping Graph data set of products and sellers, and can even use its agentic technology to call stores on your behalf. Meanwhile, back in November, OpenAI announced a ChatGPT shopping feature capable of rapidly compiling buyer’s guides, and the company has struck deals with Walmart, Target, and Etsy to allow shoppers to buy products directly within chatbot interactions.

Expect plenty more of these kinds of deals to be struck within the next year as consumer time spent chatting with AI keeps on rising, and web traffic from search engines and social media continues to plummet.

I’m going to hedge here, right out of the gate. It’s no secret that large language models spit out a lot of nonsense. Unless it’s with monkeys-and-typewriters luck, LLMs won’t discover anything by themselves. But LLMs do still have the potential to extend the bounds of human knowledge.

We got a glimpse of how this could work in May, when Google DeepMind revealed AlphaEvolve, a system that used the firm’s Gemini LLM to come up with new algorithms for solving unsolved problems. The breakthrough was to combine Gemini with an evolutionary algorithm that checked its suggestions, picked the best ones, and fed them back into the LLM to make them even better.

Google DeepMind used AlphaEvolve to come up with more efficient ways to manage power consumption by data centers and Google’s TPU chips. Those discoveries are significant but not game-changing. Yet. Researchers at Google DeepMind are now pushing their approach to see how far it will go.

And others have been quick to follow their lead. A week after AlphaEvolve came out, Asankhaya Sharma, an AI engineer in Singapore, shared OpenEvolve, an open-source version of Google DeepMind’s tool. In September, the Japanese firm Sakana AI released a version of the software called SinkaEvolve. And in November, a team of US and Chinese researchers revealed AlphaResearch, which they claim improves on one of AlphaEvolve’s already better-than-human math solutions.

There are alternative approaches too. For example, researchers at the University of Colorado Denver are trying to make LLMs more inventive by tweaking the way so-called reasoning models work. They have drawn on what cognitive scientists know about creative thinking in humans to push reasoning models toward solutions that are more outside the box than their typical safe-bet suggestions.

Hundreds of companies are spending billions of dollars looking for ways to get AI to crack unsolved math problems, speed up computers, and come up with new drugs and materials. Now that AlphaEvolve has shown what’s possible with LLMs, expect activity on this front to ramp up fast.

For a while, lawsuits against AI companies were pretty predictable: Rights holders like authors or musicians would sue companies that trained AI models on their work, and the courts generally found in favor of the tech giants. AI’s upcoming legal battles will be far messier.

The fights center on thorny, unresolved questions: Can AI companies be held liable for what their chatbots encourage people to do, as when they help teens plan suicides? If a chatbot spreads patently false information about you, can its creator be sued for defamation? If companies lose these cases, will insurers shun AI companies as clients?

In 2026, we’ll start to see the answers to these questions, in part because some notable cases will go to trial (the family of a teen who died by suicide will bring OpenAI to court in November).

At the same time, the legal landscape will be further complicated by President Trump’s executive order from December—see Michelle’s item above for more details on the brewing regulatory storm.

No matter what, we’ll see a dizzying array of lawsuits in all directions (not to mention some judges even turning to AI amid the deluge).

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

A conversation with a chatbot can shift people&#39;s political views—but the most persuasive models also spread the most misinformation.

            <div id="article-text">My daughter introduced me to El Estepario Siberiano’s YouTube channel a few months back, and I have been obsessed ever since. The Spanish drummer (real name: Jorge Garrido) posts videos of himself playing supercharged cover versions of popular tracks, hitting his drums with such jaw-dropping speed and technique that he makes other pro drummers shake their heads in disbelief. The dozens of reaction videos posted by other musicians are a joy in themselves.

Garrido is up-front about the countless hours that it took to get this good. He says he sat behind his kit almost all day, every day for years. At a time when machines appear to do it all, there’s a kind of defiance in that level of human effort. It’s why my favorites are Garrido’s covers of electronic music, where he out-drums the drum machine.

Watching Sora ­videos of Michael Jackson stealing a box of chicken nuggets or Sam Altman biting into the pink meat of a flame-grilled Pikachu has given me flashbacks to an Ed Atkins exhibition at Tate Britain I saw a few months ago. Atkins is one of the most influential and unsettling British artists of his generation. He is best known for hyper-detailed CG animations of himself (pore-perfect skin, janky movement) that play with the virtual representation of human emotions.

In The Worm we see a CGI Atkins make a long-distance call to his mother during a covid lockdown. The audio is from a recording of an actual conversation. Are we watching Atkins cry or his avatar? Our attention flickers between two realities. “When an actor breaks character during a scene, it’s known as corpsing,” Atkins has said. “I want everything I make to corpse.” Next to Atkins’s work, generative videos look like cardboard cutouts: lifelike but not alive.

What’s it like to be a pet? Australian author Laura Jean McKay’s debut novel, The Animals in That Country, will make you wish you’d never asked. A flu-like pandemic leaves people with the ability to hear what animals are saying. If that sounds too Dr. Dolittle for your tastes, rest assured: These animals are weird and nasty. A lot of the time they don’t even make any sense.

With everybody now talking to their computers, McKay’s book resets the anthropomorphic trap we’ve all fallen into. It’s a brilliant evocation of what a nonhuman mind might contain—and a meditation on the hard limits of communication.

            <h2>Job titles of the future: Head-transplant surgeon</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/02/1129416/head-transplant-surgeon-sergio-canavero-future-job/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Italian neurosurgeon Sergio Canavero has been preparing for a surgery that might never happen. His idea? Swap a sick person’s head—or perhaps just the brain—onto a younger, healthier body.

Canavero caused a stir in 2017 when he announced that a team he advised in China had exchanged heads between two corpses. But he never convinced skeptics that his technique could succeed—or to believe his claim that a procedure on a live person was imminent. The Chicago Tribune labeled him the “P.T. Barnum of transplantation.”

Canavero withdrew from the spotlight. But the idea of head transplants isn’t going away. Instead, he says, the concept has recently been getting a fresh look from life-extension enthusiasts and stealth Silicon Valley startups.

It’s been rocky. After he began publishing his surgical ideas a decade ago, Canavero says, he got his “pink slip” from the Molinette Hospital in Turin, where he’d spent 22 years on staff. “I’m an out-of-the-establishment guy. So that has made things harder, I have to say,” he says.

No other solution to aging is on the horizon. “It’s become absolutely clear over the past years that the idea of some incredible tech to rejuvenate elderly people—­happening in some secret lab, like Google—is really going nowhere,” he says. “You have to go for the whole shebang.”

He means getting a new body, not just one new organ. Canavero has an easy mastery of English idioms and an unexpected Southern twang. He says that’s due to a fascination with American comics as a child. “For me, learning the language of my heroes was paramount,” he says. “So I can shoot the breeze.”

Canavero is now an independent investigator and has advised entrepreneurs who want to create brainless human clones as a source of DNA-matched organs that wouldn’t get rejected by a recipient’s immune system. “I can tell you there are guys from top universities involved,” he says.

Combining the necessary technologies, like reliably precise surgical robots and artificial wombs to grow the clones, is going to be complex and very, very expensive. Canavero lacks the funds to take his plans further, but he believes “the money is out there” for a commercial moonshot project: “What I say to the billionaires is ‘Come together.’ You will all have your own share, plus make yourselves immortal.”

            <h2>Why inventing new emotions feels so good</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-31</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/31/1129403/new-emotions-online-life-feelings/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s a “complex and subtle emotion that elicits feelings of comfort, serenity, and a gentle sense of floating.” It’s peaceful, but more ephemeral and intangible than contentment. It might be evoked by the sight of a sunset or a moody, low-key album.

If you haven’t ever felt this sensation—or even heard of it—that’s not surprising. A Reddit user named noahjeadie generated it with ChatGPT, along with advice on how to evoke the feeling. With the right essential oils and soundtrack, apparently, you too can feel like “a soft fuzzy draping ghost floating through a lavender suburb.”

Don’t scoff: Researchers say more and more terms for these “neo-­emotions” are showing up online, describing new dimensions and aspects of feeling. Velvetmist was a key example in a journal article about the phenomenon published in July 2025. But most neo-emotions aren’t the inventions of emo artificial intelligences. Humans come up with them, and they’re part of a big change in the way researchers are thinking about feelings, one that emphasizes how people continuously spin out new ones in response to a changing world.

Velvetmist might’ve been a chatbot one-off, but it’s not unique. The sociologist Marci Cottingham—whose 2024 paper got this vein of neo-emotion research started—cites many more new terms in circulation. There’s “Black joy” (Black people celebrating embodied pleasure as a form of political resistance), “trans euphoria” (the joy of having one’s gender identity affirmed and celebrated), “eco-anxiety” (the hovering fear of climate disaster), “hypernormalization” (the surreal pressure to continue performing mundane life and labor under capitalism during a global pandemic or fascist takeover), and the sense of “doom” found in “doomer” (one who is relentlessly pessimistic) or “doomscrolling” (being glued to an endless feed of bad news in an immobilized state combining apathy and dread).

Of course, emotional vocabulary is always evolving. During the Civil War, doctors used the centuries-old term “nostalgia,” combining the Greek words for “returning home”and “pain,” to describe a sometimes fatal set of symptoms suffered by soldiers—a condition we’d probably describe today as post-traumatic stress disorder. Now nostalgia’s meaning has mellowed and faded to a gentle affection for an old cultural product or vanished way of life. And people constantly import emotion words from other cultures when they’re convenient or evocative—like hygge (the Danish word for friendly coziness) or kvell (a Yiddish term for brimming over with happy pride).

Cottingham believes that neo-­emotions are proliferating as people spend more of their lives online. These coinages help us relate to one another and make sense of our experiences, and they get a lot of engagement on social media. So even when a neo-emotion is just a subtle variation on, or combination of, existing feelings, getting super-specific about those feelings helps us reflect and connect with other people. “These are potentially signals that tell us about our place in the world,” she says.

These neo-emotions are part of a paradigm shift in emotion science. For decades, researchers argued that humans all share a set of a half-dozen or so basic emotions. But over the last decade, Lisa Feldman Barrett, a clinical psychologist at Northeastern University, has become one of the most cited scientists in the world for work demonstrating otherwise. By using tools like advanced brain imaging and studying babies and people from relatively isolated cultures, she has concluded there’s no such thing as a basic emotional palette. The way we experience and talk about our feelings is culturally determined. “How do you know what anger and sadness and fear are? Because somebody taught you,” Barrett says.

If there are no true “basic” biological emotions, this puts more emphasis on social and cultural variations in how we interpret our experiences. And these interpretations can change over time. “As a sociologist, we think of all emotions as created,” Cottingham says. Just like any other tool humans make and use, “emotions are a practical resource people are using as they navigate the world.”

Some neo-emotions, like velvetmist, might be mere novelties. Barrett playfully suggests “chiplessness” to describe the combined hunger, frustration, and relief of getting to the bottom of the bag. But others, like eco-anxiety and Black joy, can take on a life of their own and help galvanize social movements.

Both reading about and crafting your own neo-emotions, with or without chatbot assistance, could be surprisingly helpful. Lots of research supports the benefits of emotional granularity. Basically, the more detailed and specific words you can use to describe your emotions, both positive and negative, the better.

Researchers analogize this “emodiversity” to biodiversity or cultural diversity, arguing that a more diverse world is more enriched. It turns out that people who exhibit higher emotional granularity go to the doctor less frequently, spend fewer days hospitalized for illness, and are less likely to drink when stressed, drive recklessly, or smoke cigarettes. And many studies show emodiversity is a skill that, with training, people can develop at any age. Just imagine cruising into this sweet, comforting future. Is the idea giving you a certain dreamy thrill?

Are you sure you’ve never felt velvetmist?

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We’re in the midst of a global mental-­health crisis. More than a billion people worldwide suffer from a mental-health condition, according to the World Health Organization. The prevalence of anxiety and depression is growing in many demographics, particularly young people, and suicide is claiming hundreds of thousands of lives globally each year.

Given the clear demand for accessible and affordable mental-health services, it’s no wonder that people have looked to artificial intelligence for possible relief. Millions are already actively seeking therapy from popular chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude, or from specialized psychology apps like Wysa and Woebot. On a broader scale, researchers are exploring AI’s potential to monitor and collect behavioral and biometric observations using wearables and smart devices, analyze vast volumes of clinical data for new insights, and assist human mental-health professionals to help prevent burnout.

But so far this largely uncontrolled experiment has produced mixed results. Many people have found solace in chatbots based on large language models (LLMs), and some experts see promise in them as therapists, but other users have been sent into delusional spirals by AI’s hallucinatory whims and breathless sycophancy. Most tragically, multiple families have alleged that chatbots contributed to the suicides of their loved ones, sparking lawsuits against companies responsible for these tools. In October, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed in a blog post that 0.15% of ChatGPT users “have conversations that include explicit indicators of potential suicidal planning or intent.” That’s roughly a million people sharing suicidal ideations with just one of these software systems every week.

The real-world consequences of AI therapy came to a head in unexpected ways in 2025 as we waded through a critical mass of stories about human-chatbot relationships, the flimsiness of guardrails on many LLMs, and the risks of sharing profoundly personal information with products made by corporations that have economic incentives to harvest and monetize such sensitive data.

Several authors anticipated this inflection point. Their timely books are a reminder that while the present feels like a blur of breakthroughs, scandals, and confusion, this disorienting time is rooted in deeper histories of care, technology, and trust.

LLMs have often been described as “black boxes” because nobody knows exactly how they produce their results. The inner workings that guide their outputs are opaque because their algorithms are so complex and their training data is so vast. In mental-health circles, people often describe the human brain as a “black box,” for analogous reasons. Psychology, psychiatry, and related fields must grapple with the impossibility of seeing clearly inside someone else’s head, let alone pinpointing the exact causes of their distress.

These two types of black boxes are now interacting with each other, creating unpredictable feedback loops that may further impede clarity about the origins of people’s mental-­health struggles and the solutions that may be possible. Anxiety about these developments has much to do with the explosive recent advances in AI, but it also revives decades-old warnings from pioneers such as the MIT computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum, who argued against computerized therapy as early as the 1960s.

Charlotte Blease, a philosopher of medicine, makes the optimist’s case in Dr. Bot: Why Doctors Can Fail Us—and How AI Could Save Lives. Her book broadly explores the possible positive impacts of AI in a range of medical fields. While she remains clear-eyed about the risks, warning that readers who are expecting “a gushing love letter to technology” will be disappointed, she suggests that these models can help relieve patient suffering and medical burnout alike.

“Health systems are crumbling under patient pressure,” Blease writes. “Greater burdens on fewer doctors create the perfect petri dish for errors,” and “with palpable shortages of doctors and increasing waiting times for patients, many of us are profoundly frustrated.”

Blease believes that AI can not only ease medical professionals’ massive workloads but also relieve the tensions that have always existed between some patients and their caregivers. For example, people often don’t seek needed care because they are intimidated or fear judgment from medical professionals; this is especially true if they have mental-health challenges. AI could allow more people to share their concerns, she argues.

But she’s aware that these putative upsides need to be weighed against major drawbacks. For instance, AI therapists can provide inconsistent and even dangerous responses to human users, according to a 2025 study, and they also raise privacy concerns, given that AI companies are currently not bound by the same confidentiality and HIPAA standards as licensed therapists.

While Blease is an expert in this field, her motivation for writing the book is also personal: She has two siblings with an incurable form of muscular dystrophy, one of whom waited decades for a diagnosis. During the writing of her book, she also lost her partner to cancer and her father to dementia within a devastating six-month period. “I witnessed first-hand the sheer brilliance of doctors and the kindness of health professionals,” she writes. “But I also observed how things can go wrong with care.”

A similar tension animates Daniel Oberhaus’s engrossing book The Silicon Shrink: How Artificial Intelligence Made the World an Asylum. Oberhaus starts from a point of tragedy: the loss of his younger sister to suicide. As Oberhaus carried out the “distinctly twenty-first-century mourning process” of sifting through her digital remains, he wondered if technology could have eased the burden of the psychiatric problems that had plagued her since childhood.

“It seemed possible that all of this personal data might have held important clues that her mental health providers could have used to provide more effective treatment,” he writes. “What if algorithms running on my sister’s smartphone or laptop had used that data to understand when she was in distress? Could it have led to a timely intervention that saved her life? Would she have wanted that even if it did?”

This concept of digital phenotyping—in which a person’s digital behavior could be mined for clues about distress or illness—seems elegant in theory. But it may also become problematic if integrated into the field of psychiatric artificial intelligence (PAI), which extends well beyond chatbot therapy.

Oberhaus emphasizes that digital clues could actually exacerbate the existing challenges of modern psychiatry, a discipline that remains fundamentally uncertain about the underlying causes of mental illnesses and disorders. The advent of PAI, he says, is “the logical equivalent of grafting physics onto astrology.” In other words, the data generated by digital phenotyping is as precise as physical measurements of planetary positions, but it is then integrated into a broader framework—in this case, psychiatry—that, like astrology, is based on unreliable assumptions.

Oberhaus, who uses the phrase “swipe psychiatry” to describe the outsourcing of clinical decisions based on behavioral data to LLMs, thinks that this approach cannot escape the fundamental issues facing psychiatry. In fact, it could worsen the problem by causing the skills and judgment of human therapists to atrophy as they grow more dependent on AI systems.

He also uses the asylums of the past—in which institutionalized patients lost their right to freedom, privacy, dignity, and agency over their lives—as a touchstone for a more insidious digital captivity that may spring from PAI. LLM users are already sacrificing privacy by telling chatbots sensitive personal information that companies then mine and monetize, contributing to a new surveillance economy. Freedom and dignity are at stake when complex inner lives are transformed into data streams tailored for AI analysis.

AI therapists could flatten humanity into patterns of prediction, and so sacrifice the intimate, individualized care that is expected of traditional human therapists. “The logic of PAI leads to a future where we may all find ourselves patients in an algorithmic asylum administered by digital wardens,” Oberhaus writes. “In the algorithmic asylum there is no need for bars on the window or white padded rooms because there is no possibility of escape. The asylum is already everywhere—in your homes and offices, schools and hospitals, courtrooms and barracks. Wherever there’s an internet connection, the asylum is waiting.”

Eoin Fullam, a researcher who studies the intersection of technology and mental health, echoes some of the same concerns in Chatbot Therapy: A Critical Analysis of AI Mental Health Treatment. A heady academic primer, the book analyzes the assumptions underlying the automated treatments offered by AI chatbots and the way capitalist incentives could corrupt these kinds of tools.

Fullam observes that the capitalist mentality behind new technologies “often leads to questionable, illegitimate, and illegal business practices in which the customers’ interests are secondary to strategies of market dominance.”

That doesn’t mean that therapy-bot makers “will inevitably conduct nefarious activities contrary to the users’ interests in the pursuit of market dominance,” Fullam writes.

But he notes that the success of AI therapy depends on the inseparable impulses to make money and to heal people. In this logic, exploitation and therapy feed each other: Every digital therapy session generates data, and that data fuels the system that profits as unpaid users seek care. The more effective the therapy seems, the more the cycle entrenches itself, making it harder to distinguish between care and commodification. “The more the users benefit from the app in terms of its therapeutic or any other mental health intervention,” he writes, “the more they undergo exploitation.”

This sense of an economic and psychological ouroboros—the snake that eats its own tail—serves as a central metaphor in Sike, the debut novel from Fred Lunzer, an author with a research background in AI.

Described as a “story of boy meets girl meets AI psychotherapist,” Sike follows Adrian, a young Londoner who makes a living ghostwriting rap lyrics, in his romance with Maquie, a business professional with a knack for spotting lucrative technologies in the beta phase.

The title refers to a splashy commercial AI therapist called Sike, uploaded into smart glasses, that Adrian uses to interrogate his myriad anxieties. “When I signed up to Sike, we set up my dashboard, a wide black panel like an airplane’s cockpit that showed my daily ‘vitals,’” Adrian narrates. “Sike can analyze the way you walk, the way you make eye contact, the stuff you talk about, the stuff you wear, how often you piss, shit, laugh, cry, kiss, lie, whine, and cough.”

In other words, Sike is the ultimate digital phenotyper, constantly and exhaustively analyzing everything in a user’s daily experiences. In a twist, Lunzer chooses to make Sike a luxury product, available only to subscribers who can foot the price tag of £2,000 per month.

Flush with cash from his contributions to a hit song, Adrian comes to rely on Sike as a trusted mediator between his inner and outer worlds. The novel explores the impacts of the app on the wellness of the well-off, following rich people who voluntarily commit themselves to a boutique version of the digital asylum described by Oberhaus.

The only real sense of danger in Sike involves a Japanese torture egg (don’t ask). The novel strangely sidesteps the broader dystopian ripples of its subject matter in favor of drunken conversations at fancy restaurants and elite dinner parties.

The sudden ascent of the AI therapist seems startlingly futuristic, as if it should be unfolding in some later time when the streets scrub themselves and we travel the world through pneumatic tubes.

Sike’s creator is simply “a great guy” in Adrian’s estimation, despite his techno-messianic vision of training the app to soothe the ills of entire nations. It always seems as if a shoe is meant to drop, but in the end, it never does, leaving the reader with a sense of non-resolution.

While Sike is set in the present day, something about the sudden ascent of the AI therapist—­in real life as well as in fiction—seems startlingly futuristic, as if it should be unfolding in some later time when the streets scrub themselves and we travel the world through pneumatic tubes. But this convergence of mental health and artificial intelligence has been in the making for more than half a century. The beloved astronomer Carl Sagan, for example, once imagined a “network of computer psychotherapeutic terminals, something like arrays of large telephone booths” that could address the growing demand for mental-health services.

Oberhaus notes that one of the first incarnations of a trainable neural network, known as the Perceptron, was devised not by a mathematician but by a psychologist named Frank Rosenblatt, at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory in 1958. The potential utility of AI in mental health was widely recognized by the 1960s, inspiring early computerized psychotherapists such as the DOCTOR script that ran on the ELIZA chatbot developed by Joseph Weizenbaum, who shows up in all three of the nonfiction books in this article.

Weizenbaum, who died in 2008, was profoundly concerned about the possibility of computerized therapy. “Computers can make psychiatric judgments,” he wrote in his 1976 book Computer Power and Human Reason. “They can flip coins in much more sophisticated ways than can the most patient human being. The point is that they ought not to be given such tasks. They may even be able to arrive at ‘correct’ decisions in some cases—but always and necessarily on bases no human being should be willing to accept.”

It’s a caution worth keeping in mind. As AI therapists arrive at scale, we’re seeing them play out a familiar dynamic: Tools designed with superficially good intentions are enmeshed with systems that can exploit, surveil, and reshape human behavior. In a frenzied attempt to unlock new opportunities for patients in dire need of mental-health support, we may be locking other doors behind them.

            <div id="article-text">Five stars used to mean something. People still read reviews before buying software. They just don’t trust them the way they used to. And no, this isn’t about fake reviews or obvious scams. Those are easy to spot. The real problem is more uncomfortable. The review economy didn’t collapse. It slowly drifted away from its original purpose.

User reviews began as authentic buyer guidance, but they’ve morphed into strategic assets for businesses. Scroll through any app store or e-commerce site: everything is “top-rated” and lavished with praise. If every product gleams with a 4.8/5 rating, those stars start to lose their meaning.

Consumers aren’t fooled, in fact, the share of people who trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations plummeted from nearly 80% in 2020 to just 42% in 2025

We read the glowing comments, but we’ve learned to read between the lines.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

It’s not hard to see why trust has eroded. Companies have figured out that great reviews drive sales, so they’ve turned the whole system into a numbers game. High ratings aren’t just social proof now, they’re a growth tactic.  In other words, more stars = more money. So of course businesses are chasing stars like their life depends on it. And in a way, it does.

Behind the scenes, many companies actively engineer their review scores. One common tactic is to time the ask just right. For instance, some businesses send out a Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey to gauge your sentiment “How likely are you to recommend us?”

If you rate them a 9 or 10 (a promoter), you’re immediately nudged to post a public review. If you give a lukewarm or low score, the feedback form quietly thanks you and never mentions writing a review at all.

Only the happiest customers get the gentle push to “Share your experience!” This practice is so widespread it even has a name: “review gating.”

It’s essentially filtering which customers get invited to leave a review based on their initial feedback. Platforms officially frown on it (Google outright forbids “selectively soliciting positive reviews”), but behind closed doors it remains a growth hacker’s favorite trick.

Then there’s the outright incentivization. Perhaps you’ve received an email offering a discount, gift card, or free month of service in exchange for writing a review. It’s framed as a thank-you for your time, of course – “Share your honest feedback and get 10% off your next purchase!” – but the intent is clear.

In an economy of fake praise, even regulators have had to step in to remind everyone that trust isn’t a commodity to be bought. Companies know how to play the game from the other side too: suppressing negativity.

Unhappy customer feedback is quietly diverted to support teams or private channels, where it can be resolved (or simply contained) out of public view. The result is a skewed reality, a glossy wall of five-star testimonials that obscure any hint of dissatisfaction. It’s a great sales tool. It’s terrible for the truth.

Why go to such lengths to manicure the ratings? Because the platforms themselves reward it. The algorithms that sort and highlight products aren’t trying to surface the most truthful review; they’re trying to maximize engagement and conversion.

High ratings and large volumes of reviews make people more likely to click “Buy Now.” That means more conversion for sellers and more commission for the marketplace. In other words, the algorithm is biased toward whatever boosts the platform’s monetization metrics.

A bunch of five-star reviews isn’t just ego bait,  it’s algorithm bait.

Think about it: products with a 4.7-star average and hundreds of reviews tend to appear at the top of search results and recommendation lists. They convert better, so the system pushes them more.

More visibility leads to more sales, which reinforces the high ranking. It’s a feedback loop powered by positive feedback (pun intended). If a vendor can game their way into that virtuous cycle, via perfectly timed prompts or purchased praise, the platform’s code will happily amplify them.

Authenticity doesn’t earn you a top slot; performance does. The incentive is clear: keep it positive, and keep it plentiful. In the review economy, volume and sentiment are king.

Worse, some marketplaces have blurred the line between genuine high-rated listings and paid placement. It’s an open secret that many platforms offer sponsored spots or pay-to-play schemes, think “featured” placements, ads masquerading as top picks, or vendor subscriptions that subtly boost visibility.

Money talks, even if it speaks over the voice of authentic customer feedback. (To be fair, a few holdouts still refuse to monetize their review rankings or sell out their star system, but they’re the exception, not the rule).

Consumers aren’t sitting idly by in this charade. We’ve become savvy at sniffing out over-polished BS. The modern buyer knows how the game is played, and many are adapting their behavior to cope with the broken review system.

First, there’s a migration of trust to private networks and off-platform channels. Instead of relying on the star-average on a marketplace, people turn to friends, colleagues, and niche communities for real advice.

Think about the last time you were unsure about a purchase, maybe you shot a quick message to a group chat, or asked in a private Slack channel, “Hey, has anyone used this product? Is it actually any good?” Personal recommendations feel reliable again, precisely because they’re not part of the public review circus.

Second, savvy consumers cross-check everything. Rather than trusting one site’s reviews, they compare across multiple sources, the product might be 4.8 on the official store, but what’s it rated elsewhere?

Is there a discrepancy between the slick website testimonials and the chatter on Reddit? More often than not, shoppers now triangulate information. In fact, three out of four people use two or more sites when reading reviews, rather than putting all their faith in one platform’s word. We instinctively seek a consensus of truth across the noise.

Finally, many have decided the best judge is themselves. “Try before you buy” has made a comeback as a defense against dubious reviews. Free trials, freemium tiers, generous return policies, consumers leverage them all to test products firsthand.

If a software platform promises the world in its curated testimonials, a savvy buyer will take the 14-day free trial and see if it lives up to the hype. In sectors like enterprise software, where choices are costly and critical, buyers might run a pilot program or proof-of-concept rather than trust glossy case studies. Essentially, experience has become the new review.

All this has serious implications for platforms and software marketplaces. These businesses built their empires on user-generated trust, turning customer opinion into a key part of the shopping experience.

If that trust evaporates, the model cracks. We’re already seeing the early signs: users skipping the review tab, or treating every five-star rating with a healthy dose of skepticism.

If the review economy continues on its current path, platforms risk becoming mere transaction processors rather than trust brokers.

For the marketplaces, this is both a crisis and an opportunity. The crisis is obvious: loss of credibility. If people no longer believe what they read on your platform, they’ll seek validation elsewhere, and your influence over purchase decisions diminishes.

But the opportunity lies in reform. Platforms could double down on authenticity as a feature, verifying purchases, cracking down harder on fraudulent and incentivized reviews, and highlighting more qualitative, nuanced feedback instead of simple star counts.

There’s even a chance to innovate with new trust signals (some are experimenting with things like verified buyer badges, AI analysis for suspicious patterns, or weighted ratings that account for reviewer reputation). The platforms that find ways to genuinely restore faith in their review systems will win back weary consumers. Those that don’t will see their communities drift away, bit by bit.

Importantly, not all platforms have given in to the dark side. A handful still refuse pay-for-play tactics, no paid reviews, no under-the-table boosting of rankings for advertisers.

These holdouts demonstrate that integrity in reviews is possible, even if it means slower growth in the short term.

In the end, the broken review economy is forcing a rebalance of how we decide what to trust. Buyers are adapting, finding new ways to cut through the noise. And the platforms that once thrived on being the ultimate source of truth in purchasing may have to rethink their approach if they want to stay relevant.

Trust, once lost, is hard to regain. The five-star system doesn’t shine as bright as it used to; perhaps it’s time for the next evolution in how we share and earn trust online.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">2025 was the year technology stopped being tomorrow’s promise and became today’s anchor. What began as a surge in generative AI and platform innovation two years prior crystallized this year into concrete shifts in how people work, governing bodies legislate, and markets invest. Across continents and industries, the arc of technology bent toward practical impact, regulatory reality, and economic weight!

At the heart of the year’s story was artificial intelligence’s jump from novelty to infrastructure. LLMs and multimodal models moved beyond demos into everyday workflows, influencing how documents are written, campaigns are conceived, products designed, and code generated.

Enterprises that once hesitated began deploying AI tools at scale, with early adopters reporting measurable productivity gains by integrating copilots into core processes, a trend visible in surveys showing widespread adoption among software professionals.

This editorial isn’t a chronicle of every press release.

It’s a reflection on how 2025, at the crossroads of technology, governance, and economic strategy, brought about a series of inflection points that will shape the next era of creation, competition, and control.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

OpenAI’s release of GPT-5 in August pushed the boundaries of what AI could do, delivering notable gains in coding, math, and multimodal understanding. But unlike the jaw-dropping debut of ChatGPT a couple years prior, this new generation of foundation models arrived to a more measured reception.

Tech leaders and investors had begun asking harder questions: beyond impressive demos, could these models drive real products and revenue?

Google’s answer was Gemini 3, launched in November as its “most intelligent model” and immediately woven into Google’s flagship product, Search. For the first time, an AI model upgrade wasn’t just about boastful leaderboard scores, it was about transforming user experience.

Typing a query into Google now often meant receiving an AI-generated synthesis instead of the familiar list of links, a sea change in how information is delivered. Google even unveiled a Gemini “agent” that could execute multi-step tasks like booking travel or organizing email, hinting at a future where AI acts more like a digital butler than a chatbox.

Anthropic’s Claude 4 model, for instance, gained a strong following among developers by expanding how much it could handle at once, processing entire codebases with tens of thousands of lines, rather than by producing viral one-liners.

AI grew up in 2025: it was still improving at breakneck speed, but it also had to earn its keep in real products and justify the billion-dollar bets fueling its rise.

Driving this AI explosion was a parallel leap in hardware. The hunger for AI computers in 2025 was insatiable, and chipmakers raced to deliver.

NVIDIA, whose GPUs had become the era’s essential infrastructure, rolled out its new Blackwell architecture with chips like the B200 that boasted up to 3× the training speed of its predecessor. Cloud data centers around the world scrambled to deploy these to keep up with demand from model training and inference.

Rival chipmakers weren’t idle either: AMD and a cadre of startups pushed innovative AI accelerators, while even Intel signaled ambitions to catch up, reportedly exploring an acquisition of AI chip designer SambaNova.

Perhaps most tellingly, tech giants themselves started designing silicon tailored for AI workloads, recognizing that owning the chip means owning the future of computing.

Beyond AI chips, consumer hardware saw its own milestones. After years of anticipation, augmented reality glasses and mixed-reality headsets finally had their moment, sort of.

Apple’s Vision Pro headset, unveiled in late 2023, reached select markets in 2024; by 2025 developers were crafting the first wave of immersive apps. However, mass adoption lagged due to the device’s sky-high price and bulky format.

Competitors like Meta’s Quest line offered cheaper VR headsets and modest improvements, but the “metaverse” hype of yesteryear largely fizzled out, users and investors had shifted their excitement to generative AI and tangible productivity tools.

Smartphones and laptops in 2025 continued incremental improvements (faster Apple M3/M4 chips, foldable screens becoming more common), yet it was clear the next paradigm shift in personal tech was still on the horizon.

Even so, one hardware frontier made concrete progress: quantum computing. Industry leaders like IBM and Google demonstrated prototype systems with ever-larger qubit counts and made strides in error correction, inching closer to viable quantum machines.

These advances, while esoteric to the public, underscored a broader theme, from AI accelerators to quantum chips, the machinery under the hood of tech was evolving rapidly to enable the software of tomorrow.

If 2025 proved anything, it’s that technology no longer operates above the law. This was the year regulators moved from intent to enforcement, with Europe leading the charge.

After years of debate, the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act came into force, becoming the world’s first complex AI law. From February, certain “unacceptable risk” uses, such as social scoring and real-time biometric surveillance, were banned outright.

By August, transparency rules followed, forcing companies to label AI-generated content and comply with new obligations for general-purpose models. The signal was unmistakable: in Europe, the era of unchecked AI was over.

Companies now face audits, penalties, and real consequences if their systems cross legal or ethical lines, a regulatory moment European officials openly compared to GDPR’s impact on data privacy.

The pressure didn’t stop with AI. In 2025, regulators also went after the gatekeepers. The EU’s Digital Markets Act forced long-resistant changes from Big Tech, most notably when Apple opened the iPhone to third-party app stores and sideloading in Europe, dismantling a 15-year walled garden.

At the same time, enforcement of the Digital Services Act intensified. Platforms were scrutinized for how they handle disinformation, with companies like X warned or penalized during periods of geopolitical tension. In response, social networks expanded moderation teams, adjusted algorithms, and exposed more of their inner workings to researchers.

The US issued an AI executive order and signaled tougher enforcement through agencies like the FTC, while states stepped in, including New York’s law requiring mental-health warnings on addictive social features.

In China, new draft rules targeted AI systems designed for human-like interaction, tightening licensing and ideological oversight. By the end of the year, the freewheeling phase of tech disruption had given way to something more restrained. The question was no longer whether regulation would catch up, but how deeply it would reshape innovation itself.

The platform shake-up that began in 2023 gathered real momentum in 2025, as both companies and users adjusted to a post-pandemic, AI-saturated reality.

Nowhere was this clearer than in social media. Elon Musk’s X, which entered the decade with noise and bravado, found itself on the defensive. Meta’s Threads, initially dismissed after an early spike, steadily closed the gap, nearing parity with X in daily mobile users by mid-year.

X’s audience shrank as policy whiplash and leadership churn eroded confidence, and while its remaining users were still deeply engaged, the era of unquestioned Twitter dominance was over. Disenchanted users scattered across a fragmented landscape, from Meta’s polished Threads to decentralized alternatives like Bluesky and Mastodon, breaking the old Facebook–Instagram–Twitter equilibrium.

The recalibration extended well beyond social feeds.

Major platforms retooled around changing habits: Google reshaped Search around generative answers to fend off AI assistants and algorithmic discovery, while Microsoft pushed its Copilot deeper into Windows, Office, and Bing, betting on “AI inside” as a platform reset.

Everyday behavior shifted too. Smarter voice and chat assistants returned to daily use, handling emails, refunds, and scheduling with little friction. At the same time, screen fatigue set in. Digital-detox travel gained traction, and younger users gravitated toward apps that promised less algorithmic pressure and more human curation. Even streaming came full circle.

After years of fragmentation, providers began rebundling services, offering combined video, music, and gaming packages that looked suspiciously like cable TV reborn, a reminder that while technology moves forward, user preferences often move in cycles.

Amid the gains and momentum, 2025 also became a year of reckoning. As AI systems spread, society began grappling with their cultural and ethical cost. Creators who once marveled at generative tools started pushing back, arguing that their work had been absorbed without consent or compensation.

A wave of lawsuits moved through US courts, with authors accusing companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google of scraping books and articles to train models. By year’s end, the message was unmistakable: if AI is built on human creativity, many believe its rewards can no longer flow in one direction alone.

Public trust in technology was also tested by a rise in malicious uses and misuses. In the financial domain, sophisticated deepfake scams caused real damage. The frequency of such incidents spiked sharply; cybersecurity firms reported a 3000% increase in deepfake-related fraud over two years, and authorities scrambled to educate businesses on new verification practices.

Misinformation continued to be a menace: during elections and conflicts, AI-generated fake images and videos spread on social media, forcing newsrooms to set up rapid-response fact-checking teams.

Encouragingly, 2025 also saw growth in countermeasures, from better deepfake detection algorithms to nascent standards for cryptographic content authentication (the Coalition for Content Provenance, including major publishers and tech platforms, expanded efforts to watermark authentic media).

Still, the information ecosystem remained fraught, as even savvy citizens found it ever harder to tell the truth from fabrication online.

And then there’s the human element: how all this tech is affecting everyday lives and livelihoods. Workplace AI adoption soared this year; tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot and a host of AI assistants became common on office desktops. Studies showed productivity boosts but also raised concerns about workers becoming overly reliant on AI suggestions.

Meanwhile, fears of automation resurfaced in certain sectors, for example, as chatbots took over more customer service and code-generation tools improved, professionals in call centers and junior programming positions wondered about long-term job security.

These anxieties fueled calls for new approaches to education and training, so that the workforce of 2030 will be prepared for more creative, complex tasks that AI can’t easily handle.

Lovable (Stockholm, Sweden) came as one of the most remarkable AI software stories of the year, for me. What began as an open-source project evolved into a commercial platform that lets users build fully functional websites and apps using plain-language prompts, no traditional coding required.

This approach, known in the industry as “vibe coding,” turns ideas into production-ready software simply by describing what you want in natural language.

Lovable’s growth in 2025 was extraordinary by any measure. Eight months after its launch, the company hit over $100 million in annual recurring revenue and raised a $200 million Series A at a roughly $1.8 billion valuation, making it one of Europe’s fastest-growing software startups ever.

By year’s end, Lovable had secured $330 million in Series B funding at about a $6.6 billion valuation, and was rapidly scaling globally.

What makes Lovable meaningful beyond the numbers is what it represents: a shift in how software is built. It demonstrated that AI can democratize development, giving power to non-technical founders, creators, and teams to go from concept to product without traditional engineering barriers.

In an industry long centered on specialized skills and team structures, Lovable’s rise suggested a future where natural language becomes the primary interface to software creation.

On a more hopeful note, 2025 showed signs of a maturing tech culture. Ethical design moved from talking point to practice. Major platforms began experimenting with limits, turning off infinite scroll for teens, adding prompts that nudged users to pause, and treating “time well spent” as a real metric rather than a slogan.

In AI, transparency gained ground. Under pressure from regulators and researchers, companies like OpenAI and Google disclosed more about how their models are trained and where they fall short.

Researchers formed new alliances to share safety techniques, and a second global AI Safety Summit brought dozens of countries together around questions of alignment and control.

None of it amounted to binding rules, but it marked a shift in tone: even the architects of powerful systems openly acknowledged the need for restraint.

Taken together, these moments made 2025 a turning point. For years, technology had surged ahead of the institutions meant to guide it. This year, that gap began to close.

The breakthroughs were real and transformative, but so were the responses to them: laws passed, norms reset, alliances formed. If 2024 was the year the world grasped the power of generative AI, 2025 was the year it began deciding how that power should be used.

The story of technology is no longer just about what can be built, but about how it fits into the lives it shapes, and who gets to decide that fit.

            <div id="article-text">My name is Alexandru Stan, and this article continues the dialogue I began following the acquisition of TNW.

Following the recent transaction, TNW Spaces remains with the Financial Times, while we continue the mission of the website, the events, and the global community.

We already have a dedicated team at tekpon operating the platform, events, and community initiatives. Our objective is to expand and strengthen the team as TNW accelerates its next chapter.

TNW is already a global media platform with millions of readers. We’re not starting over. We are building forward.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Technology is entering a decisive stage: AI is reshaping workflows, distribution is shifting, capital is becoming more selective, and founders are expected to demonstrate value rather than potential.

The world doesn’t need more noise.
It needs clarity, execution, and access to trustworthy knowledge and people.

TNW will serve that need through editorial independence, real expertise, and community-built intelligence.

Success for TNW looks like this: more accurate understanding, faster access to verified knowledge, and direct pathways from insight to action.

I’ve been an entrepreneur since 2007, building in B2B SaaS, marketplaces, and scalable systems. I believe deeply in servant leadership. Without people, I am zero.

I lead two private networks grounded in practice rather than theory:

These groups ensure TNW remains rooted in lived experience, informed by operators, not commentators.

Our mission is to build the most trusted European tech media platform with global reach, focused on practical innovation, responsible scaling, and transparency.

We will continue to host events across Europe’s major capitals including Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Monaco.

These will not be festivals. We are introducing a concept validated through tekpon events: curated gatherings built for meaningful relationships, deep content, and tangible business outcomes.

In 2026, we return to Amsterdam for a special edition centered on AI among other fields. We will explore technologies and strategies shaping the future of work and business:

The editorial focus remains European, while the audience is global.

AI is not a threat to publishing. It is the infrastructure of the next generation of content and knowledge.

At TNW, we will use AI to accelerate research, enable personalized intelligence, reduce noise and bias, and amplify high-quality human expertise. Technology assists. Human judgment remains central.

Because this moment in Europe matters.
Because founders here are ready to scale responsibly.
Because independent media with integrity is rare.
Because innovation deserves a platform built around people, not hype.

TNW will continue its legacy with a renewed emphasis on contribution, execution, and community built through trust.

If you are building, scaling, or researching the next wave of technology, I invite you to engage with us, contribute insights, and participate in shaping the conversation.

The next era begins now. Let’s shape it together.

            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard!

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you. We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.
