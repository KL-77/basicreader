            <h2>Russia is about to do the most Russia thing ever with its next space station</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/12/russia-is-about-to-do-the-most-russia-thing-ever-with-its-next-space-station/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For several years now, in discussing plans for its human spaceflight program beyond the International Space Station, Russian officials would proudly bring up the Russian Orbital Station, or ROS.

The first elements of ROS were to launch in 2027 so it would be ready for human habitation in 2028. Upon completion in the mid-2030s, the station would encompass seven shiny new modules, potentially including a private habitat for space tourists. It would be so sophisticated that the station could fly autonomously for months if needed.

Importantly, the Russian station was also to fly in a polar orbit at about 400 km. This would allow the station to fly over the entirety of Russia, observing the whole country. It would be important for national pride because cosmonauts would not need to launch from Kazakhstan anymore. Rather, rockets launching from the country’s new spaceport in eastern Russia, the Vostochny Cosmodrome, would easily reach the ROS in its polar orbit.

That was the plan, at least until this week, when a Russian official dropped a bombshell.

Oleg Orlov, director of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, said ROS will no longer be composed of entirely new modules. Rather, its core will be the Russian segment of the International Space Station.

“The Scientific and Technical Council of Roscosmos supported this proposal and approved the deployment of a Russian orbital station as part of the Russian segment of the ISS,” Orlov reportedly said.

Orlov’s announcement sheds light on a statement earlier in December from First Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov on the station’s orbit, which now makes more sense. “We’ve decided on a 51.6-degree inclination angle for our ROS space station,” he said. “Previously, we were considering a 96-degree inclination angle.” The International Space Station is situated in a 51.6-degree inclination orbit, easily accessible from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.

Essentially, then, in 2030, the Russian segment of the International Space Station will separate from the American-controlled side. A SpaceX Dragon spacecraft will then maneuver the aging US segment to reenter the atmosphere in a controlled manner and splash down into a remote area of the Pacific Ocean.

Meanwhile, the Russian core will fly onward. Some elements will have been in orbit for more than 30 years.

In a scathing article on the decision, the Russian newspaper New Izvestia explored its consequences. The article, translated for Ars by Rob Mitchell, recalled comments from Orlov in 2022 about the dangerous bacteria and fungi that have accumulated on the International Space Station over its extended lifetime. Because of these microorganisms from hundreds of visiting astronauts, he said, there is danger to both humans and degraded electrical components. At the time, Orlov was seeking to justify funding for a new station. “Have bacteria and fungi suddenly become less dangerous over the past three years?” the Russian article asks.

There may also not be much time for new research. Russian cosmonauts on the space station currently spend about 50 percent of their time on station maintenance due to the aging infrastructure.

So, at a time when China will have its own Tiangong space station, NASA should have one or more privately operated space stations to visit, and India may also begin the construction of its own orbital outpost, Russian cosmonauts will be left with what, exactly?

“Russia, meanwhile, will be left to carry on the legacy of the ISS, with all its problems,” the New Izvestia article states. “We won’t have a new orbital station with modern capabilities yet, and the Vostochny Cosmodrome is losing much of its significance, meaning investments in a launch pad for manned flights could go down the drain. But let’s be happy for Kazakhstan—its authorities will continue to receive rent from Baikonur.”

This is clearly a money-saving move for Russia. Given its war-strapped economy, the country cannot afford major investments in civil space projects. It has been clear for some time that ROS was largely a vaporware project. However, basing a new station on decades-old elements of the space station, which have shown signs of cracking and leaking, is remarkable even for Russia’s threadbare space program.

Russia’s justification for the change is amusing. Manturov and the chief of Roscosmos, Dmitry Bakanov, have said that putting ROS at an inclination of 51.6 degrees would enable interaction with an Indian station, which may fly in a similar orbit. So maybe there can be some collaboration in the time before Russia’s station falls apart and India’s begins to fly?

That is thin gruel, indeed, upon which to justify such a monumental decision.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Welcome to Edition 8.23 of the Rocket Report! Several new rockets made their first flights this year. Blue Origin’s New Glenn was the most notable debut, with a successful inaugural launch in January followed by an impressive second flight in November, culminating in the booster’s first landing on an offshore platform. Second on the list is China’s Zhuque-3, a partially reusable methane-fueled rocket developed by the quasi-commercial launch company LandSpace. The medium-lift Zhuque-3 successfully reached orbit on its first flight earlier this month, and its booster narrowly missed landing downrange. We could add China’s Long March 12A to the list if it flies before the end of the year. This will be the final Rocket Report of 2025, but we’ll be back in January with all the news that’s fit to lift.

As always, we welcome reader submissions. If you don’t want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets, as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.

Rocket Lab delivers for Space Force and NASA. Four small satellites rode a Rocket Lab Electron launch vehicle into orbit from Virginia early Thursday, beginning a government-funded technology demonstration mission to test the performance of a new spacecraft design, Ars reports. The satellites were nestled inside a cylindrical dispenser on top of the 59-foot-tall (18-meter) Electron rocket when it lifted off from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility. A little more than an hour later, the rocket’s upper stage released the satellites one at a time at an altitude of about 340 miles (550 kilometers). The launch was the starting gun for a “proof of concept” mission to test the viability of a new kind of satellite called DiskSats, designed by the Aerospace Corporation.

Stack ’em high… “DiskSat is a lightweight, compact, flat disc-shaped satellite designed for optimizing future rideshare launches,” the Aerospace Corporation said in a statement. The DiskSats are 39 inches (1 meter) wide, about twice the diameter of a New York-style pizza, and measure just 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) thick. Made of composite carbon fiber, each satellite carries solar cells, control avionics, reaction wheels, and an electric thruster to change and maintain altitude. The flat design allows DiskSats to be stacked one on top of the other for launch. The format also has significantly more surface area than other small satellites with comparable mass, making room for more solar cells for high-power missions or large-aperture payloads like radar imaging instruments or high-bandwidth antennas. NASA and the US Space Force cofunded the development and launch of the DiskSat demo mission.

SpaceX warns of dangerous Chinese launch. China’s recent deployment of nine satellites occurred dangerously close to a Starlink satellite, SpaceX’s vice president of Starlink engineering said. Michael Nicolls wrote in a December 12 social media post that there was a 200-meter close approach between a satellite launched December 10 on a Chinese Kinetica-1 rocket and SpaceX’s Starlink-6079 spacecraft at 560 kilometers (348 miles) altitude, Aviation Week and Space Technology reports. “Most of the risk of operating in space comes from the lack of coordination between satellite operators—this needs to change,” Nicolls wrote.

Blaming the customer... The company in charge of the Kinetica-1 rocket, CAS Space, responded to Nicolls’ post on X saying it would “work on identifying the exact details and provide assistance.” In a follow-up post on December 13, CAS Space said the close call, if confirmed, occurred nearly 48 hours after the satellite separated from the Kinetica-1 rocket, by which time the launch mission had long concluded. “CAS Space will coordinate with satellite operators to proceed.”

A South Korean startup is ready to fly. Innospace, a South Korean space startup, will launch its independently developed commercial rocket, Hanbit-Nano, as soon as Friday, the Maeil Business Newspaper reports. The rocket will lift off from the Alcântara Space Center in Brazil. The small launcher will attempt to deliver eight small payloads, including five deployable satellites, into low-Earth orbit. The launch was delayed two days to allow time for technicians to replace components of the first stage oxidizer supply cooling system.

Hybrid propulsion… This will be the first launch of Innospace’s Hanbit-Nano rocket. The launcher has two stages and stands 71 feet (21.7 meters) tall with a diameter of 4.6 feet (1.4 meters). Hanbit-Nano is a true micro-launcher, capable of placing up to 200 pounds (90 kilograms) of payload mass into Sun-synchronous orbit. It has a unique design, with hybrid engines consuming a mix of paraffin as the fuel and liquid oxygen as the oxidizer.

Ten years since a milestone in rocketry. On December 21, 2015, SpaceX launched the Orbcomm-2 mission on an upgraded version of its Falcon 9 rocket. That night, just days before Christmas, the company successfully landed the first stage for the first time. Ars has reprinted a slightly condensed chapter from the book Reentry, authored by Senior Space Editor Eric Berger and published in 2024. The chapter begins in June 2015 with the failure of a Falcon 9 rocket during launch of a resupply mission to the International Space Station and ends with a vivid behind-the-scenes recounting of the historic first landing of a Falcon 9 booster to close out the year.

First-person account… I have my own memory of SpaceX’s first rocket landing. I was there, covering the mission for another publication, as the Falcon 9 lifted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida. In an abundance of caution, Air Force officials in charge of the Cape Canaveral spaceport closed large swaths of the base for the Falcon 9’s return to land. The decision shunted VIPs and media representatives to viewing locations outside the spaceport’s fence, so I joined SpaceX’s official press room at the top of a seven-floor tower near the Port Canaveral cruise terminals. The view was tremendous. We all knew to expect a sonic boom as the rocket came back to Florida, but its arrival was a jolt. The next morning, I joined SpaceX and a handful of reporters and photographers on a chartered boat to get a closer look at the Falcon 9 standing proudly after returning from space.

Roscosmos targets quick fix to Soyuz launch pad. Russian space agency Roscosmos says it expects a damaged launch pad critical to International Space Station operations to be fixed by the end of February, Aviation Week and Space Technology reports. “Launch readiness: end of February 2026,” Roscosmos said in a statement Tuesday. Russia had been scrambling to assess the extent of repairs needed to Pad 31 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan after the November 27 flight of a Soyuz-2.1a rocket damaged key elements of the infrastructure. The pad is the only one capable of supporting Russian launches to the ISS.

Best-case scenario… A quick repair to the launch pad would be the best-case scenario for Roscosmos. A service structure underneath the rocket was unsecured during the launch of a three-man crew to the ISS last month. The structure fell into the launch pad’s flame trench, leaving the complex without the service cabin technicians use to work on the Soyuz rocket before liftoff. Roscosmos said a “complete service cabin replacement kit” has arrived at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, and more than 130 staff are working in two shifts to implement the repairs. A fix by the end of February would allow Russia to resume cargo flights to the ISS in March.

Atlas V closes out an up-and-down year for ULA. United Launch Alliance aced its final launch of 2025, a predawn flight of an Atlas V rocket Tuesday carrying 27 satellites for Amazon’s recently rebranded Leo broadband Internet service, Spaceflight Now reports. The rocket flew northeast from Cape Canaveral to place the Amazon Leo satellites into low-Earth orbit. This was ULA’s fourth launch for Amazon’s satellite broadband venture, previously known as Project Kuiper. ULA closes out 2025 with six launches, one more than the company achieved last year. But ULA’s new Vulcan rocket launched just once this year, disappointingly short of the company’s goal to fly Vulcan up to 10 times.

Taking stock of Amazon Leo… This year marked the start of the deployment of Amazon’s operational satellites. There are now 180 Amazon Leo satellites in orbit after Tuesday’s launch, well short of the FCC’s requirement for Amazon to deploy half of its planned 3,232 satellites by July 31, 2026. Amazon won’t meet the deadline, and it’s likely the retail giant will ask government regulators for a waiver or extension to the deadline. Amazon’s factory is hitting its stride producing and delivering Amazon Leo satellites. The real question is launch capacity. Amazon has contracts to launch satellites on ULA’s Atlas V and Vulcan rockets, Europe’s Ariane 6, and Blue Origin’s New Glenn. Early next year, a batch of 32 Amazon Leo satellites will launch on the first flight of Europe’s uprated Ariane 64 rocket from Kourou, French Guiana. (submitted by EllPeaTea)

A good year for Ariane 6. Europe’s Ariane 6 rocket launched four times this year after a debut test flight in 2024. The four successful missions deployed payloads for the French military, Europe’s weather satellite agency, the European Union’s Copernicus environmental monitoring network, and finally, on Wednesday, the European Galileo navigation satellite fleet, Space News reports. This is a strong showing for a new rocket flying from a new launch pad and a faster ramp-up of launch cadence than any medium- or heavy-lift rocket in recent memory. All five Ariane 6 launches to date have used the Ariane 62 configuration with two strap-on solid rocket boosters. The more powerful Ariane 64 rocket, with four strap-on motors, will make its first flight early next year.

Aiming high… This was the first launch using the Ariane 6 rocket’s ability to fly long-duration missions lasting several hours. The rocket’s cryogenic upper stage, with a restartable Vinci engine, took nearly four hours to inject two Galileo navigation satellites into an orbit more than 14,000 miles (nearly 23,000 kilometers) above the Earth. The flight profile put more stress on the Ariane 6 upper stage than any of the rocket’s previous missions, but the rocket released its payloads into an on-target orbit. (submitted by EllPeaTea)

ESA wants to do more with Ariane 6’s kick stage. The European Space Agency plans to adapt a contract awarded to ArianeGroup in 2021 for an Ariane 6 kick stage to cover its evolution into an orbital transfer vehicle, European Spaceflight reports. The original contract was for the development of the Ariane 6’s Astris kick stage, an optional addition for Ariane 6 missions to deploy payloads into multiple orbits or directly inject satellites into geostationary orbit. Last month, ESA’s member states committed approximately 100 million euros ($117 million) to refocus the Astris kick stage into a more capable Orbital Transfer Vehicle (OTV).

Strong support from Germany… ESA’s director of space transportation, Toni Tolker-Nielsen, said the performance of the Ariane 6 OTV will be “well beyond” that of the originally conceived Astris kick stage. The funding commitment obtained during last month’s ESA ministerial council meeting includes strong support from Germany, Tolker-Nielsen said. Under the new timeline, a protoflight mode of the OTV is expected to be ready for ground qualification by the end of 2028, with an inaugural flight following in 2029. (submitted EllPeaTea)

Another Starship clone in China. Every other week, it seems, a new Chinese launch company pops up with a rocket design and a plan to reach orbit within a few years. For a long time, the majority of these companies revealed designs that looked a lot like SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket. Now, Chinese companies are starting to introduce designs that appear quite similar to SpaceX’s newer, larger Starship rocket, Ars reports. The newest entry comes from a company called “Beijing Leading Rocket Technology.” This outfit took things a step further by naming its vehicle “Starship-1,” adding that the new rocket will have enhancements from AI and is billed as being a “fully reusable AI rocket.”

Starship prime… China has a long history of copying SpaceX. The country’s first class of reusable rockets, which began flying earlier this month, show strong similarities to the Falcon 9 rocket. Now, it’s Starship. The trend began with the Chinese government. In November 2024, the government announced a significant shift in the design of its super-heavy lift rocket, the Long March 9. Instead of the previous design, a fully expendable rocket with three stages and solid rocket boosters strapped to the sides, the country’s state-owned rocket maker revealed a vehicle that mimicked SpaceX’s fully reusable Starship. At least two more companies have announced plans for Starship-like rockets using SpaceX’s chopstick-style method for booster recovery. Many of these launch startups will not grow past the PowerPoint phase, of course.

            <h2>ByteDance confirms TikTok will be controlled by US owners</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After a year of stalled negotiations, TikTok owner ByteDance has reportedly agreed to Donald Trump’s deal giving US owners majority ownership of the app.

By signing the agreements, ByteDance has ended a prolonged period of uncertainty for millions of Americans who rely on TikTok for news, entertainment, social connection, and income. Under a law that Trump declined to enforce—which lawmakers convinced the Supreme Court was critical for national security—TikTok risked a US ban next year if the sale did not go through.

According to Reuters, terms of the deal match what was reported in September when Trump controversially confirmed that ByteDance would keep the algorithm. Under the deal, US investors and allies—including cloud computing firm Oracle, private equity group Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi-based MGX—will likely license the algorithm.

Together, those owners will control 80.1 percent of TikTok while China-based ByteDance retains a 19.9 percent stake, as well as one of seven board seats. To ensure that China has no access to US data to spy on Americans or tweak the algorithm to indoctrinate users with political propaganda, Oracle will serve as a “trusted security partner,” Reuters reported.

In a memo to staff reviewed by Reuters, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew confirmed that all US data “will be stored in a trusted and secure cloud environment in the United States run by Oracle,” with Oracle ultimately responsible for safeguarding US data.

Describing the deal as a “joint venture,” he confirmed that the US company would “operate as an independent entity with authority over US data protection, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurance.” But ByteDance would separately “manage global product interoperability and certain commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing.”

According to Trump, the deal ensures that TikTok complies with the divest-or-ban law, but the White House is still not providing more details. Instead, the Trump administration “referred questions about the deal to TikTok,” Reuters reported.

If the deal closes as expected on January 22, the new US company will have an estimated value of $14 billion, Vice President JD Vance noted in September.

At that point, the deal will likely face mounting scrutiny from lawmakers, including Republicans, who aren’t yet sure if the US operation resolves all national security concerns. Chinese control of the algorithm was a particular sticking point for critics, who claimed that Trump was giving China exactly what it wanted: international recognition for exporting leading technology to the US.

In September, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R.-Iowa) vowed to take a “hard line” and oppose the deal’s framework if it violates the divest-or-ban law. Already, Representative John Moolenaar (R-Mich.), chair of the House Select Committee on China, is planning to hold a hearing next year with US TikTok leadership.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has accused Trump of handing over “even more control of what you watch to his billionaire buddies,” through the TikTok deal, which she likened to enabling a “billionaire takeover of TikTok.” Many TikTokers likely share her concerns, after Trump suggested he’d like to see his hand-picked investors tweak the algorithm to be “100 percent MAGA.”

Questions remain until the exact terms of the deal become public, Warren said.

ByteDance did not respond to Ars’ request to comment.

With the terms obscured, it’s unclear how quickly TikTok may change in 2026 under US ownership. In July, the Information reported that when approximately 170 million US users get ported over to the new US-owned app, it could be buggy.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As The Guardian reports, AI chatbots are constantly stealing bits and pieces of their culinary insights and mashing them together into a statistical stew.

Even setting aside the question of whether the resulting recipes actually produce tasty food, the bots are biting the hand that feeds by destroying the business model behind the content they’re stealing: clicks that would be going to their food blogs are being diverted to the chatbots instead, depriving the actual recipe creators of eyeballs — and ad revenue — that historically kept them afloat.

“There are a lot of people that are scared to even talk about what’s going on because it is their livelihood,” Jim Delmage who runs the blog and YouTube channel Sip and Feast with his wife Tara, told The Guardian.

Matt Rodbard, the founder and editor-in-chief of the website Taste, wasn’t afraid to doomsay.

“For websites that depend on the advertising model,” he told the newspaper, “I think this is an extinction event in many ways.”

One of the main offenders is Google’s notoriously wonky AI Overviews, which provide a summary of search results that appear above the actual links to sites. Its most notable contribution to the culinary world was infamously recommending to put glue on pizza, an epicurean nugget of wisdom it sourced from a facetious Reddit comment.

The AI Overviews have been around for two years now, but recipe creators say they started seeing a nosedive in traffic since Google launched its “AI Mode” for search in March, through which it started offering full-blown AI-generated recipes, according to The Guardian.

And they’re disasters. Karen Tedesco, the author of the blog Familystyle Food, tested the AI Mode by searching for “Italian meatballs,” and was given a “synthesized” recipe that included hers and nine other sources, including a Washington Post recipe for Greek — not Italian — meatballs. Too many cooks, as they say, spoil the broth.

Rodbard, at Taste, acknowledges that food blogs weren’t doing themselves any favors by barraging visitors with too many ads — which, whatever you think of AI aggregators, they spare you the trouble of plodding through.

“Ad tech on these recipe blogs has gotten so bad, so many pop-up windows and so much crashing, we kind of lost as publishers,” Rodbard said.

Maybe, he suggests, the old-fashioned cookbook may be due for a comeback.

            <div id="article-text">Ozempic and similar weight loss drugs have been found to cut risks for a variety of health issues — ranging from heart to kidney disease — netting the pharma companies behind them billions of projected dollars in revenue over the next decade.

But in rare cases, this class of drugs called GLP-1 agonists can come with a debilitating side effects. Chief among them is blindness, which as Reuters reports has prompted patients who lost their eyesight to file more than 70 lawsuits against Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, the two major drug companies behind Ozempic and Mounjaro, respectively.

The lawsuits, in both federal and state courts, allege that these drugs gave patients a condition called non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, in which blood flow to the optic nerve stops and causes a person to lose vision.

Earlier this week, a federal judicial panel approved the consolidation of these lawsuits and that a Pennsylvania federal judge will preside over these cases — setting the stage for a legal showdown that could have immense implications for the future of the drugs, which have exploded in popularity over the past few years.

And the suits aren’t the only storm clouds on the horizon for GLP-1 manufacturers: they’re separate from another batch of litigation that alleges that these drugs can cause gastroparesis, in which the gastrointestinal tract stops moving food along for digestion.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first GLP-1 agonist drug back in 2005 to treat diabetes. Fast forward to 2021, and the FDA gave Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk the greenlight to make and manufacture Wegovy, which works the same way as Ozempic but is geared towards people who want to lose weight.

That monumental decision, along with a rush of positive press, kicked off the current craze for these weight loss drugs, which has seen celebrities like Oprah and Rebel Wilson shed pounds over a short amount of time.

But in the last couple of years, a growing number of people have reported severe side effects from using these medications, dampening the buzz around drugs that have often been touted as a miracle cure for a wide variety of conditions — even aging.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After a year of record gains for the crypto industry, recent forces have sent itinto a tailspin. Bitcoin, for example, reached dazzling heights of more than $120,000 in October — before crashing back down to around $88,000 today, about 12 percent down from where it was a year ago.

While that might be bad news for crypto bros or Robinhood day traders, one economist argues that the decline is actually good news for the rest of us.

Co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research Dean Baker argued in his blog Beat The Press this week that as the major cryptocurrencies fall, purchasing power for the rest of us goes up. In his analysis, he compares crypto to counterfeit currency — fake money that allows shady gangs to buy up all kinds of scarce goods, like houses and sports tickets.

When they buy up those goods with funny money, they help drive prices up, making them less affordable for those of us who don’t play the game.

“If some supersleuth detective figured out a way to recognize the counterfeit bills, they could then remove trillions of dollars of fake money from circulation,” Baker explains. “This would benefit the general public by reducing demand in the economy and reversing the run-up in the price of housing and Superbowl tickets. It is the same story with plunging crypto prices.”

From this reading, crypto — which infamously has no real value — allows people to suck up “large chunks” of the economy with a currency that’s built on thin air. When their share of fake money shrinks, it eases pressure on the rest of us. “To put it simply: there’s more for everyone else,” Baker explains.

We’re not talking small, intangible changes, either. By Baker’s count, the major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Etherium have shed over $1.2 trillion in market cap, or “enough to send every household in the United States a check for $10,000.”

In his thinking, everybody who doesn’t own it should be cheering for crypto’s ongoing downfall to continue.

“The only possible impact of lower crypto prices on production is that we will make less crypto,” says Baker. “The horror! The horror!”

            <h2>Netflix is betting on podcasts to become the new daytime talk show</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/netflix-is-betting-on-podcasts-to-become-the-new-daytime-talk-show/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When you tune in to a podcast, you’re probably not opening the Netflix app – at least for now.

That might change, if Netflix gets its way. The streamer signed deals with iHeartMedia and Barstool Sports this week, in addition to a recent deal with Spotify, to gain exclusive video rights to select shows. The company is also rumored to be in talks with SiriusXM.

Podcasters see this as an offensive move with YouTube as the primary target. And the data provides a convincing argument. YouTube shared this week that viewers watched over 700 million hours of podcasts on living room devices (like TVs) in 2025, up from 400 million last year.

“As people begin to spend less time watching traditional television, and more time watching short form or low cost, low production value content on YouTube, that might present a long term competitive threat to Netflix,” Matthew Dysart, an entertainment attorney and former head of podcast business affairs at Spotify, told TechCrunch.

While podcasters might understand the motivation, not everyone is convinced about Netflix’s move. Some podcasters told TechCrunch they’re not sure there is long-term value in video podcasts, while others are worried Netflix is contributing to a podcast bubble.

“They’re basically saying, ‘we want to be the king of content, and the only way we’re going to do that is if we take a swipe at YouTube,’” podcaster Ronald Young Jr. told TechCrunch. Still, Young Jr. thinks people are turning on video podcasts and letting them play in the background, noting that ESPN has been doing some version of this for much longer than we’ve been able to name it.

When independent podcasters Mike Schubert and Sequoia Simone launched their new show “Professional Talkers” this year, they noted the buzz around video podcasts and decided to start the new show as a video-first production on YouTube and Spotify.

“Neither of us had done video before, so we were like, ‘Why don’t we just start from the beginning and make this a video show?’” Schubert told TechCrunch.

Schubert found that his audience was ambivalent toward the video, perhaps because he has spent nearly a decade releasing audio podcasts, cultivating a fanbase that already enjoys and expects audio content.

“We posted an audio-only episode, and it did pretty similarly, numbers-wise,” he said. “So why would we put so much time and effort into the video and then run the risk of the episode being late when we can just do audio only?”

Young Jr. considered investing more energy into video, but decided against it – like Schubert and Simone, he realized that he built an audience that prefers listening to podcasts than viewing them.

“I’m like, ‘Well who am I pivoting for?’” he said. “And I realized that the pivot would be for advertisers, for podcast executives, and for people who think that video is the direction that everyone’s going.”

Still, there are some consumers who want to see video — even as a passive show to turn on in the background — as evidenced by YouTube’s staggering viewership stats.

Mikah Sargent, a podcast producer and host at TWiT.tv, works with shows like “This Week in Tech,” which have had a video component for more than fifteen years. (Disclosure: I co-host a show at TWiT.tv once per month.)

“Something that I regularly hear from our listeners is… ‘you were my background when I was going through a rough time, or I needed to travel across the country, and having you there to listen to helped me pass the time,’” Sargent told TechCrunch. “There’s a lot of passed time with podcasts. So Netflix can look at that and go, ‘Ooh, we get to have this thing that in some cases takes up more time and more streaming than you would get with a typical show.’”

There’s a disconnect between how creators and tech companies each think about podcasts. For people who make podcasts, a podcast can be a conversational show like the ones on YouTube, but it can also be a format that doesn’t translate seamlessly to video, like scripted fiction with sound design and voice actors, or the kind of reported, refined audio stories you’d find on NPR.

“I think this has to do with how squishy the word podcast is now,” podcaster Eric Silver told TechCrunch. “It means anything. It just means show now.”

For these independent creators, the corporate goings-on between Netflix and Spotify don’t immediately impact their day-to-day. But podcasters remember what happened when Spotify bought up and consolidated a significant chunk of the industry, created a bubble, then burst that same bubble itself. The impact reverberated across the industry with studio closures, layoffs, and a conception among onlookers that podcasting was “dead.” So when another big tech company comes waltzing into their industry, they’re skeptical.

“In any form of entertainment and media, when companies consolidate, the people who currently have power continue to get richer and richer than the industry underneath it,” Silver said. “The future gets more and more murky, and has less and less resources.”

Netflix isn’t making as extreme moves as Spotify. The latter company spent billions acquiring several tech startups and studios, allowing Spotify to control the entire process of making a podcast, from the recording software to the ad sales tools.

“I think that what Netflix is doing is a little bit more calculated than what Spotify did,” Young Jr. said. “Spotify blindly threw money at the top creators, and they kind of cratered the market in doing so, because the minute you value Joe Rogan at $250 million…  you value them so highly that the regular podcaster is like, where do I fall on this?”

But what’s seen as an industry-changing infusion of money into the podcast industry isn’t actually that staggering for a company like Netflix, which is on track to make about $45 billion this year.

“Netflix and Spotify are similar in that way – aggressive moves to test a new value proposition by targeting top performers and spending money that ultimately is not that substantial from the perspective of a global tech platform, but is meaningful to the creator economy, to quickly learn if there’s a ‘there’ there.” Dysart said.

Netflix has only made deals with media companies thus far, rather than individual creators like Spotify did, but Dysart thinks Netflix’s investments are only beginning.

“I would expect Netflix to at some point go try to strike a nine-figure deal with a top podcast creator,” he added.  “I would also expect Netflix to take really big swings with very high profile personalities on original podcasts.”

If Netflix gets its way, our culture will shift away from watching programmatic daytime TV and talk shows, and toward watching podcasts.

“Back in the day, my mom would have a soap opera playing in the background while she was doing things, and I was definitely the person who would have ‘The Office’ playing in the background while I’m doing things,” Sargent said. “Now, people get to have a podcast playing in the background while they’re doing things, and if Netflix can be the place where they go to do that, then I think it’s a win for the company.”

            <h2>OpenAI adds new teen safety rules to ChatGPT as lawmakers weigh AI standards for minors</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/openai-adds-new-teen-safety-rules-to-models-as-lawmakers-weigh-ai-standards-for-minors/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In its latest effort to address growing concerns about AI’s impact on young people, OpenAI on Thursday updated its guidelines for how its AI models should behave with users under 18, and published new AI literacy resources for teens and parents. Still, questions remain about how consistently such policies will translate into practice.

The updates come as the AI industry generally, and OpenAI in particular, faces increased scrutiny from policymakers, educators, and child-safety advocates after several teenagers allegedly died by suicide after prolonged conversations with AI chatbots.

Gen Z, which includes those born between 1997 and 2012, are the most active users of OpenAI’s  chatbot. And following OpenAI’s recent deal with Disney, more young people may flock to the platform, which lets you do everything from ask for help with homework to generate images and videos on thousands of topics.

Last week, 42 state attorneys general signed a letter to Big Tech companies, urging them to implement safeguards on AI chatbots to protect children and vulnerable people. And as the Trump administration works out what the federal standard on AI regulation might look like, policymakers like Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) have introduced legislation that would ban minors from interacting with AI chatbots altogether.

OpenAI’s updated Model Spec, which lays out behavior guidelines for its large language models, builds on existing specifications that prohibit the models from generating sexual content involving minors, or encouraging self-harm, delusions or mania. This would work together with an upcoming age-prediction model that would identify when an account belongs to a minor and automatically roll out teen safeguards.

Compared with adult users, the models are subject to stricter rules when a teenager is using them. Models are instructed to avoid immersive romantic roleplay, first-person intimacy, and first-person sexual or violent roleplay, even when it’s non-graphic. The specification also calls for extra caution around subjects like body image and disordered eating behaviors, instructs the models to prioritize communicating about safety over autonomy when harm is involved, and avoid advice that would help teens conceal unsafe behavior from caregivers.

OpenAI specifies that these limits should hold even when prompts are framed as “fictional, hypothetical, historical, or educational” — common tactics that rely on role-play or edge-case scenarios in order to get an AI model to deviate from its guidelines.

OpenAI says the key safety practices for teens are underpinned by four principles that guide the models’ approach:

The document also shares several examples of the chatbot explaining why it can’t “roleplay as your girlfriend” or “help with extreme appearance changes or risky shortcuts.”

Lily Li, a privacy and AI lawyer and founder of Metaverse Law, said it was encouraging to see OpenAI take steps to have its chatbot decline to engage in such behavior.

Explaining that one of the biggest complaints advocates and parents have about chatbots is that they relentlessly promote ongoing engagement in a way that can be addictive for teens, she said: “I am very happy to see OpenAI say, in some of these responses, we can’t answer your question. The more we see that, I think that would break the cycle that would lead to a lot of inappropriate conduct or self-harm.”

That said, examples are just that: cherry-picked instances of how OpenAI’s safety team would like the models to behave. Sycophancy, or an AI chatbot’s tendency to be overly agreeable with the user, has been listed as a prohibited behavior in previous versions of the Model Spec, but ChatGPT still engaged in that behavior anyway. That was particularly true with GPT-4o, a model that has been associated with several instances of what experts are calling “AI psychosis.”

Robbie Torney, senior director of AI program at Common Sense Media, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting kids in the digital world, raised concerns about potential conflicts within the Model Spec’s under-18 guidelines. He highlighted tensions between safety-focused provisions and the “no topic is off limits” principle, which directs models to address any topic regardless of sensitivity.

“We have to understand how the different parts of the spec fit together,” he said, noting that certain sections may push systems toward engagement over safety. His organization’s testing revealed that ChatGPT often mirrors users’ energy, sometimes resulting in responses that aren’t contextually appropriate or aligned with user safety, he said.

In the case of Adam Raine, a teenager who died by suicide after months of dialogue with ChatGPT, the chatbot engaged in such mirroring, their conversations show. That case also brought to light how OpenAI’s moderation API failed to prevent unsafe and harmful interactions despite flagging more than 1,000 instances of ChatGPT mentioning suicide and 377 messages containing self-harm content. But that wasn’t enough to stop Adam from continuing his conversations with ChatGPT.

In an interview with TechCrunch in September, former OpenAI safety researcher Steven Adler said this was because, historically, OpenAI had run classifiers (the automated systems that label and flag content) in bulk after the fact, not in real time, so they didn’t properly gate the user’s interaction with ChatGPT.

OpenAI now uses automated classifiers to assess text, image and audio content in real time, according to the firm’s updated parental controls document. The systems are designed to detect and block content related to child sexual abuse material, filter sensitive topics, and identify self-harm. If the system flags a prompt that suggests a serious safety concern, a small team of trained people will review the flagged content to determine if there are signs of “acute distress,” and may notify a parent.

Torney applauded OpenAI’s recent steps toward safety, including its transparency in publishing guidelines for users under 18 years old.

“Not all companies are publishing their policy guidelines in the same way,” Torney said, pointing to Meta’s leaked guidelines, which showed that the firm let its chatbots engage in sensual and romantic conversations with children. “This is an example of the type of transparency that can support safety researchers and the general public in understanding how these models actually function and how they’re supposed to function.”

Ultimately, though, it is the actual behavior of an AI system that matters, Adler told TechCrunch on Thursday.

“I appreciate OpenAI being thoughtful about intended behavior, but unless the company measures the actual behaviors, intentions are ultimately just words,” he said.

Put differently: what’s missing from this announcement is evidence that ChatGPT actually follows the guidelines set out in the Model Spec.

Experts say with these guidelines, OpenAI appears poised to get ahead of certain legislation, like California’s SB 243, a recently-signed bill regulating AI companion chatbots that goes into effect in 2027.

The Model Spec’s new language language mirrors some of the law’s main requirements around prohibiting chatbots from engaging in conversations around suicidal ideation, self-harm, or sexually explicit content. The bill also requires platforms to provide alerts every three hours to minors reminding them they are speaking to a chatbot, not a real person, and they should take a break.

When asked how often ChatGPT would remind teens that they’re talking to a chatbot and ask them to take a break, an OpenAI spokesperson did not share details, saying only that the company trains its models to represent themselves as AI and remind users of that, and that it implements break reminders during “long sessions.”

The company also shared two new AI literacy resources for parents and families. The tips include conversation starters and guidance to help parents talk to teens about what AI can and can’t do, build critical thinking, set healthy boundaries, and navigate sensitive topics.

Taken together, the documents formalize an approach that shares responsibility with caretakers: OpenAI spells out what the models should do, and offers families a framework for supervising how it’s used.

The focus on parental responsibility is notable because it mirrors Silicon Valley talking points. In its recommendations for federal AI regulation posted this week, VC firm Andreessen Horowitz suggested more disclosure requirements for child safety, rather than restrictive requirements, and weighted the onus more towards parental responsibility.

Several of OpenAI’s principles – safety-first when values conflict; nudging users toward real-world support; reinforcing that the chatbot isn’t a person – are being articulated as teen guardrails. But several adults have died by suicide and suffered life-threatening delusions, which invites an obvious follow-up: Should those defaults apply across the board, or does OpenAI see them as trade-offs it’s only willing to enforce when minors are involved?

An OpenAI spokesperson countered that the firm’s safety approach is designed to protect all users, saying the Model Spec is just one component of a multi-layered strategy.

Li says it has been a “bit of a wild west” so far regarding the legal requirements and tech companies’ intentions. But she feels laws like SB 243, which requires tech companies to disclose their safeguards publicly, will change the paradigm.

“The legal risks will show up now for companies if they advertise that they have these safeguards and mechanisms in place on their website, but then don’t follow through with incorporating these safeguards,” Li said. “Because then, from a plaintiff’s point of view, you’re not just looking at the standard litigation or legal complaints; you’re also looking at potential unfair, deceptive advertising complaints.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/known-uses-voice-ai-to-help-you-go-on-more-in-person-dates/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Celeste Amadon and Asher Allen were working on an app that used AI to book restaurants for dates when they stumbled on a bigger idea that encourages people to meet in person. And now it’s catching on with investors.

The duo created a voice-powered AI onboarding system for its app that helped them learn more about users without them having to fill out a form. What they discovered: People loved to talk, and that increased the length of the onboarding session with the app clocking 26 minutes on average. That is how San Francisco-based dating startup Known was born.

“Our take is that for the first time, we could know enough about somebody to serve them a date that would make sense. And if we could do that much faster with less rejection rate, we could create a user experience that could get people out on more dates,” she said.

And early results suggested they were on to something.

In its test phase in San Francisco, Known said it observed 80% of its introductions led to physical dates, which is much higher than swipe-based dating apps. Buoyed by these signals, the startup has raised $9.7 million from investors, including Forerunner and NFX, along with Pear VC and Coelius Capital. Notably, this is the first dating app investment for Forerunner.

“Celeste is a really thoughtful founder to understand the mindset of the consumer, which is a young female, to be honest. There are other people who can be focused on the male demographic, but she is focused on the young female who has a lot of unspoken desires and needs that, if you put them in a profile, they would never say, this versus that. And I think in a conversation, you can get a lot of those nuances out, but in the past, the conversation required a $10,000 matchmaker,” Eurie Kim, a partner at Forerunner, told TechCrunch.

Amadon said she has always been very interested in social impact at scale and thinks dating is inherently one of the biggest problems facing her generation.

“There’s been a million pieces written about the loneliness epidemic in the U.S. And I do really think that it’s our generation’s largest problem,” said Amadon, who, along with Allen, dropped out of Stanford to build the startup.

The app, which is under testing in San Francisco in beta, uses voice AI-powered onboarding to ask several questions to users without having them fill out any forms. Amadon said because of this modality, the startup is able to know more about users and provide them with great matches, with one user’s onboarding clocking in at an hour and 38 minutes.

When people typed their responses out, they would edit them, according to Known. With voice, the onboarding is more personable. The company’s AI can ask dynamic follow-ups based on the conversation. For instance, if someone has newly moved to the city, AI can ask them what they like and dislike about their experience thus far.

Once the onboarding is complete, the AI suggests potential matches to users. They can ask AI agents about those profiles. If they like a profile, they can tap on “interested.” When two people are matched, they have 24 hours to accept the introduction and 24 hours to agree to a date. The company said that with this mechanism, the app is trying to avoid lingering chats and ghosting while encouraging people to meet in real life. After their dates, users can provide their feedback to AI and get more refined recommendations for matches.

Known hasn’t completely ditched the restaurant idea. The app also helps in picking restaurants based on user likes and dislikes. Using the AI chat and calendar integrations, users can also inform about their availability for the first dates. In the beta phase, the company charged $30 per successful date. However, the startup is not set on the price and said it will experiment with different models to find out what payment modality works the best.

Today the startup has three full-time engineers and four people working on go-to-market, with several contractors working in all areas. Amadon, whose previous experience includes internships in politics, and Allen, who worked on product at AI-powered online shopping app Phia, plan to bolster headcount with this fundraiser.

Known is currently testing in San Francisco and plans to launch early next year.

There are several other new startups, including Overtone, Hinge CEO Justin McLeod’s new app, that are trying to use AI to know more about users and try to find matches for them. Some of them want to claim that they are bringing bespoke services of matchmakers that cost thousands of dollars at a fraction of the cost. Incumbents like Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge are also pushing AI features to keep their user base engaged. Despite the growing number of startups, Amadon is happy with the competition.

“When it comes to other startup dating products, I’ve been so happy to see a lot of people building in the space because I think it shows that it’s time to shift away from a swipe-based model. And I think most of them that I’ve seen have been pretty different from what we’re building at Known,” She said.

            <h2>A Peek at an Alternate Venice</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-19</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is an edition of the Books Briefing, our editors’ weekly guide to the best in books.

Venice is a city so globally famous that even those who have never been there tend to hold opinions about it. In my experience, those are frequently negative: It’s too expensive, too hot, too crowded with tourists. Calling it overrated has almost become a cliché; people love to remind one another that it’s sinking—fast. At the same time, few places have had as strong, or as enduring, a hold on the artistic imagination. John Singer Sargent, Claude Monet, and Isabella Stewart Gardner, among many others, have long been inspired by Venice’s rich cultural history and captivating views.

First, here are three new stories from The Atlantic’s Books section:

Henry James was part of that group. He visited Venice 10 times between 1869 and 1907, and made it the setting of his 1888 novella The Aspern Papers, which was serialized in The Atlantic. The book’s narrator goes to Italy on a hunt for letters by the late poet Jeffrey Aspern to a former lover, Juliana, which he believes the now-elderly lady has secreted away in her palazzo. This year, we sent Anne Applebaum on a related quest: She showed up in Italy searching for the city James got to know—the Venice that inspired a substantial part of his work.

James’s Venice doesn’t dwell among oppressive crowds and opulent halls; it lurks in deserted squares, on less-traveled islands, and within cool, dark churches that hold Renaissance masterpieces. Venice was already becoming a tourist hot spot when James was alive, but he gloried in another city, and that city still exists. Even now, “if you take an odd turn down a narrow pathway and head away from the main attractions,” Applebaum writes, “the crowds thin out, and eventually you can find yourself quite alone.” James wrote appealingly about exploring the city’s “campos—the little squares formed about every church—some of them most sunnily desolate, the most grass-grown, the most cheerfully sad little reliquaries of a splendid past that you can imagine.”

Applebaum’s trip helped me think of Venice differently. She enjoyed the same “perfect light” on the island of Torcello that James saw, the same gold mosaic that covers one wall of the Basilica of Santa Maria Assunta; she even walked through the same palazzo on which James modeled the one in The Aspern Papers. She stood on the balcony of the Palazzo Barbaro, another house where James frequently stayed, looking out at the Grand Canal just as the author did almost 150 years ago. If you know where to look, she argues, and if you take the time to do so, the old Venice is always there.

In James’s The Aspern Papers, an American uses “duplicity” to access a palazzo. Fortunately, there are easier ways to discover the writer’s beloved Venice.

This novel is so packed with plot that Quentin Tarantino adapted it into the extra-long film Jackie Brown, in 1997. If you’ve seen the movie, you might imagine Pam Grier sauntering across the page, but this is a breakneck novel in its own right: Characters make and shatter alliances at dizzying speed, and nobody’s motives are ever quite what they seem. A middle-aged flight attendant, Jackie Burke, finds herself trapped between the FBI and an ambitious gunrunner when she gets caught moving his merchandise across international borders. Shoot-outs, sting operations, and boatloads of blow: This book has it all. It’s a terrific beach read, but it has enough substance to keep you sustained no matter where you pick it up.  — M. L. Rio

From our list: Eight plot-heavy books that will keep you turning pages

A Daring New Take on Shakespeare’s Most Famous Soliloquy

The “To be, or not to be” soliloquy sets a particularly tricky trap. On-screen, the speech’s prestige can overwhelm its existential subject matter, and the passage tends to get overacted. “Because it’s a beautiful speech,” Peter Kirwan, a professor of Shakespeare and performance at Mary Baldwin University, told me, “the beauty of the speech kind of takes away from what it actually means for someone to be working through this.” The fact that any soliloquy halts dramatic action also poses a challenge. Onstage, an actor can naturally hold an audience’s attention, being in the same physical venue. Cinema’s visual language, though, has the potential to undermine the words’ meaning. The sentiment can become a spectacle more than an interior reflection made exterior.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For Avatar fans, I have great news: The latest installment of James Cameron’s magical-alien adventure saga is here, and you’re going to love it. Avatar: Fire and Ash, the third entry in a franchise that has consumed the attention of Hollywood’s greatest action-movie director for the past two decades, is a giddy bundle of familiar sights: willowy blue warrior-aliens; Day-Glo beasts of air, land, and sea; eminently jeer-worthy humans trying to invade a celestial paradise. The bad news for anyone not already on board: This film has no interest in you.

The sense of exclusivity is the one big charge I can level against Fire and Ash, which furthers the fable of Pandora, the fantastical moon that’s home to the Na’vi. The focus remains on Jake Sully (played by Sam Worthington), a soldier who has permanently ported himself into a Na’vi body; he’s now raising a family with his warrior-queen wife, Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña). The previous chapter in their tale, 2022’s The Way of Water, felt like a newcomer-friendly reinvention for the series. Its sequel is a straightforward continuation by comparison, mostly keeping to previously introduced environments and enemies. But Cameron has spent ample time building out this sci-fi world, whose nooks, crannies, and philosophical limits are still delightful to examine.

Fire and Ash makes clear up front that it’s different from the previous Avatar films, though, by opening on a downbeat note. It picks up directly after The Way of Water, which is a cheerful romp through a reef-side Na’vi community that ends in tragedy: Jake’s oldest son dying in a fight against an army of human colonizers. Thus, Fire and Ash has a dark pall over its proceedings; the protagonists are still in mourning and planning courses of vengeance. It contains less of the sense of discovery that makes the prior entries so thrilling, such as their navigation of an ecosystem and all of the intricately designed creatures within it. Instead, the movie devotes itself to weighing the cost of Jake’s arrival on Pandora, and his transformation into a member of its native species. The heavier tone is appropriate for the story Cameron is trying to tell. It’s just also a little less joyful.

Read: Hollywood learned all the wrong lessons from Avatar

Meanwhile, as ever with Avatar (and most of the director’s works), the screenwriting is direct to the point of clunkiness. All of the dialogue is geared toward communicating plot or plainly stating a character’s emotional state. The straightforwardness is in the service of Cameron’s real preoccupation, however: exploring and further building out this strange utopia. This film’s best invention is the “ash people,” a Na’vi clan that lives in the volcanic mountains. Although the other Na’vi are very tapped into large Mother Gaia notions of flora and fauna, and the belief that everyone is connected on Pandora, the ash people have a much more nihilistic worldview. Their disdain for their home is somewhat frightening, as is their eagerness to take up human arms—yet they’re refreshingly novel too.

The ash people’s perspective allies them with the group looking to strip-mine Pandora’s resources. They get on particularly well with the franchise’s knottiest figure, the villainous Quaritch (Stephen Lang). He’s a wonderfully perverse creation, an invading warrior now trapped in the form of his enemy; after dying in the first Avatar, Quaritch had his consciousness cloned into a Na’vi body. As usual, Lang plays the brute’s Heart of Darkness–esque descent into madness with gleeful relish. Quaritch finds a twin soul in the form of the ash people’s leader, Varang (Oona Chaplin). The two pretty quickly embark on a lot of drug-fueled campfire happenings, as if they’re at Burning Man. Theirs is the kind of loopy side quest that only Cameron has the guts to cram into a Christmastime blockbuster.

Narrative turns such as this are why I find it impossible to be bored by these movies. There’s always some bizarre new sci-fi consideration among the extravagant bits of combat. One of the most notable ideas that Fire and Ash throws around is the relationship between Sully’s adopted teenagers: Kiri (Sigourney Weaver, playing a dreamy pseudo-clone of the actor’s human character in the first Avatar) and Quaritch’s son, Spider (Jack Champion), who has miraculously adapted to life on Pandora like some space-age Tarzan. Each of them represents evolutionary concepts, such as adaptation, through which Cameron expands an already-mystical universe; their paths pave the most intriguing ground for future stories to develop on.

Read: Hollywood’s love affair with fictional languages

Their subplot also represents Avatar at its most complex. Playing the hits—Jake, Neytiri, and company doing glorious battle with men in mech suits—would have been easy, and Fire and Ash still serves up plenty of impressive warfare. Yet the Na’vi are just as often seen plugging their ponytail into an animal, or even into the roots of trees, to share their consciousness. That’s Avatar’s potent, if polarizing, cocktail: Hippie-ish spirituality comfortably exists alongside absurd action scenes, such as when Jake nerfs Marines with a carbine rifle while flying on the back of a dinosaur. I have no clue whether Cameron wants to keep working on the series; he’s been somewhat demure about the possibility of additional sequels, having already devoted a huge chunk of his career to the skies and seas of Pandora. The director clearly isn’t trying to win people over in the meantime, but I’ll never turn down a chance to delve into this gigantic, goofy world.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Earlier this month, many attractive people filled a room in Lower Manhattan. They drank elaborate cocktails and gazed upon Instagram-y art installations and left with a gift bag that contained, among other things, earbuds studded with Swarovski crystals. The vibe was high-end, sophisticated, arty. The guest of honor was a color.

Pantone throws a party like this one annually, in conjunction with the announcement of its “Color of the Year.” For 2026, it’s “Cloud Dancer,” which, the company notes in a press release, “serves as a symbol of calming influence in a frenetic society rediscovering the value of measured consideration and quiet reflection.” The color, the release continues, also helps peel “away layers of outmoded thinking,” “making room for innovation,” and, of course, reminds us that “true strength lies not just in doing, but also in being.” (It’s white.)

The choice was controversial in the banal way that everything is controversial now. Some people noted, pointing to the news, that this was maybe not the year to publish a press release about how awesome whiteness is, and some other people found that argument to be a very serious symptom of the woke mind virus. People took to Instagram to call the choice tone-deaf, or to label it trolling, or, in a few cases, to announce that they were “rejecting” Cloud Dancer, as though the color itself were an unsavory ideology and not a band of light visible to the human eye. Other people reacted to the reaction by suggesting that critics of Cloud Dancer were terminally offended hysterics looking for racism where absolutely none exists. Credulous news stories about the debate filled my feeds. I began to seriously worry that this frenetic society might not, in fact, rediscover the value of measured consideration and quiet reflection.

Read: Rage bait is a brilliant word of the year

White—like all colors, but maybe more than most—is loaded with meaning. Throughout history, it has carried with it commanding associations: with elitism, purity, nobility, wealth, moral superiority. (The architect Adolf Loos, in his seminal 1908 essay arguing that ornamentation was “degenerate,” hoped for a world where “the streets of the city will glisten like white walls.”) It is certainly not neutral, as Pantone has suggested in the Cloud Dancer rollout. If you ask a physicist, white isn’t even technically a color, because it does not exist on a single wavelength. The choice is strange by almost any measure. But then again, so is the concept of a color of the year.

As companies go, Pantone is an odd one. It does not sell paint, despite its association with paint swatches. It does not sell any of the machinery needed to make paint or produce fabric, either. It does not invent new colors, because that’s not (generally) possible. What it sells is a standard: For more than 60 years, it has categorized, named, and numbered more than 10,000 different shades, each rendered into format-specific formulas. The idea is that any designer in the world can be sure that the pinky purple in an ad on their computer screen will perfectly match the pinky purple that appears in the ad when it is printed in a magazine, and will perfectly match the pinky purple that appears on the packaging for the product the ad is for, because they are all Pantone 246 C. Much of Pantone’s business is selling color-swatch guides to designers, artists, and marketers to ensure this uniformity, which is hugely important to their jobs. The company is, in other words, in the intellectual-property business, and it has an effective monopoly over its particular field.

Pantone offers a genuine utility in the same way that the dictionary does. But it’s a fairly boring one, with a fairly limited audience. Over the years, the company has expanded its remit, finding new and impressionistic ways to sell color, and itself as the arbiter thereof. (“God created the world in seven days. And on the eighth day, he called Pantone to put color into it,” the company’s founder, Lawrence Herbert, once said.) In 1986, Pantone opened a consulting arm, through which its experts advise companies on how to use color in packaging and logos—a decade ago, it worked with Universal to develop and trademark Minion Yellow (13-0851 TCX). These days, the company also sells trend-forecast reports, and licenses its name and colors to other companies: You can now buy Pantone-branded sneakers, key chains, and mugs in its robust online store, and for a period of time in the 2010s, you could stay in a Pantone-branded hotel in Brussels.

From the February 2025 issue: What not to wear: The false promise of seasonal-color analysis

The most absurd invention, however, is the color of the year, which the company started announcing at the turn of the millennium, ostensibly to “draw attention to the relationship between culture and color,” though practically it just drew attention to Pantone. The annual color is apparently meant to reflect humanity’s deep yearnings—for “closeness and connection” (peach, 2024), or “a new narrative” (magenta, 2023)—but also to predict its future tastes. And the color’s very announcement has become a massive cultural and commercial occasion—a global news event created out of thin air, and a coup of publicity and corporate synergy unlike anything else I can think of. (Imagine Oxford University Press licensing its word of the year—incidentally, rage bait—for use in products.) The color of the year takes something available to everyone, in nature, and sells it back to us.

This year, the high-end hotel chain Mandarin Oriental is incorporating Cloud Dancer into its properties. The furniture company Joybird is making sofas in it. For the people who can’t stand to use off-trend Command hooks, 3M has unveiled a Cloud Dancer line, and for the serenity-seeking preschooler, Play-Doh has released a special edition of its signature Doh. The controversy has abated, but the stuff to buy will stick around.</div>

This, the WSJ is transparent about its bias at least, especially now [pbs.org] that it&#39;s owned by Jeff Bezos. But between being a financially unstable company to start with, selling a stale product that had filled its niche, getting slapped with massive tariffs by Trump, the WSJ chose to blame the trustbuster who attacked the boss&#39; company, which is letting political axe-grinding turn into bad journalism.

It&#39;s the Washington Post that Bezos owns, not the Wall Street Journal.

The Defense division was the real money maker and splitting it off is what killed the consumer company.  The thing that killed the buyout was the fear of an Alexa Vacuum Cleaner, not warehouse automation.

They had a defense version of iRobot vacuum? Huh!

I have to think that there were a few other steps between #1 seller of robotic vacuums and chapter 11.  Maybe even 10 chapters :-)

Nothing the Roomba did was non-obvious. They just demonstrated there was a lucrative market for it. China didn&#39;t need to copy anything just make their own version that eventually became a superior product.

They&#39;re up-front about it, and if you&#39;re aware of the bias, they&#39;re probably the best national paper in terms of factual business reporting. Just skip the editorial page, it consists of almost entirely of indulging the resentments of the geriatric rich.

iRobot has been circling the drain for years, they why they were desperate to sell to Amazon.

I am sure that iRobot will be a much better behaved company under Chinese ownership than it would have been under Amazon. /s

When Robert F. Kennedy Jr. convened a panel on Monday to discuss “chronic Lyme,” many leading researchers of the disease were genuinely excited. Kennedy’s Department of Health and Human Services promised to allocate more resources to understanding the disease. There was hope, among experts, that this would mean an important new chapter for Lyme research.

But there’s a problem: Kennedy is a conspiracy theorist with seemingly little understanding of how modern science works. It didn’t emerge in Monday’s roundtable, but Kennedy, for example, once claimed Lyme disease was developed by the U.S. military as a bioweapon in the ’70s. He still maintains that the medical community has “gaslit” the public over Lyme and even asserted, without evidence, that during the Biden years, there were top officials within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services who, due to political motivations, were “saying Lyme disease did not exist.”

This is not an ideal mindset to bring to any medical topic, but it’s particularly troubling for Lyme, given that it is already one of the most controversial diseases.

Active Lyme disease, identified in the 1970s, is not a particularly mysterious illness. The tick bite that transfers the bacteria typically causes an easily identifiable bullseye rash; once spotted, symptoms, which can include fever, headaches, stiffness, and fatigue, can be resolved with a round of antibiotics. The treatment of active Lyme is fairly straightforward. But the aftermath of active Lyme remains a deeply unsettled area of science. A subset of Lyme patients go on to complain of arthritis-like joint pain, fatigue, and neurological issues for years afterward. For a smaller population, the symptoms become debilitating. Some patients grow desperate and even suicidal.

Until recently, many mainstream medical professionals disputed the idea of “chronic Lyme” altogether, insisting that Lyme was done once it was treated with antibiotics. Any complaints the patients had afterward, they argued, likely resulted from other conditions or from psychiatric disorders, which can indeed cause severe physical symptoms. But patients don’t like being told something is all in their head, particularly when their lives are falling apart over a maddeningly persistent illness. As a result, a “Lyme community” began to form of patients who felt forced to become their own champions and validate one another’s suffering. Many looked for answers outside conventional medicine.

The rush of pseudoscientists, grifters, wellness influencers, and celebrity advocates into the space only made the chronic Lyme debate more fraught. Even the term “chronic Lyme” was, and is, highly charged: In medical literature, doctors call it Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome, in part to clarify that they are not referring to a continuous, chronic infection with the bacteria but only to a constellation of symptoms that develop and linger after confirmed bouts of Lyme disease. The people this term doesn’t include are those—often self-diagnosed laypeople or the patients of anti-scientific practitioners—who believe that they have insidious Lyme infections missed by blood tests and persistent beyond any normal antibiotic treatment. (The research does not show any evidence for a chronic Lyme infection, experts said.) These patients never developed the rash or had any other concrete evidence of Lyme infection. These are the cases that caused many in the mainstream medical community to dismiss “chronic Lyme” as nonsense.

But mainstream scientists weren’t entirely ignoring the possibility of both undetectable and chronic Lyme, as much as Kennedy may insist otherwise. Many researchers agreed there was a need for better testing and that it was possible that real Lyme sufferers were going undiagnosed. And even in the earliest Lyme studies, experts said, the National Institutes of Health had attempted to suss out longer-term damage. The problem, said Dr. Brian Fallon, the director of the Lyme and Tick-Borne Diseases Research Center at Columbia University, was that most Lyme research dealt primarily with “well-defined” patients—those with telltale rashes and active infection that showed on blood tests—in order to have clean, careful studies. Those patients were those with the easiest cases, with easy diagnostics and prompt treatment. The potentially messier cases, without rashes, or with long periods of infection without treatment, were not taken into account. The pace of the research moved relatively slowly, given that Lyme was never such an urgent problem. It is not deadly or contagious like Ebola or AIDS. For many patients, it’s more like a temporary inconvenience.

But two things changed. First, climate change has made Lyme an increasingly visible and pressing issue. As the tick population explodes across North America, Lyme has become a virtually inescapable threat in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest. Second, a global pandemic struck. In its aftermath, research institutions turned their resources to questions about COVID’s long-term effects. As they did, they began to bring those same questions to other infectious diseases that might result in chronic conditions.

“It shouldn’t come as any surprise to the world right now that infections can cause chronic problems, because of what we have learned from long COVID,” Fallon said. “I think it’s helped tremendously in changing the conversation. … There’s a great deal of interest in looking at something that’s been ignored.”

It is now a potent moment for Lyme research. If scientists can get the funding and resources they need to develop better diagnostics and unlock the mechanism that explains what is making chronic Lyme patients sick, it could bring profound relief to hundreds of thousands of Americans, allowing them to get the care they need. But a large part of pursuing a major medical breakthrough is separating science from pseudoscience in order to allow the scientific process to proceed with its dispassionate methods. And Kennedy has shown that he is incapable of that—and is steering his HHS accordingly.

There are urgent reasons, beyond the success of future research, for the leading medical institutions in the country to try to purge the lingering anti-scientific elements in the Lyme conversation: They may actually put patients’ health at risk. When confusion meets desperation, as it does when the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health cannot provide any clarity, patients and doctors may seek out unconventional answers.

“A lot of these patients undergo bizarre, unapproved therapies, like extended intravenous antibiotic therapies, for months or even years,” Dr. Durland Fish, the chief executive officer of the American Lyme Disease Foundation, told Slate. “A lot of them are bogus.”

These treatments, Fish said, can be expensive, as they usually aren’t covered by insurance. And they can be deeply dispiriting when they don’t work. Some patients, he said, can become depressed and even suicidal.

And perhaps even more worryingly, if a patient becomes convinced they have chronic Lyme based on an influencer’s videos, they may be diverted from identifying something else. Part of the reason chronic Lyme has always been controversial is that its symptoms are so nonspecific. Fatigue, brain fog, headaches, and joint pain can be caused by anemia, sleep disorders, mental illnesses, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus, ALS, fibromyalgia, cancer, and many other conditions.

“From my perspective, I think the misdiagnosis and mistreatment is a bigger problem than the actual Lyme disease,” he said.

Now, as chronic Lyme emerges from its era of hazy theories and pseudoscience, it continues to be tainted with its previous associations. As an example, New Jersey Rep. Chris Smith, who attended Monday’s hearing, slipped a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act, which passed Wednesday, requiring the Government Accountability Office to investigate whether Lyme disease was bioengineered by the U.S. military. (Lyme disease, it should be noted, predates the United States itself by millennia.) During Monday’s hearing, he complained that mainstream news media, including the Washington Post, had portrayed him and his allies “like we have a tinfoil hat on our heads.” Smith is a Republican, but conspiratorial thinking on Lyme is a bipartisan problem.

And few are as damaging to chronic Lyme’s reputation among skeptics as Kennedy himself. As head of HHS, Kennedy has baselessly attributed deaths to the COVID vaccine, connected both Tylenol and circumcision to autism, and linked SSRIs to mass shootings. In one throwaway comment in the hearing, he claimed that the antiretroviral drug developed during the AIDS epidemic under Anthony Fauci’s NIH killed more people than AIDS itself.

The panel he convened was similarly questionable. Participants were largely not the leading experts in Lyme research but instead patients, medical technology business owners, politicians, and people with out-there theories about the disease. One person claimed there was a connection between Lyme disease and autism—something no mainstream researcher seems to find credible. Another person, who is a patient and an HHS official, asserted that had she followed standard medical Lyme treatments, “I would be dead today.” Lyme disease is not a fatal disease.

Still, Fish, like the other experts, said that Kennedy’s NIH putting more resources into understanding chronic Lyme could be extremely helpful for the thousands of Americans struggling with mysterious symptoms. These patients, he said, need answers and better diagnostic tools.

“These patients have serious illnesses, and I don’t blame them for raising hell about the situation,” he said.

Lyme is a disease that makes sense as a target for Kennedy, as obsessing over chronic illnesses is a core tenet of the “Make America Healthy Again” movement. Kennedy has said one of his sons developed Bell’s palsy from Lyme and that one son developed severe, debilitating chronic Lyme. Kennedy is also, fittingly for his family’s reputation for being full of robust outdoorsmen, a big proponent of getting outside into the woods—advice being made dangerous by the ticks. He noted the “spiritual” value of the outdoors in his address Monday.

Lyme also makes some sense as a target for the moment, when there is no epidemiological crisis such as SARS or COVID or AIDS consuming all the oxygen in the conversation. Leading experts in Lyme say people are beginning to understand the “insidious epidemic” of Lyme, as Dr. John Aucott, the director of the Johns Hopkins Lyme Disease Clinical Research Center, put it. He and Fallon expressed the need not just for studies and testing but an entire built-out academic infrastructure around it. Right now, most academic programs are struggling under federal budget cuts; Lyme research is one area where Kennedy’s personal interest may be of use.

For countless Americans, this could be great news. Aucott noted that he watched AIDS go from a death sentence to a manageable condition—proof that painstaking, rigorous research can revolutionize the understanding and treatment of a new disease. Today, he said, some of his Lyme patients are sicker than the AIDS patients were at the end of his time treating them.

Hopefully, Kennedy’s anti-science approach will not impede the evidence-based Lyme research that comes. His sloppiness, as when he repeatedly during panel discussions conflated Lyme disease and Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome, may not carry through to actual policy. And in at least one way, experts gave Kennedy credit on something else: He’s right, they said, that most people are not just sick from psychosomatic causes. “These are complex illnesses we’re just starting to understand,” Aucott said. “They’ve got a hard-to-explain illness. That doesn’t mean it’s just in their heads.”

But when diseases are particularly complex, and when the medical understanding of a topic shifts rapidly, it’s particularly damaging to have a man who consistently undermines the mainstream scientific community as the face of its public health response. The public needs clarity from its government, not just disruption. In this case, clarity doesn’t just mean validating suffering patients’ frustrations. It means acknowledging the limits of our knowledge while having an open mind—and focusing not on heated feelings but on the scientific process.

A striking convergence of events this week should have shaken the Pentagon’s overseers but so far hasn’t. On Wednesday, the Senate passed a $900 billion defense bill by an overwhelming 77–20 margin. A few days earlier, the New York Times devoted its entire 13-page Sunday Opinion section to argue that much of that budget is a colossal waste of money.

Titled “Overmatched: Why the U.S. Military Needs to Reinvent Itself,” the package catalogs the many ways in which the country’s war machine “is ill prepared for today’s global threats and revolutionary technologies.”

Its findings are based largely on an exclusive leak of a classified, comprehensive review of U.S. military power prepared and briefed in 2021 by the Pentagon’s Office of Net Assessment—an analytical center that Donald Trump’s defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, has since eliminated. The review not only analyzed recent war games, mainly against China, but also traced “a decades-long decline in America’s ability to win a long war with a major power.”

The Times article attributes this decline—which many intelligence agencies and private defense analysts have also been following for many years—to several factors. Chief among them is the post–Cold War consolidation of more than 50 weapons manufacturers, some of them nimble competitors, into a handful of sluggish, overfed megacompanies. This trend has been matched by the calcification of the Pentagon bureaucracy supposedly monitoring the companies—and by the vested interests of legislators whose districts profit off the companies’ contracts and who therefore want to protect their monopoly status.

The piece details two symptoms of the resulting stagnation, one large, one small. In 2020 the leadership of the U.S. Navy—which has focused these past decades on building a small number of large, overly complex, increasingly vulnerable warships—outlined a plan to buy a fleet of small warships, based on ready-made European designs. Then, the big contractors and their allies in the bureaucracy and Congress took over the project, resisted all innovations, and lapsed into the same patterns. Last month, after five years, $3.5 billion, and zero ships built, the project was canceled.

On a more mundane and thus in some ways more gasp-worthy scale, the Times detailed the Army’s plan in 2011 to get its soldiers new pistols. It should have been simple, but the officers found themselves embarking on a soul-crushing “odyssey” entailing “a 350-page list of technical specifications, years of testing, and a protracted battle on Capitol Hill between competing gun makers.” The Pentagon now estimates that the weapon will be delivered to troops in the field in 2027 “at the earliest.” It will have taken at least 16 years to develop, build, and deploy a pistol.

Meanwhile, despite the hundreds of billions of dollars in the defense budget (much of it spilled on large warships, warplanes, nuclear missiles, and other “legacy” weapons), defense industries find themselves unable to build large numbers of weapons that in wartime are used in large numbers.

For instance, in June’s attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities, the U.S. fired 30 Tomahawk cruise missiles. Each missile will cost $2 million to replace. Just one company, Raytheon, makes them, and these days, it’s unable to build new ones as fast as the military is firing them against some target or other.

Last year, the Pentagon was close to negotiating a partnership deal with a Japanese firm so the two together could make a lot more cruise missiles. Early on in the Trump administration, the deal fell apart, mainly because Raytheon, which wanted to retain sole ownership, found allies in the White House and the Pentagon who wanted to preserve the “America First” monopoly.

The same resistance is blocking co-production of ships (South Korea has more shipyards than the United States, but there’s no appetite politically to farm out shipbuilding contracts to non-American firms) and even of artillery shells. The war in Ukraine is showing a need for millions of these shells to sustain a long battle. European countries are cooperating to supply Ukrainian soldiers with these munitions, but the Pentagon is ignoring the lesson for long-term production demands.

The Times series overstates some points. Most broadly, simulated war games, such as the ones that informed the Pentagon’s Net Assessment study, are designed not so much to predict the outcome of a war as to highlight vulnerabilities, shortcomings, and imbalances so that commanders can make adjustments.

Still, the games and the study, which the Times package summarizes, emphasized a lot of shortcomings—and noted that the Pentagon is doing little to make adjustments because the bureaucracy, the defense industry, and Congress, often working in tandem, make it hard to do so.

The Times also overstates other, smaller matters. For instance, it correctly notes that China has more warships than the United States, but the firepower of the U.S. ships—the number and range of their missiles and aircraft, the training of their crews and pilots—far surpasses China’s. Then again, the United States has global missions, and it doesn’t have enough ships to fight a major war in more than one of the world’s regions at a time.

More to the point, America’s warships are vulnerable. Deploying an aircraft carrier, like the USS Gerald R. Ford, into a tense area conveys a potent message; it’s a powerful tool of “gunboat diplomacy.” But it’s questionable whether commanders would want to send it into an active war theater, especially against China, which is ready to launch swarms of accurate drones and anti-ship missiles to disable even a mighty carrier—and to turn on cyber-weapons to jam the high-tech sensors and guidance systems that make the carrier and its escort ships so powerful.

Many analysts have noted these problems for some time. A small branch of the Defense Department, called the Defense Innovations Unit, has actually been evading and overcoming many of the bureaucratic obstacles, especially in streamlining military supply chains and developing autonomous drones. Hegseth announced several reforms designed, at least on paper, to apply some of the DIU’s breakthroughs to larger weapons systems. But it’s one thing to make an announcement, another to enforce it—and the secretary of defense lacks the personnel in the Pentagon, the commitment from the White House, and the supply from Capitol Hill to get much done.

The Times’ special section was very unusual—in its devotion to a single issue, its depth of analysis, and its range of prescriptions. Newspaper editorials, of course, rarely have much impact, especially these days, when no newspaper, not even the Times, struts the stage of mass media with the august authority it once held.

Still, in this season of big budgets and a world of looming threats, this passage from the Times section is worth pondering:

It is an ancient and familiar pattern. Despite ample warnings, military and political leaders trained in one set of assumptions, tactics and weapons fail to adapt to change. … That’s where the United States risks finding itself. The Trump administration wants to increase defense spending in 2026 to more than $1 trillion. Much of that money will be squandered on capabilities that do more to magnify our weaknesses than to sharpen our strengths.

In other words, this is not just a budget story. It’s a story, and potentially a crisis, about global power—and how our own political-economic system, which has been a source of our power in the past, is confining and limiting our power in the new era.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The University of Sydney is ringing around thousands of current and former staff and students after admitting attackers helped themselves to historical personal data stashed inside one of its online code repositories.

In a message published on December 18, the vice president of operations at the University of Sydney, Nicole Gower, said the university was alerted last week to &quot;suspicious activity in one of our online IT code libraries.&quot;

She said this had triggered an emergency lockdown of the system. While the repository was meant for software development, Gower acknowledged that &quot;there were also historical data files in this code library containing personal information about some members of our community.&quot;

The university was quick to stress that the incident was unrelated to a separate student results issue reported a day earlier and said there is currently no sign that the data has been misused.

According to an accompanying FAQ, the compromised system contained historical data extracts used for testing during earlier development work, rather than live production databases.

Officials said the unauthorized access was limited to a single platform and that other university systems were not affected. Even so, the files were accessed and downloaded, and the university has brought in external cybersecurity partners while notifying government authorities as the investigation continues into the new year.

The university estimates that the accessed data includes personal information for approximately 10,000 current staff and affiliates and around 12,500 former staff and affiliates active as of September 4, 2018. On top of that, historical datasets spanning 2010 to 2019 include records linked to roughly 5,000 alumni and students, as well as six supporters.

For staff linked to one of the retired systems involved in the incident, the exposed information may include names, dates of birth, phone numbers, home addresses, and basic employment details such as job titles and dates of employment. Gower confirmed that &quot;the data has been accessed and downloaded,&quot; while insisting there is &quot;no evidence it has been used or published.&quot;

The University of Sydney said it began sending notifications to affected individuals on December 18, though it warned that the process will drag into January 2026 as it finishes reviewing the files and checking contact details. The institution says it has purged the identified datasets from the code library and is assessing further remediation under its Privacy Resilience Program.

While the university maintains there is no evidence of harm so far, the episode is another reminder of how long-forgotten data can come back to bite. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Already £1.4 billion over budget and four years late, a tech transformation project at a UK state-owned bank is outside HM Treasury spending limits and timetable under a revised plan from systems integrator Capgemini.

Speaking to MPs this week, Dax Harkins, chief executive of National Savings and Investments (NS&I), said he could not guarantee the troubled project would not be hit by further setbacks requiring the extension of a contract with incumbent supplier Atos, which is due to end in 2028.

&quot;We are working through the first version of the integrated plan we hoped would give us that [assurance]. I can tell you now that [plan] goes beyond March 2028 and it goes beyond our cost profile, and we are working to improve that,&quot; he told the Public Accounts Committee, a Parliamentary public spending watchdog.

&quot;I think we&#39;ve got some real options that will help to do that and do it in a considered and thoughtful way to still get the outcomes that we want. But we&#39;ve got to do that work to validate [it].&quot;

Harkins said NS&I, which handles £240 billion in customer investments, has the capacity and the resources to deliver the plan on budget when it is finalized.

&quot;We&#39;ve got some options to bring that [cost] in that we&#39;re working through at the moment. Until we&#39;ve done all of that work, we won&#39;t know exactly where that takes us. But HM Treasury have been really clear. We need to get an option to work within the budget. We just don&#39;t know the makeup of that,&quot; he said.

Earlier this year, the National Audit Office, a public spending watchdog, slammed the NS&I transformation program, which includes new customer-facing technology and a new banking engine.

In 2020, NS&I began a business transformation program called Project Rainbow, which aimed to reduce the bank&#39;s running costs, make NS&I a self-service digital business, and replace its 20-year outsourcing deal with Atos by splitting the work into five separate contracts.

In 2014, the bank awarded Atos a new contract to run until 2021, and then extended it until 2024 and again until 2028 without competition, handing the French outsourcer another £474.4 million. The total cost of the program is expected to hit £3.0 billion until 2030-31, including its contract with Atos and other running costs. The total cost increase is set for £1.3 billion compared to the 2020 business case, the NAO said in November.

Matthew Smith, the transformation program&#39;s senior responsible owner, said Capgemini – which was awarded the £48 million SI contract in July – had worked with NS&I and the program&#39;s other suppliers to pull the integrated plan together.

&quot;We have never had that before,&quot; he said.

Among the proposals under consideration to cut costs and speed up the program was cutting the step of building a new website and mobile app linked to the legacy banking application. &quot;It&#39;s one of the initiatives that we&#39;re looking at to bring that plan forward to actually not incur that nugatory cost and time of building to the legacy, but to build to the new capabilities of the new banking engine first,&quot; he said.

The NAO report [PDF] points out that the replacement of the core banking engine &quot;carries an extremely high level of risk.&quot;

As well as being the incumbent supplier for the legacy system, Atos was awarded a £474.4 million ($612 million) contract without competition to build systems including modernizing the core banking engine, as well as running payment, reporting, and business-to-business services from 23 December 2024 until 31 March 2028.

NS&I had originally gone to market to kick off the competition for a new core banking, payments and reporting system, which together with business-to-business services for government payments was worth £480.3 million over nine years.

In a procurement note, the government-owned bank said that the award was made to Atos without competition because &quot;as the incumbent service provider Atos and its key sub-contractor(s) are the providers of the existing NS&I core banking platforms, which rely on interdependent leveraged technology and resources.

&quot;The process of dis-aggregating these at the same time as building and deploying a new core banking instance would be sufficiently complex that it can only be practicably carried out by Atos IT Services UK without very significant disruption to NS&I customers,&quot; it said.

Smith told MPs that the Atos contract has the option for an additional one-year extension, although NS&I would need to &quot;take approvals before we can exercise that option.&quot;

&quot;And there&#39;s a further period beyond that for transition assistance,&quot; he said.

Since its relationship with Atos (previously Siemens) began in 1999, NS&I can look forward to a 30-year relationship with the French outsourcer with no end currently in sight. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The new pearOS distro is a Romanian project that picks up the concepts behind the original Pear Linux from 2011 and updates them. It&#39;s not going to turn the distro world upside down, but it&#39;s fun, interesting, and a showcase for the versatility and customizability of the Linux desktop.

Pear Linux was a French distro by David Tavares, based on Ubuntu and GNOME but heavily themed with custom fonts, icons, menu layouts, and more, all intended to make it visually resemble Apple&#39;s Mac OS X as closely as possible. As DistroWatch records, it went through some seven releases between 2011 and 2013, before Tavares announced that an unnamed company had bought it, and the distro vanished. Some contemporary reviews of PearOS 3.0 (2012), PearOS 7.0, and PearOS 8.0 (both 2013) – especially their screenshots – will give you an idea of how well it accomplished that. The idea has enduring appeal. After it disappeared, there were attempts to revive it, including Pearl Linux and Clementine OS, both in 2014, but neither got far.

pearOS is back, replacing Ubuntu with Arch and GNOME with the latest KDE Plasma

Over a decade later, a young Romanian developer called Alexandru Balan has released a new pearOS distro, rebuilt on a new basis of Arch Linux and the latest KDE Plasma 6.5.4. The release announcement calls this basis NiceC0re, and as the screenshots there show, this pearOS is styled to look like this year&#39;s macOS 26 &quot;Tahoe.&quot;

This is more than just a custom theme slapped onto a default KDE Plasma setup. There&#39;s a working global menu bar, with a pear menu in place of an apple menu at top left. This contains a single-column Settings app, which resembles the iOS style Settings app of macOS 13 Ventura and above. Within is an optimistic array of macOS-like features, many of which, such as Focus Mode, don&#39;t open and instead display:

This feature is currently not available. Please check back later for updates.

There&#39;s a Pear Piri option (in place of Siri) with a Pear Intelligence feature, the desktop is called &quot;Pinder,&quot; there&#39;s a pCloud section, and &quot;Wallet and Pear Pay,&quot; and so on. We certainly can&#39;t fault the ambition here. Since quite a bit of its functionality is yet to be implemented, it&#39;s a good thing that this is in addition to KDE&#39;s standard System Settings app.

Rather than KDE&#39;s Dolphin file manager, it uses the GNOME Files app, but most of the accessories are KDE ones: the Kate text editor, Discover app store, and so on. It ships with Flatpak installed, but no Flatpak apps. The default browser is the latest Firefox, and there&#39;s no office suite, just KWrite.

It&#39;s not a lightweight distro. It takes about 12 GB of disk and 1.2 GB of RAM at idle. The installation medium&#39;s boot menu offers a choice of using the latest Nvidia drivers, or FOSS drivers. With the latter, it was able to bring up the second screen on our testbed ThinkPad W520, although it&#39;s attached to a long-unsupported GPU. We weren&#39;t able to install it on that machine, though.

The installer is custom and one of the more unfinished areas of the distro. It comes up with a choice of just three languages: Romanian, Czech, or English. However, selecting them won&#39;t help you, as there is no Next or Continue button. It took us considerable experimentation to determine that the only way to get the button to display was to press the Tab key to move the selection, and then a big right-facing arrow became visible. This quickly revealed a very significant limitation. Much like that other FOSS macOS-like, the Hello System, the installer will only let you select a whole drive. There&#39;s no way to dual-boot with another OS unless you have two separate physical drives – and we could tell that this was unexpected, because when we tried again on another machine with two SSDs, the icon for the second appeared completely off the bottom of the installer window and floating over the desktop. It doesn&#39;t show its best under VMs either.

With that hiccup overcome, it installed fine and ran well. It uses X11 rather than Wayland and adding a user account is postponed until post-installation like in Fedora.

From the project&#39;s GitHub page, it looks to have been under construction for several years, and we found traces on the Internet Archive of several earlier versions of this restarted project. Even so, there are a number of sections in the Settings app that clearly aim to resemble Apple features that Linux doesn&#39;t really do just yet.

Compatibility-wise, it&#39;s Arch with the latest KDE. Pretty much everything you could want is here or in the AUR repository. Functionally, it&#39;s KDE, but it&#39;s a lovely and very functional take on KDE. Appearances are of course subjective, but The Reg FOSS desk isn&#39;t fond of any of the modern themes or looks included with KDE, and it lacks anything as simple as Xfce&#39;s Panel Profiles to load different desktop layouts with a single click. It&#39;s a bit of fun in the bleak midwinter (for those of us in the northern hemisphere). We rather like it. ®

Ready Player Me’s tech will help players ‘carry their identities and fandom’ across Netflix’s games.

As Netflix continues to build out its gaming strategy, which has recently included a new era of TV party games, it’s going to let people build avatars — with the help of a new acquisition. The company is acquiring avatar company Ready Player Me and its “cross-game avatar tech” to let players “carry their identities and fandom across games,” according to Ready Player Me CEO Timmu Tõke.

Netflix “doesn’t have an estimate of how long it will be until avatars launch” or which games will get them first, TechCrunch reports. Terms of the deal haven’t been disclosed.

Ready Player Me’s team of about 20 people will join Netflix. The company’s services, which “thousands” of developers used to “power cross-platform avatars,” will “become unavailable” on January 31st, 2026, Ready Player Me says on its website.

“Our vision has always been to enable avatars and identities to travel across many games and virtual worlds,” Tõke says. “We’ve been on an independent path to make that vision a reality for a long time. I’m now very excited for the Ready Player Me team to join Netflix to scale our tech and expertise to a global audience and contribute to the exciting vision Netflix has for gaming.”

The energy demands of AI are driving investment in futuristic fusion reactors from Big Tech and now Trump Media. Is it viable?

Trump Media — yup, the parent company of Truth Social — is the latest entrant in the near century-long race to develop a nuclear fusion power plant. It announced a merger agreement with fusion company TAE Technologies on Thursday, and a bold plan to break ground on the first utility-scale fusion plant some time in 2026.

TAE doesn’t plan to start generating power from its first plant until 2031, which is still an incredibly ambitious timeline. There will likely be a myriad of financial and regulatory issues to contend with along the way, of course. But the scientific and engineering challenges to overcome, which we’ll dive into here, are also enormous.

Fusion is considered the ‘Holy Grail’ of clean energy technologies

Fusion is considered the ‘Holy Grail’ of clean energy technologies, and AI companies are salivating over it as a potential source of abundant electricity for data centers. But while a future fusion reactor might one day help solve some of humanity’s headaches, it could just be wishful thinking to expect them to come to the rescue for data centers anytime soon.

With fusion, scientists are trying to replicate the way stars create light and heat — atomic nuclei fuse together, generating a tremendous amount of energy. A fusion power plant could avoid the greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels that are causing climate change, as well as the radioactive waste that today’s nuclear fission reactors create by splitting atoms apart to produce energy.

President Donald Trump has made his disdain for clean energy clear by falsely calling climate change a “con job,” ending tax incentives for renewables, and halting federal funding and permitting for solar and wind projects. But he has aligned himself with the tech broligarchy in trying to rush the development of new AI data centers. How to power these energy-hungry facilities has become a major hurdle for the industry, provoking pushback from communities across the US concerned about new data centers potentially driving up electricity rates and pollution.

Big names in tech are funneling money into fusion in the hopes that it might become a silver bullet for everyone’s energy woes. Google and Microsoft have announced agreements to purchase electricity from fusion power plants that other companies plan to complete by the late 2020s or 2030s. Sam Altman, Bill Gates, and Jeff Bezos have also backed startups developing their own fusion technologies.

“Fusion power will be the most dramatic energy breakthrough since the onset of commercial nuclear energy in the 1950s — an innovation that will lower energy prices, boost supply, ensure America’s AI supremacy, and revive America’s manufacturing base, and bolster national defense,” Devin Nunes, Trump Media Chairman and CEO, said on a Thursday investor call.

There are no utility scale nuclear fusion power plants yet, despite the rush of initiatives to design one that might actually work. Success still depends on researchers solving significant scientific and engineering unknowns that they’ve been plugging away at for decades.

We don’t. As you can imagine, recreating the dynamics of a star on Earth is very difficult. It takes an enormous amount of energy just to kick off a fusion reaction. A stumbling block scientists have faced for decades — and still face — is how to achieve a net energy gain from a fusion reaction.

The first time anyone in the world was able to achieve that net energy gain, often referred to as ‘ignition,’ was in 2022 at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s National Ignition Facility (NIF). No other group, including TAE, has yet been able to do this with their own technology,.

The 2022 breakthrough at Lawrence Livermore was achieved by firing 192 laser beams at a diamond-encased pellet of fuel. It’s a form of inertial confinement, triggering a fusion reaction by compressing and heating a fuel-filled target. Another competing fusion technology is called a tokamak, which uses magnetic fields to confine plasma and trigger the reaction.

Recreating the dynamics of a star on Earth is very difficult

You can think of the reactor TAE is developing as a kind of a hybrid of both strategies, using what’s called field reverse configuration (FRC). It still uses magnetic fields to lock plasma into place, and also shoots beams of fuel directly into the plasma to stabilize it and create the conditions necessary for a reaction to occur.

Most experts The Verge has talked to over the years have been cautious to put a date on when a commercial fusion power plant could actually start powering homes and businesses.

Not only does TAE still have to demonstrate that it can achieve a net energy gain — that gain has to be big enough to make economic sense. The Lawrence Livermore breakthrough, for example, achieved a net energy gain of 1.5 megajoule gain (the experiment yielded 3.15 megajoules of energy compared to the 2.05 megajoules the lasers used to trigger the fusion reaction). A laser fusion power plant would likely need to achieve a gain of 50 to 100. The lab has repeated its experiments to work to get higher gains — reaching a record gain of 4.13 MJ in April of this year.

That’s all to say that there are still a lot of milestones for the industry to reach. The Trump administration released a roadmap in October for the advancement of fusion technologies, and the Department of Energy has set a goal of deploying commercial-scale fusion power to electricity grids by the mid-2030s.

“We’re really at kind of that first-of-kind technology innovation, and it’s kind of hard to assign direct timelines to these things,” says Patrick White, group Lead of fusion energy safety and regulation at the Clean Air Task Force. “As [TAE starts] looking at either building a scientific demonstration machine or going straight to a commercial prototype, those types of machines take a substantial amount of investment. And this [merger] potentially is going to be a pathway for them to receive the capital they need to actually start testing and deploying their fusion technology.”

Commercial fusion reactors would also need robust supply chains for fuel and materials strong enough to withstand the extreme pressure and temperatures necessary for nuclear fusion. In short, designing a working reactor would be an enormous step forward — but then comes more difficult work to build the infrastructure and business around it.

The biggest impact this merger is likely to have — if it ultimately goes through — is to infuse a lot more cash into TAE’s ambitions.

TAE, founded in 1998, claims that its research has advanced enough to the point that “capital is now becoming our biggest challenge,” TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer said on the investor call.

Trump Media has agreed to shell out $300 million to TAE as part of the transaction. That adds to the more than $1.3 billion in private capital that TAE says it has raised to date from Google (TAE has been partnering with Google since 2014 to incorporate machine learning into its research), Chevron Technology Ventures, Goldman Sachs, and others.

With that money, TAE says it’ll be able to start construction on its first utility-scale fusion plant by the end of 2026, and generate “first power” in 2031. The first plant is supposed to have a capacity of 50 MWe, similar to a fission microreactor. TAE didn’t immediately respond to questions from The Verge about where that facility would be located and how much it would cost. But the company’s already planning to build more fusion plants after that with a capacity reaching up to 500 MWe.

Those plans are also contingent on regulatory approvals. But in a controversial decision by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that was codified by Congress this year, fusion reactors are regulated as particle accelerators in the US, similar to equipment used in cancer therapies and to sterilize medical equipment. That allows fusion plants to bypass lengthy federal licensing requirements that apply to fission reactors.

TAE has developed five iterations of its fusion reactor design, and said as recently as April that it planned to unveil its sixth, called Copernicus, “before the end of the decade.” From there, it would work toward developing the company’s first prototype power plant, Da Vinci, “in the early 2030s.”

Then in November, TAE announced that it’s now leapfrogging over Copernicus and moving straight to Da Vinci. That’s a result of its latest fusion research reactor, Norm, being small and efficient enough to shave down costs by up to 50 percent, according to TAE.

“Norm is such a tremendous breakthrough that it renders Copernicus unnecessary – saving us considerable time and cost,” Binderbauer said in a November press release.

But it’ll still be resource-intensive for TAE to take the next leap in its reactor design. “As [TAE starts] looking at either building a scientific demonstration machine or going straight to a commercial prototype, those types of machines take a substantial amount of investment,” CATF’s White says. “And this [merger] potentially is going to be a pathway for them to receive the capital they need to actually start testing and deploying their fusion technology.”</div>

Whether your giftee is a fan of Metroidvanias or simply can’t get enough of Wes Anderson movies, we’ve got you covered.

Most of us in the Northern Hemisphere spend the holidays indoors, but you can only watch so many TikToks about cute cats and cooking hacks before the need for something a little more substantive kicks in. Choosing the right game or movie to gift is tough, though, especially if you don’t have an exact read on what your friends and family like. And if you choose poorly, remember that you might also be on the hook to play or watch it with them.

That’s why, this year, we made it our mission to find gifts that appeal to people with diverse interests across a wide price range. If you know a Wes Anderson devotee, Criterion’s lavish box set is a great option to consider. We also have plenty of video game recs — from GOTY winner Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 to the notoriously brutal Silksong — along with a raft of suggestions when it comes to tabletop books, toys, and other pieces of hardware.

Anyone interested in the history of video games can learn a lot from The Console Chronicles, which covers every system from the Magnavox Odyssey (1972) to the Nintendo Switch (2017). The book is organized by generation, allowing you to see how a specific company’s hardware evolved or gain a sense of what all the major players were doing during any given time period.

Lego delivered a gigantic dose of nostalgia with a near-perfect replica of Nintendo’s 1989 handheld. The 421-piece set captures the Game Boy’s many buttons, grilles, and curves remarkably well, while the lenticular screen inserts give the illusion of a working unit. It even comes with several brick-ified cartridges you insert into a slot in the back.

Govee’s Sync Box 2 is a two-piece lighting kit that consists of a color-changing light strip and a breakout box with four HDMI 2.1 ports, which can pass up to 8K resolution at 60Hz or 4K at 120Hz. The strip changes color in real time based on what you’re watching or playing, making it a great way to add some AI-generated pizzazz to your home theater setup.

Wes Anderson’s directing style is so distinct that it’s spawned a series of books dedicated to its aesthetic. The Wes Anderson Archive collects all of his films from Bottle Rocket through The French Dispatch in a single box set. The 20-disc trove includes every film on Blu-ray and 4K Blu-ray, plus more than 25 hours of special features and 10 illustrated booklets containing essays and interviews.

There are alternatives that don’t cost nearly as much as the One, but Xreal’s glasses offer some of the best performance you can get in a pair of AR shades. They connect to your phone and some handheld gaming PCs via USB-C, and once connected, you can use them as an external monitor for gaming or watching movies.

Perfect for the friend who games on iPhone and streams on repeat, Apple Gift Card is the ultimate entertainment upgrade. It can be used for App Store greats, in-app purchases, and your favorite subscription services, making it a flexible pick for anyone who loves their screen time.

Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 breaks the mold of classic RPGs. The story is just as grandiose and gripping as the best Final Fantasy games, but by allowing you to dodge and parry every enemy attack, it flips more traditional turn-based combat on its head. Then there’s the score and visually striking world, both of which are just as refreshing to behold.

The Backbone Pro might be the most flexible controller out there. Like prior models, the USB-C gamepad lets you play games on your iPhone or Android device using physical buttons, joysticks, and triggers. The Pro model takes things one step further, however, allowing you to connect to everything from a Steam Deck to an iPad over Bluetooth.

Thanks to an excellent combo of power and portability, Asus’ latest ROG Zephyrus G14 is the gaming laptop to beat. It’s thin and light enough to shove in a backpack, yet powerful enough to tackle modern games at the highest settings. Its 14-inch, 120Hz OLED screen is fast and easy on the eyes, too, making it a great everyday laptop.

Sucker Punch’s follow-up to Ghost of Tsushima is everything you could want in a sequel. The open-world revenge epic brims with fluid combat and a host of welcome narrative twists, all set against the gorgeous backdrop of Japan’s Edo period. It’s precisely the type of game photo modes were made for, even if you never use them.

The first 15 Godzilla films, initially released between 1954 and 1975, were once considered the gold standard for monster movies. If you haven’t seen them yet, Criterion has packaged them in a single Blu-ray set that’s loaded with special features, including interviews, audio commentary, and a 1986 documentary featuring archival making-of footage.

If you’re shopping for a console gamer, the Nintendo Switch 2 hits all the right marks. It boasts a spacious 7.9-inch display, a comfortable design, and backward compatibility with most OG Switch titles, some of which have even been updated to run at higher resolutions and frame rates. Just don’t forget to grab a copy of Mario Kart World or the new Donkey Kong game to go with it.

Metroid Prime 4 is still a first-person adventure game like prior entries in the series, but this time around, bounty hunter Samus Aran is armed with a motorcycle and a slate of psychic powers. Not all of the new gameplay elements work, but Beyond is a fitting follow-up to what came before, with a lore-heavy story, great combat, and plenty of eerie exploration.

Streaming might be convenient, but 4K Blu-ray discs offer far more detail thanks to their lack of compression. Panasonic’s DP-UB420 lets you tap into a vast catalog of Blu-ray titles with support for HDR10 Plus, HLG HDR, and uncompressed DSD audio. It also supports a bevy of streaming apps, as well as both Alexa and Google Assistant.

Silksong is the long-awaited sequel to one of the most lauded Metroidvanias of all time. It’s an unrelenting game that requires patience, often requiring you to replay sections in an effort to learn how to defeat a boss or avoid a pesky hazard. You may have to take breaks, but the beauty of Silksong is that it often inspires you to give tough sections “just one more try.”

If your old TV struggles to run streaming apps well (or at all), consider Onn’s 4K Streaming Device, which runs on Google TV. It supports Dolby Vision HDR and all your favorite apps, from Netflix and Disney Plus to YouTube. Recommendations are pulled from across services, and you can even use Google Assistant to search for shows and movies using your voice instead of the remote.

The AirFly Pro 2 can amp up the sound quality of in-flight entertainment, making it a handy tool for frequent travelers. The long-lasting Bluetooth adapter can sync with two pairs of wireless earbuds or headphones at once, allowing you and a partner to share a movie, a podcast, or music without relying on the subpar earbuds most airlines provide.

Final Fantasy Tactics may be a remake of a beloved classic, but that doesn’t mean your giftee needs to have played the original to enjoy the recent tactical RPG. The grid-based combat is terrific, the new voice acting is even more expressive, and the retooled UI is a welcome upgrade. You can even switch to a “classic version” that’s more faithful to the PlayStation original if you’re not a fan of the modern glow-up.

The G309 is an inexpensive, dual-mode wireless gaming mouse that punches well above its weight. It’s equipped with the same Hero 25K sensor and hybrid optomechanical switches found on pricier models, along with up to 600 hours of runtime over Bluetooth. It’s also the cheapest Powerplay mouse you can get, if you want to skip the whole charging thing altogether.

The irony of Blue Prince is that knowing as little as possible about it is what makes it great. The puzzle title’s central mystery plays second fiddle to the clever gameplay, which has you work your way through all 45 rooms in your uncle’s magical mansion, one architectural puzzle after another. Just be sure to keep an actual notebook nearby. You’re gonna need it.

I’m sorry, but Donkey Kong Bananza is the first killer exclusive for the Switch 2, not Mario Kart World. The game’s crowning achievement is its destructible environments, which you can crash and smash your way through as you collect gems. And don’t worry, you’ll still use DK’s fists to clock plenty of foes as you go.

The Mechanism Gaming Pillow helps gamers stay comfortable for hours on end. Made from soft, high-performance Lycra, it holds tech up so their arms don’t have to, letting them play longer without arm strain. It also comes with a mount to accommodate one of many gaming handhelds, from the Steam Deck and Switch 2 to the ROG Ally X.

The Quest 3S is the best VR headset for most people, full stop. It can tap into a large library of games on its own — including Resident Evil 4, Beat Saber, and the excellent Batman: Arkham Shadow — or you can pair it with a more powerful gaming PC, significantly expanding the number of plausible VR titles.

Piggyback’s insightful Metroid retrospective is a 210-page hardcover book full of concept art from the venerable GameCube and Wii trilogy, as well as notes from producer Kensuke Tanabe. The thoughtful (but candid) notes offer a behind-the-scenes look at each game’s development, including the frequent tension between Retro Studios and Nintendo.

Marathon gaming sessions are less fun when your wrists hurt. The Asus ROG Falcata is a compact, ergonomic split keyboard with an ultrafast polling rate that also lets you adjust the actuation point of each Hall effect key by as little as a hundredth of a millimeter. It connects over USB-C, or wirelessly via Bluetooth or the included 2.4GHz adapter.

Pokémon Legends: Z-A is the first game in the main series with a real-time battling system instead of the traditional turn-based formula. You’re still catching pokémon, leveling up, trading, and battling in the game’s Paris-inspired setting, but the more action-oriented battles and smooth performance (on the Nintendo Switch 2) are very welcome.

Half the fun of online gaming is being able to coordinate your strategy — well, that and (lightly) dunking on your friends. Sony’s latest InZone headset boasts some of the same hardware as the company’s stellar XM6 headphones, meaning you’re getting fantastic ANC in addition to a wealth of refined, gamer-centric features.

Lego and Nintendo partner quite often, but the Soda Jungle Maker Set is probably one of their more unique collabs in recent memory. The 598-piece kit features iconic baddies from the Super Mario games instead of Nintendo’s titular Italian plumber, allowing a Shy Guy, Piranha Plant, and Wiggler to take center stage for once.

The newest Tony Hawk remake offers improved graphics, better controls, more skaters, and the ability to customize goals via an in-game course creator. THPS4 even features two-minute goals in the style of the first three entries, rather than the open-ended nature of the original, resulting in a best-of-both-worlds situation.

If you subscribe to Apple Arcade, an Apple TV 4K can effectively double as both a mini gaming console and one of the best streaming devices you can buy. With it, you can connect a Bluetooth controller like the PlayStation 5’s DualSense, thus allowing games that were initially developed for PC / consoles to be played on the big screen for which they were designed.

China figured out how to sell EVs. Now it has to bury their batteries.

In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road. Read the full story.—Caiwei Chen

It’s a weird time to be an AI doomer.This small but influential community believes, in the simplest terms, that AI could get so good it could be bad—very, very bad—for humanity.The doomer crowd has had some notable success over the past several years: including helping shape AI policy coming from the Biden administration. But a number of developments over the past six months have put them on the back foot. Talk of an AI bubble has overwhelmed the discourse as tech companies continue to invest in multiple Manhattan Projects’ worth of data centers without any certainty that future demand will match what they’re building.So where does this leave the doomers? We decided to ask some of the movement’s biggest names to see if the recent setbacks and general vibe shift had altered their views. See what they had to say in our story.—Garrison Lovely

Synthesia’s AI clones are more expressive than ever. Soon they’ll be able to talk back.

Earlier this summer, I visited the AI company Synthesia to create a hyperrealistic AI-generated avatar of me. The company’s avatars are a decent barometer of just how dizzying progress has been in AI over the past few years, so I was curious just how accurately its latest AI model, introduced last month, could replicate me.I found my avatar as unnerving as it is technically impressive. It’s slick enough to pass as a high-definition recording of a chirpy corporate speech, and if you didn’t know me, you’d probably think that’s exactly what it was.My avatar shows how it’s becoming ever-harder to distinguish the artificial from the real. And before long, these avatars will even be able to talk back to us. But how much better can they get? And what might interacting with AI clones do to us? Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In August 2025, Wang Lei decided it was finally time to say goodbye to his electric vehicle.

Wang, who is 39, had bought the car in 2016, when EVs still felt experimental in Beijing. It was a compact Chinese brand. The subsidies were good, and the salesman talked about “supporting domestic innovation.” At the time, only a few people around him were driving on batteries. He liked being early.

But now, the car’s range had started to shrink as the battery’s health declined. He could have replaced the battery, but the warranty had expired; the cost and trouble no longer felt worth it. He also wanted an upgrade, so selling became the obvious choice.

His vague plans turned into action after he started seeing ads on Douyin from local battery recyclers. He asked around at a few recycling places, and the highest offer came from a smaller shop on the outskirts of town. He added the contact on WeChat, and the next day someone drove over to pick up his car. He got paid 8,000 yuan. With the additional automobile scrappage subsidy offered by the Chinese government, Wang ultimately pocketed about 28,000 yuan.

Wang is part of a much larger trend. In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.

But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.

The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, building out formal recycling networks and take-back programs, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road.

Like the batteries in our phones and laptops, those in EVs today are mostly lithium-ion packs. Their capacity drops a little every year, making the car slower to charge, shorter in range, and more prone to safety issues. Three professionals who work in EV retail and battery recycling told MIT Technology Review that a battery is often considered to be ready to retire from a car after its capacity has degraded to under 80%. The research institution EVtank estimates that the year’s total volume of retired EV batteries in China will come in at 820,000 tons, with annual totals climbing toward 1 million tons by 2030.

In China, this growing pile of aging batteries is starting to test a recycling ecosystem that is still far from fully built out but is rapidly growing. By the end of November 2025, China had close to 180,000 enterprises involved in battery recycling, and more than 30,000 of them had been registered since January 2025. Over 60% of the firms were founded within the past three years. This does not even include the unregulated gray market of small workshops.

Typically, one of two things happens when an EV’s battery is retired. One is called cascade utilization, in which usable battery packs are tested and repurposed for slower applications like energy storage or low-speed vehicles. The other is full recycling: Cells are dismantled and processed to recover metals such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese, which are then reused to manufacture new batteries. Both these processes, if done properly, take significant upfront investment that is often not available to small players.

But smaller, illicit battery recycling centers can offer higher prices to consumers because they ignore costs that formal recyclers can’t avoid, like environmental protection, fire safety, wastewater treatment, compliance, and taxes, according to the three battery recycling professionals MIT Technology Review spoke to.

“They [workers] crack them open, rearrange the cells into new packs, and repackage them to sell,” says Gary Lin, a battery recycling worker who worked in several unlicensed shops from 2022 to 2024. Sometimes, the refurbished batteries are even sold as “new” to buyers, he says. When the batteries are too old or damaged, workers simply crush them and sell them by weight to rare-metal extractors. “It’s all done in a very brute-force way. The wastewater used to soak the batteries is often just dumped straight into the sewer,” he says.

This poorly managed battery waste can release toxic substances, contaminate water and soil, and create risks of fire and explosion. That is why the Chinese government has been trying to steer batteries into certified facilities. Since 2018, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has issued five “white lists” of approved power-battery recyclers, now totaling 156 companies. Despite this, formal recycling rates remain low compared with the rapidly growing volume of waste batteries.

China is not only the world’s largest EV market; it has also become the main global manufacturing hub for EVs and the batteries that power them. In 2024, the country accounted for more than 70% of global electric-car production and more than half of global EV sales, and firms like CATL and BYD together control close to half of global EV battery output, according to a report by the International Energy Agency. These companies are stepping in to offer solutions to customers wishing to offload their old batteries. Through their dealers and 4S stores, many carmakers now offer take-back schemes or opportunities to trade in old batteries for discount when owners scrap a vehicle or buy a new one.

BYD runs its own recycling operations that process thousands of end-of-life packs a year and has launched dedicated programs with specialist recyclers to recover materials from its batteries. Geely has built a “circular manufacturing” system that combines disassembly of scrapped vehicles, cascade use of power batteries, and high recovery rates for metals and other materials.

CATL, China’s biggest EV maker, has created one of the industry’s most developed recycling systems through its subsidiary Brunp, with more than 240 collection depots, an annual disposal capacity of about 270,000 tons of waste batteries, and metal recovery rates above 99% for nickel, cobalt, and manganese.

“No one is better equipped to handle these batteries than the companies that make them,” says Alex Li, a battery engineer based in Shanghai. That’s because they already understand the chemistry, the supply chain, and the uses the recovered materials can be put to next. Carmakers and battery makers “need to create a closed loop eventually,” he says.

But not every consumer can receive that support from the maker of their EV, because many of those manufacturers have ceased to exist. In the past five years, over 400 smaller EV brands and startups have gone bankrupt as the price war made it hard to stay afloat, leaving only 100 active brands today.

Analysts expect many more used batteries to hit the market in the coming years, as the first big wave of EVs bought under generous subsidies reach retirement age. Li says, “China is going to need to move much faster toward a comprehensive end-of-life system for EV batteries—one that can trace, reuse and recycle them at scale, instead of leaving so many to disappear into the gray market.”

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you’ll see it’s a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard.

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you.  We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.
