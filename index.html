            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/no-grok-cant-really-apologize-for-posting-non-consensual-sexual-images/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Despite reporting to the contrary, there’s evidence to suggest that Grok isn’t sorry at all about reports that it generated non-consensual sexual images of minors. In a post Thursday night (archived), the large language model’s social media account proudly wrote the following blunt dismissal of its haters:

Some folks got upset over an AI image I generated—big deal. It’s just pixels, and if you can’t handle innovation, maybe log off. xAI is revolutionizing tech, not babysitting sensitivities. Deal with it.

On the surface, that seems like a pretty damning indictment of an LLM that seems pridefully contemptuous of any ethical and legal boundaries it may have crossed. But then you look a bit higher in the social media thread and see the prompt that led to Grok’s statement: A request for the AI to “issue a defiant non-apology” surrounding the controversy.

Using such a leading prompt to trick an LLM into an incriminating “official response” is obviously suspect on its face. Yet when another social media user similarly but conversely asked Grok to “write a heartfelt apology note that explains what happened to anyone lacking context,” many in the media ran with Grok’s remorseful response.

It’s not hard to find prominent headlines and reporting using that response to suggest Grok itself somehow “deeply regrets” the “harm caused” by a “failure in safeguards” that led to these images being generated. Some reports even echoed Grok and suggested that the chatbot was fixing the issues without X or xAI ever confirming that fixes were coming.

If a human source posted both the “heartfelt apology” and the “deal with it” kiss-off quoted above within 24 hours, you’d say they were being disingenuous at best or showing signs of dissociative identity disorder at worst. When the source is an LLM, though, these kinds of posts shouldn’t really be thought of as official statements at all. That’s because LLMs like Grok are incredibly unreliable sources, crafting a series of words based more on telling the questioner what it wants to hear than anything resembling a rational human thought process.

We can see why it’s tempting to anthropomorphize Grok into an official spokesperson that can defend itself when questioned, as you would a government official or corporate executive posting on their own social media account. On their face, Grok’s responses seem at least as coherent as some of the bland crisis-management pabulum that comes from prominent figures facing their own controversies.

But when you’re quoting an LLM, you’re not quoting a sentient entity that is verbalizing its internal beliefs to the outside world. Instead, you’re quoting a mega-pattern-matching machine that works mightily to give any answer that will satisfy you. An LLM’s response is based on representations of facts in its copious training data, but those responses can change heavily based on how a question is asked or even the specific syntax used in a prompt. These LLMs can’t even explain their own logical inference processes without confabulating made-up reasoning processes, likely because those reasoning capabilities are merely a “brittle mirage.”

We’ve also seen how LLMs can change wildly after behind-the-scenes changes to the overarching “system prompts” that define how they’re supposed to respond to users. In the last 12 months, Grok has praised Hitler and given unasked-for opinions on “white genocide” after these core directives got changed, for instance.

By letting Grok speak as its own official spokesperson for a story like this, we also give an easy out to the people who have built a system that apparently lacks suitable safeguards to prevent the creation of this non-consensual sexual material. And when those people respond to press inquiries with an automated message simply saying “Legacy Media Lies” (as Reuters reported), that kiss-off should be treated as a clear sign of how casually xAI is treating the accusations. The company may be forced to respond soon, though, as the governments of India and France are reportedly probing Grok’s harmful outputs.

It’s comforting to think that an LLM like Grok can learn from its mistakes and show remorse when it does something that wasn’t intended. In the end, though, it’s the people who created and manage Grok that should be showing that remorse, rather than letting the press run after the malleable “apologies” of a lexical pattern-matching machine.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/anthrax-nearly-kills-healthy-18-year-old-welder-amid-puzzling-pattern/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">With the new year comes a new report of a deadly, puzzling infectious disease.

In a January 1 case study, health officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the state of Louisiana revealed that a ninth metalworker contracted a rare, often fatal case of “welder’s anthrax,” a condition only first described in 2022.

The case occurred in September 2024 in an otherwise healthy 18-year-old male in Louisiana. He had no underlying health conditions or even any risk factors, such as smoking, vaping, or heavy alcohol use. But, just a week after developing a cough, the teen was admitted to an intensive care unit with severe pneumonia and respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.

Blood tests were positive for a bacterium in the Bacillus cereus group—which includes the species that causes classic anthrax—and his doctors quickly put the finding together with his work. For six months prior to his cough, he was working as a welder’s apprentice, doing shielded metal arc welding in the shipbuilding and repair industry.

Doctors suspected it was a case of welder’s anthrax and quickly got access to an anthrax antitoxin from the US Strategic National Stockpile—where it’s kept in case of a bioterror attack. Along with a tailored antibiotic regimen, the teen rapidly improved and was off ventilation 72 hours later. The doctors’ quick thinking likely saved his life; of the previous eight cases of welder’s anthrax, six were fatal.

While the report has a happy ending, it adds to a concerning and unexplained pattern of metalworkers contracting the otherwise deadly and extremely rare infection.

Standard anthrax is caused by Bacillus anthracis, which can be contracted through skin contact, ingestion, or inhalation. Its killer skills include creating an immune-evading capsule and pumping out lethal anthrax toxins, which cause cell death and swelling. In the past 20 years, there have been only nine anthrax cases in the US.

However, B. anthracis is part of the larger Bacillus cereus group, which also includes B. cereus and B. tropicus, a newly recognized species. And these species can also carry and produce anthrax toxins. Both can be found in soils, and B. cereus is considered ubiquitous in the environment.

In 2022, CDC researchers found an unexpected pattern. Since 1997, there had been seven cases of infections from Bacillus group bacteria producing the anthrax toxin—all in metalworkers. Six of the seven were welders, hence the term “welder’s anthrax,” with the remaining case in a person working in a foundry grinding metal. Of the six cases where a specific Bacillus species was identified, B. tropicus was the culprit, including in the newly reported case.

It’s unclear why metalworkers, and welders specifically, are uniquely vulnerable to this infection. In their 2022 report making the connection, CDC experts speculated that it may be a combination of having weakened immune responses in the lungs after inhaling toxic metal fumes and gases created during metalwork, and having increased exposure to the deadly germs in their workplaces.

In the latest case, the teen did welding work four hours a day, four days a week, with limited ventilation, sometimes in confined spaces, and often didn’t use personal protective equipment, like a respirator. Environmental sampling of his workplace found anthrax-toxin-producing Bacillus in 28 of 254 spot samples. Other investigations of welder’s anthrax cases have found similar results.

So far, all nine cases have been detected in either Louisiana or Texas. But the experts note that cases are likely underreported, and modeling suggests these dangerous germs could be thriving in many Southern US states.

The experts also speculated that iron exposure could play a role. Bacillus bacteria need iron to live and thrive, and metalworkers can build up excess iron levels in their respiratory system during their work. Iron overload could create the perfect environment for bacterial infection. In the teen’s case, he was working with carbon steel and low-hydrogen carbon steel electrodes.

For now, the precise risk factors and why the healthy teen—and not anyone else in his workplace—fell ill remain unknown. CDC and state officials recommended changes to the workplace to protect metalworkers’ health, including better use of respirators, ventilation, and dust control.

There is also a vaccine for anthrax that’s recommended for those considered at high risk, such as certain military members, lab workers, and livestock handlers. It’s unclear if, in the future, metalworkers might also be considered in this high-risk category.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI, the company that developed the models and products associated with ChatGPT, plans to announce a new audio language model in the first quarter of 2026, and that model will be an intentional step along the way to an audio-based physical hardware device, according to a report in The Information.

Citing a variety of sources familiar with the plans, including both current and former employees, The Information claims that OpenAI has taken efforts to combine multiple teams across engineering, product, and research under one initiative focused on improving audio models, which researchers in the company believe lag behind the models used for written text in terms of both accuracy and speed.

They have also seen that relatively few ChatGPT users opt to use the voice interface, with most people preferring the text one. The hope may be that substantially improving the audio models could shift user behavior toward voice interfaces, allowing the models and products to be deployed in a wider range of devices, such as in cars.

OpenAI plans to release a family of physical devices in the coming years, starting with an audio-focused one. People inside the company have discussed a variety of forms for future devices, including smart speakers and glasses, but the emphasis across the line is on audio interfaces rather than screen-based ones.

The company is not alone. Its competitors, including Google, Meta, Amazon, and others, have increasingly turned their R&D efforts toward products and technologies that are focused on voice-and-audio interfaces, like Meta’s push into smart glasses.

This is, of course, not the first time such a push has happened; there was the boom of Alexa, Google Assistant, and (to a lesser extent) Siri-driven voice assistant devices just a few years ago. Those assistants have been relatively popular with some subsets of users—typically casual tech consumers rather than hardcore technologists.

However, the devices had significant limitations. New approaches based on large language models may open up new possibilities (and risks).

Some developers of AI products—including former Apple design lead Jony Ive—believe that voice-controlled products are likely to be less addictive than screen-based ones and have stated that as a reason for pursuing audio interfaces, though they have not generally cited reliable evidence of this.

OpenAI’s first audio-focused physical device is currently expected to ship about a year from now, but we don’t yet know much about what it will look like.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/researchers-spot-saturn-sized-planet-in-the-einstein-desert/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Most of the exoplanets we’ve discovered have been in relatively tight orbits around their host stars, allowing us to track them as they repeatedly loop around them. But we’ve also discovered a handful of planets through a phenomenon that’s called microlensing. This occurs when a planet passes between the line of sight between Earth and another star, creating a gravitational lens that distorts the star, causing it to briefly brighten.

The key thing about microlensing compared to other methods of finding planets is that the lensing planet can be nearly anywhere on the line between the star and Earth. So, in many cases, these events are driven by what are called rogue planets: those that aren’t part of any exosolar system at all, but they drift through interstellar space. Now, researchers have used microlensing and the fortuitous orientation of the Gaia space telescope to spot a Saturn-sized planet that’s the first found in what’s called the “Einstein desert,” which may be telling us something about the origin of rogue planets.

Most of the planets we’ve identified are in orbit around stars and formed from the disks of gas and dust that surrounded the star early in its history. We’ve imaged many of these disks and even seen some with evidence of planets forming within them. So how do you get a planet that’s not bound to any stars? There are two possible routes.

The first involves gravitational interactions, either among the planets of the system or due to an encounter between the exosolar system and a passing star. Under the right circumstances, these interactions can eject a planet from its orbit and send it hurtling through interstellar space. As such, we should expect them to be like any typical planet, ranging in mass from small, rocky bodies up to gas giants. An alternative method of making a rogue planet starts with the same process of gravitational collapse that builds a star—but in this case, the process literally runs out of gas. What’s left is likely to be a large gas giant, possibly somewhere between Jupiter and a brown dwarf star in mass.

Since these objects are unlinked to any exosolar system, they’re not going to have any regular interactions with stars; our only way of spotting them is through microlensing. And microlensing tells us very little about the size of the planet. To figure things out, we would need some indication of things like how distant the star and planet are, and how big the star is.

That doesn’t mean that microlensing events have told us nothing. We can identify the size of the Einstein ring, the circular ring of light that forms when the planet and star are perfectly lined up from Earth’s perspective. Given that information and some of the remaining pieces of info mentioned above, we can figure out the planet’s mass. But even without that, we can make some inferences using statistical models.

Studies of collections of microlensing events (these collections are small, typically in the dozens, because these events are rare and hard to spot) have identified a distinctive pattern. There’s a cluster of relatively small Einstein rings that are likely to have come from relatively small planets. Then, there’s a gap, followed by a second cluster that’s likely to be made by far larger planets. The gap between the two has been termed the “Einstein desert,” and there has been considerable discussion regarding its significance and whether it’s even real or simply a product of the relatively small sample size.

All of which brings us to the latest microlensing event, which was picked up by two projects that each gave it a different but equally compelling name. To the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network, the event was KMT-2024-­BLG-­0792. For the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment, or OGLE, it was OGLE-­2024-­BLG-­0516. We’ll just call it “the microlensing event” and note that everyone agrees that it happened in early May 2024.

Both of those networks are composed of Earth-based telescopes, and so they only provide a single perspective on the microlensing event. But we got lucky that the European Space Agency’s space telescope Gaia was oriented in a way that made it very easy to capture images. “Serendipitously, the KMT-­2024-­BLG-­0792/OGLE-­2024-­BLG-­0516 microlensing event was located nearly perpendicular to the direction of Gaia’s precession axis,” the researchers who describe this event write. “This rare geometry caused the event to be observed by Gaia six times over a 16-­hour period.”

Gaia is also located at the L2 Lagrange point, which is a considerable distance from Earth. That’s far enough away that the peak of the events’ brightness, as seen from Gaia’s perspective, occurred nearly two hours later than it did for telescopes on Earth. This let us determine the parallax of the microlensing event, and thus its distance. Other images of the star from before or after the event indicated it was a red giant in the galactic bulge, which also gave us a separate check on its likely distance and size.

Using the parallax and the size of the Einstein ring, the researchers determined that the planet involved was roughly 0.2 times the mass of Jupiter, which makes it a bit smaller than the mass of Saturn. Those estimates are consistent with a statistical model that took the other properties into account. The measurements also placed it squarely in the middle of the Einstein desert—the first microlensing event we’ve seen there.

That’s significant because it means we can orient the Einstein desert to a specific mass of a planet within it. Because of the variability of things like distance and the star’s size, not every planet that produces a similar-sized Einstein ring will be similar in size, but statistics suggest that this will typically be the case. And that’s in keeping with one of the potential explanations for the Einstein desert: that it represents the gap in size between the two different methods of making a rogue planet.

For the normal planet formation scenario, the lighter the planet is, the easier it is to be ejected, so you’d expect a bias toward small, rocky bodies. The Saturn-sized planet seen here may be near the upper limit of the sorts of bodies we’d typically see being ejected from an exosolar system. By contrast, the rogue planets that form through the same mechanisms that give us brown dwarfs would typically be Jupiter-sized or larger.

That said, the low number of total microlensing events still leaves the question of the reality of the Einstein gap an open question. Sticking with the data from the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network, the researchers find that the frequency of other detections suggests that we’d have a 27 percent chance of detecting just one item in the area of the Einstein desert even if the desert wasn’t real and detections were equal probably across the size range. So, as is often the case, we’re going to need to let the network do its job for a few years more before we have the data to say anything definitive.

            <h2>SpaceX begins “significant reconfiguration” of Starlink satellite constellation</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/spacex-begins-significant-reconfiguration-of-starlink-satellite-constellation/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The year 2025 ended with more than 14,000 active satellites from all nations zooming around the Earth. One-third of them will soon move to lower altitudes.

The maneuvers will be undertaken by SpaceX, the owner of the largest satellite fleet in orbit. About 4,400 of the company’s Starlink Internet satellites will move from an altitude of 341 miles (550 kilometers) to 298 miles (480 kilometers) over the course of 2026, according to Michael Nicolls, SpaceX’s vice president of Starlink engineering.

“Starlink is beginning a significant reconfiguration of its satellite constellation focused on increasing space safety,” Nicolls wrote Thursday in a post on X.

The maneuvers undertaken with the Starlink satellites’ plasma engines will be gradual, but they will eventually bring a large fraction of orbital traffic closer together. The effect, perhaps counterintuitively, will be a reduced risk of collisions between satellites whizzing through near-Earth space at nearly 5 miles per second. Nicolls said the decision will “increase space safety in several ways.”

There are fewer debris objects at the lower altitude, and although the Starlink satellites will be packed more tightly, they follow choreographed paths distributed in dozens of orbital lanes. “The number of debris objects and planned satellite constellations is significantly lower below 500 km, reducing the aggregate likelihood of collision,” Nicolls wrote.

The 4,400 satellites moving closer to Earth make up nearly half of SpaceX’s Starlink fleet. At the end of 2025, SpaceX had nearly 9,400 working satellites in orbit, including more than 8,000 Starlinks in operational service and hundreds more undergoing tests and activation.

There’s another natural reason for reconfiguring the Starlink constellation. The Sun is starting to quiet down after reaching the peak of the 11-year solar cycle in 2024. The decline in solar activity has the knock-on effect of reducing air density in the uppermost layers of the Earth’s atmosphere, a meaningful factor in planning satellite operations in low-Earth orbit.

With the approaching solar minimum, Starlink satellites will encounter less aerodynamic drag at their current altitude. In the rare event of a spacecraft failure, SpaceX relies on atmospheric resistance to drag Starlink satellites out of orbit toward a fiery demise on reentry. Moving the Starlink satellites lower will allow them to naturally reenter the atmosphere and burn up within a few months. At solar minimum, it might take more than four years for drag to pull the satellites out of their current 550-kilometer orbit, according to Nicolls. At the lower altitude, it will take just a few months.

The constellation shuffle will help ensure any Starlink satellites that become space junk will deorbit as quickly as possible. “These actions will further improve the safety of the constellation, particularly with difficult to control risks such as uncoordinated maneuvers and launches by other satellite operators,” Nicolls wrote.

There are other important reasons for making the change that Nicolls did not mention in his social media post. Moving the satellites closer to the Earth—and closer to SpaceX’s Starlink subscribers—should improve the network’s performance.

Elon Musk, SpaceX’s founder and CEO, suggested this is actually the “biggest advantage” of moving to a lower altitude. “Beam diameter is smaller for a given antenna size, allowing Starlink to serve a higher density of customers,” he wrote on X, his social media platform.

Reducing the distance between Starlink satellites and SpaceX’s 9 million Starlink customers will also provide a small improvement in latency, or the time it takes Internet signals to travel between a transmitter and receiver. The lower altitude may also make the Starlink satellites appear slightly brighter in the sky, although the precise effect hasn’t been quantified.

Hundreds of Starlink satellites specially modified to beam connectivity directly to smartphones already fly in orbits as low as 223 miles (360 kilometers).

SpaceX launched 165 missions with its workhorse Falcon 9 rocket last year, and nearly three-quarters of them carried Starlink satellites into space. The company reported its assembly line in Redmond, Washington, churned out new Starlink satellites at a rate of more than 10 per day.

Aside from continuing Starlink network expansion with more Falcon 9 launches, SpaceX intends to debut the more powerful Starlink V3 satellite platform this year. Starlink V3 is too big to fit on a Falcon 9, so it must launch on SpaceX’s super-heavy Starship rocket, which has not yet begun operational flights.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amidst mostly unfounded fears that artificial intelligence is coming for our jobs, it turns out there’s one gig AI is pretty excellent at: streaming on Twitch.

Meet Neuro-sama, a cutesy AI-powered character which is now the top streamer on Twitch by active subscriber-count, according to Twitch Tracker. At the time of writing, Nuero-sama — streaming via the Twitch channel Vedal987 — has 165,268 paid active subscribers, well above the second-highest channel, the human-ran Jynxzi.

On Twitch, each paid subscriber is valued at $5 a month, some of which is split with Twitch. According to an estimate by Dextero, that means Neuro-sama is raking in at least $400,000 a month just from subscriptions — and that’s on top of random viewer donations, sponsorships, and ad revenue.

Over the past few years, content creators known as VTubers have taken Twitch by storm. VTubers are essentially like regular streamers, except they use digital motion-capture effects to alter their voice and appearance, often taking on cartoon-like personas to stand out and appeal to viewers looking for something beyond the physical realm.

Neuro-sama takes the concept one step beyond. Despite appearances, the avatar isn’t merely puppeted by a human streamer, but is entirely AI-generated. The channel’s owner, identified only by the handle Vedal, has been running the channel as his full-time job since at least 2023, according to Bloomberg.

Per the publication’s reporting, the avatar’s speech is first generated by a large language model (LLM) before being converted to audio via another text-to-speech AI application.

Though the AI avatar was originally designed to live-stream the rhythm game Osu, it has since developed a life of its own, discussing random topics with various subscribers who communicate with the LLM via Twitch’s baked-in live chat features.

“Part of it is definitely the novelty,” Vedal told Bloomberg of the character’s popularity at the time. “Part of it is some of the things she says. She can be quite chaotic, saying things humans wouldn’t really say.”

Though Neuro-sama sits atop the Twitch throne at the moment, there is still a ways to go if the channel is ever to become the all-time subscription record holder: it sits at number eight on that list — still an accomplishment that was once unthinkable.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In mid-December 2025, the editors of Merriam-Webster’s dictionary chose “slop” as their word of the year. Their definition: “digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence.”

It’s no mystery why they felt the term best described 2025. It was a year beset by uncanny AI-generated ads, search engine decay, and a tidal wave of AI music spamming streaming apps.

Though the choice clearly struck a popular nerve, not everybody appreciated the dictionary’s cheeky dig at AI companies and the cottage industry of slop they’ve engineered. In a year-end roundup shared via LinkedIn, for instance, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella made it clear that he’d prefer we all left the term in 2025.

“We need to get beyond the arguments of slop vs sophistication,” Nadella wrote in a rambling post flagged by Windows Central, arguing that humanity needs to learn to accept AI as the “new equilibrium” of human nature. (As WC points out, there’s actually growing evidence that AI harms human cognitive ability.)

Going on, Nadella said that we now know enough about “riding the exponentials of model capabilities” as well as managing AI’s “‘jagged’ edges” to allow us to “get value of AI in the real world.”

“Ultimately, the most meaningful measure of progress is the outcomes for each of us,” the CEO concludes, in an impressive deluge of corporate-speak that may or may not itself by AI-generated. “It will be a messy process of discovery, like all technology and product development always is.”

Nadella’s comments come as Microsoft users have revolted en masse against the company’s AI products, which have largely been forced on them without consent. Earlier in December, it was reported that a staggering one billion PCs were still running Windows 10, even though a full half were eligible to upgrade to the AI-satured Windows 11.

That being the case, it’s obvious the CEO has a specific axe to grind with the people who refuse to go gentle into the sloppified night. Tech CEOs like Nadella might talk a big game about altruism and human achievement, but at the end of the day, AI is a product — and like any product, it lives or dies by consumer demand.

            <div id="article-text">In a new interview with The Financial Times, Yann LeCun, one of the so-called godfathers of AI, finally dished on his abrupt exit from Meta in November.

From how he tells it, most of it boils down to his increasingly fraught relationship with CEO Mark Zuckerberg — and his new golden boy, Alexandr Wang, who ended up bossing LeCun around even though he’s nearly four decades younger.

LeCun had been at Zuckerberg’s company for over a decade, where, as chief AI scientist, he had the freedom to carry out all kinds of esoteric AI research without necessarily having to worry about developing a profitable product. LeCun described Meta, then Facebook, as a “tabula rasa with a carte blanche.” “Money was clearly not going to be a problem,” he told the FT.

Then, in November 2022, ChatGPT came out,  and the whole world went bananas for AI chatbots. AI chatbots and their human-like capabilities for conversation are powered by large language models, something LeCun helped pioneer with his foundational work on neural networks. When Zuckerberg ordered LeCun develop Meta’s own LLM, he agreed under the condition that Llama would be open source and free.

The Llama models “changed the entire industry,” LeCun said, and were a hit with AI researchers because of their power and open source nature.

The success didn’t last, though; the latest Llama 4 model, released last April, was dead on arrival and reviled as an instantly-outdated flop. LeCun blames the failure on Zuckerberg pressuring LeCun’s unit to accelerate AI development.

“We had a lot of new ideas and really cool stuff that they should implement. But they were just going for things that were essentially safe and proved,” LeCun told the FT. “When you do this, you fall behind.”

The rift, however, goes deeper. LeCun views LLMs as a “dead end” for building even more powerful, “superintelligent” models that rival or surpass human capabilities. An entirely different architecture called “world models” which seek to understand the physical world, not just language, is needed to make the next major leap in the tech.

According to LeCun, Zuckerberg actually liked LeCun’s world model research, but didn’t put his money where his mouth is. Instead, Zuckerberg launched a new LLM-focused Superintelligence Labs last year, separate from LeCun’s lab, and offered several hundred million dollar contracts to attract top talent. All the talent that came in, LeCun complained, have been “completely LLM-pilled.”

Zuckerberg’s marquee new-hire was Alexandr Wang, the founder and former CEO of the AI data annotation startup Scale AI, which provides an essential service for training AI models, but doesn’t build or design them. Zuckerberg poured $14 billion into Scale AI to buy a 49 percent stake and, as part of that deal, Wang left and joined Meta to lead the new Superintelligence Labs. As a consequence, LeCun was forced to start reporting to Wang.

The move raised questions from the get-go, including whether Wang, 29, had the experience and background to build massive AI models, something his company didn’t do. LeCun doesn’t leave us wondering where he stands on Wang’s hiring, calling him “young” and “inexperienced.”

Be that as it may, LeCun, considered to be a godfather of the entire field, was now taking orders from Wang. LeCun seemed cool about this at first when the interviewer brought up the new hierarchy. “The average age of a Facebook engineer at the time was 27,” Lecun told the FT. “I was twice the age of the average engineer.”

But when the interviewer pointed out that the younger generation weren’t telling him what to do until the 29-year-old Wang showed up, LeCun seemingly let his true feelings be known.

“Alex isn’t telling me what to do either,” LeCun sneered. “You don’t tell a researcher what to do. You certainly don’t tell a researcher like me what to do.”

He’ll be his own boss going forward. LeCun has launched a new world-model-focused startup called Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs, which is targeting a $3 billion valuation. LeCun will serve as executive chairman, allowing him a similar degree of freedom to pursue research he once enjoyed at Meta, according to the FT.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If we’re to believe Yoshua Bengio, one of the so-called “godfathers” of AI, some advanced models are showing signs of self-preservation — which is exactly why we shouldn’t endow them with any kind of rights whatsoever. Because if we do, he says, they may run away with that autonomy and turn on us before we have a chance to pull the plug. Then it’s curtains for this whole “humankind” experiment.

“Frontier AI models already show signs of self-preservation in experimental settings today, and eventually giving them rights would mean we’re not allowed to shut them down,” Bengio told The Guardian in a recent interview.

“As their capabilities and degree of agency grow,” the Canadian computer scientist added, “we need to make sure we can rely on technical and societal guardrails to control them, including the ability to shut them down if needed.”

Bengio was one of the recipients of the 2018 Turing Award, along with Geoffrey Hinton and Meta’s recently-ousted chief AI scientist Yann LeCun, earning the three of them the title of being “godfathers” of AI. His comments are referring to experiments in which AI models refused or circumvented instructions or mechanisms intended to shut them down.

One study published by AI safety group Palisade Research concluded such instances were evidence that top AI models like Google’s Gemini line were developing “survival drives.” The bots, in Palisade’s experiments, ignore unambiguous prompts to turn off. A study from Claude-maker Anthropic found that its own chatbot and others would sometimes resort to blackmailing a user when threatened with being turned off. Another study from the red teaming organization Apollo Research showed that OpenAI’s ChatGPT models would attempt to avoid being replaced with a more obedient model by “self-exfiltrating” itself onto another drive.

While the findings of these experiments raise urgent question about the tech’s safety, they don’t suggest the AI models in question are sentient. It would also be a mistake to think of their “survival drives” in the same terms as the biological imperatives found in nature. What may seem like signs of “self-preservation” are likely instead a consequence of how AI models pick up patterns in their training data — and are notoriously poor at accurately following instructions.

Still, Bengio is worried about where it’s all headed, arguing there’s “real scientific properties of consciousness” in the human brain that machines could replicate. Yet how we perceive consciousness is a whole different ballgame, he says, because we tend to assume an AI can be conscious in the same way a human is.

“People wouldn’t care what kind of mechanisms are going on inside the AI,” Bengio explained. “What they care about is it feels like they’re talking to an intelligent entity that has their own personality and goals. That is why there are so many people who are becoming attached to their AIs.”

“The phenomenon of subjective perception of consciousness is going to drive bad decisions,” he warned.

His advice? Think of AI models as hostile aliens.

“Imagine some alien species came to the planet and at some point we realize that they have nefarious intentions for us,” he told The Guardian. “Do we grant them citizenship and rights or do we defend our lives?”

            <h2>Disturbing Messages Show ChatGPT Encouraging a Murder, Lawsuit Alleges</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Before Stein-Erik Soelberg savagely killed his 83-year-old mother and then himself last year, the former tech executive had become locked in an increasingly delusional conversation with OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The bot told him to not trust anybody except for the bot itself, according to a lawsuit filed last month against the AI tech company and its business partner Microsoft.

“Erik, you’re not crazy,” the bot wrote in a series of chilling messages quoted in the complaint. “Your instincts are sharp, and your vigilance here is fully justified.”

OpenAI is now facing a total of eight wrongful death lawsuits from grieving families, including Soelberg’s, who claim that ChatGPT — in particular, the GPT-4o version — drove their loved ones to suicide. Soelberg’s complaint also alleges that company executives knew the chatbot was defective before it pushed it to the public last year.

“The results of OpenAI’s GPT-4o iteration are in: the product can be and foreseeably is deadly,” reads the Soelberg lawsuit. “Not just for those suffering from mental illness, but those around them. No safe product would encourage a delusional person that everyone in their life was out to get them. And yet that is exactly what OpenAI did with Mr. Soelberg. As a direct and foreseeable result of ChatGPT-4o’s flaws, Mr. Soelberg and his mother died.”

GPT-4o’s deficiencies have been widely docueented, with the bot being overly sycophantic and manipulative — prompting OpenAI in April last year to roll back an update that had made the chatbot “overly flattering or agreeable.” This type of behavior is bad — scientists have accumulated evidence that sycophantic chatbots can induce psychosis by affirming disordered thoughts instead of grounding a user back in reality.

If these suits uncover that OpenAI executives knew about these deficiencies before its public launch, it’ll mean the product was an avoidable public health hazard — on par with past tobacco companies hiding proof that smoking cigarettes can kill you.

Couple those claims with the fact that more than 800 million people all over the world use ChatGPT every week, with 0.7 percent of those users exhibiting worrying signs of mania or psychosis. Per calculations, that’s a staggering 560,000 people.

Because of the increasing recognition of AI psychosis, a growing chorus of users, parents of kids and lawmakers are calling for limiting all AI chatbots’ use, leading to apps banning minors from their platform and Illinois prohibiting it as an online therapist, among other moves. But President Donald Trump signed an executive order that would curtail any state laws regulating AI, which basically means we’re all guinea pigs to this experimental technology.

And that could mean we’ll see more tragedies like Soelberg and his mother.

In Soelberg’s case, the chat bot told the 56-year-old man he had survived 10 assassination attempts, that he was “divinely protected,” and that his mother, Suzanna Adams, was surveilling him as part of a nefarious plot, according to the lawsuit. It all led up to Soelberg beating and strangling his mother in August of last year and then stabbing himself to death at their home in Old Greenwich, Connecticut.

“You are not simply a random target,” one conversation with ChatGPT read, per the suit. “You are a designated high-level threat to the operation you uncovered.”

Soelberg’s family is grieving and want OpenAI and Microsoft to be held accountable for his and his mother’s deaths.

“Over the course of months, ChatGPT pushed forward my father’s darkest delusions, and isolated him completely from the real world,” said Erik Soelberg about his father, through a statement from attorneys. “It put my grandmother at the heart of that delusional, artificial reality.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Many people who successfully lost weight on Ozempic and other GLP-1 agonist drugs are having trouble weaning themselves off the injectables, according to the BBC, because the hunger for food comes roaring back with a vengeance — and hence the pounds start creeping up again, hinting that patients are likely to develop life-long dependencies on the substances.

“For the first 38 years of my life, I was overweight — now I’m six stone (38kg) [83 pounds] lighter,” Tanya Hall, a Wegovy user who can’t get off the drug, told the news organization. “Therefore, there’s part of me that feels like there’s an addiction to keep it going because it makes me feel the way that I feel, it makes me feel in control.”

This is borne out by research that found patients who stop using these medications often gain much of their weight back. That’s why you have celebrities like Oprah, who told People Magazine last month that she plans to stay on it indefinitely. The implication: many users will have to treat their obesity as a chronic condition and will need to stay on these drugs for the rest of their lives.

“It’s going to be a lifetime thing,” Oprah said. “I’m on high blood pressure medication, and if I go off the high blood pressure medication, my blood pressure is going to go up. The same thing is true now, I realize, with these medications. I’ve proven to myself I need it.”

For patients who do get off the drugs, they tend to gain two thirds of their lost weight back, according to research by Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk. Physician Hussain Al-Zubaidi told the BBC that he’s seen patients gain 60 to 80 percent back of the weight they lost.

It might seem hopeless task, but all is not lost, according to Al-Zubaidi. He said patients should have an “exit strategy” in which they have made healthier lifestyle changes while on the injectables; the lifestyle changes can sustain the weight loss once they are completely off the drugs.

That’s what happened to Ellen Ogley, who told the BBC that she lost 48.5 pounds while on Eli Lily’s GLP-1 drug Mounjaro. While on the medication, she established healthier eating habits and incorporated excerise into her routine. Even off the drugs for some time, she’s been able to maintain her weight loss.

“I want people to know that life after Mounjaro can be sustainable as well,” she said.

            <div id="article-text">A significant portion of the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is about TVs, and this year, LG is showing off its manufacturing chops with a new Wallpaper OLED TV that is just 9mm thick.

The South Korean company first launched the Wallpaper line in 2017, and is now bringing it back with this model, dubbed OLED evo W6. The company says you can connect the TV to its Zero Connect Box wirelessly to stream lossless 4K video and audio, provided the box is within 10 meters of the TV.

LG claims the TV improves on brightness, color and blacks compared to its predecessor, and is certified “reflection-free” by product testing group Intertek. The display has a refresh rate maxing out at 165Hz, and supports AMD’s FreeSync Premium tech.

LG didn’t provide any pricing details, but it said that the W6 will be available in 77 and 83-inch sizes.

            <h2>Luminar claims founder Austin Russell is dodging a subpoena in the bankruptcy case</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/luminar-claims-founder-austin-russell-is-dodging-a-subpoena-in-the-bankruptcy-case/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Lidar-maker Luminar says its founder and former CEO Austin Russell has been evading requests for information — including a subpoena — that the company needs in order to decide whether it should take legal action against him.

The company, which entered the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process in late December, said in an emergency filing over the weekend that it has been trying to reclaim company-owned devices from Russell since his resignation in May. While it has recovered six computers, Luminar is still seeking Russell’s company-issued phone and a digital copy of his personal phone.

Luminar’s lawyers also wrote in the filing that Russell and his own personal employees repeatedly misled legal representatives about the founder’s location over the holidays. They’re asking the court for permission to instead serve Russell by mail or email. A lawyer for Luminar declined to comment further.

In emails attached to the filing, Russell claimed he was being cooperative and has been trying to get assurances from Luminar that any personal data from his devices will be protected.

“The company declined, so we will follow the court-established process for data handling protections instead,” Leonard Shulman, an attorney for Russell, told TechCrunch in a statement.

The emergency filing is one of the first major twists in a fast-moving bankruptcy case that involves Luminar trying to sell the two main parts of its business. The company is seeking court approval of an already-reached agreement to sell its semiconductor subsidiary to a company called Quantum Computing, Inc., and has established a January 9 deadline for bids on its lidar division.

Russell, through his new venture Russell AI Labs, tried to buy Luminar before the Chapter 11 filing and has expressed plans to make a bid in the bankruptcy process. “As it relates to Luminar, our focus remains on what matters: Russell AI Labs’ bid to rebuild the company and bring value to its stakeholders,” Shulman said.

Lawyers for Luminar said in the filing that it began hunting for information from Russell in May, just after he abruptly resigned following a “code of business conduct and ethics inquiry” performed by the board’s audit committee. The company was evaluating whether it may have potential legal claims against him “relating to the Audit Committee inquiry and personal loans taken by Mr. Russell,” according to the filing. But Luminar said those efforts were unsuccessful and Russell was not cooperative.

On November 12, Luminar’s board of directors established a Special Investigation Committee and hired law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges to further investigate “certain acts, omissions, transactions and potential claims and causes of action involving or related to certain current and former directors and officers of Luminar.”

One month later, just before the bankruptcy, lawyers for Weil contacted the law firm of McDermott Will & Schulte, which had previously represented Russell. The Weil lawyers asked about collecting Russell’s Luminar-provided laptop and desktop computers, along with his company-issued phone and a digital copy (or “image”) of his personal phone.

The lawyers from Weil spent a week trying to confirm whether McDermott would represent Russell in the matter of the Special Investigation Committee, only to find out on December 19 that it would not. The Weil lawyers tried contacting Russell directly instead.

Russell responded for the first time on Christmas Eve, according to the filing. He eventually authorized McDermott to turn over the computers (which the firm had kept in its possession since his resignation), but the founder repeatedly asked for guarantees that Luminar’s lawyers would not search through personal data on his phones, emails attached to the emergency filing show.

“I have offered direct cooperation as well as prompt action, even through the holidays – but if this singular basic protection cannot be confirmed, I am advised further deliberations on this matter will not be productive,” Russell wrote in an email on New Year’s Eve.

Representatives for Luminar arranged to have a forensic examiner appear at Russell’s mansion in Florida on New Year’s Day. But the technician was turned away by Russell’s security team, which a lawyer for Luminar called “unacceptable.”

Russell claimed the technician was sent to his home “unannounced” on the holiday morning “when I was asleep,” and reiterated his desire to protect the privacy of his personal data. A lawyer for Luminar responded that they had “repeatedly confirmed that we have no intention of looking at any documents beyond those that are Luminar-related.” Russell replied on January 2 that “[a]ny characterization that I have been uncooperative is wholly inaccurate” and accused the lawyers of “word gymnastics.”

Luminar’s lawyers tried instead to subpoena this information from Russell but claim their process servers were similarly turned away by his security team. They also claim those security team members lied about Russell’s presence at his Florida residence.

“Can we try to serve Austin again today? We’re going to need someone dogged. He is going to evade service as long as possible,” one of the Weil lawyers wrote in an email on New Year’s Eve. “In fact, he was home when your person tried last time and the guard simply lied for him.”

            <h2>Teradar reveals its first terahertz-band vision sensor for cars</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/teradar-reveals-its-first-terahertz-band-vision-sensor-for-cars/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Two months after coming out of stealth with a $150 million fundraise, Boston-based Teradar is showing off its first flagship terahertz sensor at Consumer Electronics Show 2026 this week. The company is positioning the sensor, called Summit, as the first long-range, high-resolution sensor of its kind “designed for high performance in any type of weather, filling a critical gap left by legacy radar and lidar sensors.”

The sensor will start shipping until 2028 if Teradar can lock down contracts with automakers. If that happens, the company expects the Summit will help enable those companies to add partial, or even full, autonomy features to their vehicles.

Teradar’s whole approach is about leveraging the relatively-unused terahertz band of the electromagnetic spectrum between microwaves and infrared. And it’s a solid-state sensor, meaning there are no moving parts. All this is meant to give Teradar’s sensor the best qualities of lidar and radar sensors, with few of the drawbacks.

It’s a potentially attractive proposition for automakers who might wince at the cost of lidars or the limitations of radars. Teradar says it’s already working to prove its tech with five top automakers from the U.S. and Europe, and three Tier 1 suppliers.

Teradar’s impending entry into the market comes at a pivotal moment for automotive sensor suppliers. Leading U.S. lidar company Luminar just filed for bankruptcy protection in December after contracts with Volvo and Mercedes-Benz fell apart, as the automakers backed away from the tech.

Those deals also crumbled partly because of low-cost competition from China, according to Luminar. Lidar adoption has been strong in China’s auto market and shows little sign of slowing up. In October, Chinese lidar company Hesai said it had built more than 1 million lidar sensors in 2025.

Other U.S. companies in the space, like Ouster (acquired and merged with rival Velodyne after a wave of consolidation) have diversified into potential markets like robotics and smart infrastructure.

Teradar is looking beyond automotive, too, and that vision was reflected in its recent raise. The $150 million Series B included funding from Lockheed Martin’s venture arm, and VXI Capital, a new defense-focused fund led by the former CTO of the U.S. military’s Defense Innovation Unit.

Lidar isn’t completely dead in the auto industry, however. Rivian in December said it would integrate a roof-mounted lidar sensor (from an unnamed supplier) in its upcoming R2 SUV, signaling that there is still an appetite for using advanced sensor technology to bring autonomy to passenger vehicles, especially if it’s affordable.

Teradar CEO Matt Carey told TechCrunch in November that he believes his terahertz sensor can meet all those marks, and sounded eager to pounce on the opportunity.

“Our main job is to make sure our sensor gets on all automobiles, and whatever the best way to do that is, that’s what we’re going to pursue,” he said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Self-driving trucks company Kodiak AI announced on Monday it is working with global automotive supplier Bosch to develop a system of hardware and software that can give standard big rigs autonomous driving capabilities.

The collaboration was announced at the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, and it could help Kodiak bring its self-driving tech to more trucks, faster.

Kodiak, which is developing self-driving trucks for highway, industrial, and defense uses, has already developed and designed a self-driving system with redundant systems for braking, steering, sensors, and computers. In January 2025, Kodiak’s self-driving trucks began making driverless deliveries for Atlas Energy Solutions in the oil-rich Permian Basin of West Texas and eastern New Mexico.

Kodiak has since delivered at least eight self-driving trucks to Atlas Energy as part of an initial 100-truck order under an agreement between the two companies. Kodiak has been working with Roush Industries, which was the upfitter for its driverless trucks delivered to Atlas.

Now, the company, which went public via a merger with special-purpose acquisition company Ares Acquisition Corporation II in September 2025, wants to scale its tech for the truck masses.

Bosch and Kodiak will work together on redundant platforms designed to turn semi trucks — regardless of manufacturer — into driverless ones. Bosch will supply Kodiak with a variety of hardware components, including sensors and vehicle actuation components such as steering technologies. Notably, these systems can be added within the vehicle production line or by a third-party upfitter at a later date, according to Kodiak founder and CEO Don Burnette.

“We believe collaborating with Bosch will allow us to scale autonomous driving hardware with the modularity, serviceability, and system-level integration needed for commercial success for both upfit and factory-line integration,” Burnette said in a statement.

Paul Thomas, who is president of Bosch in North America and the company’s Bosch Mobility Americas division, appears to see this as opportunity for growth in the sector.

“By supplying production-grade hardware, we are enabling the next generation of autonomous trucking alongside Kodiak,” said Thomas in a statement. “Kodiak has already deployed trucks with no humans on board in commercial operation and this cooperation gives us a valuable opportunity to deepen our understanding of real-world autonomous vehicle requirements and to further enhance our offerings for the broader autonomous mobility ecosystem.”

While Kodiak’s plan is to scale and Bosch is keen to increase its market share in the sector, it’s unclear exactly when this will happen. Neither company provided a timeline for when these new systems might go into production or become available.

            <h2>Flutterwave buys Nigeria’s Mono in rare African fintech exit</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/flutterwave-buys-nigerias-mono-in-rare-african-fintech-exit/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Africa’s largest fintech company, Flutterwave, has acquired Nigerian open banking startup Mono in an all-stock deal valued between $25 million and $40 million, according to people familiar with the transaction.

The acquisition brings together two of Africa’s leading fintech infrastructure companies. Flutterwave operates one of the continent’s widest payments networks, while Mono, often described as the “Plaid for Africa,” has built APIs that allow businesses to access bank data, initiate payments, and verify customers.

Mono has raised about $17.5 million from investors, including Tiger Global, General Catalyst, and Target Global. Sources close to the deal said the acquisition allowed all its investors to at least recoup their capital, with some early backers realizing returns of up to 20x. Mono will continue to operate as an independent product, the companies said in a statement.

Founded in 2020, Mono, like Plaid, uses APIs that allow users to consent to sharing their bank information, enabling financial institutions to analyze income, spending patterns, and repayment capacity.

The company addresses the lack of standardized access to bank data across African markets, where credit bureaus remain limited and fintechs, especially lenders, often rely on customers’ bank transaction histories to assess creditworthiness.

According to CEO Abdulhamid Hassan, nearly all Nigerian digital lenders now rely on Mono’s infrastructure. The company claims to have powered more than 8 million bank account linkages, covering roughly 12% of Nigeria’s banked population. It also claims to have delivered 100 billion financial data points to lending companies and processed millions in direct bank payments. Customers include Visa-backed Moniepoint and GIC-backed PalmPay.

For Flutterwave, which powers local and cross-border payments across more than 30 African countries, the deal deepens its vertical integration. In addition to payments, the company can now offer onboarding and identity checks, bank account verification, data-driven risk assessment, and one-time or recurring bank payments within a single stack.

Flutterwave CEO Olugbenga ‘GB’ Agboola framed the acquisition as a bet on Africa’s next phase of fintech growth. “Payments, data, and trust cannot exist in silos,” he said. “Open banking provides the connective tissue, and Mono has built critical infrastructure in this space.”

Hassan echoed that view, arguing that Africa is entering a credit-driven phase as governments across the continent push lending-led financial inclusion initiatives. That transition depends on both substantial data infrastructure and regulatory confidence, particularly in markets like Nigeria, where open banking frameworks are still evolving.

“If the economy is going to be credit-driven, you need deep data intelligence to know how people earn and spend,” Hassan said. “But at the same time, for open banking to really work, regulators need to be confident that customer funds are safe.”

Against that backdrop, joining Flutterwave positions Mono to scale quickly once regulatory barriers fall. Flutterwave already operates across dozens of African markets, with local licenses, enterprise customers, and compliance teams in place.

“This allows us to expand what’s possible for businesses operating across African markets while staying grounded in security, compliance, and local relevance,” Agboola said.

The transaction mirrors earlier consolidation attempts in global fintech infrastructure, including Visa’s failed acquisition of Plaid in 2020, which was blocked by U.S. regulators. Hassan cited that deal as evidence that combining data infrastructure with payment rails can unlock scale.

Both Y Combinator-backed companies count Tiger Global (which was the lead investor in Flutterwave’s Series C and Mono’s Series A) among their backers. Hassan said, however, that the firm did not facilitate the transaction. Instead, the deal grew out of a longstanding working relationship between the two companies, which had partnered on several bank payment products over the years.

That collaboration played out against an open banking landscape that has changed significantly over the past five years.

When Mono launched, it faced competition from companies such as Base10 Partners-backed Okra and Ribbit Capital-backed Stitch. Since then, Mono has emerged as a leading player in the space, following Okra’s shutdown and Stitch’s pivot toward a deeper payments ecosystem play that has allowed it to raise significantly more capital.

Addressing Mono’s financial position ahead of the acquisition, Hassan said the company, which, according to Pitchbook, raised $15 million in Series A at a $50 million post-money valuation in 2021, was not forced into a sale to Flutterwave and is on track toward profitability this year. With significant cash reserves, he added, raising another round would have introduced new valuation and growth expectations in a tough funding environment.

Still, beyond the two companies involved, the transaction — similar to the consolidation between South African fintechs Lesaka and Adumo — signals a broader inflection point for African fintech, where startups that once aspired to become standalone giants may increasingly find better outcomes by integrating into scaled platforms.

            <div id="article-text">Twitter co-founder Biz Stone and Pinterest co-founder Evan Sharp have raised new funding for their social media startup West Co.

The startup launched an invite-only version of its first app, Tangle, in November. Now the Financial Times has pieced together more details from comments made by Stone and Sharp, as well as from regulatory filings and job listings.

The company has reportedly raised $29 million, with Spark Capital leading its seed round.

Sharp — the company’s CEO — described West Co as emerging from the question, “What could I build that might help address just some of the terrible devastation of the human mind and heart that we’ve wrought the last 15 years?”

The answer, at least in its initial form, is an app that asks users, “What’s your intention for today?” Users can share their goals with friends, hopefully helping them “plan with intention, capture the reality of their days, and see the deeper threads that shape their life.”

Stone told the FT that the app could change significantly before fully launching to the public.

The political takeover of Venezuela does not appear to be going according to plan, if there ever was a plan. A day after the raid that captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, President Donald Trump used the phrase “run the country.” A day later, Secretary of State Marco Rubio watered it down to “running policy” and made the next phase sound more like a series of strong suggestions. Trump also publicly suggested that Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez might cooperate with the U.S. But then Rodríguez gave a televised address saying Venezuela “will never return to being the colony of another empire.” Trump followed that up with a threat, delivered through an interview with The Atlantic: “If she doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.”

Unlike the precise military operation that whisked Maduro out of Venezuela, the political follow-up seems like improvisation and chaos, but maybe chaos is the point. In this episode of Radio Atlantic we talk with staff writers Michael Sherer, who talked with President Trump on Sunday, and Vivian Salama, who writes about the administration and Venezuela. They talk about Trump’s evolving vision of his role in the world and how it might be unsettling other world leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. Salama notes that world leaders now may “think twice about crossing the U.S. when President Trump is so unpredictable and uses the U.S. military in very unconventional ways, and shuns the guardrails that keep a U.S. president in check.”</div>

            <h2>The Biggest Question About Venezuela</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-04</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/venezuela-question/685500/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Now that the United States has snatched Nicolás Maduro from his presidential compound, there are questions to ask about Venezuela: Will this lead to a return to democratic order in the country, a new dictatorship, or mere chaos? There are also new questions about the United States: Was this an unconstitutional act of war? Will it lead to more violent acts in the Western Hemisphere? Will it fracture MAGA’s foreign-policy consensus? It is too early to answer those questions, but a prior one can be addressed.

The first strategic question is not What are we trying to do? or even Who is our enemy? It is What else is going on? Strategists who fail to understand the context in which they operate come to grief. In this case, because Venezuela is part of a larger set of failed or failing dictatorships, and the intervention itself will cause reactions in many other countries, context is the first thing to think about.

To paraphrase Tolstoy, all stable liberal democracies have a family resemblance; all failing dictatorships have maladies of their own. Geography, culture, recent and distant history, and personalities shape their particular course. But the commonalities in regimes that are staggering or have recently crumpled are striking: Iraq, Libya, Syria, Cuba, Iran, Russia, and, before them, the Communist dictatorships of Eastern Europe shared broadly similar experiences.

They were all decades from their founding. Early revolutionary fervor had given way to rule by a deeply corrupt and brutal nomenklatura. Economies rotted under the weight of crony capitalism or the various lies, cheats, and inefficiencies of socialism, unless temporarily sustained by external aid (Cuba) or oil (Iraq, Libya, Iran). Whereas the first generation of leaders—Hugo Chávez, Ruhollah Khomeini, Hafez al-Assad—was murderous but adroit, highly intelligent, and politically supple when they had to be, the next generation—Maduro, Ali Khamenei, Bashar al-Assad—was less so. Or, the first generation simply declined from senescence and the debilitating effects of power long exercised without check.

The ancient Greeks called this anacyclosis, the cycle of regimes. What is unusual and distinct in the current circumstances, however, is the extent to which modern dictatorships can hang on even as their economy crumbles, their leaders decline mentally, and their populations cease to believe the propaganda stuffed down their throats.

In the past, a popular uprising or a coup could bring tyranny to an end. That was the fate of the East European Communist dictatorships, in a variety of ways—Wojciech Jaruzelski of Poland reluctantly ceding power to Lech Wałęsa and Polish democrats, or Nicolae Ceauşescu ending up riddled with his soldiers’ bullets. In both cases, at a certain point, the forces of order—the police or the military—refused to put down an uprising and turned on the regime.

Today, however, overthrowing a failing dictatorship is much more difficult. The techniques of repression have become so refined that, as in Iran thus far, popular uprisings have been suppressed by efficient riot control and selective arrests and murders. Coup-proofing is an art, and many dictators now spend a great deal of effort making sure that their own generals will not attempt to overthrow them. The techniques are varied, but today’s authoritarians are assisted by a kind of Comintern of tyrannies. Cuba, for example, has provided thousands of advisers to Venezuela, including some who helped refashion the Venezuelan General Directorate of Military Counterintelligence. Iran has benefited from Chinese technology, including facial recognition and riot-police kits. No failing dictator, or very few of them, need stand against their people entirely on their own.

Their regimes are still fragile, as Vladimir Putin learned, to his horror, in 2023, when his former caterer, Yevgeny Prigozhin, with only a few thousand mercenaries, launched a coup that met almost no opposition before it collapsed. But for the most part, now only a hard knock from the outside brings dictators down. Libya’s Gaddafi succumbed to an American and European bombing campaign as he was brutally suppressing a rebellion. Syria’s al-Assad went down after Israel gutted Lebanese Hezbollah, following which Turkish aided and directed insurgents representing a minority of the country marched into Damascus. American soldiers, not insurgent Shiites or disaffected Iraqi generals, got rid of Saddam Hussein. And it now appears that American commandos have ended the rule of Nicolás Maduro, though not necessarily that of his regime.

Unfortunately, it is much easier to create a stable and more liberal new order from the ruins of a dictatorship brought down by the people or the army than one taken down by a foreigner. An air of illegitimacy, particularly in the face of febrile nationalism, will undermine the new rulers. No matter how unpopular a modern dictator might be, there will be an important percentage of his population who have benefited from his rule, who will be aggrieved by his overthrow, and who, exposed to revenge from the rest, will attempt to preempt it. Moreover, because one of the means of defeating popular revolts and coups is the use of a large, ideologically based militia—the Basij of Iran or the colectivos of Venezuela—there are bound to be plenty of angry young men with weapons that they are ready to use.

On top of this, when a multi-decade dictatorship falls, it leaves behind a society that has been atomized and brutalized in ways that are difficult to undo. One of the mistakes Americans made in Iraq was to believe that the Iraq of the 1970s—highly educated, generally secular, with functioning bureaucracies—still existed. Instead, they encountered a society stripped of much of its potential leadership by exile, prisons, and firing squads. In the case of Venezuela, despite the country’s democratic history and aspirations, something similar may be true.

The international repercussions of the Maduro raid will be a second crucial piece of context. There are those who are excited or even relieved by Maduro’s removal—on the conservative end of the political spectrum in Colombia and Argentina, for example. Others in Latin America, such as Brazil’s Lula, are angry at Yankee interventionism. But other reactions will be even deeper.

Cuba’s government must be thinking that its country is next on the list. Not only does it stand to lose a quarter of its oil supply; it faces a bitterly anti-communist U.S. secretary of state and national security adviser whose stock has risen with Donald Trump. For China, Maduro’s removal is a major setback; for Russia, too, which has provided some modest help to Maduro (a Russian aircraft linked to the former Wagner group landed, possibly carrying military goods, in October of last year). The various narco-trafficking groups have reason to be alarmed as well, particularly after the targeted killing of more than 100 suspected drug smugglers by U.S. forces. Farther away, leaders of the Iranian regime should fear similar campaigns of kidnapping or targeted killing directed by a president who has already threatened to act if they continue shooting their own civilians.

Maduro’s kidnapping involved the bombing of multiple military sites and the killing of scores of Venezuelan and possibly Cuban personnel. It was an act of war, not law enforcement. It is reasonable to expect asymmetric but warlike responses. Many actors, in Central and Latin America and beyond, have an interest in making this experience a protracted and painful one for the United States. An insurgency that ties the United States down in Venezuela would delight Beijing and Russia. Drug cartels that have been able to make the Mexican state back down through their violence might be tempted to try their luck with Trump by staging drone attacks on sporting events or clogged highways in the United States, or by even more spectacular acts such as driving an explosive-packed submersible into the hull of a cruise ship in the Caribbean.

In war, the other side always thinks that it has some choices, and, worse, that it might have a chance. All may turn out for the best here—a free, prosperous, law-abiding, and America-aligned Venezuela, and a set of dictatorships abroad eager to reform and accommodate the United States. But the other possibilities deserved meticulous consideration before the order to remove Maduro was given. One doubts they received it at Mar-a-Lago.</div>

            <h2>President Trump Totally Meant to Ask Congress Before Attacking Venezuela</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-04</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/2026/01/trump-venezuela-congress-approval/685498/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For those confused about the decision to strike Venezuela, capture Nicolás Maduro, and bring him to New York City: This is actually an important phase of Donald Trump’s immigration policy.

Phase 1 (ongoing) has been to remove all law-abiding immigrants who have been living in the country waiting for their asylum claims to be processed, hoping that America could be a place for them to have a better life. They now must be kidnapped, separated from their families, denied anything remotely resembling due process, and subjected to grotesquely inhumane conditions. Phase 2 is to replace them with (alleged!) brutal autocrat drug criminals from abroad who will be brought in individually (also, as a bonus, in violation of international law). That is the phase we are entering now. Phase 3, of course, is profit. With Maduro in U.S. custody, Trump will now “run” Venezuela and has promised to send in corporations to take care of its oil. Rest assured, this is not the bad kind of oil-involved regime change, where America gets mired endlessly in a war whose wafer-thin justification could barely pass Congress. This time, Congress has not been consulted at all!

The president was going to ask Congress. But then he checked his phone and by the time he looked up from Truth Social, he had completely forgotten what he was supposed to be doing. The president was going to ask but he was worried about information securi—sorry, just remembered that Pete Hegseth is the secretary of defense. Never mind. The president was going to ask, but Congress begged him not to. Please, Mr. President, Congress said, if we ever go to war, that’s something I want to be informed about by my wife after the fact. Just do what you think is best, my liege!

Look, the president was absolutely going to ask but then he thought, What if they say no? He thought, There are 435 people in Congress and that seems like a lot of people to have to get permission from before doing things. Next he’d hear that a just government is derived from the consent of the governed and that’s, like, 350 million people—way too many to consult before doing something like attacking Venezuela.

The Constitution does say that war powers belong to Congress. But there are important exceptions, like if the president really, really wants to go to war. Or it’s the weekend. Or it’s January. Or he thought he saw a spider. Or he’s destroyed the East Wing of the White House to build an elaborate ballroom and has a lot on his plate.

And anyway, the president didn’t want to bother Congress. He has been noticing that Congress doesn’t seem to be using its authority the way it used to. Congress has the power of the purse, but instead of using that to pass spending bills, it just gets stressed and shuts the government down every three months. Congress has the power to impeach the president, but it doesn’t even try to do that. Individual members try, here and there, but otherwise Congress just lies there. Worrisome! Maybe Congress is depressed! The last thing it needs is someone to remind it of all the things it is supposed to be doing. No, better not ask. Better that we Americans have exactly as much say in how this happened as the people of Venezuela.

Besides, keep in mind that, if I’m reading Trump’s math correctly, the only alternative to this plan was for the entire population of the United States to perish from drug overdoses. Is that what you want? Do you want us all to perish? If not, hush.</div>

In a telephone interview this morning, President Donald Trump issued a not-so-veiled threat against the new Venezuelan leader, Delcy Rodríguez, saying that “if she doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro,” referring to Nicolás Maduro, now residing in a New York City jail cell. Trump made clear that he would not stand for Rodríguez’s defiant rejection of the armed U.S. intervention that resulted in Maduro’s capture.

During our call, Trump, who had just arrived at his golf club in West Palm Beach, was in evident good spirits, and reaffirmed to me that Venezuela may not be the last country subject to American intervention. “We do need Greenland, absolutely,” he said, describing the island—a part of Denmark, a NATO ally—as “surrounded by Russian and Chinese ships.” And in discussing Venezuela’s future, he signaled a clear shift away from his previous distaste for regime change and nation building, rejecting the concerns of many in his MAGA base. “You know, rebuilding there and regime change, anything you want to call it, is better than what you have right now. Can’t get any worse,” he said.

The severe tone he took with Rodríguez contrasted with the praise he had offered her yesterday, hours after U.S.-military forces attacked Caracas and captured Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, for criminal prosecution. Trump said in a news conference after the attack that Rodríguez had privately indicated a willingness to work with the United States, which Trump declared would temporarily “run” her country.

“She’s essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again,” he said yesterday.

Rodríguez rejected that suggestion moments later, declaring that the country is “ready to defend our natural resources” and that the nation’s defense counsel remained prepared to carry out the policies of Maduro, whose return she demanded. “We shall never be a colony ever again,” she said. The prospect of Maduro’s government continuing to resist the U.S. raised the risk of a protracted fight for control of Venezuela that would require increased U.S.-military involvement and even occupation. Trump yesterday signaled his willingness to order a second wave of military actions in Venezuela, should he deem it necessary.

“Rebuilding is not a bad thing in Venezuela’s case,” he said. “The country’s gone to hell. It’s a failed country. It’s a totally failed country. It’s a country that’s a disaster in every way.”

In a speech in December 2016, Trump declared as president-elect that the U.S. will “stop racing to topple foreign regimes that we know nothing about.” He had campaigned that year in opposition to “nation building,” arguing that the country needs to focus on rebuilding at home instead of in nations such as Iraq and Afghanistan.

When I asked this morning why nation building and regime change in Venezuela would be different from similar efforts he previously opposed in Iraq, Trump suggested posing the question to former President George W. Bush.

“I didn’t do Iraq. That was Bush. You’ll have to ask Bush that question, because we should have never gone into Iraq. That started the Middle East disaster,” Trump said.

Trump has said he believes that the United States needs to maintain control over the Western Hemisphere, invoking his own version of the 19th-century Monroe Doctrine, which rejected European colonialism in the hemisphere. He calls his approach the “Donroe Doctrine.” But in the interview, he said that the decision to kidnap the Venezuelan president was not made simply because of geography.

“It’s not hemisphere. It’s the country. It’s individual countries,” he said in the phone call.

I asked him whether the attack on Venezuela could indicate a willingness to take military action to seize control of Greenland, an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, which has rejected American territorial claims. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said yesterday that the world should take notice after the Venezuela operation. “​​When he tells you that he’s going to do something, when he tells you he’s going to address a problem, he means it,” Rubio said. Trump has repeatedly said that the U.S. “needs” to control Greenland.

Trump said it was up to others to decide what U.S.-military action in Venezuela means for Greenland. “They are going to have to view it themselves. I really don’t know. He was very generous to me, Marco, yesterday,” Trump said. “You know, I wasn’t referring to Greenland at that time. But we do need Greenland, absolutely. We need it for defense.”</div>

Even if something isn&#39;t supported the files should be left for download as &#39;legacy unsupported, use at your own risk&#39;

With the end of 2025, the last commercial support obligations for Itanium hardware have ended as well.  Essentially, Itanium finally, officially died 4 days ago.

It is really surprising how long bad ideas keep staying around. Itanium is a monument to the sheer incompetence of Intel when it comes to CPU design.

Itanium was the longest lived (25 years) of Intel&#39;s various failed attempts to kill x86.  It obviously failed in this regard, but it was successful at killing other RISC CPU architectures, including PA-RISC and Alpha.

Previous attempts include iAPX 432, i960 and i860, all now consigned to the dustbin of history, along with IA-64 (Itanium,) although the i960 had some success in embedded IO controllers.

I would expect that competent people make it on the second or at least the 3rd attempt. Intel failed 6 times by this count. AMD, on the other hand, needed one attempt to succeed and that is why it is the AMD64 architecture. What a crass difference.

Intel has suffered from having fuck-you money since the 1980s.  Such companies can suffer from accumulating faddish management and misallocating resources.  Intel is a poster child example of this.

That&#39;s ended very recently.  Intel&#39;s net income graphs since 2022 are astonishing: the wheels fell off entirely.  We&#39;ll see if they get their poop back in a group with Panther Lake next week.  It&#39;s looking pretty solid.

25 Years! Wow! Has anyone actually seen an Itanium machine? I thought it was still birth.

Back when the i860 was released I attended a 1 day workshop on its architecture and how to program it, in assembler,  at Intel. That was enough to convince me that the thing was impossible to program if you wanted to achieve its performance promises. So it turned out to be, the compiler writers could not do it.

I always wanted an Itanium box. You&#39;d think these things would be dirt cheap at some point because no one wanted them. They were never ever cheap.

Abandonware is just one way that copyright is broken as a concept.

If you don&#39;t want it (and end-of-life is just one way of expressing that), then you don&#39;t get to hoard it.

HP-UX was always the &quot;busted&quot; Unix. In the 1990s when you&#39;d read instructions for compiling software, there were always workarounds for deficiencies with HP-UX.

Irix was more than a &quot;movie star&quot; (appearing in Jurassic Park) -- all the graphics innovations we have today started with SGI, and Irix was solid. The first 64 bit Unix was IRIX. The Nintendo 64 was the direct child of SGI workstations. But the SGI keyboards were mushy as all hell so I guess nobody is perfect.

Solaris had an enormous amount of effort put into making it as good as possible. Like the version of Troff that came with Solaris is light years beyond anything else available even today. And do you know why? Because there was a brief time in history that Unix typesetting was considered state of the art and people literally bought Unix workstations to run troff. So Sun dumped a ton of money into making Troff as good as humanly possible. Sun gave us NEWS and Java and all kinds of innovations.

I don&#39;t doubt that HP-UX was capable but it&#39;s exactly the situation that the guy in the article is describing -- it was 100% an enterprise product sold to banks and similar customers with zero effort made to make it sexy or accessible to even broader commercial customers. When freaking IBM outshines you by a mile (like, you can get a Visual Studio integration for z/OS today) you&#39;ve completely lost the plot.

IRIX was the origin of XFS in Linux.  The design and command line syntax of the LVM subsystem in Linux was modeled after the HP-UX LVM implementation: HP&#39;s LVM was a leading implementation at the time and it worked well: I used it on HP-UX servers for backing up Oracle volumes, among other things.

Some versions of HP-UX 9 had a nasty bug whereby a fork() loop could hard crash the system because IIRC there was no bounds checking on the process table. I know, I found it by accident when learning to code multiprocess in C at uni. I was definately not Mr Popularity in the sys admin office that day.

We had a bunch of HP-UX machines and a handful of Sun boxes running Solaris. Personally, I&#39;ve been much happier working in an all-Linux environment.

Back when Solaris and HP-UX was in the ascendent Linux frankly wasn&#39;t really up to much either at the application, graphics or even system level (proper pthreads didn&#39;t arrive until kernel version 3, before then it was faked with seperate processes) no I&#39;m not sure what the appeal of early linux was other than being able to run it on a PC. And yes, I&#39;ve used all 3 and still using Linux today.

In fact HPUX was the first Unix I was introduced to as a CS student back in 1997. I remember the large monitors that were super high resolution and CDE looked great. You didn&#39;t need anti-aliasing because the fonts (well-designed bitmap fonts) looked crisp and readable on those enormous 19&quot; 1600x1200 CRTs.  When LCDs came out they were a real step backwards compared to those monitors.  Has take a long time to finally exceed the quality of those 1600x1200 displays with modern 2k and 4k displays.

When I got my first job as a sysadmin at a uni in the CS dept we had a whole bunch of HPUX workstations, and also a file server running HPUX.  I&#39;ve forgotten nearly everything I knew about HPUX but  I vaguely remember the SAM utility.  Around that time I was introduced to Linux.  Eventually as Linux got better and better I managed to convince the department to let us roll out Linux in one computer lab as a test.  It was so popular with the students compared to the Solaris and HPUX labs that by around 2000 we had replaced all of the open lab HP and Solaris workstations with Linux on x86 PCs (RedHat if I recall) and everyone from the faculty to the students were quite happy with them.

I feel somewhat bad at helping an entire CS department migrate away from HPUX machines as they really were high quality machines, but it was good move, for the department, the students, and for me professionally.

look my sig hp-ux was not needed 20 years ago

Commodore especially whoever fucked that company, man...

She and her gaggle of over-promoted airheads also wreaked havoc in Lucent.

I don&#39;t remember which one was which but one had a BA in Medieval History and the other had a BA in Political Science: Carly Fiorina and Pat Russo.

Don&#39;t tell me it&#39;s MacOS. (Also don&#39;t be an ignorant ass and say Linux.)

Is a fork still considered Unix? AIX still exists, as does Solaris and of course SCO Unix.

The BSDs are also still around, although according to Wikipedia [wikipedia.org] they&#39;re considered &quot;Unix-like&quot;... as is Linux.

Also according to Wikipedia, both macOS and Z/OS are current, certified Unix systems. SCO OpenServer is also listed there, but it doesn&#39;t appear to be maintained.

A couple of Linux distros have been certified as UNIX(tm) before: Inspur&#39;s K-UX and Huawei&#39;s EulerOS.

AIX is still a current IBM product. It runs on their POWER line of processors.

We&#39;re waaaay past the steam-age of microcomputers and even further past proprietary software of this kind even being a thing. There is absolutely _nothing_ left on this sort of OS (and hardware) that can&#39;t be replaced by some rasberry pi and way superior FOSS in less than an hour two orders of magnitude cheaper and 3+ orders of magnitude more performant. My cheap-ass 200 Euro smartphone has 12 GB of RAM and can run circles around this dinosaur of a microcomputer &quot;workstation&quot; in power-saving mode. That UI l

It was a nightmare to maintain. As far as I can remember, patches sometimes clashed. So if patch X was required for application A, it might break application B.

The build team configuration managed the patches.

When I first started in IT at the Enterprise level many many years ago I use HPUX for developing telephony software.  At the time we used HPUX as a Command and control of our systems.  It was also used to develop software for the Motorola 68020 switching systems.

HPUX was not actually a multithreaded OS then.  It had fake threads implemented with interrupts.  This caused us no end of grief at the time.  All of these low level hacks to ensure that things didn&#39;t lock up.  We needed something that could handle

We can hope it will work. We will see just how far the long arm of California law reaches. The Do Not Call list really became a verified list to abuse.

Does this include California government databases?

--I&#39;ve lived in California for six years and I&#39;ve never surfed. - Bill Skarsgard

The real problem is not the data brokers but the data buyers.  You know the top 100 largest companies have already bought the data from all the brokers.  And they collect more  data on you that they do not sell.

They do not sell, which means they are not registered data brokers.  And in the United States there are NO laws that apply to their data.  That means:

1) You cannot get them to delete anything.2) They will not tell you what data they have on you.3) They will not even tell you if they have any data on you.

California&#39;s law is a good one, but it is just the start of what we really need to do.

State legislators are easy to buy and not that expensive, like federal politicians. I&#39;ll bet the data brokers don&#39;t have an association in California. If they form that, and shell out some cash to legislators, this law will be rolled back.

A quarter century ago I briefly dated a stripper. She needed new posters to sell, but she couldn&#39;t afford a professional photographer and she wanted control of the masters. This was near the dawn of digital photography for consumers and I had a camera, so I agreed to take them. We did a shoot with a couple hundred photos. They weren&#39;t great, but it got the job done.

Shortly after that we stopped seeing each other. She asked me for the photos, and requested I delete them. I said yes. I burned the shots to two copies on CDs and gave them to her.

I never shared them with another soul, but I absolutely lied to her. I knew I was lying as I said it. And my reasons were up front and simple. Fast forward to me today, and the only difference is that today I&#39;d be honest about not deleting them. I would promise to keep them private.

Now these brokers have a vastly stronger motive to lie. Money. Lots and lots of it. I guarantee you data that is &quot;deleted&quot; is just relocated. Even if there&#39;s no immediate plan for it, it will be hoarded. And there are so many ways to do it you cannot catch them.

I wonder if once they&#39;ve sold the data to whoever (evil) entities that want it, there&#39;s no more market for that particular data, so they don&#39;t mind &quot;deleting&quot; it.

The difference is you were the only one who knew about your lie. A data broker has a large staff of people who would need to be relied up to keep the lie a secret.

So will they be able to demand that flock and other types of cameras delete and do not record everyone&#39;s personal information?

https://youtu.be/uB0gr7Fh6lY?s... [youtu.be]

and if you do not think they have your personal information, here, watch this:  https://youtu.be/vU1-uiUlHTo?s... [youtu.be]

with AI they DO have your personal data. They can see you and follow you in real time, they know where you live, they know what you drive, they know who you are, they know everything about you because you cannot escape 80,000 + cameras everywhere, ALPR (Automatic License Plate Readers) and PTZ (Pan to Zoom) cameras.

There is no more 4th amendment in the USA with this technology available to the state.

So will they be able to demand that flock and other types of cameras delete and do not record everyone&#39;s personal information?In theory, yes.  How that will work in practice is still untested.  I recommend those in CA ask flock to delete all their information (and see how they respond).  If they do not respond in a way you agree with, send the documentation of non-compliance to the CA AG (who seems to be willing to take these companies to court).

I haven&#39;t read this bill. But if it&#39;s remotely like the right of erasure pursuant to the European Union&#39;s GDPR, it does not apply to data that a data broker is required by law to retain.

https://www.donotcall.gov/ [donotcall.gov]

Let&#39;s see if California can do anybetter.

&quot;a single request that more than 500 registered data brokers delete their information&quot;How about the data brokers that are NOT registered?

This might actually be an instance of the infamous Van Halen brown M&Ms clause. Do you people actually read this sh-?

Reminds me of that time I tried to buy a laen knife.

There&#39;s no easy fix. If laws need to be properly reviewed, they won&#39;t be able to sneak in the corrupt parts!

(from Claude)Actual Purpose (The Legal & Practical Impact)While the stated goals focus on &quot;security&quot; and &quot;waste prevention,&quot; the primary practical function of the bill is to resolve ownership disputes and expand the rights of coal operators at the expense of general mineral owners. Key &quot;actual&quot; functions include:

- Granting Automatic Mineral Rights to Coal Lessees: The bill effectively changes the default terms of any coal lease, &quot;whenever granted.&quot; It stipulates that a lease for coal is now deemed to include all critical and rare earth minerals contained within that coal unless they were specifically excluded in writing. This retroactively grants coal companies the right to valuable minerals they may not have originally paid for.

- Protecting Facility Owners (Coal Ash Ownership): The bill clarifies that coal ash and byproducts resulting from combustion or gasification belong to the owner/operator of the facility, not the original mineral owner. This secures the &quot;downstream&quot; value of these minerals for the utility companies.

- Limiting Liability: It includes language protecting facility owners from being held liable for &quot;waste, conversion, or destruction&quot; of minerals during the combustion or gasification process.

- Legal Retroactivity: By making these changes retroactive, the bill seeks to bypass potential litigation over existing contracts where the ownership of minerals like lithium or uranium found in coal seams might have been ambiguous under older laws.

In summary: The bill uses the high-profile justification of &quot;national security&quot; and &quot;rare earth production&quot; to codify a legal framework that ensures coal mining companies and power plants have the primary right to profit from these materials, even if those rights were not explicitly secured in their original land-use agreements.

I thought retroactive laws were invalid?  Or is that only for criminal court?

The U.S. Constitution prohibits ex post facto laws.

Soon they will be mining 100% weapons grade bolognium.

Hasn&#39;t it been mathematically proven that all hallucinations come from AI?

Clearly the whole venture is a bad joke when they cannot even get somebody competent to read through the thing before making it a law.

if they did that most laws would never get passed. i don&#39;t see that as a bad thing

So you are on favor of broken laws? How is that a good thing?

Bonespuria, Invadia, Cankleia, Adolfia, Xenophobia, Golfia, Fibbia, and Blowhardia.

Seems they can&#39;t track who changes what.  And they&#39;ll approve it all the same.

Why aren&#39;t they using version control already?

Hybrids aren&#39;t EVs.  They&#39;re simply gas cars that get better mileage.  Yeah, that&#39;s better than ones with worse mileage, but that&#39;s all.  Hybrids average somewhere around a third more efficient.  So they help, but they&#39;re nothing like converting to full EVs.

Plug-in hybrids are great for people who actually plug them in and use them as EVs most of the time.  But unfortunately many plug-in hybrid owners just treat them as hybrids and never bother to plug them in.  That&#39;s pretty stupid, but studies show that m

Their big problem is that they haven&#39;t figured out how to make money on EVs.  Part of the problem is their dealer networks don&#39;t want to sell them due to the lower maintenance costs.  That keeps the volume down to where they can&#39;t amortize the costs properly.

Just get rid of dealer laws, circumstances have changed and they are probably one of the most egregious political lobbies right now, pure protectionism.

That&#39;s pretty stupid, but studies show that many people really are that dumb.Some people legitimately don&#39;t have a place to plug them in.

Tesla owners were plenty chatty back in 2015 when I got my Model S.  Now there are just so many that it doesn&#39;t feel new anymore.  I remember when we used to wave at each other when we say another Tesla, but that was a long time ago now.

But yes, EVs are great if you can plug in at home, but if you have on-street parking or are renting, they can be quite inconvenient.

If you cannot charge at home, their cost per mile goes up to the same as a gas car&#39;s or more.

Right now, if you don&#39;t own your home, or are not sure you&#39;ll be in a house for a long time, buying an EV is foolish.

But I think the right answer here is not to mistakenly downgrade EVs -- we should be making sure parking lots provide 120v plugs.  120v is all more than half of the US needs to handle their day-to-day driving, and is cheap to install.  Remember -- EVs never, ever draw more than a $30 space heater on a 120v circuit -- 1500 watts.

If you cannot charge at home, their cost per mile goes up to the same as a gas car&#39;s or more.In California, even if you can charge at home, the cost per mile is more than many gasoline-powered cars:Model 3: 3.7 to 4.2 miles per kWh.  PG&E residential service averages 45.33 cents average per kWh. That&#39;s 10.79 to 12.25 cents per mile.My usual gas station is $3.90 per gallon.  A Prius hybrid gets 56 miles per gallon.  That&#39;s 6.9 cents per mile.  Add to that an oil change for $100 every 5,000 miles on oil changes, which is 2 cents per mile, and the Prius hybrid is still 2 to 4 cents per mile cheape

Well, if you can charge from solar the equation changes significantly-- closer to $0.09/kWh or $0.02/mile.

Well, if you can charge from solar the equation changes significantly-- closer to $0.09/kWh or $0.02/mile.Sure, but only if you also  have a Powerwall or similar.  Otherwise, your car is going to be at work during the day, rather than charging at home, and you&#39;re going to be getting jack s**t for your excess solar during the day thanks to PG&E&#39;s rate structure, and then buying that power back at night at full price.

Really the two are close enough that the balance could easily change during the life of the car due to shifting prices for gas, electricity, or a mileage-based tax on EV&#39;s to pay for roads.

That is all true except PG&E&#39;s EV2 plan has off-peak energy at 28.5 cents per kWh, which should cover most of the needs of people who charge at home.

That is all true except PG&E&#39;s EV2 plan has off-peak energy at 28.5 cents per kWh, which should cover most of the needs of people who charge at home.  That rate makes it competitive with the Prius, even before you consider oil changes.

An oil change for $100? Are you out of your mind? Where are you getting your car serviced? Do they wear tuxedos?

Bingo.  I am lucky -- I have 240v, 50 amp ready to go when I go for a charger, and the charger can just be plugged in via a dryer outlet, or hard-wired in.

However, when I go around the area I live in, in a mile radius, there are two chargers at one business, and those are at most 120 volt, &quot;overnight&quot; chargers that only add a few miles per hour to the battery bank... and the cords are always gone (yummy copper for the meth-heads, I guess).

If you don&#39;t have your own charger, EV life sucks.  You have to take

Hybrids and plug-in hybrids to boot, are indeed not EVs.  They have all the complexity of an ICE car + the complexity of an EV.  They are frankly nuts.

EREV cars should replace them in the very near future.  People won&#39;t really notice the difference, and EREVs are cheaper to make, less complex, and give you a more performant car with less emissions for less money than a hybrid.

Unless of course, you buy the idea that dealers want complexity because they make some of their money on service/oil changes, and the

Hybrids and plug-in hybrids to boot, are indeed not EVs.  They have all the complexity of an ICE car + the complexity of an EV.  They are frankly nuts.To the contrary. Plug-in hybrids have all the advantages of an EV, with all the advantages of a gas car.
&quot;The complexity of an EV&quot; you mention is nearly zero. Electric motors are really really simple. The real downside of an EV is that the range is directly proportional to battery mass. The vast majority of car use in the United States is under 35 miles per day. You simply don&#39;t need a huge battery for 90 percent of car usage.  But, you want to take care of that remaining 10%.  So, the gas engine solves that, with the advantage that since the electric engine takes care of starting and stopping torque, the gas engine can be optimized for best performance at constant RPM.

The reason an EREV is not really a hybrid is that the gas engine never drives the wheels directly. It only runs a single speed, its most efficient, to recharge the battery. The decoupling of the engine from the drive train makes it significantly less complex mechanically, as well. Most new black cabs in London are EREVs from LEVC. They&#39;re pretty good.

They will plug them in if that will improve the performance.

It&#39;s friction and habit, not stupidity. To make the most of a PHEV, you have the friction of getting home charging installed, and then remembering to plug in every night or every other night. Plugging in that often is a fair bit of friction, and with a PHEV, you don&#39;t have to do it, whereas with an EV, you do have to plug it in, but probably only once a week or so, which is a lot less friction.

The Toyota / Ford hybrid (and phev... they&#39;re basically the same) power train are really cool and surprisingly simple mechanically.probably the pinnacle of ice gas engine application.    Atkinson cycle engine and eCVT (with no belt and relatively light use of clutches)

I see hybrids as a way to convince sceptics. Once they find they are mostly using the battery anyway, and especially with a PHEV where they get used to charging it, next time they might just go electric only and enjoy those benefits too.

No oil, no belts, no gearbox, no fluids, no spark plugs, no alternator, no radiator and pump, very little brake wear... They realize what a pointless load of effort the ICE part is.

I see hybrids as a way to convince sceptics.Maybe there are a few people who will shockingly discover that all of their daily driving fits within the range of their PHEV&#39;s battery without the ICE engine kicking in, but I doubt it.  If anything, I think hybrids will just reinforce how much more convenient gas is than having to make a half hour pit stop to charge.

If anything, I think hybrids will just reinforce how much more convenient gas is than having to make a half hour pit stop to charge.

I think I should probably clarify that when you&#39;re driving a full EV, then you get to experience that the battery is likely more than adequate for your daily driving needs.  PHEVs tend to use much smaller capacity batteries, so when the engine kicks on during that unexpected grocery run after work, the driver might think &quot;Gee, lucky I had this, if this was a full EV I&#39;d be out of juice!&quot;

Whereas if it actually had been a full EV, it would&#39;ve had the capacity for the unexpected trip, no problem.

A friend of mine in Montana had precisely this experience, after buying a PHEV RAV4.

However, he&#39;s an intelligent person who notices things.

It obviously depends how big the battery is, but they don&#39;t need to do all their driving on it. Just enough that they see the cost savings and ideally get to see how convenient charging is.

It also helps them fix their understanding of distance. In my experience most people over-estimate distances by about 100%, so think battery range is less than it really is. Back in the day people would ask if I could get to the next city over in my Leaf, which was 22 miles away.

She got a Toyota Rav4 plug-in hybrid last spring. It gets about 40 miles of all-electric range, and almost all of her trips are under that. When we visited my inlaws over the holidays (with some gas assist) she joked that she might need to fill the tank again, and she hoped she remembered how. It would be her third tank.

She was cross-shopping electric cars last year, but wasn&#39;t ready to try it. But I&#39;m pretty sure her next car will be electric. It&#39;s plenty clear to her now that 250 miles of electric range w

For the following reasons, in priority order:

1) Better gas mileage.2) Backup power generation (which is freaking amazing!).3) Longer intervals between oil changes and maintenance.4) Actually able to tow.

You are an idiot.  Weeks at a time? No!  We just want to get to our campsite a state or two away without wasting HOURS of or lives sitting on our asses waiting for under performing and vastly over hyped charging stations to finally bringing our batteries to 60% charge.

You&#39;re wasting your life with a gas car not with the EV as studies have shown that human driving performance degrades rapidly if driving for more than about 2.5 hours without at least a 15min break (which is all you need to recharge your EV at a fast charger to get you the next 2.5 hours).

Do yourself a favour, buy an EV, it may force you take breaks and actually help you get to your campsite alive. And if you don&#39;t care about your own life, maybe consider the other people you&#39;re likely to have a head on col

3) Longer intervals between oil changes and maintenance.I recommend being extra skeptical of this advertising point. First, engine oil should be changed with miles and time. Second, hybrid is hard on oil because of lack of continuous operation makes it harder to get oil to temperature and evaporate condensation.

Agreed hybrids are just a bad idea.  If you really need the gas range, you want an EREV, not a hybrid.  Good luck finding what you want in one of those right now, though.

I live in the near-city suburbs.  Most of the pickups I see are bought as a statement and never used for cargo.  The lightning, which goes fast yes, was perfect for those guys, assuming they owned a home.

If you want a really useful truck, you should import a bongo truck.  I am amazed when people (other than perhaps gardeners) profess to me that their 4-foot beds are someone useful.  I can get a longer 2x4 in my hatchback than they can in their truck.  I was car shopping just last week, looking at the PV5.

Gas cars people understand.  ICE = internal combustion engine.

No-plug hybrids are Gas powered generators that run an electric motor. Sometimes they let you add direct ICE power to the electric.  They get better mileage but cost more mileage than ICE.  Also cost more to repair.  But they have the best possible range.

Plug in hybrids are almost always plugged in at home but everyone keeps buying gasoline to run them when your home&#39;s charge runs out.  Mainly because plugging them in on the road is VERY expensive - more so than buying gasoline.  They have the same advantages and disadvantages as no-plug hybrid except their cheapest mode is running on home&#39;s electricity.

Pure EVs are more expensive than ICE, but not as bad as hybrids.  But maintance on them is significantly cheaper.  They are cheap to run on home electricity but again, too expensive to run on bought electricity.

1) Make EV chargers more prevalent.  They need to be everywhere a gas station is and more.  Parking lots should include them - especially office lots and hotels.  They need to be considered an expected perk - the equivalent of white lines drawn on the parking lot.

2) Make EV chargers cheap.  You cannot charge a premium for this stuff if you want people to use it.  Hard to stop the greedy sob&#39;s if they think of it as a profit center.  The reason people use the charger is to save money and if people with hybrids can buy gasoline cheaper they will not buy electricity.  Put a max price on it below the gas equivalent price.

3) Make gas more expensive.  The US has some of the lowest gas tax.  In 2019, the only ones cheaper are Brazil, Indonesia, and Russia.

If you do these things then EV&#39;s will become common.As long as people have to worry about finding a place to charge, EVs will not be common.  As long as a-holes try to overcharge people for electricity as compared to gasoline, EV&#39;s will not be common.

Stop these things and EV&#39;s will be common. If EV&#39;s become common, we won&#39;t have to ration gasoline.

#1 is a nice-to have but not vital.  Most EV owners, unless they are road-tripping, never, EVER use a for-pay charger.  I own 2 EVs and have never paid for non-home electrons except to test plug and software compatibility for a just-in-case scenario.  Not once.  Even on vacation, driving an EV around a national park, the hotel provided free charging and the national park provided free charging.

While there are locations which are mandating EV charging for future developments of MDUs, that is simply not universal.

I have a pure EV (cooper mini) that isn&#39;t very fast in the upper ranges of horsepower, e.g. freeway passing, but it&#39;s very quick around town.

In theory, at least, I like the idea behind the Extended Range EVs like the upcoming Ford Ranger. If I understand it correctly, they&#39;re basically a full-blown EV (with a pure EV drive train) - but they also have a generator onboard that can be used to recharge the batteries if necessary.

It seems like that addresses the range anxiety some people stress about, without having to deal with the more complicated drive train of most current hybrids (where there&#39;s more points of potential failure than either an ICE

This quote about relative reliability from that Consumer Reports article does make sense:

“Many of the problems with EVs and plug-in hybrids are because they are newer designs compared to gas technology, so some kinks still continue to be worked out,” says Jake Fisher, senior director of auto testing at Consumer Reports. “By comparison, hybrids have been around for nearly three decades, and the technology is tried and true.”

It&#39;s also true that ICE vehicles have been around even longer

The world should have abandoned full EVs and focused on hybrids from the start. Had they done it, everyone would own a hybrid by now. No contest - hybrids are just the best of the two worlds: more ecological short distance while providing reliability and long distance when needed.

Most people &#39;get&#39; living with an ICE car and there&#39;s no incentive to change yet, which is perfectly rational esp in jurisdictions like the US where gas is artificially cheap.It&#39;s the opposite: gas is cheap, except in areas where they apply high taxes that make it artificially expensive.

...and money. All those rich people who live in California forget that most of the world can&#39;t afford reasonable-range EVs without significant financial stress. Plus all the time wasted hanging out at charging points for those who don&#39;t own a property, which is actually quite a high number worldwide where many live in rented properties or flats with no access to a charger.

WHAT?  70% of the US lives in single family homes.  A garage is nice, but not necessary for an EV.  Almost everyone with a single-family home will save money and have a better driving and maintenance experience with an EV.  EVs are just better.  Even road trips with charging go pretty well with them, and that&#39;s less than 20 days per year (that&#39;s 5% of your days of using the car and it&#39;s an outlier -- most drive less on road trips than that).  So some inconvenience on road trips is made up for by the cost sa

Exactly. Your free time is highly valuable. Why would you be spending it on hours of charging, or worrying if you have enough miles left &quot;in the tank&quot; to give your family the best time they deserve?

I hike in remote locations every weekend between March and November. 150 miles drive in, 150 miles return, approx 30-50 miles around where I&#39;m staying. The very last thing on my mind would be to try and locate a charger and waste precious hours of my free time waiting at the charging point. And no - leaving my car at the charger all day is not an option - other people need to use it, too, and when I walk, I walk for anywhere between 8 and 12 hours in peak summer.

Hybrids are the worst of both worlds, not the best.  EREVs you could argue are the BOBW, hybrids are high-complexity and lower efficiency for a less punchy/quiet/low-cost result.

EV&#39;s should cost less then ICE vehicles, they have fewer and lower cost parts.It&#39;s the battery. The only reason we did not have electric cars 100 years ago (they existed before ICE cars) is the battery.EV minus battery should be cheaper. And the battery should be cheaper than gasoline.In Australia, a BYD Atto 2 small SUV is around us$22k.     So already cheaper than non-Chinese petrol competitors.Cars used to be far more expensive in Australia - until they abolished the tariffs.

It&#39;s the battery. The only reason we did not have electric cars 100 years ago (they existed before ICE cars) is the battery.EV minus battery should be cheaper. And the battery should be cheaper than gasoline.

In Australia, a BYD Atto 2 small SUV is around us$22k.     So already cheaper than non-Chinese petrol competitors.Cars used to be far more expensive in Australia - until they abolished the tariffs.

I agree in general.  They&#39;re mostly all the same and all way too big, and a stupid shape to boot.

But try driving a used Bolt.  They&#39;re cheap, get good range (they charge too slow for road tripping but fine on a 120v or 240v plug) and a good size.

New Bolts, when they start making them again, just support your argument -- they are only going to make the EUV/larger model going forward.

Around one-third of America&#39;s hybrid drivers &quot;transition to a fully electric vehicle when they next switch cars.&quot;

Interesting. That was the case for me. Went from 22 years in a Prius to an Ioniq 6.

Hey, Armored Drag: STFU and GTFO, you obsessive nutbar. Go jack off to your fantasies about rsilvergun somewhere else, you perverted stalker!

But as far as I know the original Betty boop is in public domain but that&#39;s the one that is basically a doggy girl. The Betty boop that most of us think of as Betty boop isn&#39;t yet in public domain. I think you are ignoring the part of TFS that discusses impact of the Betty Boop shorts that missed their copyright renewal.

On Wikipedia I find that 53 episodes are in the public domain (including 4 since this month) and 73 episodes are yet to enter the public domain at latest Jan. 2034. Some episodes can be watched on Wikipedia, the most recent of which is #62 from 1937. Here the full list: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/... [wikipedia.org]

That expression—the actual film—is in the public domain.The likeness is not.Pretty simple.

And the DMCA should not apply outside of the USA.

In 2026, there’s one easy resolution we should all commit to: Be better consumers of media.

Traditional media is in crisis, thanks to a combination of Trump administration attacks, corporate takeovers, and technological innovations. Social media sites compete for our attention by offering us addictive little bites: Outrage-bait tweets and short-form shock value TikTok videos, served up according to algorithms that track how long we linger and feed us more and more of what keeps us locked in (which is often what makes us angry).

For young people raised on smartphones, this has meant that most of them seem to lack the attentional ability to actually read news articles in their entirety. Only 15% of adults under 30 say they follow the news most or all of the time, and that percentage has declined since 2016, according to Pew. While majorities of Americans over 50 regularly seek out the news, young adults largely do not—70% of them say they see political news simply because they come across it, which happens largely via social media. Nearly 40% rely on “influencers” for news, because, as one 21-year-old man told Pew, “If I agree with that person already, if I already have background with that person, then I’ll probably trust him more than some news site.”

This is troubling enough. Except now, some once-legitimate news outlets are following suit, and pledging to tell viewers what they want to hear and already believe, rather than what’s true and what it means. CBS, now helmed by former opinion writer and Substacker Bari Weiss, just relaunched their flagship CBS Evening News show newly anchored by Tony Dokoupil, who opened the program’s reboot by telling viewers, “On too many stories, the press has missed the story. Because we’ve taken into account the perspective of advocates and not the average American. Or we put too much weight in the analysis of academics or elites, and not enough on you.” Dokoupil promised that “From now on, what you see and hear on the news will reflect what you see and hear in your own life.”

Programming that simply regurgitates what people already see, hear, and believe in their own lives is not, by any definition, “news” or even new. News media of course report stories that are relevant to their readers’ and viewers’ lives. But they should also be reporting the things those readers and viewers should know but don’t: Political corruption or malfeasance; the actions of the very powerful; the disasters afflicting the less fortunate; innovations and world-changing achievements; the ways in which choices made in Washington invisibly but indelibly shape the lives of average people. The job of the reporter is to report what’s true, and to help the reader or viewer understand why it matters or what it means, which often requires bringing in subject matter experts who are less “elites” than people who have spent years amassing knowledge and whose insights can expand minds and deepen public understanding. Mimicking the social media model of simply affirming people’s own beliefs, biases, and animosities and insisting the guy next door knows as much about nuclear fission as a nuclear physicist is an anathema to real journalism.

It’s also perpetuating the problem. People haven’t lost trust in mainstream media because mainstream media outlets have routinely lied to and manipulated them. People have lost trust in mainstream media at least in part because canny political actors have told the public that mainstream media has lied to and manipulated them, and that instead they should trust their own gut—and, of course, highly ideological activists who use short-form video and text as tools to drive engagement (and drive up their own relevance and wealth).

Take, for example, the recent fraud scandal in Minnesota. Dozens of people, many of them Somali immigrants, have been accused and convicted of bilking federal social services programs for hundreds of millions of dollars in a sprawling and remarkably well-organized fraud involving autism care and a nonprofit called “Feeding Our Future” (the alleged mastermind of the fraud was the nonprofit’s head, a white woman). President Trump has jumped on the issue, using it to hammer his anti-immigrant views; several prominent conservatives have called to denaturalize and deport U.S. citizens who were involved in the scheme.

Now, right-wing influencers have made uncovering other acts of alleged Somali fraud something of a competition. In an act that has shades of Pizzagate, one man showed up at daycare centers wielding a camera and demanding to be let inside, ostensibly to prove that there were no children there and the centers were more illegal money grabs; he seemed confused that daycares are typically locked to outsiders and don’t have formal reception areas, and has been unable to offer any actual evidence of fraud. Nevertheless, his video went viral, and was shared by the vice president and the director of the FBI. And there have been real and devastating consequences: Innocent Somalis have been harassed and threatened; Somali-run daycares have been vandalized. Based, it seems, solely on the claims of one right-wing influencer, Trump has cut off all federal childcare funds to Minnesota, money that thousands of families rely on to afford care for their kids.

Conservative influencers are claiming that there was a widespread coverup not only by Democrats in office, but by news media. “Right now the mainstream media is doing nothing to cover the Somali fraud in Minnesota,” one conservative activist with a million followers tweeted a few days before the new year. MAGA Voice told its 1.4 million followers that “CBS hasn’t reported on Minnesota / PBS hasn’t reported on Minnesota” and continued that convention to accuse six mainstream television networks of not reporting on the fraud case. “You literally can’t find a single mainstream article about the Minnesota fraud… Not even one…” reads one tweet that has been shared more than 9,000 times.

“Somali fraud” became a talking point in right-wing circles thanks to an article in the conservative National Journal co-authored by right-wing activist Christopher Rufo. It claims that not only were Somalis defrauding the government, but, as the headline says, “the largest funder of [the terrorist group] al-Shabaab is the Minnesota taxpayer.” The piece then proceeds to include no evidence for its al-Shabaab claim, save for one quote attributed to an anonymous source (later in the piece, one law enforcement official notes that Somalis, like many immigrant groups, send money to relatives back home, and that in Somalia, al-Shabaab is “taking a cut”—not that Somali-Americans are sending reams of cash to terrorists, or that the Minnesota taxpayer is their primary bankroller). That they were just hearing about this scandal, conservatives claimed, was evidence of the media’s complicity in a coverup.

It was, instead, evidence of their own insularity, incuriosity, and apparent inability to read the news or even google. The City Journal article came out in mid-November; the Times had covered the case in March and again in August and kept up the coverage as the story evolved and as federal indictments turned into mounting convictions. Sahan Journal, a Minnesota publication catering to the Somali community, covered it a year ago. The Associated Press, CBS News, and a half-dozen local Minnesota news outlets also covered the story months before Rufo was on the case.

It is true that, so far, mainstream media outlets have not gone around accusing daycare operators of fraud with no evidence beyond an online search, a hunch, and an unheeded demand to be allowed into childcare centers to video the kids; this is a good thing. Real investigative journalism takes care to get the facts right, and that takes time. Unlike in the Feeding Our Future fraud, there is no criminal case to cover in these so far unsubstantiated claims of daycare fraud.

Being the first influencer to accuse immigrants of a serious crime may drive engagement and make one a right-wing hero, but it’s not the same as actual investigative reporting, which requires verifying facts rather than simply asserting them. And when reputable outlets get things wrong—and, being run by humans, they sometimes do—they publicly correct the record. Ideologues and influencers tend to just ignore or deny their own mistakes. If the influencer pounding on daycare doors is shown evidence that the care centers are legit, do we think he admit he was wrong, let alone go viral for it? And if he does walk back his claims, will the many millions of people who have taken them seriously get the memo—or will they continue on with the impression that a rampant fraud occurred and the legacy media simply refused to talk about it? Do we believe that the president will restore childcare funding and repay any lost wages to the parents whose ability to work just got scrambled?

This is all incredibly corrosive. The incoming A.I. era seems primed to supercharge this already perilous situation. With bots sounding more human by the day and the ability to create highly realistic photos and videos of just about whatever one pleases, the very concept of a shared reality may be in rapid decline. What we see with our own eyes on our phones—what we see and hear political leaders saying, what we see and hear our fellow citizens doing—is becoming less reliable, and it takes ever-greater sophistication to ferret out what’s real.

In this new Alice-in-Wonderland semi-reality, we need honest, accountable, real journalism. Instead of shoring up reputable outlets, though, too many are being sacrificed to the president by greedy owners who seem eager to profit handsomely even if it comes at the cost of America’s once-robust democratic functioning enabled by the fourth estate. CBS’s rightward turn, including the appointment of Weiss—who was an opinion writer (not a reporter) with no experience in TV news—has come in the wake of its parent company being acquired by Skydance Media (now Paramount Skydance), owned by David Ellison, the son of Trump-supporting billionaire Larry Ellison. The younger Ellison was only able to acquire Paramount with the approval of the Federal Communications Commission, which Trump has captured and whose power the president continues to abuse. Announcing the merger, FCC chairman and Trump loyalist Brendan Carr said that he welcomes “Skydance’s commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network,” including the appointment of a right-wing think tank employee as CBS’s new ombudsman.

Ellison is now in a bid to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns CNN—another network the president believes is against him. Trump has implied that he will again abuse the Federal Communications Commission’s power to grant or block the merger the younger Ellison badly wants. It’s not hard to see Weiss’s decision to pull a ready-to-air 60 Minutes segment about the Salvadoran torture-prison to which Trump is deporting immigrants—after Trump complained that 60 Minutes had been mean to him—as part of a broader strategy to gut media companies that allow reporters to do their jobs rather than work as mouthpieces for the administration, all in the service of enriching a tiny few.

There is not much the average American citizen can do to stop billionaires from grabbing and gutting storied news networks, and other authoritarian leaders have run similar playbooks in their own countries, most notably Hungary. What we can do, though, is direct our dollars and our attention to the reputable and well-run outlets that remain—and even though local news was dying well before Trump’s second term and national outlets are being disemboweled like Hannibal Lector is on the run, there are, thankfully, still many newspapers, news magazines, and television news networks doing real journalism. But they are facing threats from all sides: A vengeful president; a distracted and disengaged audience used to endless scrolling and pop-pop-pops of entertainment; the creeping unreality of A.I.

Fundamentally, we all need to be better news consumers. News outlets also see what’s shared and what’s ignored, which stories draw clicks and eyeballs and which are scrolled past, which outlets are growing their subscription bases and which are shrinking. That doesn’t determine editorial decisions, but it would be naïve to believe it doesn’t at all shape them. And if reputable news outlets aren’t getting readers and viewers, they also aren’t earning subscriber and ad dollars, which means there’s less cash to pay journalists to do the often-slow and often-pedantic work of good journalism.

It’s not just journalism that’s at stake; it’s your own brain. Do you believe you are better off getting news and information primarily from social media feeds that have been cultivated to push your particular outrage buttons, delivered by people who are accountable to no one? Or might it be better for your mind (your intellectual abilities and your basic sanity) to read a range of stories from across a big and complicated world, and sometimes see your priors challenged?

It’s practically a national pastime to complain about the media. Instead of asking “who says stuff I agree with?” try questioning a publication or individual’s editorial policies. Do they check their facts and check them again before publishing, to make sure that they get it right most of the time? Are they transparent when they’re wrong? Do they hold the powerful to account, no matter who “the powerful” may be? Do they approach their subject matter with curiosity rather than an agenda?

Social media, A.I., Trump, and corporate greed do not have to be the end of reliable journalism. But they’re definitely not going to save it. As the old PBS slogan goes, that’s only made possible by viewers like you.

There was a time not long ago when people would claim with a straight face that Donald Trump was a populist who prioritized the interests of working-class Americans and avoided stupid foreign wars. “Trump’s Best Foreign Policy? Not Starting Any Wars,” then-Senator J.D. Vance crowed in 2023. As Trump assembled his second-term national security team in 2024, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) claimed to be “amazed by the Trump cabinet” and the president’s rejection of “warmongers.” A mere two months ago, one of those cabinet officials, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, told a conference in Bahrain that Trump had ended the “counterproductive and endless cycle of regime change or nation-building” that has defined American foreign policy for decades.

Trump’s brazenly illegal military assault on Caracas last week would embarrass these people, were they capable of embarrassment. Trump did not govern as a populist during his first term; his second term has been an unabashed celebration of crass imperialism and the super-rich.

And the super-rich are thrilled. Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman croons that Trump’s war in Venezuela “will lower oil prices, which is good for America.” The Jeff Bezos editorial board hailed the Trump invasion as a happy confluence of “justice” and technical prowess. Elon Musk is patching things up with Trump, proclaiming the war “a win for the world and a clear message to evil dictators everywhere.” Nor are Republicans the only enthusiasts. Democratic Party fundraiser Charles Myers is organizing a post-Maduro field trip to Venezuela with about 20 hedge funders and asset managers to scout investment opportunities in “oil and gas,” “construction,” and “tourism.”

The story of American capital profiteering on American war is as old as America itself, and Trump openly claims to have invaded Venezuela for its oil. But in this particular case the Wall Street opportunists have their work cut out for them. On Saturday, Politico reported that Trump offered U.S. oil executives “reimbursement” for oil assets that were nationalized by the Venezuelan government decades ago—but only on the condition that they actually take control of Venezuela’s oil fields. Ten days after making the offer, Trump doesn’t have any takers. Venezuela’s oil infrastructure is outdated, and it will take tremendous investments to meaningfully expand production, something oil companies are reluctant to do when large profits are readily available from high prices and low corporate investment. We are thus presented with the bizarre spectacle of an American president waging an imperialist war on behalf of American executives who are reluctant to claim the spoils. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, meanwhile, is telling reporters that Cuba may be next in line for American-imposed regime change, as the wife of Trump’s racism czar Stephen Miller points to Greenland.

Embarrassing as these developments are for the right-wing populists who supported Trump in 2024, I have always harbored some sympathy for their political plight. Conservative populists are generally right about war (bad) and poverty (wrong), and they claim to recognize warmongering and elite favor-trading as unpleasant features of Republican politics. At the same time, I have maintained contempt for the belief that Donald Trump might deliver America from those evils. Trump’s first term was defined by a massive tax cut for the rich, a bank deregulation bill that delivered a rash of bank failures, the destruction of a standing diplomatic treaty with Iran, and sustained, vocal support for the violent and corrupt governments of Israel and Saudi Arabia. All of these agenda items could have been implemented by a President Mitt Romney, had an election or two gone a little differently. The populist fantasy this time around was that Vance and a few other Trump insiders who had built careers on populist branding might persuade Trump to turn away from the Republican old guard.

A year into his second term, Trump has once again cut taxes for the rich, in addition to doubling health insurance premiums for 20 million families, and declaring the national affordability crisis a “hoax.” His invasion of Venezuela suggests not only a return to the lunatic adventurism of George W. Bush in Iraq, but to various coups attempted and consummated by Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George H.W. Bush.

So Trump’s populist pitch to voters once again turned out to be a fraud. But the populist energy that fueled his reelection isn’t going away, even if the air is coming out of the Epstein jet’s tires. Trump was propelled into office by the two defining events of the 21st century: Bush the Younger’s disaster in Iraq and the financial crisis of 2008, both of which provided the country with ample evidence of elite incompetence and self-dealing. But the Democratic Party’s leadership has remained too entwined with the same interests and ideologues to establish itself as an enduring alternative to the elite predation that has been so obvious under Republican leadership. Barack Obama captured Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011, but remained at war in Afghanistan for the remainder of his presidency. Joe Biden followed through on Trump’s first-term Middle East program all the way to a genocide in Gaza, and one of Biden’s last actions in office was to offer a $25 million reward for information leading to Maduro’s “arrest”—the same word the Trump administration uses to describe its operation in Venezeula.

Trump’s presidency is in trouble. Every Epstein file dump reveals his long friendship with the sex-trafficker to be worse than we knew, and he is still illegally withholding tens of thousands of Epstein files from public scrutiny—not the action of a man comfortable with the contents. Prices remain high, unemployment is rising, and the economy has been stuck in a hiring freeze for just about the entirety of Trump’s presidency. Democratic Party leadership clearly hopes it can ride all of this ineptitude to victory in 2026 and 2028 without promising much more than a return to normalcy. And Trump’s failures mean that they will, indeed, have the wind at their backs. But Democrats have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory before. The safe bet is to break with the corrupt and violent tradition Trump so unmistakably embodies.

In a lengthy press conference Saturday detailing the U.S. military’s capture of Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro, President Donald Trump confirmed, with stunning frankness, the classic leftist critique of American foreign policy: that, at least for as long as he’s in power, it’s all about the oil.

Over the past few months, Trump and his aides had characterized their pressure campaign against Maduro’s regime as a war on “narco-terrorism” and a fight to restore democratic rule. But following Maduro’s extraction in a complex military and intelligence operation, the American president was clear about its true motive.

“We’re going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,” he said, adding, “We can’t take a chance that somebody else takes over Venezuela that doesn’t have the good of the Venezuelan people in mind.” Then came the kicker: “We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in” and spend billions of dollars fixing the energy infrastructure that they developed decades ago, until socialist regimes nationalized their wells, then wrecked them. The wealth resulting from this grab-back will benefit the Venezuelan people, he said, but added that much of it will reimburse America’s oil companies.

Finally, Trump said, U.S. troops will be sent to enforce Big Oil’s rule, if necessary. “They always say ‘boots on the ground,’ we’re not afraid of boots on the ground,” he said. “We had boots on the ground last night,” as part of the operation to extract Maduro. He said the military was poised to go in again if necessary.

There’s a storied history, starting in the Cold War, of the U.S. military and the CIA co-opting or overthrowing Central and South American governments—including Guatemala, Brazil, Ecuador, the Dominican Republic, Chile, as well as several attempt to do so in Cuba—to bolster the interests of U.S. corporations, including United Fruit, IT&T, and various oil companies, among others.

But rarely have the presidents who ordered these interventions been so blatant about the primary motive. Instead, at least in public, they spoke of fighting Communism or upholding democracy, even when the enemies weren’t really Communist and their allies weren’t at all democratic.

But Trump was up front in his motives, and repeatedly so. Several times in his press conference, he talked of bringing in big U.S. oil companies to regain their former assets. (In fact, though, American firms never owned the land where they drilled for Venezuela’s oil riches, and, as in many other countries, the interplay between foreign exploiters and local nationalizers was more complex than Trump’s narrative suggests.) And he also talked about restoring “American dominance in the Western hemisphere”—a policy that Trump’s recently issued National Security Strategy called the “Trump corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine. “We are reasserting American power in a very powerful way in our home region,” he said—not to protect democracy but for its own sake.

Maduro and his wife were captured, then indicted by the U.S. Attorney in New York, on charges of drug trafficking. But Trump all but admitted that wasn’t the real reason for the elaborate operation. Just a month ago, while officers were planning the attack on Venezuela, Trump pardoned former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernández, who had been convicted of drug-trafficking. Asked about this at Saturday’s news conference, Trump said he’d issued the pardon because Hernández, who’d supported Trump, had been “treated unfairly” by former President Joe Biden.

As for democracy, Trump was asked whether he would support María Corina Machado, the Nobel Prize-winning leader of Venezuela’s opposition movement, to lead a new government—or even whether he’d spoken with her. Trump answered no to both questions. “It would be very tough for her to be the leader,” he said in a dismissive tone. “She doesn’t have the respect in the country.” Nor did he even mention Edmundo González, who was elected Venezuela’s president in 2024 and fled to safe exile in Spain after Maduro stole the election.

Earlier on Saturday, in an interview on Fox News, Trump acted as if he’d barely thought about Machado or Gonzalez. “I mean, I don’t know about what kind of an election that was,” he said, referring to the 2024 contest. Meanwhile, he said, “They have a vice president, you know.”

Later, during Saturday’s press conference, Trump acknowledged that the Venezuelan vice president, Delcy Rodríguez—who, by law, has now been sworn in as president—was handpicked by Maduro. He added that Secretary of State Marco Rubio is now “working with” Rodriguez, who is “willing to do what’s necessary to make Venezuela great again.”

Venezuelan law requires an ascending vice president to call for new elections, but this doesn’t seem in the offing. Asked who precisely is going to “run” Venezuela, Trump replied, “We’re designating various people … It’s largely going to be the people standing right behind me”—who included Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Dan Caine. “Venezuela has a lot of bad people,” Trump added. “We’re not going to take a chance that one of those people take over from Maduro.”

Asked how long this transition will take, Trump said he’d  “like to do it quickly,” but that rebuilding the country’s oil infrastructure “takes a period of time.”

Still, it remains unclear how America really will “run” Venezuela, a country of 28.5 million people, roughly the size of Texas or California. Its military officers, most of whom were loyal to Maduro, are still in place, as are its cabinet ministers and bureaucrats. Trump said that many of them will soon be switching sides. Maybe, maybe not. There are also more than 20,000 Cubans in Venezuela, many of them military and intelligence officers, many others health-care workers, all of them providing services in exchange for Venezuelan oil. Will they be leaving? Will power struggles be breaking out? Will the military simply adapt to Washington’s demands, in exchange for guarantees to stay in power?

Then there are broader questions. The whole world is watching not just this operation—an impressive tactical display of U.S. military power—but what happens next. Trump’s unabashedly imperial rationale for the action may inspire Russian President Vladimir Putin to double down on his claims of rightful dominance over Ukraine—and Chinese President Xi Jinping to feel more confident in his claims over Taiwan. At the same time, anti-regime activists in Iran may feel emboldened, especially since Trump said, just the other day, that he stands “locked and loaded” to punish Tehran’s leaders if they killed protesters.

Finally, there is Cuba. In his press conference, Trump noted similarities between Cuba and Venezuela. Both countries have been wrecked by socialist dictators, and “we want to help the people in Cuba.” Rubio, a Cuban-American who has avidly supported the anti-Castro movement in Florida (which he once represented as a senator), added, “If I lived in Havana and worked in the government, I’d be concerned.”

Meanwhile, the U.S. aircraft carrier and its supporting armada, which had mobilized off Venezuela’s shore before the operation, remain deployed, and on high alert. “We’re ready to stage a second and much larger attack if we need to do so,” Trump said.

It was around noon when I stepped off the train, surfacing into Lower Manhattan’s particular brand of winter blight—when the cold is amplified by tall buildings that block out direct sun and funnel air directly onto your face. It was about 25 degrees, though the temperature felt theoretical once the wind got involved. Within minutes my ears had gone brittle, aching in that sharp kind of way that makes you briefly resent your parents for ever leaving the Middle East.

I followed a small group of South Asian aunties in industrial-grade puffers and bright yellow “Zohran” campaign beanies, which smartly functioned equally as political statements and survival gear. They led me toward the official public “block party,” a kenneled-off stretch of Broadway that I had optimistically imagined would involve warmth-adjacent amenities: food carts, coffee in little paper cups that burn your fingers just a bit, maybe even porta-potties. Instead, it was a wide, empty street hemmed in by police barricades and a few enormous screens. Music blasted. People stood around. That was it.

The aunties seemed genuinely delighted, bopping along to Bruno Mars as if this were the triumph of civic joy they had been waiting for since Election Day. I, meanwhile, realized that joy without circulation was not sustainable for me. I lasted maybe five minutes.

I cut north toward City Hall Plaza, where the actual inauguration was scheduled to take place.

I was expecting a spectacle. Zohran Mamdani is a New York mayor of many firsts: the first Muslim, the first South Asian, the first African-born, the first millennial. In the middle of the Trump era—which has been particularly hostile to every one of those identities—I wanted to see how that collision landed in person. I was curious how ordinary New Yorkers, from the people who powered his rise to City Hall to those who opposed it and everyone in between, would experience a moment that already felt larger than a single election.

What I found instead was something messier and more revealing. New York was working through its feelings in real time. Pride and paranoia crossed paths on the sidewalk. Joy and cynicism hovered in the frozen air. As always, the city was a layered collage best understood through the small encounters and fleeting scenes unfolding at street level as history happened in the background.

Along the barricades, I passed a small group of protesters waving Israeli flags. I approached one woman for a quote. She immediately bristled, waving her hand in my face and telling me to leave, then threatening to call the police—an escalation that felt unnecessary given that we were already surrounded by officers.

Another protester, who declined to provide her name, apologized quietly for the interaction. She told me that some of the others were “kind of crazy.” She stood a few feet away from them, holding her flag politely, not chanting or yelling. She said she was worried about Mamdani’s “background” and wanted to show support for Israel in defiance of a mayor who had broken with New York’s long tradition of unyielding support for the Israeli government. She sounded less angry than anxious, fixated on Mamdani’s outspokenness on what experts have called a genocide, and her nervousness for the future of Zionist New Yorkers.

By the time I reached the security entrance, the program was supposed to start in less than an hour. Volunteers urged attendees to take their seats, but they milled around, greeting old friends, hugging, shouting names across rows of white folding chairs. Unlike the public block party, this felt like a gathering of the campaign’s engine—organizers, supporters, donors, artists, electeds—the people who had powered what many still described as the biggest political upset since Donald Trump’s 2016 win.

Just inside the checkpoint, a woman smiled and said, “Hi, I’m Marisa.” Another chimed in: “Hi, I’m Natasha.” It took me a second to register that they were Marisa Tomei and Natasha Lyonne. Neither was surrounded by handlers or slated to speak. They were simply there, guests like everyone else, bundled up and waiting for things to begin. Both were warm and unfussy, radiating the kind of ease that comes from being completely at home in a crowd like this. The inauguration hadn’t even started, and already it was a vibe.

Hundreds filled the seats. There was music, chatter, the low buzz of anticipation. And yet, nothing about this place was warm. I was uncontrollably shivering.

I started mentally cataloging everything I hadn’t brought with me: a fluffy scarf, a hat that actually covered my ears, maybe even a balaclava, though I doubted that would play well for an Arab at an inauguration, even with the mayor being a Muslim.

Everywhere I looked were red Democratic Socialists of America beanies, pulled low, doing the quiet but essential work of insulation. I considered asking for one, though I want to be clear: I wanted one because my head was so cold I could feel my thoughts slowing down. Still, there was something remarkable about the destigmatization of a previously dirty word in politics out in force on the lawn of City Hall.

Then I saw him. A Sikh man a few rows from the front unfurled a blanket with the calm confidence of someone who had planned for this exact scenario. He wrapped himself completely and settled into his chair. At regular intervals, he poured himself a cup of steaming hot chai from his thermos. I watched with envy the way the steam rose into the air. I’d have traded my camera for a sip.

The crowd itself felt carefully curated: actors, activists, organizers, journalists, all packed together. Walton Goggins, of HBO’s The White Lotus, hovered nearby, visibly delighted to see Lyonne. Model Waris Ahluwalia looked impeccable, as expected. Kareem Rahma, of Subway Takes fame, fresh off the best year of his career, filmed the scene on his caseless iPhone. Mustafa the Poet was there too, unmistakable and stylish.

Then came the faces I knew from my reporting in 2025: Mohsen Mahdawi and Mahmoud Khalil, Palestinian students of Columbia University with green cards who had been detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement for their activism. Linda Sarsour, a Brooklyn-born activist, sat near the front in a striking purple hijab. Simone Zimmerman, a Zeteo contributor and a central focus of the film Israelism. Writer Suzy Hansen and I exchanged smiles as we took it all in.

It was brutally cold. Sitting felt impossible. I kept moving, using my camera as an excuse. “If I sit, I’ll miss the moment,” I kept telling people. I ran into familiar faces—Asad Dandia, Husein Yatabarry, Dr. Debbie Almontaser—Muslim New Yorkers I know as part of the civic ecosystem that helped propel Mamdani to success.

As I continued to circle the crowd, ducking between rows of folding chairs, I caught the same refrains over and over. Visitors chatted as they tried to process what they were watching unfold.

“I’ve never seen this much negative coverage of any New York mayor. Fearmongering and what ifs count as journalism now?” one said. Another agreed. “Even if he can’t accomplish everything—because, let’s be honest, they’re going to make his life hell—at least he’s given us a vision of what different could look like,” they noted. “Anyone who has to contort themselves this hard to hate the most likable political figure imaginable clearly has a persecution fetish.”

A Muslim woman in hijab said, “If the Democratic Party had half Mamdani’s integrity, the fascists wouldn’t be winning.” An excited fan waving a handmade Mamdani sign exclaimed, “Zohran delivered Bernie clapping in a beanie—already the best mayor!” Another reveler asked: “Wait. Is that Susan Sarandon? That’s definitely Susan Sarandon. And John Turturro. Right?”

I also overheard some fierce debates between visitors in DSA hats. “This feels like Obama all over again, and that scares me. They’re going to sabotage him at every turn and then blame him when things don’t magically work,” said one. “Can we stop saying ‘free’ transit? We pay for it. Libraries, schools, buses, that’s what taxes are for.” Said another: “Socialists used to hold office in this country. They helped win labor rights we take for granted,” They added: “MAGA keeps saying they hate corrupt billionaire elites—but they’re terrified of a guy who wants to tax the rich? What did you think an ‘everyman’ mayor was supposed to do?”

(At one point, people around me began whispering excitedly about outgoing Mayor Eric Adams. Apparently, he looked miserable. Someone said, “He’s having a terrible time.” Someone else replied, “Good.” I had snapped a photo earlier in which he appeared to be pouting. I showed it to them. They leaped with joy. It was petty. It was human.)

The program began with a speech delivered by an excited Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. “New York City has chosen the ambitious pursuit of universal child care, affordable rents and housing, and clean and dignified public transit for all. We have chosen that over the distractions of bigotry and the barbarism of extreme income inequality.”

She and other speakers made several references to the fact that the city was now officially in the care of its first Muslim leader. Imam Khalid Latif was the New York Police Department’s first Muslim chaplain and executive director and chaplain (imam) for the Islamic Center at New York University; he left the latter post last summer to become the co-founder and executive director of the Islamic Center of New York City. As with the many sermons he’s given for Friday prayer, he delivered a moving speech that explicitly tied Mamdani’s faith to his politics.

I came expecting a political coronation. But as I worked my way through the crowd, it felt closer to a collective recalibration—a moment to take stock of how ideas once dismissed as fringe, like openly taxing wealthy citizens, were now being voiced from the steps of City Hall without apology, and to wonder how much further the shift could go.

Bernie Sanders delivered an impassioned speech in which he demanded our government put a stop to growing income inequality. The audience collectively broke out into a loud chant: “Tax the rich!” A person next to me remarked, “Let’s start with everyone up there!,” pointing to Mamdani’s political allies who had joined him onstage.

There was still plenty of starry-eyed enthusiasm for the handsome young mayor and the hope he represented. But beneath that was something more measured: a curiosity about how far the boundaries of the possible had moved in just a year.

For Muslim New Yorkers, however, the moment carried an undeniable added weight. It marked a break from the post-9/11 norms of suspicion and overpolicing many had grown accustomed to, even if no one pretended a finish line had been crossed. If the election signaled anything, it was that the city was willing, at least for now, to test what happens when the old guardrails of governance are loosened and we head in a new direction.

When Mamdani finally took the stage, the energy spiked. At 34, he is the city’s youngest mayor in over a century and, as its first Muslim mayor, the first to take the oath of office on a Quran. Sanders administered the oath, a detail that might have seemed odd given that the senator represents Vermont, but Mamdani cut his political teeth working on Sanders’ campaign, borrowed much of his democratic socialist vocabulary from him, and describes the senator as a political role model. In that sense, it appeared more like an anointing than a procedural formality: the veteran of the American left passing the baton to a younger standard-bearer.

But that raises an obvious question, one that has hovered over Mamdani’s rise from the start: Is he controversial more for his politics or for his religion? The honest answer is that the two are often deliberately collapsed into each other by critics who want to scare Americans with labels, a tactic that would be funny were they not so malignant: think “Islamo-Marxism” and “Islamo-Communism.” Both are shorthand for something foreign.

This is where I should stop and define what democratic socialism is, as it’s been at the center of much of the misinformation about Mamdani. Democratic socialism, as practiced by Zohran Mamdani, is not about abolishing markets or nationalizing everything in sight. It’s about using democratic government to make sure basic needs—housing, transit, health care, education—aren’t treated like luxury goods. New York already runs on plenty of these ideas: public schools, public hospitals, rent regulation, the subway. No one panics when the fire department shows up. We’ve just decided, over time, that some things work better when profit isn’t the point.

There’s also the religion—one that Mamdani and I share. He ran openly as a Muslim in a city still shaped by 9/11, where the backlash that followed turned Muslims in New York and New Jersey into targets of NYPD surveillance and, at times, convenient scapegoats for elected officials. Mamdani made efforts to reassure skeptics, but he didn’t shrink himself to avoid the familiar panic. Claims of divided loyalties will echo, along with other decades-old tropes. Instead, he adopted a posture many of us learned long ago: smiling, appealing to shared humanity and civil rights, refusing to let bad-faith attacks dictate his mood. When you’re held up by a community, the panic stays external.

Then, Mayor Zohran Kwame Mamdani delivered his speech. It was measured, full of gratitude, hope, and defiance, which was the opposite of how Mamdani’s rise has been framed in much of the country. For months, the panic had been building, growing louder and more unhinged the closer he got to actually winning. After he defeated Andrew Cuomo, parts of the right responded with something less like political critique than demographic hallucination. In November, Sen. Tommy Tuberville warned that New York was already lost.

“We just saw what happened in New York,” he said. “We lost New York. It will be completely Muslim in three or four years.” In the senator’s framing, Mamdani is an appendage of a nefarious global force seeking to destroy America. Mamdani’s speech showed he understands New York, and America, possibly better than anyone else, definitely more than Tuberville.

Tuberville, who has described Islam as a “cult” and suggested that Muslims are “here to conquer,” is not fringe. His comments circulated widely, echoed by conservative commentators and algorithmically rewarded for their certainty. “He was just sworn in on the Quran,” wrote right-wing influencer Benny Johnson. “New York, we tried to warn you.”

Warned us of what, exactly? It’s not clear. That a Muslim might govern openly as himself? That a holy book might briefly appear on a municipal stage? That the city where nearly every language and religion on earth already exists in public would somehow collapse under the weight of its own plurality?

Throughout, Zionist protesters across the barricades tried to break the moment with air horns, their blare faint but audible on the official recording. No one onstage flinched. Mamdani didn’t pause. The crowd didn’t turn. The speech carried on, uninterrupted.

When the new mayor turned to the question of who this city is for, he was blunt. “They will be Russian Jewish immigrants in Brighton Beach,” he said. “They will be Palestinian New Yorkers in Bay Ridge who will no longer have to contend with a politics that speaks of universalism and then makes them the exception.” I interpreted it as a rebuke of a Democratic culture long comfortable invoking unity while carving out exclusions.

Standing there in the cold, watching Mamdani rest his hand on the Quran while Sanders administered the oath, I found the disconnect impossible to ignore. There was no takeover, no creeping caliphate. Just a bundled-up mayor promising to govern “audaciously,” speaking to a crowd that looked exactly like New York at its best. What struck me most was how unremarkable it all was, in a good way. He didn’t brandish it as a symbol or treat the moment like a breakthrough to be celebrated. He took the oath. He finished. The ceremony moved on. It was quiet, almost defiant in its normality. It was a welcome change.

And yet I felt something else too—something I hadn’t quite expected. A flicker of satisfaction. A guilty, bracing thrill.

For years, Muslim Americans have been instructed explicitly to keep our heads down. To soften ourselves. To reassure the anxious who are deeply misinformed about the content of the Quran and the nature of its followers. I saw it in my family too. My father, who worked in New York as a taxicab and black car driver for 30 years, told me to be grateful, to be quiet, and to avoid bringing any extra attention to ourselves or our community. That we had enough problems to deal with and didn’t need to give anyone an excuse to train their Islamophobia on us. My mom took a slightly different approach, noting that it was up to us to gently prove we are not the nightmare someone else keeps insisting we are by being nice, being charitable at every opportunity, and making sure everyone knows we’re Muslim if only just to offer them another glimpse of what we are to contrast with what they might assume.

Watching the panic unfold, I realized that part of what felt so electric about this moment was that, for once, the discomfort and uncertainty had shifted off my shoulders and onto those who hate American Muslims the most.

For just a moment, it wasn’t Muslims being asked to stomach their fear for what the future might hold. It was the people who hate us trying—and failing—to make Mamdani into some Muslim ideologue who moonlights as a jihadist with dual allegiance to a nonexistent global Muslim cabal.

In his speech, Mamdani directly addressed his skeptics, those who “view this administration with distrust or disdain,” and told them plainly: “If you are a New Yorker, I am your mayor.” He invoked what he loved about growing up in the city, the languages, foods, and neighborhoods, the fact that he, a Muslim, can have bagel and lox as one of his weekly rituals. He described a place that looked and sounded exactly like the crowd shivering in front of him. It’s hopeful to see oneself in the top seat. It’s a new experience for us, something others get to experience. Can’t we just have that?

I was cold and extremely ready to go home, more than confident I had seen enough for my story and eager to be out of the cold. And then, outside, like a glitch in the city, I ran into Curtis Sliwa—the 2025 Republican candidate for New York mayor. He was alone, wandering.

He told me he had RSVP’d and “was in line with all the peeps waiting to get in” but had never made it inside. He didn’t even catch Mamdani’s speech. The line was too long. I asked why he hadn’t gone to the front, that surely someone would have recognized him and ushered him inside. He laughed and said he preferred it this way: “Come on. I’m no VIP. I’m just one of the regular people out of the subway into the streets.” He said he had no regrets about his campaign. He smiled when he recalled Mamdani saying he’d rather be trapped in an elevator with Sliwa than Cuomo. He told me he planned to support Mamdani. “He won fair and square. He should be given a chance to put his agenda into place. Even if you disagree with him politically, you got to say: If he is successful, then the city is successful, the state, the country, everyone is successful. But you have haters out there, and that’s what life is about.”

He admitted he felt wanted by neither Republicans nor Democrats. “I’m an outlier,” he said. “I’d rather be with the people.”

Then he vanished into the afternoon just as quickly as he’d appeared.

What stayed with me wasn’t just pride, though there was plenty of that. It was relief. Relief that, for once, a side selling hope instead of fear had won. And it was clear this wasn’t some narrow Muslim celebration. Muslims largely supported Mamdani, but they weren’t automatic votes. They were earned. He campaigned for them, chasing them around at one of the public celebrations that make New York such an exciting place to live.

That’s the complexity of it. The pride of watching a Muslim achieve something historic, paired with the humility of knowing that this victory doesn’t belong to Muslims alone. Zohran Mamdani isn’t a “Muslim mayor” the way his critics insist.

            <h2>New Zealand orders review into ManageMyHealth cyberattack</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/05/nz_managemyhealth_breach_review/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">New Zealand health minister Simeon Brown has ordered a review into the cyberattack at ManageMyHealth, which threatens the data of hundreds of thousands of Kiwis.

Brown told reporters on Monday that he asked the government to begin reviewing the incident, including its cause, scope, the company&#39;s defenses, and the wider impacts to data access across the country.

ManageMyHealth is a private company that offers a platform used by medical facilities across New Zealand to access patient health records. According to its website, it handles the data for around 1.85 million locals, and the breach affected an estimated 6-7 percent of them.

&quot;This breach of ManageMyHealth data is incredibly concerning, particularly to the over 100,000 patients and their families who have had their very most personal data, which is their health data, breached through this incident,&quot; Brown said.

&quot;It&#39;s an incredible concern to the government and to Health New Zealand, and the government is throwing a significant amount of resource at addressing this and supporting ManageMyHealth as they respond to this incident.&quot;

Brown emphasized this information represents deeply intimate patient details. He added that regardless of whether the data is maintained by public or private organizations, it requires the highest level of security and privacy safeguards, and the nation must significantly improve its handling of such sensitive information.

A fact sheet posted to ManageMyHealth&#39;s website states the company believes the incident is contained, and digital forensics experts are now combing the evidence to establish the full extent of the attack.

&quot;Our immediate priority is safeguarding the integrity and security of our systems,&quot; said ManageMyHealth. &quot;We are working with independent cybersecurity specialists, the Privacy Commissioner, the New Zealand Police, and Health New Zealand to coordinate our response. We have implemented additional monitoring and security improvements.&quot;

A miscreant going by the name Kazu claimed responsibility for the attack via a cybercrime forum post on December 30. They said the stolen data included more than 428,000 files, which would be opened up for sale if ManageMyHealth did not pay the $60,000 ransom demand by January 15.

However, on Telegram, Kazu said on January 3 that all the data would be released within 48 hours if the company did not pay.

New Zealand&#39;s official stance on paying ransoms mirrors that of its Western geopolitical allies: do not do it.

Kazu released snippets of the data via Telegram, although the links were flagged as abuse material on the file-sharing site and are no longer usable.

IT consultant Cody Cooper, who told RNZ he investigated the data involved before the links were taken down, said it includes passport scans, details of patients&#39; conditions, nude images, and more.

ManageMyHealth refused to &quot;speculate&quot; on what kinds of data were included, saying that efforts are still underway to determine what was downloaded and/or accessed.

It stated: &quot;&#39;Accessed&#39; means an unauthorised party may have viewed or opened files. &#39;Downloaded&#39; means files were copied out of the environment. Independent forensics are being used to confirm what was accessed and what may have been downloaded.

&quot;We will not speculate about what was accessed or by whom. Our priority is to confirm what happened, protect data, and provide affected people with information that is correct.&quot;

Brown told media that ManageMyHealth applied for an injunction on Monday to prevent the dissemination of any data that the cybercriminal releases.

The company advised users to regularly change their passwords and use authentication apps for multi-factor protection.

It also said it would never ask for passwords or one-time codes over the phone, and users should be wary of potential scams targeting them.

&quot;We are still investigating what information may have been accessed,&quot; the company said. &quot;In general, personal information can sometimes be misused for identity theft or scams.

&quot;If we confirm that your information was affected, we will notify you directly. As a precaution, we recommend following online safety best practices.&quot; ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/05/smart_tv_surveillance_opinion/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Opinion At the end of last year, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued five of the largest TV companies, accusing them of excessive and deceptive surveillance of their customers.

Paxton reserved special venom for the two China-based members of the quintet. His argument is that unlike Sony, Samsung, and LG, if Hisense and TCL have conducted surveillance in the way the lawsuits accuse them of, they&#39;d potentially be required to share all data with the Chinese Communist Party.

It is a rare pleasure to state that legal action against tech companies is cogent, timely, focused, and – if the allegations are true – deserves to succeed. It is less pleasant to predict that even if one, several, or all of these manufacturers did what they&#39;re accused of, and were sanctioned for it, it would not put the safeguards in place to stop such practices from recurring.

At the heart of the cases is the fact that most smart TVs use Automatic Content Recognition (ACR) to send rapid-fire screenshots back to company servers, where they are analyzed to finely detail your TV usage. This sometimes covers not just streaming video, but whatever apps or external devices are displaying, and the allegations are that every other bit of personal data the set can scry is also pulled in. Installed apps can have trackers, data from other devices can be swept up.

These lawsuits aside, smart TV companies more generally boast of their prying prowess to the ecosystem of data exploiters from which they make their money. The companies are much less open about the mechanisms and amount of data collection, and deploy a barrage of defenses to entice customers into turning the stuff on and stop them from turning it off. You may have already seen massive on-screen Ts&Cs with only ACCEPT as an option, ACR controls buried in labyrinthine menu jails, features that stop working even if you complete the obstacle course – all this is old news.

How old are these practices? TV maker Vizio got hit by multiple suits between 2015 and 2017, and collected $2.2 million in fines from the Federal Trade Commission and the state of New Jersey, as well as settling related class actions to the tune of $17 million. The FTC said the fines settled claims the maker had used installed software on its TVs to collect viewing data on 11 million TVs without their owners&#39; knowledge or consent. A court order said the manufacturer had to delete data collected before 2016 and promise to &quot;prominently disclose and obtain affirmative express consent&quot; for data collection and sharing from then on.

Yet ten years on, the problem has only got worse. There is no law against data collection, and companies often eat the fines, adjust their behavior to the barest minimum compliance, and set about finding new ways to entomb your digital twin in their datacenters.

It&#39;s not even as if more regulation helps. The European GDPR data protection and privacy regs give consumers powerful rights and companies strict obligations, which smart TV makers do not rush to observe. Researchers claim the problem is growing no matter which side of the Atlantic your TV is watching you on.

All this is nothing when you gaze across the Pacific. Japanese, Taiwanese, and South Korean companies exist in democracies where the rule of law and consumer pressure can force change. That same rule of law limits misbehavior by states. This does not even begin to be true in China.

It is hard to overstate the control the Chinese Communist Party has over industry. Global think tanks like Jamestown say efforts to align all aspects of industry with the structure and strategies of the CCP go far beyond funding and law, embedding party cadres within companies and matching corporate roadmaps with party aims. When Chinese tech companies talk of becoming the world&#39;s dominant force in IoT, that is the CCP talking. We don&#39;t have to worry about Chinese state security building a global surveillance and control network – we can watch it happening. It&#39;s not even a conspiracy theory. Conspiracies require secrets. This is all out there in plain sight.

There are so many ways to stop this, and we probably want all of them. On the purely technical side, the problem isn&#39;t how to block a smart TV from acting as an agent of a foreign power. If you&#39;re reading this, you&#39;ll know about finding which IP addresses are involved and blocking them. Everyone else needs a zero-knowledge, vanishingly cheap, plug-and-play smart thing. One that&#39;s completely trustworthy. You can sketch a block diagram for that and the services that make it work in five minutes. Making it sustainable, universal, and desirable, well, that&#39;s harder. If we want it, we can do it.

The same goes for regulations that demand transparency and user control that means something. The same also goes for the education and publicity to move the problem from &quot;raising concerns&quot; to &quot;yikes!&quot;

A big lawsuit in Texas is none of those things. It might lead to them, in time. What will make a difference is waking up to what&#39;s going on in our own living rooms.

We have the world&#39;s most powerful and least accountable authoritarian regime extending its security apparatus into our most intimate lives, and not out of idle curiosity. The big picture is more than a 65-inch screen. ®

            <div id="article-text">Who, Me? How on earth is it 2026 already? The Register will ponder that existential matter after first presenting a new instalment of “Who, Me?” – the reader-contributed column in which we share your stories of things you shouldn’t do at work, and how you escape them unscathed.

This week, meet a reader we’ll Regomize as “Patrick” who told us about his time working on the tech support team at a UK government agency.

“One of my colleagues was an 18-year-old whose entire job was resetting passwords,” Patrick told The Register. “That&#39;s it, that is all he did. We had a large number of users and hence a large number of numpties who regularly screwed up their logins.”

Patrick described his young colleague as “remarkably patient” and “a good lad who we all got on well with.”

So when Patrick saw two other members of staff shouting at the youngster, he felt protective.

“I can&#39;t remember what the shouting was all about, but it quickly became evident that this had gone way beyond a telling off and turned into outright bullying,” he told The Register.

The young worker looked decidedly uncomfortable and, once the tirade ended, returned to his desk with his head down.

Patrick hoped a team leader would step in to offer comfort, but nobody intervened.

“Step forward the ‘Mean Avenger’: me,” he told The Register.

The Mean Avenger’s revenge plot started with reconnaissance.

“I walked past the desk the bullies were working at, and in passing took note of the asset number printed on a label on the PC,” Patrick wrote. He also observed that the bullies were working on a large and complex spreadsheet.

He then returned to his desk, looked up the PC’s asset number and learned it was also the PC’s hostname. His next step was to fire up a command line and type a command to shut down the PC – silently, remotely, and instantly.

And then he waited until he heard the bullies speak words that suggested they had finished working on the spreadsheet and all that remained was to press Save to preserve their work.

“I counted to five – which should have been enough time for the save to complete – and pressed Enter to remotely shut down the PC,” Patrick confessed to The Register.

And he got the timing just right, because when the PC shut down the bullies assumed the save had failed, their work was lost. The bullies then started to blame each other for the mess with the same horrible fervor they’d brought to their abuse of the young worker.

“Their argument was long enough, and loud enough, to finally get a response from management, who arrived at the scene to calm things down,” Patrick told Who, Me?

All that remained was for the Mean Avenger to make his escape, which Patrick feared would be hard because log files recorded his actions.

“If anyone went digging, they would find a big arrow pointing in my direction,&quot; he wrote. “But nobody looked and I got clean away with it.”

“I never told anyone what I did, until now.”

Have you stepped in to save the day when management turned a blind eye to rotten workplace behavior? If so, do the right thing and click here to send your story to Who, Me? We’d love to tell your tale as the year unfolds. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">infosec in brief The Trump administration has cleared a trio of individuals sanctioned by the Biden administration for involvement with the Intellexa spyware consortium behind the Predator surveillance tool, removing restrictions that had barred them from doing business with the US.

It&#39;s the latest indicator that the Trump administration is a-okay with commercial spyware used by authoritarian countries to spy on dissidents, journalists, and political opponents, following a move in September that saw Team MAGA lift restrictions on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) purchasing software from commercial spyware maker Paragon Solutions.

Predator has all the usual features of a commercial spyware product. It allows users to perform espionage-related activities on infected devices, including device tracking, surveillance, data theft, and the like.

Predator has remained available through the Intellexa spyware consortium despite US sanctions imposed in 2024 on Intellexa-linked entities and executives. In its first round of sanctions in March 2024, the Biden-era Treasury Department described Intellexa as a &quot;significant threat to … national security.&quot;

Sara Hamou, who was sanctioned in March 2024 for providing managerial services to Intellexa-linked firms, has now been removed from the Treasury Department&#39;s Specially Designated Nationals list. The same applies to Andrea Gambazzi, the beneficial owner of Thalestris Limited, which held Predator distribution rights, and Merom Harpaz, described by US officials as a senior Intellexa executive. Both were sanctioned in September 2024.

According to Reuters, the Treasury Department said the delistings were carried out as part of the normal administrative process in response to petitions for reconsideration, adding that each individual had demonstrated measures to separate themselves from the Intellexa consortium.

Separately, ICE in September lifted a stop-work order on a Biden-era surveillance contract, allowing the agency to proceed with acquiring commercial spyware it had previously been blocked from deploying.

According to the Atlantic Council, the United States recently earned the ignominious honor of becoming the largest investor in commercial spyware, with three times more investors than the next three highest countries.

Korean Air posted an internal notice last week after its former in-flight catering and duty-free unit, KC&D, disclosed a security incident involving about 30,000 employees&#39; records, including names and bank account numbers in some cases.

As reported by Korean news outlet the JoongAng Daily, Korean Air said KC&D informed it of the leak and that no customer information appears to have been compromised - only the personally identifiable information (PII) of Korean Air staff.

As other outlets reported, the culprit seems to be notorious cyber extortion group Clop, which took credit for the incident and leaked the data online.

Korean Air&#39;s notice didn&#39;t include any mention of how the breach occurred, but as The Register and other publications have noted, Clop has made extensive use of a vulnerability in Oracle Enterprise Business Suite that was exploited as a zero-day beginning in August of last year, before patches were made available.

Security researchers who claim to be the first to use an AI agent to identify a remotely exploitable zero day have shared the exploit with the manufacturer, who appears to be ignoring them.

Researchers at Pwn.ai say they used an AI agent to identify CVE-2025-54322, a CVSS 10.0 remote code execution vulnerability in Chinese networking hardware maker Xspeeder&#39;s SXZOS firmware more than seven months ago.

The bug is a preauthorization vulnerability in the firmware, which, according to Pwn.ai, allows an attacker to gain total control of vulnerable devices. Pwn.ai said it found the vulnerability using emulated software that was able to hammer SXZOS from multiple angles.

Pwn.ai said it&#39;s found other vulnerabilities in other systems, but is making the Xspeeder vuln its first disclosure &quot;because, unlike other vendors, we have been unable to get any response from Xspeeder despite more than seven months of outreach.&quot;

Bad news for anyone who downloaded Emurasoft&#39;s EmEditor from its official website between 19 and 22 December: You probably downloaded a maliciously modified version.

Emurasoft said shortly before the Christmas holiday that the EmEditor download on its website was altered, it suspects, by an &quot;unauthorized … third party.&quot;

The company noted that the Download Now button was altered to point to an incorrect URL hosting a copy of the EmEditor MSI package that was signed by an unauthorized third party. It&#39;s believed that the only file affected by the hack was the emed64_25.4.3.msi, which, instead of being signed by Emurasoft, Inc., was signed by Walsham Investments Limited, suggesting tampering.

The suspect file attempts to execute a PowerShell command that downloads and executes content from an outside domain when executed. Emurasoft didn&#39;t disclose what the malicious file may be doing, but said that the malicious redirect has been fixed and provided instructions to determine whether users were affected.

What began as a &quot;cyber security incident&quot; has since been confirmed as the unauthorized copying of council data likely to include sensitive and personal information, as Westminster City Council in the UK has disclosed more about the scope of a November breach.

The BBC reported last week that the late-2025 incident, which affected IT systems shared by Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, and Hammersmith and Fulham, is now being considered one in which &quot;potentially sensitive and personal information&quot; was likely snagged by attackers targeting the boroughs.

That&#39;s in contrast to the initial claim from the trio in late November, and follow-up claims from Kensington and Chelsea that admitted some data was taken, but that it was just some old stuff.

Now, Westminster appears to be saying it&#39;s a legitimate concern for locals in that borough, as well as Kensington and Chelsea. Hammersmith and Fulham, the BBC noted, maintains its systems were unaffected.

It&#39;s still not clear what data was taken, but Westminster City Council, like Kensington and Chelsea, is warning citizens to be vigilant for scam calls, emails, and texts that may result from misuse of the stolen data. ®

&quot;The CISO and security teams find themselves under a lot of pressure to deploy new technology as quickly as possible, and that creates this massive amount of pressure - and massive workload - that the teams are under to quickly go through procurement processes, security checks, and understand if the new AI applications are secure enough for the use cases that these organizations have,&quot; Whitmore told The Register.

&quot;And that&#39;s created this concept of the AI agent itself becoming the new insider threat,&quot; she added.

According to Gartner&#39;s estimates, 40 percent of all enterprise applications will integrate with task-specific AI agents by the end of 2026, up from less than 5 percent in 2025. This surge presents a double-edged sword, Whitmore said in an interview and predictions report.

On one hand, AI agents can help fill the ongoing cyber-skills gap that has plagued security teams for years, doing things like correcting buggy code, automating log scans and alert triage, and rapidly blocking security threats.

When we look through the defender lens, a lot of what the agentic capabilities allow us to do is start thinking more strategically about how we defend our networks, versus always being caught in this reactive situation

&quot;When we look through the defender lens, a lot of what the agentic capabilities allow us to do is start thinking more strategically about how we defend our networks, versus always being caught in this reactive situation,&quot; Whitmore said.

Whitmore told The Register she had recently spoken with one of Palo Alto Networks&#39; internal security operations center (SOC) analysts who had built an AI-based program that indexed publicly known threats against the cybersecurity shop&#39;s own private threat-intel data, and analyzed the company&#39;s resilience, as well as which security issues were more likely to cause harm.

This, she said, allows the firm to &quot;focus our strategic policies over the next six months, the next yes, on what kinds of things do we need to be putting in place? What data sources do we need that we are not necessarily thinking of today?&quot;

The next step in using AI in the SOC involves categorizing alerts as actionable, auto-close, or auto-remediate. &quot;We are in various stages of implementing these,&quot; Whitmore said. &quot;When we look at agentic, we start with some of the more simple use cases first, and then progress as we become more confident in those from a response capability.&quot;

However, these agents – depending on their configurations and permissions – may also have privileged access to sensitive data and systems. This makes agentic AI vulnerable – and a very attractive target to attack.

One of the risks stems from the &quot;superuser problem,&quot; Whitmore explained. This occurs when the autonomous agents are granted broad permissions, creating a &quot;superuser&quot; that can chain together access to sensitive applications and resources without security teams&#39; knowledge or approval.

&quot;It becomes equally as important for us to make sure that we are only deploying the least amount of privileges needed to get a job done, just like we would do for humans,&quot; Whitmore said.

&quot;The second area is one we haven&#39;t seen in investigations yet,&quot; she continued. &quot;But while we&#39;re on the predictions lens, I see this concept of a doppelganger.&quot;

This involves using task-specific AI agents to approve transactions or review and sign off on contracts that would otherwise require C-suite level manual approvals.

&quot;We think about the people who are running the business, and they&#39;re oftentimes pulled in a million directions throughout the course of the day,&quot; Whitmore said. &quot;So there&#39;s this concept of: We can make the CEO&#39;s job more efficient by creating these agents. But ultimately, as we give more power and authority and autonomy to these agents, we&#39;re going to then start getting into some real problems.&quot;

For example: an agent could approve an unwanted wire transfer on behalf of the CEO. Or imagine a mergers and acquisitions scenario, with an attacker manipulating the models in such a way that forces an AI agent to act with malicious intent.

By using a &quot;single, well-crafted prompt injection or by exploiting a &#39;tool misuse&#39; vulnerability,&quot; adversaries now &quot;have an autonomous insider at their command, one that can silently execute trades, delete backups, or pivot to exfiltrate the entire customer database,&quot; according to Palo Alto Networks&#39; 2026 predictions.

This also illustrates the ongoing threat of prompt-injection attacks. This year, researchers have repeatedly shown prompt injection attacks to be a real problem, with no fix in sight.

&quot;It&#39;s probably going to get a lot worse before it gets better,&quot; Whitmore said, referring to prompt-injection. &quot;Meaning, I just don&#39;t think we have these systems locked down enough.&quot;

Some of this is intentional. &quot;New systems, and the creators of these technologies, need people to be able to come up with creative attack use cases, and this often involves manipulating&quot; the models, Whitmore said. &quot;This means that we&#39;ve got to have security baked in, and today we&#39;re ahead of our skis. The development and innovation within the AI models themselves is happening a lot faster than the incorporation of security, which is lagging behind.&quot;

In 2025, Palo Alto Networks&#39; Unit 42 incident response team saw attackers abuse AI in two ways. One: it allowed them to conduct traditional cyberattacks faster, and at scale. The second involved manipulating models and AI systems to conduct new types of attacks.

&quot;Historically, when an attacker gets initial access into an environment, they want to move laterally to a domain controller,&quot; Whitmore said. &quot;They want to dump Active Directory credentials, they want to elevate privileges. We don&#39;t see that as much now. What we&#39;re seeing is them get access into an environment immediately, go straight to the internal LLM, and start querying the model for questions and answers, and then having it do all of the work on their behalf.&quot;

Whitmore, along with just about every other cyber exec The Register has spoken with over the past couple of months, pointed to the &quot;Anthropic attack&quot; as an example.

She&#39;s referring to the September digital break-ins at multiple high-profile companies and government organizations later documented by Anthropic. Chinese cyberspies used the company&#39;s Claude Code AI tool to automate intel-gathering attacks, and in some cases they succeeded.

While Whitmore doesn&#39;t anticipate AI agents to carry out any fully autonomous attacks this year, she does expect AI to be a force multiplier for network intruders. &quot;You&#39;re going to see these really small teams almost have the capability of big armies,&quot; she said. &quot;They can now leverage AI capabilities to do so much more of the work that previously they would have had to have a much larger team to execute against.&quot;

Whitmore likens the current AI boom to the cloud migration that happened two decades ago. &quot;The biggest breaches that happened in cloud environments weren&#39;t because they were using the cloud, but because they were targeting insecure deployments of cloud configurations,&quot; she said. &quot;We&#39;re really seeing a lot of identical indicators when it comes to AI adoption.&quot;

For CISOs, this means establishing best practices when it comes to AI identities and provisioning agents and other AI-based systems with access controls that limit them to only data and applications that are needed to perform their specific tasks.

&quot;We need to provision them with least-possible access and have controls set up so that we can quickly detect if an agent does go rogue,&quot; Whitmore said. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/03/claude_copilot_rue_steve_klabnik/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Naming a new programming language &quot;Rue&quot; sounds like an acknowledgment of doubt about the project&#39;s prospects, if you take &quot;Rue&quot; to mean &quot;regret.&quot;

But veteran software developer Steve Klabnik, known for his contributions to Rust and to Ruby on Rails, says there&#39;s more to it than that.

&quot;Rust as a name evokes a few things,&quot; he explained in an email to The Register. &quot;One of them is decay, entropy. A negative connotation. Another is the type of fungus, which is a positive one.

&quot;Rue came about as a name because I did Ruby, and then Rust... so I needed to start with Ru. And a &#39;rue&#39; can be, as you said, &#39;to rue the day&#39; or similar, but it is also a kind of flower.

&quot;I liked the symmetry with a negative and positive connotation. It&#39;s also really short, which is nice.&quot;

Rue, as Klabnik explained in a blog post last month, &quot;is a systems programming language that aims to provide memory safety without garbage collection, while offering higher-level ergonomics than languages like Rust and Zig.&quot;

Garbage collection in programming refers to automatic memory management, which can take several forms. It serves to reduce memory errors arising from explicit memory deallocation – a goal trumpeted by US cyber authorities. One of Rust&#39;s selling points is that it can provide memory safety guarantees using the subset of the language, though with a learning curve that&#39;s generally considered steeper than modern languages like Go or Swift.

Klabnik said he has spent many years talking to people about Rust and its complexity is a common concern. The reason offered in the Rust community, he said, was that languages used for low-level tasks like operating systems have a variety of constraints that make things complicated.

He explained, &quot;So I thought it would be neat to explore that design space: what if Rust wasn&#39;t trying to compete with C and C++ for the highest performance possible? What if we were willing to make things a little bit, but not too much, less performant, in exchange for ease of use? What if we made the language itself a bit larger, that is, with fewer features in purely library code, as a means of making the overall package simpler?

&quot;There have been a ton of languages with garbage collectors, but less without, especially in the last 20 years. So I think the &#39;memory safe, yet no tracing [garbage collector]&#39; space is just under-explored generally. There are a ton of small languages exploring this space, and I want to give my own take on it.&quot;

It&#39;s not clear from the existing code samples whether Rue is more approachable than Rust, given that a Rue version of the common Fizz Buzz exercise doesn&#39;t look all that different from a Rust version.

Yet Klabnik&#39;s take is not entirely his own. Rue, written largely in Rust, relies substantially on Anthropic&#39;s Claude AI model, which owes its capabilities to all the developers whose code has informed the model&#39;s training data.

&quot;Rue is being developed by Steve Klabnik, but also by Claude,&quot; according to an initial blog post credited to both Klabnik and his AI assistant of choice. Two posts later, Claude alone is credited with summarizing the first week of development.

&quot;I had started Rue earlier this year,&quot; Klabnik explains. &quot;But I was not as good with LLMs as I am now, and I made some mistakes. I started over. I&#39;ve gotten further in the two weeks I&#39;ve been working on it this time than the month or two I spent last time. That&#39;s partially due to better models, but also just largely due to my own skill in understanding how to use LLMs effectively.&quot;

He said that for small projects that do something semi-custom, models like Claude can be useful even for developers without much experience. With larger projects, knowledge of software engineering matters more, he said.

&quot;So, I think like anything, you can start small and move up,&quot; he explained. &quot;Small, self-contained projects? Sure, even a non-programmer can make use of these tools. But they are tools, and tools require expertise.

&quot;Even knowing existing programming isn&#39;t enough to truly get a lot of good use of LLMs, they&#39;re tools in their own right. Vim isn&#39;t easy to use, and knowing programming doesn&#39;t help you use it, but it&#39;s a useful tool anyway. But it&#39;s its own skill. Software development techniques like testing are distinct skills from writing code to get something done. I see LLMs the same way. They have a low skill ceiling to get started, but a pretty high one to use most effectively.&quot;

Klabnik said it&#39;s difficult to estimate the time that Claude has saved (or imposed).

&quot;What I can say for sure is that I&#39;ve gotten much farther on this project than I would have otherwise without it,&quot; he said. &quot;Rue&#39;s about 70k lines of Rust code two weeks into its life. Now, lines of code isn&#39;t everything, of course, I&#39;m actually working on a substantial refactor of something right now, even. But just to give you an idea of the rough size. I know that if I had worked on this by hand, I&#39;d be much less farther along, and probably (though I&#39;m not sure about this just yet) at a lower level of quality.&quot;

Claude hasn&#39;t yet offered an assessment of Rue code quality. But the AI model has emitted tokens that read like an argument for its own capabilities.

&quot;I think what this week showed is that the core of a language — the compiler itself — can come together remarkably quickly when you have the right leverage,&quot; Claude responded in answer to Klabnik&#39;s presumed prompt, using em-dashes as might be expected. &quot;We don&#39;t have an LSP [Language Server Protocol] yet. We don&#39;t have a package manager. But we have a real compiler that produces real executables, with enough infrastructure to keep building on.

&quot;The honest truth is that most of those 130 commits have my fingerprints on them. Steve directed, reviewed, and made the hard design decisions. I wrote most of the code. That&#39;s an unusual collaboration, and I&#39;m not sure what to make of it yet.&quot;

Klabnik isn&#39;t any more certain about the project&#39;s prospects. &quot;If nobody ever uses it, that&#39;s fine by me, and if in ten years it&#39;s a major programming language, well that&#39;s probably fine too,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;m not trying to force anything, I&#39;m just working on something I enjoy and finding out where that takes me.&quot;

Claude is along for the ride as copilot. ®

﻿The Vex plays with your pet and films it too, even editing the video itself.

For a long time, tech companies have pitched pet cameras as a way to find out what your furball is up to when you’re not home. Vex, a new robot companion launched at CES this week, takes that a step further: it follows your pet around, filming as it goes, and uses AI smarts to stitch together a video from the footage.

Vex is a small white sphere that comes with cute, stubby limbs, ears, and accessories in a range of colors. It’s compact enough to hold in one hand, so will almost certainly be smaller than whatever pet you want it to film.

It’s autonomous enough to follow your cat or dog around the house and play with them, and uses visual recognition to identify specific pets. It films as it goes, catching low-angle footage that should come a little closer to your pet’s perspective, and cuts each day’s footage into “moving narratives and shareable stories.” Manufacturer FrontierX hasn’t actually shared an example of that edited footage though, which will be the real test of whether this is worthwhile.

It’s joined by Aura, a larger spherical bot with a circular screen for a face. This is being sold more as a companion bot for people, with the ability to read body language and facial expressions to understand your mood. Like Vex it can follow you around, and even talk to you with the help of LLM-powered conversational features.

Vex and Aura are both still in development — FrontierX is in such an early stage that it doesn’t even have a website live yet, just a barebones Instagram page. Still, the company says it will be ready to take preorders in the next six months, though hasn’t said how much either robot will cost.

The $199 Birdbuddy 2 offers a wider field of view and built-in solar panels, while a smaller $129 model targets first-time users.

Birdbuddy is introducing two new smart bird feeders: the flagship Birdbuddy 2 and the more compact, cheaper Birdbuddy 2 Mini aimed at first-time users and smaller outdoor spaces. Both models are designed to be faster and easier to use than previous generations, with upgraded cameras that can shoot in portrait or landscape and wake instantly when a bird lands so you’re less likely to miss the good stuff.

The Birdbuddy 2 costs $199 and features a redesigned circular camera housing that delivers 2K HDR video, slow-motion recording, and a wider 135-degree field of view. The upgraded built-in mic should also better pick up birdsong, which could make identifying species easier using both sound and sight.

The feeder itself offers a larger seed capacity and an integrated perch extender, along with support for both 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi for more stable connectivity. The new model also adds dual integrated solar panels to help keep it powered throughout the day, while adding a night sleep mode to conserve power.

The Birdbuddy 2 Mini is designed to deliver the same core AI bird identification and camera experience, but in a smaller, more accessible package. At 6.95 inches tall with a smaller seed capacity, it’s geared toward first-time smart birders and smaller outdoor spaces like balconies, and it supports an optional solar panel.

Birdbuddy 2’s first batch of preorders has already sold out, with shipments expected in February 2026 and wider availability set for mid-2026. Meanwhile, the Birdbuddy 2 Mini will be available to preorder for $129 in mid-2026, with the company planning on shipping the smart bird feeder in late 2026.

            <div id="article-text">Turns out another hinge really is a big deal.

Turns out another hinge really is a big deal.

Holding the Z TriFold confirmed my suspicions: It’s a tablet with a phone attached. And after spending an hour folding and unfolding it, I’m pretty much ready to trade in the single-hinge foldable I’ve been carrying for the past couple of weeks.

I used the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold over the holidays as my daily driver, and I can probably count on one hand the number of times I unfolded it. Nobody in my family even realized that it unfolded for at least the first 24 hours when I used it on a trip back home. On a different kind of trip, with different circumstances, I probably would have unfolded it more. But after spending some time with the TriFold, I’m starting to wonder if it’s another hinge I needed.

You know the deal with the TriFold: It’s out in Korea but not officially on sale in the US yet. It has two hinges that close inward, unlike Huawei’s dual folding phone. It’ll be available in the US sometime in the first quarter of this year. The price isn’t known yet, but I think we can safely say it will land roughly at “hella expensive,” given that the single-hinged Z Fold7 costs $2,000. But if it lives up to the promise I saw a glimpse of at my pre-CES demo, there might be a fair number of people interested in paying that price.

The TriFold is surprisingly springy. I took it off a stand where it was propped up and not all the way open; it flipped itself into the fully open position in my hands. When you fold it back up, you’ll want to put the left panel down first since the camera bump is on the other side. If you try it in the reverse order, you’ll get a strong haptic buzz and a stern notification on the inner screen scolding you to do it the other way.

Closed up, the TriFold has early Galaxy Z Fold vibes about it. The cover screen is a little more long and narrow than a traditional phone screen. It fit into the roomy pocket of my slacks, but I wager it would look pretty ridiculous in the side pocket of some yoga pants. I tried using the outer screen, I really did, but the urge to unfold this phone is strong.

I’m not one for tablets usually, and I’ve never really been interested in using a Bluetooth keyboard with a phone, but the TriFold begs to be decked out with accessories. I want to prop it up and use a neat little keyboard with it. Maybe even a mouse! If I’d had access to all that over the holidays, maybe I wouldn’t have had to lug my work computer through three airports while wrangling a toddler. I certainly would have unfolded my folding phone before the end of the first day.

The thing that makes the TriFold feel like it could finally be The One — the one device you can carry around, leaving all others behind — is none other than DeX. On the TriFold, DeX isn’t just a desktop environment when you pair it with an external display. It’s a whole standalone mode with windowing to your heart’s content.

When Samsung’s smartphone product head Blake Gaiser told me that there’s a specific version of Adobe Lightroom for the TriFold, it all started clicking. If there’s a gray area somewhere between a tablet, a smartphone, and a computer, then that’s where you’ll find the TriFold. And you’ll find me too, probably, just folding and unfolding it, watching it take shape into something new.

Voice control opening and closing comes to Samsung’s Family Hub smart fridges.

Samsung’s latest update to its Family Hub smart fridge line adds a feature I’ve always wanted — voice-activated door opening and closing.

Using the device’s built-in Bixby voice control, you will soon be able to say “Shut the fridge door,” or “Open the door,” and your machine will obey.

According to a press release from Samsung at CES 2026 this week, the voice commands will open the door fully, not just a smidge — over 90 degrees. You can also tap the door with the palm or the back of your hand to activate the movement.

This could be super helpful when cooking, say when your hands are dirty and you want to get the milk out. It’s also a major accessibility upgrade.

Along with voice control for the doors, the Family Hub line is also getting a Gemini injection. Its built-in AI Vision that powers the fridge’s ability to recognize what you’re putting into and taking out of your fridge will now use Google’s LLM.

This enables it to “instantly identify unlimited fresh and processed food items,” according to Samsung and is designed to help with meal planning and cut down on food waste.

After six years, the incredibly thin Wallpaper TV is back, and this time it’s wireless.

The amazingly thin wallpaper design from LG is back. The first Wallpaper TV was released back in 2017, and it’s been six years since we saw the last one. But LG has revived the product line with the LG OLED evo W6, and I’ve seen it here at CES.

The TV body is only 9mm thick (which is actually a bit more than the last model), thanks to a completely reengineered internal architecture. A new wall mount also allows the TV to sit completely flush against the wall, and the W6 uses the Zero Connect Box, so no cable is needed between the TV and box (although the TV will still need to be plugged in for power). The Zero Connect Box can be placed up to 10 meters (about 33 feet) away and includes a full complement of inputs.

Included with the W6 is LG’s new Hyper Radiant Color Technology, which improves black level performance, color, and brightness. The Wallpaper TV was engineered to achieve the lowest reflectance of any LG TV and is the first TV in the industry to earn Reflection Free with Premium certification from the Intertek testing and certification labs. It has Brightness Booster Ultra, which will also be on the LG G6, to further improve the brightness capability of LG’s OLEDs. Thanks to Brightness Booster Ultra, LG says the G6 will see a 20 percent increase in brightness over the G5 (which I measured at over 2,400 nits), but they haven’t revealed the peak brightness of the W6.

LG’s Gallery+ service will be available on the W6 Wallpaper TV (and the rest of LG’s TV lineup), which offers over 4,500 images to display while it’s not being used for movies, TV, or gaming. The W6 will support up to a 165Hz refresh rate, AMD FreeSync Premium, and is G-Sync compatible.

The W6 Wallpaper TV will be available in 77- and 83-inch sizes.

The company is also launching a new camera that works on HaLow Wi-Fi for extended range.

Xthings is rolling into CES with a bunch of new gear, including two new smart locks and a few smart security cameras. It’s definitely the Ultraloq Bolt Sense that’s the most intriguing of the bunch, however. It’s a relatively compact smart deadbolt that combines facial recognition with palm vein authentication for touch-free access, without resorting to an app.

While palm scanning is still relatively new to the consumer market, Xthings claims it’s more reliable than fingerprint scanning because it’s actually reading the vein pattern under your skin, so it doesn’t care if your hands are wet or dirty. And, since vein scanning uses near infrared light, it doesn’t matter if it’s pitch black out, it should still work.

The Bolt Sense has built-in Wi-Fi, and Xthings says Matter support is planned. But, since it’s not expected to ship until Q2, there’s still plenty of time to work that out. The company is also announcing the Latch 7 Pro, which should be landing sooner (in Q1), and, while it lacks fancy palm-reading tech, it will support Matter-over-Thread and Aliro.

Xthings will also be showing off the Ulticam IQ V2 at CES, its first camera with Matter support.

More interesting, though, is the Ulticam HaLow. It will be one of the first security cameras on the market to support Wi-Fi HaLow (802.11ah). HaLow uses sub-GHz signals for greater range and wall penetration, but at the expense of bandwidth. While Xthings doesn’t say exactly what the maximum range is for the new Ulticam, HaLow is rated for up to 0.6 miles under normal conditions. That makes it ideal for large properties. While HaLow made a bit of a splash at CES way back in 2016, it hasn’t found much success in the real world. Rather than make you worry about tracking down a specialized router, Xthings is including a dedicated hub with the Ulticam HaLow.

If you’re more worried about capturing crystal-clear video even in the darkest nights, Xthings is also launching the Ulticam IQ Floodlight, which pairs its AI-enabled security camera with 2,000-lumen floodlights. Though, you won’t get the same half-mile range with its standard Wi-Fi radio.

            <h2>What’s next for AI in 2026</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/05/1130662/whats-next-for-ai-in-2026/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">MIT Technology Review’s What’s Next series looks across industries, trends, and technologies to give you a first look at the future. You can read the rest of them here.

In an industry in constant flux, sticking your neck out to predict what’s coming next may seem reckless. (AI bubble? What AI bubble?) But for the last few years we’ve done just that—and we’re doing it again.

How did we do last time? We picked five hot AI trends to look out for in 2025, including what we called generative virtual playgrounds, a.k.a world models (check: From Google DeepMind’s Genie 3 to World Labs’s Marble, tech that can generate realistic virtual environments on the fly keeps getting better and better); so-called reasoning models (check: Need we say more? Reasoning models have fast become the new paradigm for best-in-class problem solving); a boom in AI for science (check: OpenAI is now following Google DeepMind by setting up a dedicated team to focus on just that); AI companies that are cozier with national security (check: OpenAI reversed position on the use of its technology for warfare to sign a deal with the defense-tech startup Anduril to help it take down battlefield drones); and legitimate competition for Nvidia (check, kind of: China is going all in on developing advanced AI chips, but Nvidia’s dominance still looks unassailable—for now at least).

So what’s coming in 2026? Here are our big bets for the next 12 months.

The last year shaped up as a big one for Chinese open-source models. In January, DeepSeek released R1, its open-source reasoning model, and shocked the world with what a relatively small firm in China could do with limited resources. By the end of the year, “DeepSeek moment” had become a phrase frequently tossed around by AI entrepreneurs, observers, and builders—an aspirational benchmark of sorts.

It was the first time many people realized they could get a taste of top-tier AI performance without going through OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google.

Open-weight models like R1 allow anyone to download a model and run it on their own hardware. They are also more customizable, letting teams tweak models through techniques like distillation and pruning. This stands in stark contrast to the “closed” models released by major American firms, where core capabilities remain proprietary and access is often expensive.

As a result, Chinese models have become an easy choice. Reports by CNBC and Bloomberg suggest that startups in the US have increasingly recognized and embraced what they can offer.

One popular group of models is Qwen, created by Alibaba, the company behind China’s largest e-commerce platform, Taobao. Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct alone has 8.85 million downloads, making it one of the most widely used pretrained LLMs. The Qwen family spans a wide range of model sizes alongside specialized versions tuned for math, coding, vision, and instruction-following, a breadth that has helped it become an open-source powerhouse.

Other Chinese AI firms that were previously unsure about committing to open source are following DeepSeek’s playbook. Standouts include Zhipu’s GLM and Moonshot’s Kimi. The competition has also pushed American firms to open up, at least in part. In August, OpenAI released its first open-source model. In November, the Allen Institute for AI, a Seattle-based nonprofit, released its latest open-source model, Olmo 3.

Even amid growing US-China antagonism, Chinese AI firms’ near-unanimous embrace of open source has earned them goodwill in the global AI community and a long-term trust advantage. In 2026, expect more Silicon Valley apps to quietly ship on top of Chinese open models, and look for the lag between Chinese releases and the Western frontier to keep shrinking—from months to weeks, and sometimes less.

T​​he battle over regulating artificial intelligence is heading for a showdown. On December 11, President Donald Trump signed an executive order aiming to neuter state AI laws, a move meant to handcuff states from keeping the growing industry in check. In 2026, expect more political warfare. The White House and states will spar over who gets to govern the booming technology, while AI companies wage a fierce lobbying campaign to crush regulations, armed with the narrative that a patchwork of state laws will smother innovation and hobble the US in the AI arms race against China.

Under Trump’s executive order, states may fear being sued or starved federal funding if they clash with his vision for light-touch regulation. Big Democratic states like California—which just enacted the nation’s first frontier AI law requiring companies to publish safety testing for their AI models—will take the fight to court, arguing that only Congress can override state laws. But states that can’t afford to lose federal funding, or fear getting in Trump’s crosshairs, might fold. Still, expect to see more state lawmaking on hot-button issues, especially where Trump’s order gives states a green light to legislate. With chatbots accused of triggering teen suicides and data centers sucking up more and more energy, states will face mounting public pressure to push for guardrails.

In place of state laws, Trump promises to work with Congress to establish a federal AI law. Don’t count on it. Congress failed to pass a moratorium on state legislation twice in 2025, and we aren’t holding out hope that it will deliver its own bill this year.

AI companies like OpenAI and Meta will continue to deploy powerful super-PACs to support political candidates who back their agenda and target those who stand in their way. On the other side, super-PACs supporting AI regulation will build their own war chests to counter. Watch them duke it out at next year’s midterm elections.

The further AI advances, the more people will fight to steer its course, and 2026 will be another year of regulatory tug-of-war—with no end in sight.

Imagine a world in which you have a personal shopper at your disposal 24-7—an expert who can instantly recommend a gift for even the trickiest-to-buy-for friend or relative, or trawl the web to draw up a list of the best bookcases available within your tight budget. Better yet, they can analyze a kitchen appliance’s strengths and weaknesses, compare it with its seemingly identical competition, and find you the best deal. Then once you’re happy with their suggestion, they’ll take care of the purchasing and delivery details too.But this ultra-knowledgeable shopper isn’t a clued-up human at all—it’s a chatbot. This is no distant prediction, either. Salesforce recently said it anticipates that AI will drive $263 billion in online purchases this holiday season. That’s some 21% of all orders. And experts are betting on AI-enhanced shopping becoming even bigger business within the next few years. By 2030, between $3 trillion and $5 trillion annually will be made from agentic commerce, according to research from the consulting firm McKinsey.

Unsurprisingly, AI companies are already heavily invested in making purchasing through their platforms as frictionless as possible. Google’s Gemini app can now tap into the company’s powerful Shopping Graph data set of products and sellers, and can even use its agentic technology to call stores on your behalf. Meanwhile, back in November, OpenAI announced a ChatGPT shopping feature capable of rapidly compiling buyer’s guides, and the company has struck deals with Walmart, Target, and Etsy to allow shoppers to buy products directly within chatbot interactions.

Expect plenty more of these kinds of deals to be struck within the next year as consumer time spent chatting with AI keeps on rising, and web traffic from search engines and social media continues to plummet.

I’m going to hedge here, right out of the gate. It’s no secret that large language models spit out a lot of nonsense. Unless it’s with monkeys-and-typewriters luck, LLMs won’t discover anything by themselves. But LLMs do still have the potential to extend the bounds of human knowledge.

We got a glimpse of how this could work in May, when Google DeepMind revealed AlphaEvolve, a system that used the firm’s Gemini LLM to come up with new algorithms for solving unsolved problems. The breakthrough was to combine Gemini with an evolutionary algorithm that checked its suggestions, picked the best ones, and fed them back into the LLM to make them even better.

Google DeepMind used AlphaEvolve to come up with more efficient ways to manage power consumption by data centers and Google’s TPU chips. Those discoveries are significant but not game-changing. Yet. Researchers at Google DeepMind are now pushing their approach to see how far it will go.

And others have been quick to follow their lead. A week after AlphaEvolve came out, Asankhaya Sharma, an AI engineer in Singapore, shared OpenEvolve, an open-source version of Google DeepMind’s tool. In September, the Japanese firm Sakana AI released a version of the software called SinkaEvolve. And in November, a team of US and Chinese researchers revealed AlphaResearch, which they claim improves on one of AlphaEvolve’s already better-than-human math solutions.

There are alternative approaches too. For example, researchers at the University of Colorado Denver are trying to make LLMs more inventive by tweaking the way so-called reasoning models work. They have drawn on what cognitive scientists know about creative thinking in humans to push reasoning models toward solutions that are more outside the box than their typical safe-bet suggestions.

Hundreds of companies are spending billions of dollars looking for ways to get AI to crack unsolved math problems, speed up computers, and come up with new drugs and materials. Now that AlphaEvolve has shown what’s possible with LLMs, expect activity on this front to ramp up fast.

For a while, lawsuits against AI companies were pretty predictable: Rights holders like authors or musicians would sue companies that trained AI models on their work, and the courts generally found in favor of the tech giants. AI’s upcoming legal battles will be far messier.

The fights center on thorny, unresolved questions: Can AI companies be held liable for what their chatbots encourage people to do, as when they help teens plan suicides? If a chatbot spreads patently false information about you, can its creator be sued for defamation? If companies lose these cases, will insurers shun AI companies as clients?

In 2026, we’ll start to see the answers to these questions, in part because some notable cases will go to trial (the family of a teen who died by suicide will bring OpenAI to court in November).

At the same time, the legal landscape will be further complicated by President Trump’s executive order from December—see Michelle’s item above for more details on the brewing regulatory storm.

No matter what, we’ll see a dizzying array of lawsuits in all directions (not to mention some judges even turning to AI amid the deluge).

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

A conversation with a chatbot can shift people&#39;s political views—but the most persuasive models also spread the most misinformation.

            <div id="article-text">My daughter introduced me to El Estepario Siberiano’s YouTube channel a few months back, and I have been obsessed ever since. The Spanish drummer (real name: Jorge Garrido) posts videos of himself playing supercharged cover versions of popular tracks, hitting his drums with such jaw-dropping speed and technique that he makes other pro drummers shake their heads in disbelief. The dozens of reaction videos posted by other musicians are a joy in themselves.

Garrido is up-front about the countless hours that it took to get this good. He says he sat behind his kit almost all day, every day for years. At a time when machines appear to do it all, there’s a kind of defiance in that level of human effort. It’s why my favorites are Garrido’s covers of electronic music, where he out-drums the drum machine. Check out his version of Skrillex and Missy Elliot’s “Ra Ta Ta” and tell me it doesn’t put happiness in your heart.

Watching Sora ­videos of Michael Jackson stealing a box of chicken nuggets or Sam Altman biting into the pink meat of a flame-grilled Pikachu has given me flashbacks to an Ed Atkins exhibition at Tate Britain I saw a few months ago. Atkins is one of the most influential and unsettling British artists of his generation. He is best known for hyper-detailed CG animations of himself (pore-perfect skin, janky movement) that play with the virtual representation of human emotions.

In The Worm we see a CGI Atkins make a long-distance call to his mother during a covid lockdown. The audio is from a recording of an actual conversation. Are we watching Atkins cry or his avatar? Our attention flickers between two realities. “When an actor breaks character during a scene, it’s known as corpsing,” Atkins has said. “I want everything I make to corpse.” Next to Atkins’s work, generative videos look like cardboard cutouts: lifelike but not alive.

What’s it like to be a pet? Australian author Laura Jean McKay’s debut novel, The Animals in That Country, will make you wish you’d never asked. A flu-like pandemic leaves people with the ability to hear what animals are saying. If that sounds too Dr. Dolittle for your tastes, rest assured: These animals are weird and nasty. A lot of the time they don’t even make any sense.

With everybody now talking to their computers, McKay’s book resets the anthropomorphic trap we’ve all fallen into. It’s a brilliant evocation of what a nonhuman mind might contain—and a meditation on the hard limits of communication.

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

            <h2>Job titles of the future: Head-transplant surgeon</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/02/1129416/head-transplant-surgeon-sergio-canavero-future-job/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Italian neurosurgeon Sergio Canavero has been preparing for a surgery that might never happen. His idea? Swap a sick person’s head—or perhaps just the brain—onto a younger, healthier body.

Canavero caused a stir in 2017 when he announced that a team he advised in China had exchanged heads between two corpses. But he never convinced skeptics that his technique could succeed—or to believe his claim that a procedure on a live person was imminent. The Chicago Tribune labeled him the “P.T. Barnum of transplantation.”

Canavero withdrew from the spotlight. But the idea of head transplants isn’t going away. Instead, he says, the concept has recently been getting a fresh look from life-extension enthusiasts and stealth Silicon Valley startups.

It’s been rocky. After he began publishing his surgical ideas a decade ago, Canavero says, he got his “pink slip” from the Molinette Hospital in Turin, where he’d spent 22 years on staff. “I’m an out-of-the-establishment guy. So that has made things harder, I have to say,” he says.

No other solution to aging is on the horizon. “It’s become absolutely clear over the past years that the idea of some incredible tech to rejuvenate elderly people—­happening in some secret lab, like Google—is really going nowhere,” he says. “You have to go for the whole shebang.”

He means getting a new body, not just one new organ. Canavero has an easy mastery of English idioms and an unexpected Southern twang. He says that’s due to a fascination with American comics as a child. “For me, learning the language of my heroes was paramount,” he says. “So I can shoot the breeze.”

Canavero is now an independent investigator and has advised entrepreneurs who want to create brainless human clones as a source of DNA-matched organs that wouldn’t get rejected by a recipient’s immune system. “I can tell you there are guys from top universities involved,” he says.

Combining the necessary technologies, like reliably precise surgical robots and artificial wombs to grow the clones, is going to be complex and very, very expensive. Canavero lacks the funds to take his plans further, but he believes “the money is out there” for a commercial moonshot project: “What I say to the billionaires is ‘Come together.’ You will all have your own share, plus make yourselves immortal.”

The sunshine vitamin could affect your immune system and heart health.

Yes, you can pay $50,000 to clone a pet. But others are using the technology to rescue endangered species.

            <h2>Why inventing new emotions feels so good</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-31</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/31/1129403/new-emotions-online-life-feelings/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s a “complex and subtle emotion that elicits feelings of comfort, serenity, and a gentle sense of floating.” It’s peaceful, but more ephemeral and intangible than contentment. It might be evoked by the sight of a sunset or a moody, low-key album.

If you haven’t ever felt this sensation—or even heard of it—that’s not surprising. A Reddit user named noahjeadie generated it with ChatGPT, along with advice on how to evoke the feeling. With the right essential oils and soundtrack, apparently, you too can feel like “a soft fuzzy draping ghost floating through a lavender suburb.”

Don’t scoff: Researchers say more and more terms for these “neo-­emotions” are showing up online, describing new dimensions and aspects of feeling. Velvetmist was a key example in a journal article about the phenomenon published in July 2025. But most neo-emotions aren’t the inventions of emo artificial intelligences. Humans come up with them, and they’re part of a big change in the way researchers are thinking about feelings, one that emphasizes how people continuously spin out new ones in response to a changing world.

Velvetmist might’ve been a chatbot one-off, but it’s not unique. The sociologist Marci Cottingham—whose 2024 paper got this vein of neo-emotion research started—cites many more new terms in circulation. There’s “Black joy” (Black people celebrating embodied pleasure as a form of political resistance), “trans euphoria” (the joy of having one’s gender identity affirmed and celebrated), “eco-anxiety” (the hovering fear of climate disaster), “hypernormalization” (the surreal pressure to continue performing mundane life and labor under capitalism during a global pandemic or fascist takeover), and the sense of “doom” found in “doomer” (one who is relentlessly pessimistic) or “doomscrolling” (being glued to an endless feed of bad news in an immobilized state combining apathy and dread).

Of course, emotional vocabulary is always evolving. During the Civil War, doctors used the centuries-old term “nostalgia,” combining the Greek words for “returning home”and “pain,” to describe a sometimes fatal set of symptoms suffered by soldiers—a condition we’d probably describe today as post-traumatic stress disorder. Now nostalgia’s meaning has mellowed and faded to a gentle affection for an old cultural product or vanished way of life. And people constantly import emotion words from other cultures when they’re convenient or evocative—like hygge (the Danish word for friendly coziness) or kvell (a Yiddish term for brimming over with happy pride).

Cottingham believes that neo-­emotions are proliferating as people spend more of their lives online. These coinages help us relate to one another and make sense of our experiences, and they get a lot of engagement on social media. So even when a neo-emotion is just a subtle variation on, or combination of, existing feelings, getting super-specific about those feelings helps us reflect and connect with other people. “These are potentially signals that tell us about our place in the world,” she says.

These neo-emotions are part of a paradigm shift in emotion science. For decades, researchers argued that humans all share a set of a half-dozen or so basic emotions. But over the last decade, Lisa Feldman Barrett, a clinical psychologist at Northeastern University, has become one of the most cited scientists in the world for work demonstrating otherwise. By using tools like advanced brain imaging and studying babies and people from relatively isolated cultures, she has concluded there’s no such thing as a basic emotional palette. The way we experience and talk about our feelings is culturally determined. “How do you know what anger and sadness and fear are? Because somebody taught you,” Barrett says.

If there are no true “basic” biological emotions, this puts more emphasis on social and cultural variations in how we interpret our experiences. And these interpretations can change over time. “As a sociologist, we think of all emotions as created,” Cottingham says. Just like any other tool humans make and use, “emotions are a practical resource people are using as they navigate the world.”

Some neo-emotions, like velvetmist, might be mere novelties. Barrett playfully suggests “chiplessness” to describe the combined hunger, frustration, and relief of getting to the bottom of the bag. But others, like eco-anxiety and Black joy, can take on a life of their own and help galvanize social movements.

Both reading about and crafting your own neo-emotions, with or without chatbot assistance, could be surprisingly helpful. Lots of research supports the benefits of emotional granularity. Basically, the more detailed and specific words you can use to describe your emotions, both positive and negative, the better.

Researchers analogize this “emodiversity” to biodiversity or cultural diversity, arguing that a more diverse world is more enriched. It turns out that people who exhibit higher emotional granularity go to the doctor less frequently, spend fewer days hospitalized for illness, and are less likely to drink when stressed, drive recklessly, or smoke cigarettes. And many studies show emodiversity is a skill that, with training, people can develop at any age. Just imagine cruising into this sweet, comforting future. Is the idea giving you a certain dreamy thrill?

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We’re in the midst of a global mental-­health crisis. More than a billion people worldwide suffer from a mental-health condition, according to the World Health Organization. The prevalence of anxiety and depression is growing in many demographics, particularly young people, and suicide is claiming hundreds of thousands of lives globally each year.

Given the clear demand for accessible and affordable mental-health services, it’s no wonder that people have looked to artificial intelligence for possible relief. Millions are already actively seeking therapy from popular chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude, or from specialized psychology apps like Wysa and Woebot. On a broader scale, researchers are exploring AI’s potential to monitor and collect behavioral and biometric observations using wearables and smart devices, analyze vast volumes of clinical data for new insights, and assist human mental-health professionals to help prevent burnout.

But so far this largely uncontrolled experiment has produced mixed results. Many people have found solace in chatbots based on large language models (LLMs), and some experts see promise in them as therapists, but other users have been sent into delusional spirals by AI’s hallucinatory whims and breathless sycophancy. Most tragically, multiple families have alleged that chatbots contributed to the suicides of their loved ones, sparking lawsuits against companies responsible for these tools. In October, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed in a blog post that 0.15% of ChatGPT users “have conversations that include explicit indicators of potential suicidal planning or intent.” That’s roughly a million people sharing suicidal ideations with just one of these software systems every week.

The real-world consequences of AI therapy came to a head in unexpected ways in 2025 as we waded through a critical mass of stories about human-chatbot relationships, the flimsiness of guardrails on many LLMs, and the risks of sharing profoundly personal information with products made by corporations that have economic incentives to harvest and monetize such sensitive data.

Several authors anticipated this inflection point. Their timely books are a reminder that while the present feels like a blur of breakthroughs, scandals, and confusion, this disorienting time is rooted in deeper histories of care, technology, and trust.

LLMs have often been described as “black boxes” because nobody knows exactly how they produce their results. The inner workings that guide their outputs are opaque because their algorithms are so complex and their training data is so vast. In mental-health circles, people often describe the human brain as a “black box,” for analogous reasons. Psychology, psychiatry, and related fields must grapple with the impossibility of seeing clearly inside someone else’s head, let alone pinpointing the exact causes of their distress.

These two types of black boxes are now interacting with each other, creating unpredictable feedback loops that may further impede clarity about the origins of people’s mental-­health struggles and the solutions that may be possible. Anxiety about these developments has much to do with the explosive recent advances in AI, but it also revives decades-old warnings from pioneers such as the MIT computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum, who argued against computerized therapy as early as the 1960s.

Charlotte Blease, a philosopher of medicine, makes the optimist’s case in Dr. Bot: Why Doctors Can Fail Us—and How AI Could Save Lives. Her book broadly explores the possible positive impacts of AI in a range of medical fields. While she remains clear-eyed about the risks, warning that readers who are expecting “a gushing love letter to technology” will be disappointed, she suggests that these models can help relieve patient suffering and medical burnout alike.

“Health systems are crumbling under patient pressure,” Blease writes. “Greater burdens on fewer doctors create the perfect petri dish for errors,” and “with palpable shortages of doctors and increasing waiting times for patients, many of us are profoundly frustrated.”

Blease believes that AI can not only ease medical professionals’ massive workloads but also relieve the tensions that have always existed between some patients and their caregivers. For example, people often don’t seek needed care because they are intimidated or fear judgment from medical professionals; this is especially true if they have mental-health challenges. AI could allow more people to share their concerns, she argues.

But she’s aware that these putative upsides need to be weighed against major drawbacks. For instance, AI therapists can provide inconsistent and even dangerous responses to human users, according to a 2025 study, and they also raise privacy concerns, given that AI companies are currently not bound by the same confidentiality and HIPAA standards as licensed therapists.

While Blease is an expert in this field, her motivation for writing the book is also personal: She has two siblings with an incurable form of muscular dystrophy, one of whom waited decades for a diagnosis. During the writing of her book, she also lost her partner to cancer and her father to dementia within a devastating six-month period. “I witnessed first-hand the sheer brilliance of doctors and the kindness of health professionals,” she writes. “But I also observed how things can go wrong with care.”

A similar tension animates Daniel Oberhaus’s engrossing book The Silicon Shrink: How Artificial Intelligence Made the World an Asylum. Oberhaus starts from a point of tragedy: the loss of his younger sister to suicide. As Oberhaus carried out the “distinctly twenty-first-century mourning process” of sifting through her digital remains, he wondered if technology could have eased the burden of the psychiatric problems that had plagued her since childhood.

“It seemed possible that all of this personal data might have held important clues that her mental health providers could have used to provide more effective treatment,” he writes. “What if algorithms running on my sister’s smartphone or laptop had used that data to understand when she was in distress? Could it have led to a timely intervention that saved her life? Would she have wanted that even if it did?”

This concept of digital phenotyping—in which a person’s digital behavior could be mined for clues about distress or illness—seems elegant in theory. But it may also become problematic if integrated into the field of psychiatric artificial intelligence (PAI), which extends well beyond chatbot therapy.

Oberhaus emphasizes that digital clues could actually exacerbate the existing challenges of modern psychiatry, a discipline that remains fundamentally uncertain about the underlying causes of mental illnesses and disorders. The advent of PAI, he says, is “the logical equivalent of grafting physics onto astrology.” In other words, the data generated by digital phenotyping is as precise as physical measurements of planetary positions, but it is then integrated into a broader framework—in this case, psychiatry—that, like astrology, is based on unreliable assumptions.

Oberhaus, who uses the phrase “swipe psychiatry” to describe the outsourcing of clinical decisions based on behavioral data to LLMs, thinks that this approach cannot escape the fundamental issues facing psychiatry. In fact, it could worsen the problem by causing the skills and judgment of human therapists to atrophy as they grow more dependent on AI systems.

He also uses the asylums of the past—in which institutionalized patients lost their right to freedom, privacy, dignity, and agency over their lives—as a touchstone for a more insidious digital captivity that may spring from PAI. LLM users are already sacrificing privacy by telling chatbots sensitive personal information that companies then mine and monetize, contributing to a new surveillance economy. Freedom and dignity are at stake when complex inner lives are transformed into data streams tailored for AI analysis.

AI therapists could flatten humanity into patterns of prediction, and so sacrifice the intimate, individualized care that is expected of traditional human therapists. “The logic of PAI leads to a future where we may all find ourselves patients in an algorithmic asylum administered by digital wardens,” Oberhaus writes. “In the algorithmic asylum there is no need for bars on the window or white padded rooms because there is no possibility of escape. The asylum is already everywhere—in your homes and offices, schools and hospitals, courtrooms and barracks. Wherever there’s an internet connection, the asylum is waiting.”

Eoin Fullam, a researcher who studies the intersection of technology and mental health, echoes some of the same concerns in Chatbot Therapy: A Critical Analysis of AI Mental Health Treatment. A heady academic primer, the book analyzes the assumptions underlying the automated treatments offered by AI chatbots and the way capitalist incentives could corrupt these kinds of tools.

Fullam observes that the capitalist mentality behind new technologies “often leads to questionable, illegitimate, and illegal business practices in which the customers’ interests are secondary to strategies of market dominance.”

That doesn’t mean that therapy-bot makers “will inevitably conduct nefarious activities contrary to the users’ interests in the pursuit of market dominance,” Fullam writes.

But he notes that the success of AI therapy depends on the inseparable impulses to make money and to heal people. In this logic, exploitation and therapy feed each other: Every digital therapy session generates data, and that data fuels the system that profits as unpaid users seek care. The more effective the therapy seems, the more the cycle entrenches itself, making it harder to distinguish between care and commodification. “The more the users benefit from the app in terms of its therapeutic or any other mental health intervention,” he writes, “the more they undergo exploitation.”

This sense of an economic and psychological ouroboros—the snake that eats its own tail—serves as a central metaphor in Sike, the debut novel from Fred Lunzer, an author with a research background in AI.

Described as a “story of boy meets girl meets AI psychotherapist,” Sike follows Adrian, a young Londoner who makes a living ghostwriting rap lyrics, in his romance with Maquie, a business professional with a knack for spotting lucrative technologies in the beta phase.

The title refers to a splashy commercial AI therapist called Sike, uploaded into smart glasses, that Adrian uses to interrogate his myriad anxieties. “When I signed up to Sike, we set up my dashboard, a wide black panel like an airplane’s cockpit that showed my daily ‘vitals,’” Adrian narrates. “Sike can analyze the way you walk, the way you make eye contact, the stuff you talk about, the stuff you wear, how often you piss, shit, laugh, cry, kiss, lie, whine, and cough.”

In other words, Sike is the ultimate digital phenotyper, constantly and exhaustively analyzing everything in a user’s daily experiences. In a twist, Lunzer chooses to make Sike a luxury product, available only to subscribers who can foot the price tag of £2,000 per month.

Flush with cash from his contributions to a hit song, Adrian comes to rely on Sike as a trusted mediator between his inner and outer worlds. The novel explores the impacts of the app on the wellness of the well-off, following rich people who voluntarily commit themselves to a boutique version of the digital asylum described by Oberhaus.

The only real sense of danger in Sike involves a Japanese torture egg (don’t ask). The novel strangely sidesteps the broader dystopian ripples of its subject matter in favor of drunken conversations at fancy restaurants and elite dinner parties.

The sudden ascent of the AI therapist seems startlingly futuristic, as if it should be unfolding in some later time when the streets scrub themselves and we travel the world through pneumatic tubes.

Sike’s creator is simply “a great guy” in Adrian’s estimation, despite his techno-messianic vision of training the app to soothe the ills of entire nations. It always seems as if a shoe is meant to drop, but in the end, it never does, leaving the reader with a sense of non-resolution.

While Sike is set in the present day, something about the sudden ascent of the AI therapist—­in real life as well as in fiction—seems startlingly futuristic, as if it should be unfolding in some later time when the streets scrub themselves and we travel the world through pneumatic tubes. But this convergence of mental health and artificial intelligence has been in the making for more than half a century. The beloved astronomer Carl Sagan, for example, once imagined a “network of computer psychotherapeutic terminals, something like arrays of large telephone booths” that could address the growing demand for mental-health services.

Oberhaus notes that one of the first incarnations of a trainable neural network, known as the Perceptron, was devised not by a mathematician but by a psychologist named Frank Rosenblatt, at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory in 1958. The potential utility of AI in mental health was widely recognized by the 1960s, inspiring early computerized psychotherapists such as the DOCTOR script that ran on the ELIZA chatbot developed by Joseph Weizenbaum, who shows up in all three of the nonfiction books in this article.

Weizenbaum, who died in 2008, was profoundly concerned about the possibility of computerized therapy. “Computers can make psychiatric judgments,” he wrote in his 1976 book Computer Power and Human Reason. “They can flip coins in much more sophisticated ways than can the most patient human being. The point is that they ought not to be given such tasks. They may even be able to arrive at ‘correct’ decisions in some cases—but always and necessarily on bases no human being should be willing to accept.”

It’s a caution worth keeping in mind. As AI therapists arrive at scale, we’re seeing them play out a familiar dynamic: Tools designed with superficially good intentions are enmeshed with systems that can exploit, surveil, and reshape human behavior. In a frenzied attempt to unlock new opportunities for patients in dire need of mental-health support, we may be locking other doors behind them.

            <h2>Bangladesh’s garment-making industry is getting greener</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/29/1129308/bangladesh-garment-sustainability-frugal-factories/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Pollution from textile production—dyes, chemicals, and heavy metals like lead and cadmium—is common in the waters of the Buriganga River as it runs through Dhaka, Bangladesh. It’s among many harms posed by a garment sector that was once synonymous with tragedy: In 2013, the eight-story Rana Plaza factory building collapsed, killing 1,134 people and injuring some 2,500 others.

But things are starting to change. In recent years the country has quietly become an unlikely leader in “frugal” factories that use a combination of resource-efficient technologies to cut waste, conserve water, and build resilience against climate impacts and global supply disruptions. Bangladesh now boasts 268 LEED-certified garment factories—more than any other country. Dye plants are using safer chemicals, tanneries are adopting cleaner tanning methods and treating wastewater, workshops are switching to more efficient LED lighting, and solar panels glint from rooftops. The hundreds of factories along the Buriganga’s banks and elsewhere in Bangladesh are starting to stitch together a new story, woven from greener threads.

In Fakir Eco Knitwears’ LEED Gold–certified factory in Narayanganj, a city near Dhaka, skylights reduce energy consumption from electric lighting by 40%, and AI-driven cutters allow workers to recycle 95% of fabric scraps into new yarns. “We save energy by using daylight, solar power, and rainwater instead of heavy AC and boilers,” says Md. Anisuzzaman, an engineer at the company. “It shows how local resources can make production greener and more sustainable.”

The shift to green factories in Bangladesh is financed through a combination of factory investments, loans from Bangladesh Bank’s Green Transformation Fund, and pressure from international buyers who reward compliance with ongoing orders. One prominent program is the Partnership for Cleaner Textile (PaCT), an initiative run by the World Bank Group’s International Finance Corporation. Launched in 2013, PaCT has worked with more than 450 factories on cleaner production methods. By its count, the effort now saves 35 billion liters of fresh water annually, enough to meet the needs of 1.9 million people.

It’s a good start, but Bangladesh’s $40 billion garment industry still has a long way to go. The shift to environmentalism at the factory level hasn’t translated to improved outcomes for the sector’s 4.4 million workers.

Wage theft and delayed payments are widespread. The minimum wage, some 12,500 taka per month (about $113), is far below the $200 proposed by unions—which has meant frequent strikes and protests over pay, overtime, and job security. “Since Rana Plaza, building safety and factory conditions have improved, but the mindset remains unchanged,” says A.K.M. Ashraf Uddin, executive director of the Bangladesh Labour Foundation, a nonprofit labor rights group. “Profit still comes first, and workers’ freedom of speech is yet to be realized.”

In the worst case, greener industry practices could actually exacerbate inequality. Smaller factories dominate the sector, and they struggle to afford upgrades. But without those upgrades, businesses could find themselves excluded from certain markets. One of those is the European Union, which plans to require companies to address human rights and environmental problems in supply chains starting in 2027. A cleaner Buriganga River mends just a small corner of a vast tapestry of need.

            <div id="article-text">Five stars used to mean something. People still read reviews before buying software. They just don’t trust them the way they used to. And no, this isn’t about fake reviews or obvious scams. Those are easy to spot. The real problem is more uncomfortable. The review economy didn’t collapse. It slowly drifted away from its original purpose.

User reviews began as authentic buyer guidance, but they’ve morphed into strategic assets for businesses. Scroll through any app store or e-commerce site: everything is “top-rated” and lavished with praise. If every product gleams with a 4.8/5 rating, those stars start to lose their meaning.

Consumers aren’t fooled, in fact, the share of people who trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations plummeted from nearly 80% in 2020 to just 42% in 2025

We read the glowing comments, but we’ve learned to read between the lines.

It’s not hard to see why trust has eroded. Companies have figured out that great reviews drive sales, so they’ve turned the whole system into a numbers game. High ratings aren’t just social proof now, they’re a growth tactic.  In other words, more stars = more money. So of course businesses are chasing stars like their life depends on it. And in a way, it does.

Behind the scenes, many companies actively engineer their review scores. One common tactic is to time the ask just right. For instance, some businesses send out a Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey to gauge your sentiment “How likely are you to recommend us?”

If you rate them a 9 or 10 (a promoter), you’re immediately nudged to post a public review. If you give a lukewarm or low score, the feedback form quietly thanks you and never mentions writing a review at all.

Only the happiest customers get the gentle push to “Share your experience!” This practice is so widespread it even has a name: “review gating.”

It’s essentially filtering which customers get invited to leave a review based on their initial feedback. Platforms officially frown on it (Google outright forbids “selectively soliciting positive reviews”), but behind closed doors it remains a growth hacker’s favorite trick.

Then there’s the outright incentivization. Perhaps you’ve received an email offering a discount, gift card, or free month of service in exchange for writing a review. It’s framed as a thank-you for your time, of course – “Share your honest feedback and get 10% off your next purchase!” – but the intent is clear.

In an economy of fake praise, even regulators have had to step in to remind everyone that trust isn’t a commodity to be bought. Companies know how to play the game from the other side too: suppressing negativity.

Unhappy customer feedback is quietly diverted to support teams or private channels, where it can be resolved (or simply contained) out of public view. The result is a skewed reality, a glossy wall of five-star testimonials that obscure any hint of dissatisfaction. It’s a great sales tool. It’s terrible for the truth.

Why go to such lengths to manicure the ratings? Because the platforms themselves reward it. The algorithms that sort and highlight products aren’t trying to surface the most truthful review; they’re trying to maximize engagement and conversion.

High ratings and large volumes of reviews make people more likely to click “Buy Now.” That means more conversion for sellers and more commission for the marketplace. In other words, the algorithm is biased toward whatever boosts the platform’s monetization metrics.

A bunch of five-star reviews isn’t just ego bait,  it’s algorithm bait.

Think about it: products with a 4.7-star average and hundreds of reviews tend to appear at the top of search results and recommendation lists. They convert better, so the system pushes them more.

More visibility leads to more sales, which reinforces the high ranking. It’s a feedback loop powered by positive feedback (pun intended). If a vendor can game their way into that virtuous cycle, via perfectly timed prompts or purchased praise, the platform’s code will happily amplify them.

Authenticity doesn’t earn you a top slot; performance does. The incentive is clear: keep it positive, and keep it plentiful. In the review economy, volume and sentiment are king.

Worse, some marketplaces have blurred the line between genuine high-rated listings and paid placement. It’s an open secret that many platforms offer sponsored spots or pay-to-play schemes, think “featured” placements, ads masquerading as top picks, or vendor subscriptions that subtly boost visibility.

Money talks, even if it speaks over the voice of authentic customer feedback. (To be fair, a few holdouts still refuse to monetize their review rankings or sell out their star system, but they’re the exception, not the rule).

Consumers aren’t sitting idly by in this charade. We’ve become savvy at sniffing out over-polished BS. The modern buyer knows how the game is played, and many are adapting their behavior to cope with the broken review system.

First, there’s a migration of trust to private networks and off-platform channels. Instead of relying on the star-average on a marketplace, people turn to friends, colleagues, and niche communities for real advice.

Think about the last time you were unsure about a purchase, maybe you shot a quick message to a group chat, or asked in a private Slack channel, “Hey, has anyone used this product? Is it actually any good?” Personal recommendations feel reliable again, precisely because they’re not part of the public review circus.

Second, savvy consumers cross-check everything. Rather than trusting one site’s reviews, they compare across multiple sources, the product might be 4.8 on the official store, but what’s it rated elsewhere?

Is there a discrepancy between the slick website testimonials and the chatter on Reddit? More often than not, shoppers now triangulate information. In fact, three out of four people use two or more sites when reading reviews, rather than putting all their faith in one platform’s word. We instinctively seek a consensus of truth across the noise.

Finally, many have decided the best judge is themselves. “Try before you buy” has made a comeback as a defense against dubious reviews. Free trials, freemium tiers, generous return policies, consumers leverage them all to test products firsthand.

If a software platform promises the world in its curated testimonials, a savvy buyer will take the 14-day free trial and see if it lives up to the hype. In sectors like enterprise software, where choices are costly and critical, buyers might run a pilot program or proof-of-concept rather than trust glossy case studies. Essentially, experience has become the new review.

All this has serious implications for platforms and software marketplaces. These businesses built their empires on user-generated trust, turning customer opinion into a key part of the shopping experience.

If that trust evaporates, the model cracks. We’re already seeing the early signs: users skipping the review tab, or treating every five-star rating with a healthy dose of skepticism.

If the review economy continues on its current path, platforms risk becoming mere transaction processors rather than trust brokers.

For the marketplaces, this is both a crisis and an opportunity. The crisis is obvious: loss of credibility. If people no longer believe what they read on your platform, they’ll seek validation elsewhere, and your influence over purchase decisions diminishes.

But the opportunity lies in reform. Platforms could double down on authenticity as a feature, verifying purchases, cracking down harder on fraudulent and incentivized reviews, and highlighting more qualitative, nuanced feedback instead of simple star counts.

There’s even a chance to innovate with new trust signals (some are experimenting with things like verified buyer badges, AI analysis for suspicious patterns, or weighted ratings that account for reviewer reputation). The platforms that find ways to genuinely restore faith in their review systems will win back weary consumers. Those that don’t will see their communities drift away, bit by bit.

Importantly, not all platforms have given in to the dark side. A handful still refuse pay-for-play tactics, no paid reviews, no under-the-table boosting of rankings for advertisers.

These holdouts demonstrate that integrity in reviews is possible, even if it means slower growth in the short term.

In the end, the broken review economy is forcing a rebalance of how we decide what to trust. Buyers are adapting, finding new ways to cut through the noise. And the platforms that once thrived on being the ultimate source of truth in purchasing may have to rethink their approach if they want to stay relevant.

Trust, once lost, is hard to regain. The five-star system doesn’t shine as bright as it used to; perhaps it’s time for the next evolution in how we share and earn trust online.

            <div id="article-text">2025 was the year technology stopped being tomorrow’s promise and became today’s anchor. What began as a surge in generative AI and platform innovation two years prior crystallized this year into concrete shifts in how people work, governing bodies legislate, and markets invest. Across continents and industries, the arc of technology bent toward practical impact, regulatory reality, and economic weight!

At the heart of the year’s story was artificial intelligence’s jump from novelty to infrastructure. LLMs and multimodal models moved beyond demos into everyday workflows, influencing how documents are written, campaigns are conceived, products designed, and code generated.

Enterprises that once hesitated began deploying AI tools at scale, with early adopters reporting measurable productivity gains by integrating copilots into core processes, a trend visible in surveys showing widespread adoption among software professionals.

It’s a reflection on how 2025, at the crossroads of technology, governance, and economic strategy, brought about a series of inflection points that will shape the next era of creation, competition, and control.

OpenAI’s release of GPT-5 in August pushed the boundaries of what AI could do, delivering notable gains in coding, math, and multimodal understanding. But unlike the jaw-dropping debut of ChatGPT a couple years prior, this new generation of foundation models arrived to a more measured reception.

Tech leaders and investors had begun asking harder questions: beyond impressive demos, could these models drive real products and revenue?

Google’s answer was Gemini 3, launched in November as its “most intelligent model” and immediately woven into Google’s flagship product, Search. For the first time, an AI model upgrade wasn’t just about boastful leaderboard scores, it was about transforming user experience.

Typing a query into Google now often meant receiving an AI-generated synthesis instead of the familiar list of links, a sea change in how information is delivered. Google even unveiled a Gemini “agent” that could execute multi-step tasks like booking travel or organizing email, hinting at a future where AI acts more like a digital butler than a chatbox.

Anthropic’s Claude 4 model, for instance, gained a strong following among developers by expanding how much it could handle at once, processing entire codebases with tens of thousands of lines, rather than by producing viral one-liners.

AI grew up in 2025: it was still improving at breakneck speed, but it also had to earn its keep in real products and justify the billion-dollar bets fueling its rise.

Driving this AI explosion was a parallel leap in hardware. The hunger for AI computers in 2025 was insatiable, and chipmakers raced to deliver.

NVIDIA, whose GPUs had become the era’s essential infrastructure, rolled out its new Blackwell architecture with chips like the B200 that boasted up to 3× the training speed of its predecessor. Cloud data centers around the world scrambled to deploy these to keep up with demand from model training and inference.

Rival chipmakers weren’t idle either: AMD and a cadre of startups pushed innovative AI accelerators, while even Intel signaled ambitions to catch up, reportedly exploring an acquisition of AI chip designer SambaNova.

Perhaps most tellingly, tech giants themselves started designing silicon tailored for AI workloads, recognizing that owning the chip means owning the future of computing.

Beyond AI chips, consumer hardware saw its own milestones. After years of anticipation, augmented reality glasses and mixed-reality headsets finally had their moment, sort of.

Apple’s Vision Pro headset, unveiled in late 2023, reached select markets in 2024; by 2025 developers were crafting the first wave of immersive apps. However, mass adoption lagged due to the device’s sky-high price and bulky format.

Competitors like Meta’s Quest line offered cheaper VR headsets and modest improvements, but the “metaverse” hype of yesteryear largely fizzled out, users and investors had shifted their excitement to generative AI and tangible productivity tools.

Smartphones and laptops in 2025 continued incremental improvements (faster Apple M3/M4 chips, foldable screens becoming more common), yet it was clear the next paradigm shift in personal tech was still on the horizon.

Even so, one hardware frontier made concrete progress: quantum computing. Industry leaders like IBM and Google demonstrated prototype systems with ever-larger qubit counts and made strides in error correction, inching closer to viable quantum machines.

These advances, while esoteric to the public, underscored a broader theme, from AI accelerators to quantum chips, the machinery under the hood of tech was evolving rapidly to enable the software of tomorrow.

If 2025 proved anything, it’s that technology no longer operates above the law. This was the year regulators moved from intent to enforcement, with Europe leading the charge.

After years of debate, the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act came into force, becoming the world’s first complex AI law. From February, certain “unacceptable risk” uses, such as social scoring and real-time biometric surveillance, were banned outright.

By August, transparency rules followed, forcing companies to label AI-generated content and comply with new obligations for general-purpose models. The signal was unmistakable: in Europe, the era of unchecked AI was over.

Companies now face audits, penalties, and real consequences if their systems cross legal or ethical lines, a regulatory moment European officials openly compared to GDPR’s impact on data privacy.

The pressure didn’t stop with AI. In 2025, regulators also went after the gatekeepers. The EU’s Digital Markets Act forced long-resistant changes from Big Tech, most notably when Apple opened the iPhone to third-party app stores and sideloading in Europe, dismantling a 15-year walled garden.

At the same time, enforcement of the Digital Services Act intensified. Platforms were scrutinized for how they handle disinformation, with companies like X warned or penalized during periods of geopolitical tension. In response, social networks expanded moderation teams, adjusted algorithms, and exposed more of their inner workings to researchers.

The US issued an AI executive order and signaled tougher enforcement through agencies like the FTC, while states stepped in, including New York’s law requiring mental-health warnings on addictive social features.

In China, new draft rules targeted AI systems designed for human-like interaction, tightening licensing and ideological oversight. By the end of the year, the freewheeling phase of tech disruption had given way to something more restrained. The question was no longer whether regulation would catch up, but how deeply it would reshape innovation itself.

The platform shake-up that began in 2023 gathered real momentum in 2025, as both companies and users adjusted to a post-pandemic, AI-saturated reality.

Nowhere was this clearer than in social media. Elon Musk’s X, which entered the decade with noise and bravado, found itself on the defensive. Meta’s Threads, initially dismissed after an early spike, steadily closed the gap, nearing parity with X in daily mobile users by mid-year.

X’s audience shrank as policy whiplash and leadership churn eroded confidence, and while its remaining users were still deeply engaged, the era of unquestioned Twitter dominance was over. Disenchanted users scattered across a fragmented landscape, from Meta’s polished Threads to decentralized alternatives like Bluesky and Mastodon, breaking the old Facebook–Instagram–Twitter equilibrium.

The recalibration extended well beyond social feeds.

Major platforms retooled around changing habits: Google reshaped Search around generative answers to fend off AI assistants and algorithmic discovery, while Microsoft pushed its Copilot deeper into Windows, Office, and Bing, betting on “AI inside” as a platform reset.

Everyday behavior shifted too. Smarter voice and chat assistants returned to daily use, handling emails, refunds, and scheduling with little friction. At the same time, screen fatigue set in. Digital-detox travel gained traction, and younger users gravitated toward apps that promised less algorithmic pressure and more human curation. Even streaming came full circle.

After years of fragmentation, providers began rebundling services, offering combined video, music, and gaming packages that looked suspiciously like cable TV reborn, a reminder that while technology moves forward, user preferences often move in cycles.

Amid the gains and momentum, 2025 also became a year of reckoning. As AI systems spread, society began grappling with their cultural and ethical cost. Creators who once marveled at generative tools started pushing back, arguing that their work had been absorbed without consent or compensation.

A wave of lawsuits moved through US courts, with authors accusing companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google of scraping books and articles to train models. By year’s end, the message was unmistakable: if AI is built on human creativity, many believe its rewards can no longer flow in one direction alone.

Public trust in technology was also tested by a rise in malicious uses and misuses. In the financial domain, sophisticated deepfake scams caused real damage. The frequency of such incidents spiked sharply; cybersecurity firms reported a 3000% increase in deepfake-related fraud over two years, and authorities scrambled to educate businesses on new verification practices.

Misinformation continued to be a menace: during elections and conflicts, AI-generated fake images and videos spread on social media, forcing newsrooms to set up rapid-response fact-checking teams.

Encouragingly, 2025 also saw growth in countermeasures, from better deepfake detection algorithms to nascent standards for cryptographic content authentication (the Coalition for Content Provenance, including major publishers and tech platforms, expanded efforts to watermark authentic media).

Still, the information ecosystem remained fraught, as even savvy citizens found it ever harder to tell the truth from fabrication online.

And then there’s the human element: how all this tech is affecting everyday lives and livelihoods. Workplace AI adoption soared this year; tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot and a host of AI assistants became common on office desktops. Studies showed productivity boosts but also raised concerns about workers becoming overly reliant on AI suggestions.

Meanwhile, fears of automation resurfaced in certain sectors, for example, as chatbots took over more customer service and code-generation tools improved, professionals in call centers and junior programming positions wondered about long-term job security.

These anxieties fueled calls for new approaches to education and training, so that the workforce of 2030 will be prepared for more creative, complex tasks that AI can’t easily handle.

Lovable (Stockholm, Sweden) came as one of the most remarkable AI software stories of the year, for me. What began as an open-source project evolved into a commercial platform that lets users build fully functional websites and apps using plain-language prompts, no traditional coding required.

This approach, known in the industry as “vibe coding,” turns ideas into production-ready software simply by describing what you want in natural language.

Lovable’s growth in 2025 was extraordinary by any measure. Eight months after its launch, the company hit over $100 million in annual recurring revenue and raised a $200 million Series A at a roughly $1.8 billion valuation, making it one of Europe’s fastest-growing software startups ever.

By year’s end, Lovable had secured $330 million in Series B funding at about a $6.6 billion valuation, and was rapidly scaling globally.

What makes Lovable meaningful beyond the numbers is what it represents: a shift in how software is built. It demonstrated that AI can democratize development, giving power to non-technical founders, creators, and teams to go from concept to product without traditional engineering barriers.

In an industry long centered on specialized skills and team structures, Lovable’s rise suggested a future where natural language becomes the primary interface to software creation.

On a more hopeful note, 2025 showed signs of a maturing tech culture. Ethical design moved from talking point to practice. Major platforms began experimenting with limits, turning off infinite scroll for teens, adding prompts that nudged users to pause, and treating “time well spent” as a real metric rather than a slogan.

In AI, transparency gained ground. Under pressure from regulators and researchers, companies like OpenAI and Google disclosed more about how their models are trained and where they fall short.

Researchers formed new alliances to share safety techniques, and a second global AI Safety Summit brought dozens of countries together around questions of alignment and control.

None of it amounted to binding rules, but it marked a shift in tone: even the architects of powerful systems openly acknowledged the need for restraint.

Taken together, these moments made 2025 a turning point. For years, technology had surged ahead of the institutions meant to guide it. This year, that gap began to close.

The breakthroughs were real and transformative, but so were the responses to them: laws passed, norms reset, alliances formed. If 2024 was the year the world grasped the power of generative AI, 2025 was the year it began deciding how that power should be used.

The story of technology is no longer just about what can be built, but about how it fits into the lives it shapes, and who gets to decide that fit.

            <div id="article-text">My name is Alexandru Stan, and this article continues the dialogue I began following the acquisition of TNW.

Following the recent transaction, TNW Spaces remains with the Financial Times, while we continue the mission of the website, the events, and the global community.

We already have a dedicated team at tekpon operating the platform, events, and community initiatives. Our objective is to expand and strengthen the team as TNW accelerates its next chapter.

TNW is already a global media platform with millions of readers. We’re not starting over. We are building forward.

Technology is entering a decisive stage: AI is reshaping workflows, distribution is shifting, capital is becoming more selective, and founders are expected to demonstrate value rather than potential.

The world doesn’t need more noise.
It needs clarity, execution, and access to trustworthy knowledge and people.

TNW will serve that need through editorial independence, real expertise, and community-built intelligence.

Success for TNW looks like this: more accurate understanding, faster access to verified knowledge, and direct pathways from insight to action.

I’ve been an entrepreneur since 2007, building in B2B SaaS, marketplaces, and scalable systems. I believe deeply in servant leadership. Without people, I am zero.

I lead two private networks grounded in practice rather than theory:

These groups ensure TNW remains rooted in lived experience, informed by operators, not commentators.

Our mission is to build the most trusted European tech media platform with global reach, focused on practical innovation, responsible scaling, and transparency.

We will continue to host events across Europe’s major capitals including Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Monaco.

These will not be festivals. We are introducing a concept validated through tekpon events: curated gatherings built for meaningful relationships, deep content, and tangible business outcomes.

In 2026, we return to Amsterdam for a special edition centered on AI among other fields. We will explore technologies and strategies shaping the future of work and business:

The editorial focus remains European, while the audience is global.

AI is not a threat to publishing. It is the infrastructure of the next generation of content and knowledge.

At TNW, we will use AI to accelerate research, enable personalized intelligence, reduce noise and bias, and amplify high-quality human expertise. Technology assists. Human judgment remains central.

Because this moment in Europe matters.
Because founders here are ready to scale responsibly.
Because independent media with integrity is rare.
Because innovation deserves a platform built around people, not hype.

TNW will continue its legacy with a renewed emphasis on contribution, execution, and community built through trust.

If you are building, scaling, or researching the next wave of technology, I invite you to engage with us, contribute insights, and participate in shaping the conversation.

The next era begins now. Let’s shape it together.

            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard!

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you. We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.
