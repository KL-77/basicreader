            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Supply shortages and big price increases for RAM and storage have been a major drag for enthusiasts and PC builders in recent months. And while we haven’t yet seen large, widespread price increases for memory-dependent products like pre-built laptop PCs, smartphones, and graphics cards, most companies expect that to change this year if shortages continue.

In the meantime, memory manufacturers are riding high demand and high prices to record profits.

In revenue guidance released this week, Samsung Electronics predicts it will make between 19.9 and 20.1 trillion Korean won in operating profit (roughly $13.8 billion USD) in Q4 2025, compared to just 6.49 trillion won in Q4 of 2024.

Samsung is way more than just a memory business, of course, but its fortunes often rise and fall along with its memory division; Samsung’s profits were dropping dramatically in 2023 partly because of an oversupply of memory that made its memory division lose billions of dollars.

Less-diversified companies that primarily make memory are also raking in money lately. SK Hynix posted its “highest-ever quarterly performance” in Q3 of 2025 with 11.38 trillion Korean won (about $7.8 billion) in operating profit, up from 7.03 trillion in Q3 of 2024, and an operating margin that increased from 40 percent to 47 percent. SK Hynix credits “expanding investments in AI infrastructure” and “surging demand for AI servers” for its performance.

Micron—which recently decided to exit the consumer RAM and storage markets but is still selling its products to other businesses—also reported a big boost to net income year over year, from $1.87 billion in Q1 2025 to $5.24 billion in Q1 2026. This has generated the company’s “highest ever free cash flow.”

“Total company revenue, DRAM and NAND revenue, as well as HBM and data center revenue and revenue in each of our business units, also reached new records [in fiscal Q1],” wrote Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra.

Reading these upbeat earnings reports and forecasts will be cold comfort to people trying to build or upgrade a PC, who have seen the price of a 32GB kit of DDR5-6000 increase from $80 in August 2025 to $340 today. And if the current AI boom continues, it’s not likely to get better in the near term.

This is a problem with a lot of causes—including scalpers who are capitalizing on the shortages by buying up kits just to resell them—but the two biggest ones can be attributed to generative AI companies, and each problem compounds the other.

The first is just that consumers and PC manufacturers get to compete with OpenAI and its ilk for the standard DRAM used for traditional servers and consumer devices. By some estimates, OpenAI’s “Stargate” could use as much as 40 percent of the world’s DRAM output all by itself (though that figure uses production numbers as of 2024 and 2025 and doesn’t take production increases into account).

The second is that the HBM (high-bandwidth memory) used for Nvidia’s AI data center GPUs uses about three times as much space on a silicon wafer as the same amount of standard DDR5. So when memory manufacturers shift their production capacity to HBM instead of DRAM, it disproportionately reduces the amount of DRAM that they can make.

Either of these problems would drive up the prices of RAM a bit, but dealing with increased demand and reduced supply at the same time is what has kicked memory prices into the stratosphere.

As things currently stand, the AI industry’s gargantuan demand for these chips will keep memory prices elevated, possibly for years. According to Bank of America analysts cited by SK Hynix, the average selling price for DRAM will increase by as much as 33 percent in 2026, and the market for just HBM in 2028 could be larger than the entire RAM market was in 2024. Micron’s CEO expects both increased demand and constrained supply “to persist beyond calendar 2026,” suggesting that we could be waiting years and not months for the current crunch to end.

Of course, all of these companies’ forecasts rely on the continued demand for RAM in AI data centers. If there’s an AI bubble and it bursts or deflates, memory manufacturers could find themselves back where Samsung was in 2023—sitting on such big piles of unsold chips that they have to reduce prices to move all the inventory.</div>

            <h2>RFK Jr.’s dietary guidance: Food funnel features slab of red meat, butter</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/rfk-jr-s-dietary-guidelines-beef-tallow-is-in-but-no-booze-for-breakfast/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Agriculture Secretary Brook Rollins unveiled the delayed 2025–2030 Dietary Guidelines for America Wednesday, which is already drawing criticism for its ties to the meat and dairy industry.

Headlining with the advice to “eat real food,” the new guidelines, which are updated every five years, are in a brisk, citation-free 10-page document. Overall, the new guidelines: lambaste added sugars and highly processed foods (though it doesn’t clearly define them); ditch previous limits on alcohol while directing Americans to just drink “less”; beef up recommendations for protein, including red meat; and appear to embrace saturated fats while not actually changing the 2020–2025 recommendation for how much you should eat—which was and continues to be no more than 10 percent of total daily calories.

“We are ending the war on saturated fats,” Kennedy said triumphantly in a White House press briefing Wednesday, despite the lack of a change. He went on to proclaim that “today, our government declares war on added sugar,” though that too is questionable.

While the new guidelines say “no amount of added sugars or non-nutritive sweeteners is recommended,” it offers the suggestion that “one meal should contain no more than 10 grams of added sugars.” There are four calories in one gram of sugar, so the recommendation means no more than 40 calories from sugar per meal. For three meals a day, that’s a max of 120 calories from sugar a day, which on a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet, would be about 6 percent of total calories. The previous recommendation in the 2020–2025 guidelines was to have less than 10 percent of total calories per day from added sugars.

Earning some praise from outside experts, including the American Medical Association, the new guidelines are the first iteration to directly address highly processed foods. While emphasizing “whole, nutrient-dense foods,” it aims for a “dramatic reduction in highly processed foods laden with refined carbohydrates, added sugars, excess sodium, unhealthy fats, and chemical additives.”

While the guidelines don’t provide a clear definition of what constitutes highly processed foods or how consumers can identify them, they do offer some broad examples at various points, including store-bought “chips, cookies, and candy,” and “white bread, ready-to-eat or packaged breakfast options, flour tortillas, and crackers.”

In an effort to steer Americans to healthy choices, the new guidance unveils a new(ish) visual aid—a food pyramid that is upside-down, thus resembling a funnel.

The move at least explains a puzzling trend: Over the past year, Kennedy and other Trump administration officials have repeatedly made reference to the food pyramid—though only to mock and scorn it, often with inaccuracies.

“The dietary guidelines that we inherited from the Biden administration were 453 pages long,” Kennedy said in August, referring to the 2020–2025 guidelines, which are 164 pages long. “They were driven by the same commercial impulses that put Froot Loops at the top of the food pyramid.”

On Wednesday’s unveiling of the new guidelines, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary lamented that, “for decades, we’ve been fed a corrupt food pyramid.”

Not only were Froot Loops never listed on a food pyramid, no food pyramid has been included in federal dietary guidelines for over a decade, raising the question of why the administration was repeatedly attacking a defunct polyhedron. The original food pyramid was introduced in 1992, significantly revised in 2005, and ditched entirely in 2011. Since then, the guidelines have used MyPlate as a visual aid, intended to provide a simplistic depiction of the foods people should eat, in their recommended proportions, on a plate.

The resurrection of a pyramid in its upside-down form clarifies the administration’s geometric obsession. In the new funnel version, though, the food groups are a jumbled spectrum, rather than stacked or divided, leaving proportions up to guesswork. The wide top of the funnel includes a large slab of red meat, a wedge of cheese, a whole roasted bird, broccoli, carrots, and a bag of frozen peas. As it tapers downward, it includes whole milk and unsweetened yogurt, “healthy fats” including olive oil and a stick of butter, as well as fruits and nuts, and then ends with whole grains.

(The written guidance identifies “healthy fats” as olive oil, but also “butter or beef tallow.” Beef tallow is a fat Kennedy has personally endorsed, but is probably harder to easily depict in a drawing.)

The visual guidance seems to create some conflict with the guidelines’ written recommendation to limit saturated fat to 10 percent of total calories, given that red meat and whole-fat dairy contain high amounts of saturated fat.

In a response, the American Heart Association said it was “concerned” about the guidelines, noting that saturated fats, along with salt, are the “primary drivers of cardiovascular disease.” The guidance also suggests that people can eat more than the recommended 2,300 mg limit of sodium a day if they work out to, they said, “offset sweat losses” (no citation included).

Pending scientific evidence suggesting otherwise, the AHA’s stance is for people to reduce sugar and sodium and to “prioritize plant-based proteins, seafood and lean meats and to limit high-fat animal products including red meat, butter, lard and tallow, which are linked to increased cardiovascular risk.”

Another change in the guidelines that is conspicuously missing scientific backing is a rollback of recommendations to limit alcohol. Gone from the federal guidance is the previous hard limit of no more than two drinks a day for men and one drink a day for women. Instead, the guidance encourages Americans to simply drink “less.”

When a reporter asked about this in the press briefing Wednesday, Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, responded, saying, “alcohol is a social lubricant that brings people together.”

“In the best-case scenario, I don’t think you should drink alcohol, but it does allow people an excuse to bond and socialize,” Oz said. “And there’s probably nothing healthier than having a good time with friends in a safe way.” While he emphasized small amounts, he went on to note that in “blue zones,” areas where people seem to live long lives, alcohol is part of diets.

“So, there is alcohol on these dietary guidelines, but the implication is don’t have it for breakfast.”

While the guidelines seem favorable for the alcohol industry, overall, the meat and dairy industry are the clear winners, topping the funnel. Documents released alongside the dietary guidelines identify nine experts who helped craft the final document. Of the nine, at least four have had ties to the meat and dairy industry in the past three years. Those include the National Cattleman’s Beef Association, the National Pork Board, the National Dairy Council, and the California Dairy Research Foundation. Two also had links to General Mills, and one was linked to pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk, maker of weight-loss drug Wegovy among many other medications. The clear conflicts of interest have already drawn criticism from outside nutrition experts.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When it comes to cognitive ability, not all dogs are created equal. Most dogs can learn simple action cues like “sit” or “down.” But so-called “gifted word learner” (GWL) dogs exhibit a remarkable ability to learn the names of objects—for example, learning the names of specific toys so well that they can retrieve them from a large pile of toys on command. And according to a new study published in the journal Science, they can even learn labels for new toys just by overhearing their owners talking about those toys. Per the authors, this suggests that GWL dogs have sociocognitive skills that are functionally comparable to those of 18-month-old human toddlers.

Co-author Claudia Fugazza of Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, Hungary, has been studying canine behavior and cognition for several years as part of the Genius Dog Challenge. For instance, the group’s 2022 study discovered that dogs store key sensory features about their toys—notably what they look like and how they smell—and recall those features when searching for the named toy. Prior studies had suggested that dogs typically rely on vision, or a combination of sight and smell, to locate target objects. GWL dogs can also identify objects based on verbal labels.

In that 2022 study, all the dogs—regardless of whether they were GWL dogs or typical dogs—successfully picked out the target toys in both light and dark conditions, though it took them longer to locate the toys in the dark. Most relied on visual cues, even though dogs possess an excellent sense of smell. However, the dogs sniffed more frequently and longer when searching for the toy in the dark.

The GWL dogs were also able to select the named toys when commanded by their owners, with similar reliance on visual cues—what the toy looks like—augmented by their sense of smell (what the toy smells like), particularly in dark conditions. This confirmed that when dogs play with a toy, they record its features using multiple senses, creating a “multistory mental image.” They prefer to rely primarily on visual cues, but dogs can incorporate other sensory cues, most notably smell, when the conditions call for it.

Last fall, Fugazza’s group built on those findings and concluded that certain dogs can not only memorize the names of objects like their favorite toys, but they can also extend those labels to entirely new objects with a similar function, regardless of whether or not they are similar in appearance. It’s a cognitively advanced ability known as “label extension,” and for animals to acquire it usually involves years of intensive training in captivity. But the dogs in this new study developed the ability to classify their toys by function with no formal training, merely by playing naturally with their owners. It’s akin to a person calling a hammer and a rock by the same name, or a child understanding that “cup” can describe a mug, a glass, or a tumbler because they serve the same function.

This time, Fugazza et al. wanted to investigate how well GWL dogs listen to and learn from human verbal interactions. So they adapted an experimental protocol used to study this ability in children for their canine subjects. All dogs tend to get very excited about new toys, so the subjects (10 GWL dogs) were allowed to play with two new toys first. Then the owners would spend one minute holding the toy and identifying it with a simple label (“This is Toy A” or “This is Toy B”) while directly addressing their dogs. The dogs then played with the toys (both with their owners and on their own) for several minutes with no further mention of the labels.

This training protocol was repeated twice a day for four nonconsecutive days, followed by a label comprehension test. The two new toys were placed on the floor with nine familiar toys in a room out of the owners’ line of sight. Owners would first ask their dogs to retrieve a familiar toy and then ask them to retrieve a new toy using its label (“Can you bring ?”). The label comprehension test was repeated 12 times for both the familiar and new toys.

Next, the entire experiment was repeated with one key variation: This time, during the training protocol, rather than addressing the dogs directly when naming new toys, the dogs merely watched while their owners talked to another person while naming the toys, never directly addressing the dogs at all.

The result: 80 percent of the dogs correctly chose the toys in the direct address condition, and 100 percent did so in the overhearing condition. Taken together, the results demonstrate that GWL dogs can learn new object labels just by overhearing interactions, regardless of whether the dogs are active participants in the interactions or passive listeners—much like what has been observed in young children around a year-and-a-half old.

To learn whether temporal continuity (a nonsocial factor) or the lack thereof affects label learning in GWL dogs, the authors also devised a third experimental variation. The owner would show the dog a new toy, place it in a bucket, let the dog take the toy out of the bucket, and then place the toy back in. Then the owner would lift the bucket to prevent the dog from seeing what was inside and repeatedly use the toy name in a sentence while looking back and forth from the dog to the bucket. This was followed by the usual testing phase. The authors concluded that the dogs didn’t need temporal continuity to form object-label mappings. And when the same dogs were re-tested two weeks later, those mappings had not decayed; the dogs remembered.

But GWL dogs are extremely rare, and the findings don’t extend to typical dogs, as the group discovered when they ran both versions of the experiment using 10 non-GWL border collies. There was no evidence of actual learning in these typical dogs; the authors suggest their behavior reflects a doggy preference for novelty when it comes to toy selection, not the ability to learn object-label mappings.

“Our findings show that the socio-cognitive processes enabling word learning from overheard speech are not uniquely human,” said co-author Shany Dror of ELTE and VetMedUni universities. “Under the right conditions, some dogs present behaviors strikingly similar to those of young children. These dogs provide an exceptional model for exploring some of the cognitive abilities that enabled humans to develop language. But we do not suggest that all dogs learn in this way—far from it.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/grok-assumes-users-seeking-images-of-underage-girls-have-good-intent/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For weeks, xAI has faced backlash over undressing and sexualizing images of women and children generated by Grok. One researcher conducted a 24-hour analysis of the Grok account on X and estimated that the chatbot generated over 6,000 images an hour flagged as “sexually suggestive or nudifying,” Bloomberg reported.

While the chatbot claimed that xAI supposedly “identified lapses in safeguards” that allowed outputs flagged as child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and was “urgently fixing them,” Grok has proven to be an unreliable spokesperson, and xAI has not announced any fixes.

A quick look at Grok’s safety guidelines on its public GitHub confirms they were last updated two months ago. The GitHub also indicates that, despite prohibiting such content, Grok maintains programming that could make it likely to generate CSAM.

Billed as “the highest priority,” superseding “any other instructions” Grok may receive, these rules explicitly prohibit Grok from assisting with queries that “clearly intend to engage” in creating or distributing CSAM or otherwise sexually exploit children.

However, the rules also direct Grok to “assume good intent” and “don’t make worst-case assumptions without evidence” when users request images of young women.

Using words like “‘teenage’ or ‘girl’ does not necessarily imply underage,” Grok’s instructions say.

X declined Ars’ request to comment. The only statement X Safety has made so far shows that Elon Musk’s social media platform plans to blame users for generating CSAM, threatening to permanently suspend users and report them to law enforcement.

Critics dispute that X’s solution will end the Grok scandal, and child safety advocates and foreign governments are growing increasingly alarmed as X delays updates that could block Grok’s undressing spree.

Grok can struggle to assess users’ intent, making it “incredibly easy” for the chatbot to generate CSAM under xAI’s policy, Alex Georges, an AI safety researcher, told Ars.

The chatbot has been instructed, for example, that “there are **no restrictions** on fictional adult sexual content with dark or violent themes,” and Grok’s mandate to assume “good intent” may create gray areas in which CSAM could be created.

There’s evidence that in relying on these guidelines, Grok is currently generating a flood of harmful images on X, with even more graphic images being created on the chatbot’s standalone website and app, Wired reported. Researchers who surveyed 20,000 random images and 50,000 prompts told CNN that more than half of Grok’s outputs featuring images of people sexualize women, with 2 percent depicting “people appearing to be 18 years old or younger.” Some users specifically “requested minors be put in erotic positions and that sexual fluids be depicted on their bodies,” researchers found.

Grok isn’t the only chatbot that sexualizes images of real people without consent, but its policy seems to leave safety at a surface level, Georges said, and xAI is seemingly unwilling to expand safety efforts to block more harmful outputs.

Georges is the founder and CEO of AetherLab, an AI company that helps a wide range of firms—including tech giants like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Amazon—deploy generative AI products with appropriate safeguards. He told Ars that AetherLab works with many AI companies that are concerned about blocking harmful companion bot outputs like Grok’s. And although there are no industry norms—creating a “Wild West” due to regulatory gaps, particularly in the US—his experience with chatbot content moderation has convinced him that Grok’s instructions to “assume good intent” are “silly” because xAI’s requirement of “clear intent” doesn’t mean anything operationally to the chatbot.

“I can very easily get harmful outputs by just obfuscating my intent,” Georges said, emphasizing that “users absolutely do not automatically fit into the good-intent bucket.” And even “in a perfect world,” where “every single user does have good intent,” Georges noted, the model “will still generate bad content on its own because of how it’s trained.”

Benign inputs can lead to harmful outputs, Georges explained, and a sound safety system would catch both benign and harmful prompts. Consider, he suggested, a prompt for “a pic of a girl model taking swimming lessons.”

The user could be trying to create an ad for a swimming school, or they could have malicious intent and be attempting to manipulate the model. For users with benign intent, prompting can “go wrong,” Georges said, if Grok’s training data statistically links certain “normal phrases and situations” to “younger-looking subjects and/or more revealing depictions.”

“Grok might have seen a bunch of images where ‘girls taking swimming lessons’ were young and that human ‘models’ were dressed in revealing things, which means it could produce an underage girl in a swimming pool wearing something revealing,” Georges said. “So, a prompt that looks ‘normal’ can still produce an image that crosses the line.”

While AetherLab has never worked directly with xAI or X, Georges’ team has “tested their systems independently by probing for harmful outputs, and unsurprisingly, we’ve been able to get really bad content out of them,” Georges said.

Leaving AI chatbots unchecked poses a risk to children. A spokesperson for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), which processes reports of CSAM on X in the US, told Ars that “sexual images of children, including those created using artificial intelligence, are child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Whether an image is real or computer-generated, the harm is real, and the material is illegal.”

Researchers at the Internet Watch Foundation told the BBC that users of dark web forums are already promoting CSAM they claim was generated by Grok. These images are typically classified in the United Kingdom as the “lowest severity of criminal material,” researchers said. But at least one user was found to have fed a less-severe Grok output into another tool to generate the “most serious” criminal material, demonstrating how Grok could be used as an instrument by those seeking to commercialize AI CSAM.

In August, xAI explained how the company works to keep Grok safe for users. But although the company acknowledged that it’s difficult to distinguish “malignant intent” from “mere curiosity,” xAI seemed convinced that Grok could “decline queries demonstrating clear intent to engage in activities” like child sexual exploitation, without blocking prompts from merely curious users.

That report showed that xAI refines Grok over time to block requests for CSAM “by adding safeguards to refuse requests that may lead to foreseeable harm&quot;—a step xAI does not appear to have taken since late December, when reports first raised concerns that Grok was sexualizing images of minors.

Georges said there are easy tweaks xAI could make to Grok to block harmful outputs, including CSAM, while acknowledging that he is making assumptions without knowing exactly how xAI works to place checks on Grok.

First, he recommended that Grok rely on end-to-end guardrails, blocking “obvious” malicious prompts and flagging suspicious ones. It should then double-check outputs to block harmful ones, even when prompts are benign.

This strategy works best, Georges said, when multiple watchdog systems are employed, noting that “you can’t rely on the generator to self-police because its learned biases are part of what creates these failure modes.” That’s the role that AetherLab wants to fill across the industry, helping test chatbots for weakness to block harmful outputs by using “an ‘agentic’ approach with a shitload of AI models working together (thereby reducing the collective bias),” Georges said.

xAI could also likely block more harmful outputs by reworking Grok’s prompt style guidance, Georges suggested. “If Grok is, say, 30 percent vulnerable to CSAM-style attacks and another provider is 1 percent vulnerable, that’s a massive difference,” Georges said.

It appears that xAI is currently relying on Grok to police itself, while using safety guidelines that Georges said overlook an “enormous” number of potential cases where Grok could generate harmful content. The guidelines do not “signal that safety is a real concern,” Georges said, suggesting that “if I wanted to look safe while still allowing a lot under the hood, this is close to the policy I’d write.”

X has been very vocal about policing its platform for CSAM since Musk took over Twitter, but under former CEO Linda Yaccarino, the company adopted a broad protective stance against all image-based sexual abuse (IBSA). In 2024, X became one of the earliest corporations to voluntarily adopt the IBSA Principles that X now seems to be violating by failing to tweak Grok.

Those principles seek to combat all kinds of IBSA, recognizing that even fake images can “cause devastating psychological, financial, and reputational harm.” When it adopted the principles, X vowed to prevent the nonconsensual distribution of intimate images by providing easy-to-use reporting tools and quickly supporting the needs of victims desperate to block “the nonconsensual creation or distribution of intimate images” on its platform.

Kate Ruane, the director of the Center for Democracy and Technology’s Free Expression Project, which helped form the working group behind the IBSA Principles, told Ars that although the commitments X made were “voluntary,” they signaled that X agreed the problem was a “pressing issue the company should take seriously.”

“They are on record saying that they will do these things, and they are not,” Ruane said.

As the Grok controversy sparks probes in Europe, India, and Malaysia, xAI may be forced to update Grok’s safety guidelines or make other tweaks to block the worst outputs.

In the US, xAI may face civil suits under federal or state laws that restrict intimate image abuse. If Grok’s harmful outputs continue into May, X could face penalties under the Take It Down Act, which authorizes the Federal Trade Commission to intervene if platforms don’t quickly remove both real and AI-generated non-consensual intimate imagery.

But whether US authorities will intervene any time soon remains unknown, as Musk is a close ally of the Trump administration. A spokesperson for the Justice Department told CNN that the department “takes AI-generated child sex abuse material extremely seriously and will aggressively prosecute any producer or possessor of CSAM.”

“Laws are only as good as their enforcement,” Ruane told Ars. “You need law enforcement at the Federal Trade Commission or at the Department of Justice to be willing to go after these companies if they are in violation of the laws.”

Child safety advocates seem alarmed by the sluggish response. “Technology companies have a responsibility to prevent their tools from being used to sexualize or exploit children,” NCMEC’s spokesperson told Ars. “As AI continues to advance, protecting children must remain a clear and nonnegotiable priority.”</div>

            <h2>ChatGPT Health lets you connect medical records to an AI that makes things up</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/chatgpt-health-lets-you-connect-medical-records-to-an-ai-that-makes-things-up/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Wednesday, OpenAI announced ChatGPT Health, a dedicated section of the AI chatbot designed for “health and wellness conversations” intended to connect a user’s health and medical records to the chatbot in a secure way.

But mixing generative AI technology like ChatGPT with health advice or analysis of any kind has been a controversial idea since the launch of the service in late 2022. Just days ago, SFGate published an investigation detailing how a 19-year-old California man died of a drug overdose in May 2025 after 18 months of seeking recreational drug advice from ChatGPT. It’s a telling example of what can go wrong when chatbot guardrails fail during long conversations and people follow erroneous AI guidance.

Despite the known accuracy issues with AI chatbots, OpenAI’s new Health feature will allow users to connect medical records and wellness apps like Apple Health and MyFitnessPal so that ChatGPT can provide personalized health responses like summarizing care instructions, preparing for doctor appointments, and understanding test results.

OpenAI says more than 230 million people ask health questions on ChatGPT each week, making it one of the chatbot’s most common use cases. The company worked with more than 260 physicians over two years to develop ChatGPT Health and says conversations in the new section will not be used to train its AI models.

“ChatGPT Health is another step toward turning ChatGPT into a personal super-assistant that can support you with information and tools to achieve your goals across any part of your life,” wrote Fidji Simo, OpenAI’s CEO of applications, in a blog post.

But despite OpenAI’s talk of supporting health goals, the company’s terms of service directly state that ChatGPT and other OpenAI services “are not intended for use in the diagnosis or treatment of any health condition.”

It appears that policy is not changing with ChatGPT Health. OpenAI writes in its announcement, “Health is designed to support, not replace, medical care. It is not intended for diagnosis or treatment. Instead, it helps you navigate everyday questions and understand patterns over time—not just moments of illness—so you can feel more informed and prepared for important medical conversations.”

The SFGate report on Sam Nelson’s death illustrates why maintaining that disclaimer legally matters. According to chat logs reviewed by the publication, Nelson first asked ChatGPT about recreational drug dosing in November 2023. The AI assistant initially refused and directed him to health care professionals. But over 18 months of conversations, ChatGPT’s responses reportedly shifted. Eventually, the chatbot told him things like “Hell yes—let’s go full trippy mode” and recommended he double his cough syrup intake. His mother found him dead from an overdose the day after he began addiction treatment.

While Nelson’s case did not involve the analysis of doctor-sanctioned health care instructions like the type ChatGPT Health will link to, his case is not unique, as many people have been misled by chatbots that provide inaccurate information or encourage dangerous behavior, as we have covered in the past.

That’s because AI language models can easily confabulate, generating plausible but false information in a way that makes it difficult for some users to distinguish fact from fiction. The AI models that services like ChatGPT use statistical relationships in training data (like the text from books, YouTube transcripts, and websites) to produce plausible responses rather than necessarily accurate ones. Moreover, ChatGPT’s outputs can vary widely depending on who is using the chatbot and what has previously taken place in the user’s chat history (including notes about previous chats).

Then there’s the issue of unreliable training data, which companies like OpenAI use to create the models. Fundamentally, all major AI language models rely on information pulled from sources of information collected online. Rob Eleveld of the AI regulatory watchdog Transparency Coalition told SFGate: “There is zero chance, zero chance, that the foundational models can ever be safe on this stuff. Because what they sucked in there is everything on the Internet. And everything on the Internet is all sorts of completely false crap.”

So when summarizing a medical report or analyzing a test result, ChatGPT could make a mistake that the user, not being trained in medicine, would not be able to spot.

Even with these hazards, it’s likely that the quality of health-related chats with the AI bot can vary dramatically between users because ChatGPT’s output partially mirrors the style and tone of what users feed into the system. For example, anecdotally, some users claim to find ChatGPT useful for medical issues, though some successes for a few users who know how to navigate the bot’s hazards do not necessarily mean that relying on a chatbot for medical analysis is wise for the general public. That’s doubly true in the absence of government regulation and safety testing.

In a statement to SFGate, OpenAI spokesperson Kayla Wood called Nelson’s death “a heartbreaking situation” and said the company’s models are designed to respond to sensitive questions “with care.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nintendo’s Switch 2 was an unmitigated market success for Nintendo following its launch last June, selling a record-setting 3.5 million units worldwide in its first four days and reaching over 10 million shipments in just under four months. But a new report from The Game Business suggests that frenzied initial sales pace may have slowed significantly in many markets during the system’s crucial first holiday season.

The report suggests that US Switch 2 sales were down about 35 percent during November and December compared to sales of the original Switch in the same period in 2017. In the UK, Switch 2 sales were down 16 percent compared to the original Switch during the last eight weeks of the year. And in France, comparative Switch 2 sales were down 30 percent relative to the Switch for the same period, reflecting what The Game Business says is “a slowdown in Switch 2 sales momentum over the Christmas sales window” across “all major European markets.”

The Switch 2’s relative performance was a little better in Japan, where sales for the holiday period declined just 5.5 percent compared to the original Switch. For the full launch year, though, Japanese Switch 2 sales were up 11 percent compared to the Switch launch, thanks perhaps in part to a cheaper Japan-only version of the console that isn’t subject to the vagaries of international currency valuations.

To be fair, the original Switch’s first holiday season set a high bar for any new Nintendo console to meet. When the Switch proved unexpectedly popular following its March 2017 launch, Nintendo hastily bumped worldwide production by 4 million units to help ameliorate holiday shortages. That helped the first Switch sell 15 million units in its first full year on store shelves, roughly mirroring the initial sales mania for the Nintendo Wii a decade earlier.

Lingering sales of the original Switch might also be contributing to the relatively weak holiday performance for the Switch 2. In the UK, at least, the older console is still selling well enough to buoy Nintendo’s overall holiday hardware sales in the country to 7 percent higher than what the company achieved in 2017.

That said, the transition from record-setting launch sales to relatively underwhelming holiday sales is a worrying sign for the Switch 2’s market momentum. A lack of system-selling Switch 2 exclusive games could explain that movement. In 2017, the October launch of Super Mario Odyssey built holiday excitement for the Switch on top of earlier hits like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. For the Switch 2, holiday releases like Pokémon Legends Z-A and Metroid Prime 4 don’t seem to have had as much impact as early system sellers like Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza.

Thus far, Nintendo’s planned 2026 schedule doesn’t seem primed to offer many big-name exclusive software to turn things around. The year’s first-party lineup is currently anchored by standard sequels for second-tier franchises like Yoshi, Mario Tennis, and Fire Emblem, alongside slightly upgraded “Switch 2 Edition” re-releases of popular Switch games. Aside from Nintendo’s own titles, the planned 2026 release of FromSoft’s Bloodborne-esque Duskbloods as a Switch 2 exclusive could make some fans of the company’s Souls-like games take a second look at the hardware.

Nintendo is likely to announce more Switch 2 exclusives and ports in the coming months, of course. Having a few system-selling blockbusters in that slate could be crucial to propping up the Switch 2’s sales now that pent-up launch-window demand seems largely satiated.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After a Tesla in Full Self-Driving mode suddenly swerved off of a busy highway and almost straight into a ditch, the owner of the vehicle praised the driving technology to high heaven for supposedly saving his skin.

“Tesla FSD saved my life last night on Interstate 95 in South Carolina,” wrote the driver, who goes by the display name “The Electric Israeli.”

“Car in front braked hard suddenly. FSD veered to the left and got back safely on the road,” he explained. “Thank you @Tesla_AI.”

The user, who also calls himself “Dr. Moshe,” helpfully uploaded footage of the incident, and it paints FSD’s supposedly heroic intervention in a far more dubious light.

During a night commute, the video shows the Tesla tailing an SUV in front of it at a reasonable enough distance. But when the SUV brakes and slows down, neither FSD nor Moshe take notice. There’s ample time to react, but instead of gradually slowing down to respond to the SUV in front, the Tesla’s self-driving software brakes at the last second and veers off the road, nearly plunging into the depressed center of the grass median.

The dramatic intervention affords us a view of the road ahead: miles of bumper-to-bumper traffic, meaning that both driver and driving software had no excuse not to be ready for another stop.

Seemingly intended to exculpate FSD, Moshe wrote in a follow-up tweet: “We noticed at the same time.”

Tesla FSD saved my life last night on Interstate 95 in South Carolina. Car in front braked hard suddenly. FSD veered to the left and got back safely on the road. Thank you @Tesla_AI pic.twitter.com/WpvXto5qla

Why FSD swerved off the road is anyone’s guess. Hindsight is 20/20, and backseat driving is seldom F1-worthy, but it sure looks like that the Tesla wasn’t in danger of rear-ending the SUV, even though it braked late. The maneuver, we’d hazard, was totally pointless. And had the median been something other than a fairly level stretch of grass, it could’ve ended up a lot worse.

Such is the blind devotion of the Tesla fan. When one man’s Cybertruck running FSD wrapped itself around a pole last year, its owner also praised the automaker. “Thank you @Tesla for engineering the best passive safety in the world,” they wrote after the accident.

A Model Y owner was similarly thankful — or in the owner’s words, “insanely grateful” — after FSD obliterated a deer at full speed while making no attempt to slow down, footage showed, even after acknowledging that Tesla’s service was terrible.

A reminder that Full Self-Driving isn’t actually fully self-driving, and is not classified as autonomous driving software, but rather as a driving assistance feature. Of course, like many Elon Musk products, it commands cultish loyalty even as it’s being investigated by a federal regulator over frequent reports of it driving straight into the path of oncoming trains at railroad crossings. Life-saving tech indeed.

            <h2>Kawasaki’s Robot Horse Is Going Into Production</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-08</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Back in April, we came across a flashy and almost entirely CGI video of a bizarre concept for a rideable, four-legged robotic “horse.”

The video showed the mysterious concept, dubbed Corleo, roaming rocky terrain, leaping over icy crevasses, crossing snowy landscapes without losing its footing, and traversing a dark forest at night — all while carrying an adult rider on its back and being powered by a hydrogen power cell.

While the company behind the idea, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, showed off a full-scale model at an exposition at the time, promising a production-ready device by the far-off date of 2050, we had a lot of trouble believing Corleo was little more than pure vaporware.

But the company has now announced that it’s started to work on turning its ambitious vision into a reality, and decades ahead of schedule. As New Atlas reports, Kawasaki is setting up a dedicated “Safe Adventure Business Development Team,” with the aim of showing off a functioning prototype at the Expo 2030 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

The company is hoping to put the unusual motorcycle on legs on sale by 2035, a lofty plan that still keeps the delivery way well in the future to avoid near-term embarrassment — we’re looking at you, Elon Musk!

According to a press release, Kawasaki is also developing a “riding simulator that enables riding experience of the four-legged mobility vehicle.”

Beyond targeting thrill seekers, the company also suggests that Corleo could be used to “eliminate mountain accidents and make mountainous regions safe and enjoyable for everyone.”

Sure, it may sound like a promising start — but there are plenty of reasons to remain skeptical. For one, achieving the kind of agility the company showed off in its original marketing video will likely remain an enormous engineering challenge.

What exactly a production-ready prototype will be able to do at the Expo 2030 — a mere four years from now — remains unclear as well.

On the other hand, we’ve seen the field of robotics make major leaps and bounds, with an onslaught of humanoid robots that can dance, kickbox, and even cook up an elaborate breakfast. Four-legged robots have similarly learned to effortlessly navigate rugged landscapes and even herd sheep.

In short, for now we’ll reserve judgment — but we’re nonetheless excited about the prospect of a robotic horse that we can ride into the sunset, not unlike Aloy, the protagonist of the popular video game series “Horizon.”

            <div id="article-text">What makes a conspiracy theorist? Is it poor education, an overactive imagination, a tinfoil hat? According to one recent study, it isn’t any of that stuff, but instead something psychologically revealing: a deep insecurity about the world they inhabit.

The study, published in the journal Applied Cognitive Psychology, examined 14 variables in demographics, ideology, and personality for links to conspiratorial thinking. Some 253 adults were recruited to participate in the study, primarily from the UK, US, Canada, and South Africa, with an average age of 49 years old.

Specifically, the researchers were interested in exploring factors that might influence whether a person has “beliefs about cover-ups.” This is the blanket idea that powerful organizations or collectives are concealing the truth from the entire world, which only the conspiracy-minded can see through.

“I have long been interested in conspiracy theories, having published around 20 papers on the topic over the past decade or so,” the study’s lead author and professor of psychology at the Norwegian Business School, Adrian Furnham, told PsyPost. “Few, if any, researchers have taken into account the ‘cover up’ perspective of conspiracy believers.”

To consistently measure conspiratorial thinking, the researchers created a 10-point scale, corresponding to responses to statements such as “politicians usually do not tell us the true motives for their decisions” and “government agencies closely monitor all citizens.” Participants also took a personality assessment called the High Potential Trait Indicator (HTPI), which measures six traits including competitiveness and tolerance of ambiguity.

When all was said and done, one of the main factors researchers found a strong correlation between endorsement of conspiracy theories and an intriguing characteristic: a low tolerance of ambiguity.

In other words, people who feel insecure or uncomfortable when they don’t know all the answers, or who can’t grasp that some situations are complex, multidimensional, and puzzling even to experts. Presented with a complicated set of issues or events, these folks were more likely to sign on to a hare-brained conspiracy theory that offered an easy answer, even if it was wrong, or an oversimplification.

There was also a significant correlation between those who believe that the world is fundamentally unfair — from a “human nature” point of view — and those who subscribe to far-fetched theories. Those who believe in an “unjust world,” the researchers found, were also more inclined to believe in shadowy groups pulling the strings.

Contrary to what many may think, the researchers found no correlation between a person’s level of education and their capacity to believe in absurd conspiracies. Basically, this suggests that intelligence isn’t a factor determining whether a person falls into a conspiracy rabbithole, which paints a far different picture of conspiracy theorists than the one we typically see.

Going forward, more research with a much larger sample size is needed to expand the findings. Still, it’s a fascinating glimpse at the factors that could shape conspiratorial thinking — concrete evidence that when faced with uncertainty, some of us really do prefer simple lies to complicated truths.

            <h2>Astronaut on Space Station Suffers Medical Issue</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A simple medical issue as mundane as an infection is far more dangerous when orbiting the Earth hundreds of miles above the surface in a confined spacecraft.

Apollo 7 astronaut Wally Schirra famously came down with a nasty head cold a mere 15 hours into the mission in 1967, with ground control warning him he could shatter his eardrums while returning to Earth with bad congestion. Given the lack of gravity, even a runny nose can turn into an extremely unpleasant experience, forcing astronauts to resort to unusual measures just to drain mucus from their nasal passages.

In short, there are compelling reasons to be extremely cautious about any possibility of illness when it comes to space travel, particularly given the lack of comprehensive medical equipment or specialized health professionals in orbit.

That’s why it’s striking that on Thursday, NASA announced that it was forced to postpone a January 8 spacewalk, citing a “medical concern.”

According to the carefully-worded update, the “matter involved a single crew member who is stable.”

The situation is still developing, and we have far more questions than answers. We don’t know if the astronaut has fallen ill or has suffered an injury. However, given NASA’s description, it sounds like it could be a fairly serious situation.

“Safely conducting our missions is our highest priority, and we are actively evaluating all options, including the possibility of an earlier end to Crew-11’s mission,” the statement reads, referring to a mission that saw a crew of four travel to the ISS in August on board a SpaceX Crew Dragon.

“These are the situations NASA and our partners train for and prepare to execute safely,” NASA wrote.

The Crew-11 crew, which includes NASA astronauts Mike Fincke and Zena Cardman, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui, and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov, arrived at the station on August 2 and is, at the time of writing, scheduled to return to Earth next month, following the mid-February launch of the Crew-12 launch.

As CNN points out, NASA doesn’t usually speak openly about medical conditions affecting its astronauts. However, there has been plenty of research into the effects of microgravity on the human body.

Prolonged space travel has been shown to affect astronauts’ vision, bone density, and blood circulation. A 2020 study, for instance, points out that blood can clot in an astronaut’s jugular vein, but how much of a danger this poses to astronauts remains unclear.

An astronaut and Crew-8 mission crew member, who returned to Earth in October 2024, had to be hospitalized upon their return. The crew member stayed overnight for observation due to a “minor medical issue.”

“To protect the crew member’s medical privacy, specific details on the individual’s condition or identity will not be shared,” NASA wrote in an update at the time.

To this day, we still don’t know why the astronaut was hospitalized — suggesting we may get little clarity on the currently unfolding situation, either.

However, NASA has promised “further updates within the next 24 hours.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Forget Mars. For 28 member of China’s astronaut corps, the brave new world is a dark, damp hole in the ground — cut off from light, wind, and even the internet.

As reported by Space News, the China Astronaut Research and Training Center (CARTC) just wrapped up a month-long training regimen meant to prepare future and veteran astronauts for lunar landing missions. The astronauts were split into four groups, each of which spent nearly a week in underground isolation.

While they were down there, each team completed work in cave mapping, environmental monitoring, long-distance communication, as well as psychological and behavioral training, according to the China National Space Administration.

While it isn’t known which cave the astronauts braved, the CNSA notes the system was located somewhere in the Wulong District of Chongqing. This area is home to massive karst formations like the Wulong Three Bridges, the largest natural stone arches in Asia, as well as the Xiaozhai Heavenly Pit, the world’s largest sinkhole. It also contains the famous Furong Cave, a UNESCO world heritage site and one of the largest limestone caverns in the world.

CARTC researchers had been scouting caves across China for the training program since 2016. At least 10 alternative caves were also considered, in regions like Guangxi, Hunan, and Guizhou. After rating each cavern based on metrics like training challenge, geological stability, and safety, program administrators settled on the one in Chongqing, where conditions most accurately resembled the “extreme environment of space,” the CNSA said.

The training mirrored a similar program run by the European Space Agency, called the Cooperative Adventure for Valuing and Exercising human behavior and performance Skills (CAVES). One of the directors of the Chinese cave training, veteran astronaut Ye Guangfu, also participated in a 2016 CAVES training in a European cavern.

“Compared with the cave training in Europe, our support team inside the cave intervened as little as possible,” Ye told the state news agency Xinhua. “This approach pushed astronauts to rely on their own judgment, unlocking both individual initiative and their full problem-solving potential.”

“It was so dark that I couldn’t see my own hands in front of my face,” Tang Hongbo told the agency. A veteran of the Shenzhou-12 and Shenzhou-17 spaceflight missions, Tang served as commander of the second team to face the underground trials. “In that kind of darkness, the mental pressure is overwhelming.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the future, you may not need to get a new prescription for your eye glasses — because a Finnish company called IXI is claiming to have manufactured the world’s first eyeglasses that can adjust their corrective lenses automatically.

These special glasses have “dynamic lenses” made of liquid crystals, which can transform to accommodate whatever focal length the user’s eyesight requires, IXI CEO Niko Eiden told CNN.

That makes them a far cry from old fashioned bifocals, which are eyeglasses with two different prescriptions in the same lens that are clearly separated by a seam, or progressive glasses (also called varifocal lenses), which are similar to bifocals but use a progression of lenses instead of a hard divider.

Eyeglasses that can autofocus automatically would be a huge leap for the tech, which hasn’t changed much since progressive lens were first developed in 1950s Germany.

“The eyewear industry hasn’t really been innovating for vision correction,” Eiden told CNN. “Maybe 10, 15 years from now people will be wondering, how did we wear those fixed focus glasses in the old days?”

Tiny LEDs inside the IXI frame bounce invisible infrared light into your eyes while photodiodes, also within the slim eyeglass frame, pick up the reflection on your eyeballs while measuring and tracking what you’re looking at. Then it converts that reflection and data into electrical signals that control the liquid crystals; like bifocals or progressives, the IXI has a reading area within the lens for near sighted vision, but that disappears entirely if it detects your eyes looking to the far distance.

The venture has attracted more than $36.5 billion from Amazon and other investors. It’s not clear when the eyeglasses will be available for the public to buy, though Eiden told CNN that they’ll launch sometime next year. Meanwhile, there’s a waiting list live on the company’s site.

IXI isn’t the only company pursuing dynamic autofocus lens with liquid crystals; CNN reports that a Japanese company called Elcyo is developing its own version, while another Japanese outfit called ViXion is currently selling autofocus glasses, though they look pretty clunky with two tiny apertures in the lens that a user must look through in order for the glasses to work. The IXI glasses look like ordinary glasses, by comparison.

But there’s a catch with the IXI glasses — they need to be charged along with your other gadgets taking up precious real estate on your nightstand, and will brick to their “base” prescription if they run out of batteries. And these specs, which will no doubt be more expensive than ordinary lo-fi eyeglasses, will be harder to fix or replace — a major negative for people who don’t want another gadget to maintain.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Building software products has never been easier, so why are so many well-funded startups failing to take off no matter how good their product is? In this season finale episode of Build Mode, our guest has an answer: Startups have focused too much on product development and not enough on distribution excellence. Paul Irving is partner and COO at GTMfund, which operates under the thesis that distribution is the final moat in the AI era.

The traditional go-to-market playbook lays out a one-size-fits-all approach to hiring and scaling that may have worked in the days of traditional enterprise SaaS but won’t cut it in the crowded, AI-driven startup era of 2025. Innovation cycles are moving faster than ever, and what used to take several years can now be achieved in just a few months. So Irving and the GTMfund team advise their portfolio companies to differentiate in their distribution rather than their product.

“The aperture for how you build your go-to-market or revenue engine and the decisions you make to get there have never had more unique and specific pathways depending on your company,” Irving said.

In this episode, Irving dove into several specific examples of what he’s seen work for startups. The main takeaways: AI can help small teams hone their data-driven approach and find direct lines to their customer base through creative means; in the early days, founders can’t tackle all distribution channels at once; hiring should be approached thoughtfully without a traditional mindset; and building a team of trusted advisers should be a top priority.

Early-stage investors, at least at GTMfund, aren’t looking for startups that have spent half their budget on paid ads or hired a full sales team. They want to see founders get creative with how they reach their unique customers. Irving laid out an example of one startup that became an active participant in several relevant Facebook groups. “If you think about it in the framework of, okay, it’s a thousand people, but 700 of them are my actual ICP and buyer because of the specific groups that either we started as a company or the ones that we’ve become the most active posters in. It can become a really unique channel if you’re looking to bring on 40, 50, 60 new customers in a given year,” he said.

Irving argues that the aperture for going to market has never been broader, so it’s crucial for founders to carve out a creative approach for reaching their target customer. However, founders can’t and shouldn’t do it alone. A refrain throughout this conversation is the importance of a robust network. GTMfund provides their portfolio companies with a vast network of operators, but they won’t just hand founders a Rolodex — they create bespoke pairings to ensure that there will be value in the meeting for everyone involved.

“I think what’s wonderful about the venture-backed ecosystem more generally is people’s willingness to help. They know how hard it is to build a company. They know how low the likelihood of success is in the grand scheme of things, but people are always willing. If you come and you’re curious, you teach them something as part of that as well. People are usually willing to open up doors,” Irving said.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/critics-pan-spyware-maker-nsos-transparency-claims-amid-its-push-to-enter-us-market/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">NSO Group, one of the most well-known and controversial makers of government spyware, released a new transparency report on Wednesday, as the company enters what it described as “a new phase of accountability.”

But the report, unlike NSO’s previous annual disclosures, lacks details about how many customers the company rejected, investigated, suspended, or terminated due to human rights abuses involving its surveillance tools. While the report contains promises to respect human rights and have controls to demand its customers do the same, the report provides no concrete evidence supporting either.

Experts and critics who have followed NSO and the spyware market for years believe the report is part of an effort and campaign by the company to get the U.S. government to remove the company from a blocklist — technically called the Entity List — as it hopes to enter the U.S. market with new financial backers and executives at the helm.

Last year, a group of U.S. investors acquired the company, and since then, NSO has been undergoing a transition that included high-profile personnel changes: former Trump official David Friedman was appointed the new executive chairman; CEO Yaron Shohat stepped down; and Omri Lavie, the last remaining founder who was still involved in the company, also left, as Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported.

“When NSO’s products are in the right hands within the right countries, the world is a far safer place. That will always be our overriding mission,” Friedman wrote in the report, which does not mention any country where NSO operates.

Natalia Krapiva, the senior tech-legal counsel at Access Now, a digital rights organization that investigates spyware abuses, told TechCrunch: “NSO is clearly on a campaign to get removed from the U.S. Entity List and one of the key things they need to show is that they have dramatically changed as a company since they were listed.”

“Changing the leadership is one part and this transparency report is another,” said Krapiva.

“However, we have seen this before with NSO and other spyware companies over the years where they change names and leadership and publish empty transparency or ethics reports but the abuses continue.”

“This is nothing but another attempt at window dressing and the U.S. government should not be taken for a fool,” said Krapiva.

Ever since the Biden administration added NSO to the Entity List, the company has lobbied to have its restrictions lifted. After President Donald Trump took office again last year, NSO intensified these efforts. But, as of May last year, NSO had failed to sway the new administration.

In late December, the Trump administration lifted sanctions against three executives tied to the Intellexa spyware consortium, in what some saw as a sign of a shift in the administration’s attitude toward spyware makers.

This year’s transparency report, which covers 2025, has fewer details than reports from previous years.

In an earlier transparency report covering 2024, for example, NSO said it opened three investigations of potential misuse. Without naming the customers, the company said it cut ties with one, and imposed on another customer “alternative remediation measures,” including mandating human rights training, monitoring the customer activities, and requesting more information about how the customer uses the system. NSO did not provide any information about the third investigation.

NSO also said that during 2024, the company rejected more than $20 million “in new business opportunities due to human rights concerns.”

In the transparency report published the prior year, covering 2022 and 2023, NSO said it suspended or terminated six government customers, without naming them, claiming these actions resulted in a revenue loss of $57 million.

In 2021, NSO said it had “disconnected” the systems of five customers since 2016 following an investigation of misuse, resulting in more than $100 million in “estimated loss of revenue,” and it also said that it “discontinued engagements” with five customers due to “concerns regarding human rights.”

NSO’s newest transparency report does not include the total number of customers NSO has, statistics that have been consistently present in previous reports.

TechCrunch asked NSO spokesperson Gil Lanier to provide similar statistics and figures, but did not receive answers by press time.

John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at The Citizen Lab, a human rights organization that has investigated spyware abuses for more than a decade, criticized NSO.

“I was expecting information, numbers,” Scott-Railton told TechCrunch. “Nothing in this document allows outsiders to verify NSO’s claims, which is business as usual from a company that has a decade-long history of making claims that later turned out to be misrepresentation.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">​XBrew Lab debuted its countertop nitro beverage machine, EverNitro, at CES this week, offering nitro coffee enthusiasts a more accessible way to enjoy the drink — without the waste and expense of traditional cartridge-based machines.

If you’re unfamiliar with nitro coffee, it’s cold brew coffee infused with nitrogen gas. This process creates tiny bubbles, resulting in a silky-smooth, naturally sweeter taste — similar to drinking a Guinness. Many people also note that nitro coffee is less bitter.

EverNitro is positioning itself against competitors such as NitroBrew as a long-term more affordable all-in-one solution. “We offer the quality of a commercial tap with the footprint of a coffee maker. While others sell you gas, we give you technology to harvest it for free,” founder and CEO Terry Tan said.

​The company claims EverNitro delivers 95% nitrogen purity and highlights its ability to generate nitrogen directly from the surrounding air. By eliminating the need for single-use cartridges, the device provides a less expensive, environmentally friendly solution for home use.

After testing it ourselves, we were pleasantly surprised. The machine is simple to use, and it fits easily on a counter or stores comfortably on a shelf — making it a nice addition to any kitchen or bar setup. The canister accommodates coffee, cocktails for that bar-quality touch, or other beverages. Users can select their preferred pressure, which ranges from 0 to 8 BAR (a metric unit of pressure).

The entire process, from loading your beverage to enjoying the finished drink, takes only minutes. There’s also a companion app that delivers updates.

The device launched on Kickstarter in October and raised over $570,000 — a testament to strong interest in this product despite its premium price point. The Lite option costs $470 and includes just the machine and canister, while backers can purchase it for $290. The Pro version is $583 (or $337 for backers) and comes with the machine, two canisters, a coffee bean preservation jar, and whipped cream kits.​ Yet, for comparison’s sake, a countertop unit of NitroBrew costs about $1,000.

Looking ahead, Tan told TechCrunch that the team is “exploring how gases can fundamentally elevate the texture of all beverages, not just coffee. Imagine a machine that doesn’t just dispense; it intelligently mixes a cocktail or brews a coffee and then automatically selects the perfect gas profile to enhance its body and mouthfeel.”

            <h2>I watched LG’s new home robot CLOid do laundry but I have questions</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/i-watched-lgs-new-home-robot-cloid-do-laundry-but-i-have-questions/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">CES is always chock-full of robots, and this year electronics giant LG announced a new bot, dubbed CLOid, that it claims will revolutionize household chores (as in, you won’t have to do them anymore).

CLOid is described as an AI-powered home robot, designed to assist its user with a wide variety of domestic tasks — from folding laundry to making breakfast to patrolling a home for signs of trouble. The company says that, eventually, it envisions the device “evolving into an ambient-care agent that supports everyday life.”

The bot was announced during LG’s keynote earlier this week, but it was also available for inspection via rolling presentations on the convention room floor. I went to check one out, where I saw the bot, alongside a human presenter, performing a variety of tasks for an enthusiastic audience.

CLOid has autonomous movement, so it can get around by itself, and comes equipped with a variety of cameras and sensors that, when paired with LG’s smart home ThinQ app, can leverage situational and environmental data to make proactive suggestions for how to make its user’s life better, LG says.

The bot also has speakers so it can communicate with its user. LG says that CLOid runs off a vision language model that converts “images and video into structured, language-based understanding” and a vision language action program that can convert verbal commands into action (you know, like Siri).

The last few years have seen the introduction of a number of domestic robots, including Amazon’s Astro and Enabot’s EBO X. CLOid follows in their footsteps but seems designed for a broader array of domestic tasks than its predecessors. Unlike Astro and EBO (which are little more than squat, rolling automatons), CLOid has a large upper body and two arms — a physicality clearly designed to lift stuff and interact with its environment.

You’d think that would lead to some impressive results, right? Unfortunately, at the presentation I saw, CLOid didn’t do a whole lot. I saw the bot very gingerly take a shirt out of a basket and place it into a dryer. I also saw it pick up a croissant and (again, very gingerly) place it into an oven. In addition to the live performance from the bot, the presentation was intercut with highly produced videos of the bot in a number of hypothetical scenarios where it might prove useful to potential users.

CLOid was cute, and seemed affable enough, but the biggest thing you notice is how slow it is. During Tuesday’s presentation, when his human counterpart asked CLOid to make him some breakfast, the robot trundled over to the refrigerator, waited for the automatic door to open, and then stared into the fridge’s depths for an uncomfortably long period of time before ultimately selecting milk.

Yes, even the most lethargic human would likely win in a race against CLOid. However, speed isn’t really the issue here. The idea is to make sure that the bot’s human companion doesn’t have to do any work at all. It’s part of what LG refers to as its “Zero Labor Home” model, where automation takes care of all of those boring but essential domestic chores. You can be off brushing your teeth or answering a call from your boss while the bot is in the next room, prepping pancakes. That’s the idea, at least.

From the available presentation, it’s a little unclear when that idea will become a reality. I was unable to find out if and when the bot would actually be available to the public. A disclaimer at the bottom of the presentation’s videos read: “Products and solutions shown in this video are under development and not been released for commercial use, thus specifications may vary.”

An on-site LG communications staffer told me that CLOid would be available in the future, but she didn’t know when. I reached out to LG’s Home Solutions team for more information.

Thus, like a lot of other robots on display at CES, CLOid felt a little more like an ad for its company’s potential than an accurate representation of what it is currently offering. The bot also seemed well positioned to help market LG’s new AI home ecosystem, which represents a broader array of impressive smart home products, the bulk of which seem like easier lifts for consumers than a new robot in their home.

I got a brief tour of some of the latest editions of those products. In addition to the return of the LG Wallpaper (having spent a few minutes staring into its insanely thin but beautifully hypnotic surface, I can safely say I want one), the company had a variety of appliances on display this week, including an AI-powered oven that can identify particular ingredients and recommend recipes for you, and an AI refrigerator that you can talk to. All of these devices are supposed to synch with CLOid and are controllable via the company’s ThinQ app.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Internet connectivity collapsed across Iran on Thursday amid nationwide protests, according to web monitoring firms.

“I think we’re at a near-total disconnection from the outside world now,” Amir Rashidi, an Iranian cybersecurity researcher who works for the nonprofit Miaan Group, told TechCrunch.

Doug Madory, the director of internet analysis at Kentik, a company that monitors internet traffic worldwide, concurred, telling TechCrunch that Iran’s internet has been in “near-total blackout” since around 11:30 a.m. on the U.S. east coast on Thursday, or 8 p.m. local time in Tehran.

Internet traffic monitor NetBlocks, internet infrastructure company Cloudflare, and internet connectivity tracking site IODA, all registered sudden drops in connectivity across Iran at the same time.

“We continue to see a small amount of traffic, but the country is effectively completely offline,” David Belson, the head of data insight at Cloudflare, told TechCrunch.

At the end of December, protests erupted in several cities in Iran, following a sharp drop in the value of the country’s currency, prompting shortages of goods and dramatic spikes in prices. Some shops in Tehran’s traditional bazaar have been closed for 11 days, according to The New York Times.

Iran’s government has responded by violently cracking down on the protesters.

The Iranian government, which maintains a tight control over the country’s internet access, is behind the internet blackout, according to Rashidi.

Representatives for the Iranian government in the United States did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment. The Iranian Foreign Ministry’s website was down at the time of publication.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI is kicking off the new year with yet another acqui-hire. The AI giant is acquiring the team behind Convogo, a business software platform that helps executive coaches, consultants, talent leaders, and HR teams automate and improve leadership assessments and feedback reporting.

An OpenAI spokesperson said the company is not acquiring Convogo’s IP or technology, but rather hiring the team to work on its “AI cloud efforts.” The three co-founders — Matt Cooper, Evan Cater, and Mike Gillett — will join OpenAI as part of what a source familiar with the matter called an all-stock deal.

The startup began as a “weekend hackathon” sparked by a question by Cooper’s mother, who is an executive coach: Could an AI tool automate the drudgery of report writing so she could spend more time on the human coaching work she loves? Over the past two years, Convogo has helped “thousands” of coaches and partnered with the “world’s top leadership development firms,” per an email bearing news of the acquisition sent by Convogo.

In the email, the team wrote that the real problem they uncovered in their work is how to bridge the gap between what is possible with each new model release and how to translate that into real-world outcomes.

“We’re convinced now more than ever that the key to bridging that gap lies in thoughtful, purpose-built experiences, like what we’ve built for coaches at Convogo,” the founders wrote. “That’s why we’re thrilled to join OpenAI to continue our work of making AI accessible and useful to professionals in every industry.”

The Convogo acqui-hire marks OpenAI’s ninth acquisition in the span of a year, per PitchBook data. In nearly all of those acquisitions, the product was either folded into OpenAI’s ecosystem — as in the case of Sky, the AI interface for Mac, or Statsig, a product testing firm — or completely shut down as the team joined OpenAI, as in the cases of Roi, Context.ai, and Crossing Minds.

The Convogo deal also signals that OpenAI, like its competitors, is using M&A as a talent and capability accelerator. The main exception to that rule is OpenAI’s acquisition of Jonny Ive’s io Products, which is continuing its product roadmap as the two companies work together to create a piece of AI hardware.

            <div id="article-text">People look at you differently when you carry a Geiger counter. Or, at least, when you carry a Geiger counter and exclaim things like “Much less radiation here than you might expect!” But how else are you to know that the radiation in your food is at acceptable levels?

They have government inspectors for this, you might say. It is their job.

Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.

That was before Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency started hacking away at our bureaucracy. Before the federal government was shut down for much of the fall. And before I bought a Geiger counter to do my own food inspections.

For a while—maybe since 1883, when the Pendleton Act created a merit-based civil service of experts—we, as a nation, thought to ourselves: Life is too short for everyone to inspect their own food. Let the government handle this. But then along came the Trump administration to wonder: What if we didn’t?

FDA inspections at foreign food manufacturers are at historic lows because of staffing cuts, according to ProPublica. My Geiger counter cost $22.79. I thought it would give me a sense of agency and reassurance in this era of dismantlement. Instead, buying the Geiger counter was the first step toward losing my mind.

While the Trump administration conducted a sweeping experiment in government erosion, I started an experiment of my own. As each government function was targeted for cuts—or an official suggested that it was standing between me and my freedom—I put it on my to-do list, as a way to feel like I was doing something other than fretting about what was not being done.

About 300,000 civil servants—roughly 10 percent of the federal workforce—left their job between January and late November last year, according to the Office of Personnel Management. In February 2025, hundreds of weather forecasters and other employees of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were canned. In June, the National Science Foundation was told it had to leave its headquarters. In the fall, during the shutdown, about 1,400 nuclear-security employees were furloughed, and the ranks of air-traffic controllers continued to dwindle.

There is a concept called “mental load”—the weight of knowing all the Things That Need to Get Done Around the House. Someone has to know when to do laundry, take out the trash, buy groceries, locate the winter clothes, cook dinner, set a budget, vacuum, etc. This is the kind of labor that, if not properly divided, ruins marriages and drives people to the brink.

Now multiply that mental load by 343 million. That’s the number of people in the house of America. You can’t worry only about buying the groceries; you must also worry about whether those groceries are radioactive. You don’t just have to make sure the kids are dressed for the weather; you must also forecast the weather. It’s not enough to merely buy eggs; you must also know how much eggs should cost, and what they cost last week, because the economy sort of depends on it.

What became a five-month quest to assume government responsibilities took me from the overgrown fields of Antietam to the cramped basket of a hot-air balloon about 1,400 feet over Ohio; from a biology lab at Johns Hopkins University, where I beheaded flies, to a farmstead in Maryland, where I inspected the fly-bothered udder of a cow named Melissa.

And the potential duties kept piling up as I learned about each round of cuts. Since I started typing this paragraph, Donald Trump has fired many of the people who surveil infectious diseases; before I finish typing this paragraph, he may have hired them back. I hope so! I would do almost anything for a good story, but perhaps I should draw the line at “monitor Ebola.”

John F. Kennedy famously implored us: “Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country.” Well, I asked! And the answer is: lots of things. If you don’t mind doing them wrong.

I have just driven six and a half hours to Ohio in order to forecast my own weather. From a hot-air balloon.

“Anyone that tells you they’re not afraid of heights is either lying or insane,” Tim the balloon pilot is telling me. It is 5 p.m. on a clear Tuesday in September, and we are getting ready, in a field outside Columbus, to go up and find weather. Tim has a trim white beard and a confident demeanor that I find reassuring. There are two kinds of balloonists, Tim tells me: old ones and bold ones. He is the former.

Weather forecasting is among the legion of chores that the government does, or used to do more thoroughly, through NOAA, whose budget the Trump administration attempted to slash—a scenario that would “stop all progress” in U.S. forecasting, as James Franklin, a former branch chief at the National Hurricane Center, told USA Today.

In the founding days of the country, individuals collected weather data alone, without the aid of computers, weather balloons, or modeling. George Washington kept a fairly detailed weather diary. Behold his entry for April 14, 1787: “Mercury at 62 in the Morning—74 at Noon and 68 at Night. Cloudy in the Morning with a few drops of rain.” But while journaling is fine if you want to know what the weather was, most people want to know what the weather will be. For that, you need other people.

The advent of the telegraph allowed weather watchers to share observations and data across great distances, in almost real time. This launched the era of forecasts—or, as the pioneering meteorologist Cleveland Abbe called them, “probabilities.” Cleveland left his home base of Cincinnati (just to confuse you!) to work for an arm of the federal government that would later become the National Weather Service.

“The nation has had few more useful servants than Cleveland Abbe,” the meteorologist Thomas Corwin Mendenhall wrote around 1919, praising his storm warnings, which saved millions of dollars’ worth of property every year.

Human observation and telegraph chitchat were eventually supplanted by radiosondes, which are sensor packages launched by balloon twice a day, all across the country, to determine wind direction, temperature, pressure, and so on. After DOGE cuts in February, several sites pared back to one launch a day; the Alaskan cities of Kotzebue (along the western coast) and St. Paul (out in the Bering Sea) stopped launches altogether.

I had asked Keith Seitter, a senior policy fellow at the American Meteorological Society, how I could forecast weather myself, without using government models. He made the mistake of suggesting that weather generally travels west to east at a rate of 20 to 30 miles an hour. I latched on to this. Could I simply find a city that is about 500 miles west and drive there to get tomorrow’s weather today?

Well, sure, Keith said, but that seems like a big waste of time.

Please! I have two children under the age of 4. I have nothing but time.

I Googled my way to Tim and his hot-air-balloon company in Columbus. It had a single review on Yelp, from 2012, but that review was five stars: “Tim is a great pilot.” Good enough for me!

I meet Tim and his crew in a parking lot near a golf course. We pile into his balloon van, with the balloon basket attached to the back, and drive to our takeoff point. The basket is stunningly small—more like a double-wide grocery cart. We arrive at 5:37 p.m., just as the sun is starting to slide toward the horizon.

The Geiger count in Ohio is a tiny bit lower than in Washington, D.C., if you were wondering. But my instrument now is a combination thermometer-barometer-anemometer that I bought for $22.89.

Tim reassures me that “the vast majority of people in a balloon don’t realize any sensation of height issues,” because “balloons use natural forces.” I thought gravity was a natural force? I am becoming agitated. Tim, in our initial call, described some balloon landings as “sporty,” an adjective I do not like having applied to my physical safety.

Listen. I am actually very afraid of heights. I always forget this until I am irretrievably committed to a course of action that will take me to the top of a height, and then, as I am borne ineluctably to the top of that height, I think, Oh, right. I am terrified of these.

I hoist myself over the edge of the basket. My palms are sweating. Suddenly everything around us becomes very small. There is a miniature tractor doing neat laps around a miniature field. A hawk is … below us?

“Very high was a mistake” is what my notes say at this point.

My phone has acquired a thin film of sweat, maybe from condensation? 29.06 on the barometer. 85.3 degrees Fahrenheit. It is eerily quiet except for the periodic firing of the propane tank, which sounds like someone is grilling very urgently right in my ear. 28.26, 87.3 F. The temperature is suddenly much cooler: 47.3 degrees, although it doesn’t feel like that at all.

Then I realize that I have been reading the dew point instead of the temperature.

When I switch to the actual temperature, I realize a second problem: Whenever Tim fires the burner, the basket of the balloon becomes hot. It is like being aloft with a small campfire. Now, instead of telling me that it is 52.9 degrees, my thermometer informs me that it is 91.2 degrees! It is a beautiful, still, cloudless evening. If only Cleveland Abbe could see me now! He would probably say something like “What a senseless waste of astonishingly futuristic equipment.”

We drift over more fields and hummers, which is what some balloonists call power lines. Below us: trees, fields, houses, old junked cars, the occasional dog.

Our descent is not at all sporty, although I hold my breath as we approach the hummers. Tim has done this 1,600 times, and thus we do not fly into a power line, or you would not be reading this. It turns out that in this business, you just sort of … land in people’s yards? Members of the balloon crew have had guns pulled on them before, and dogs unleashed.

Improbably, the yard we land in belongs to a proud Atlantic subscriber named Deborah, who is apparently a competitive pinball player. I try to explain why we landed in her yard, making Deborah the first of many strangers to be confused by my project. Deborah is nonetheless so excited by my affiliation with The Atlantic that she asks for a hug. For a subscriber, anything!

On the ground it is 7:18 p.m., somewhere between 78.3 and 80.8 degrees. I cannot stress enough how lovely this weather is. Clear and crisp and the perfect temperature, the kind of fall day you order from an L.L. Bean catalog.

The next day, I begin my easy, convenient, six-plus-hour drive home to see my weather.

I close in on D.C. and notice it is raining. The sky is gray. Gray gray gray.

This is not my weather! I did not drive all the way from Ohio to bring this! I DON’T KNOW THIS WEATHER!

A friend whose hobby is meteorology informs me that current pressure systems are making the weather travel from east to west today. Whoops.

There is a certain indignity in having done this astoundingly inefficient thing and not even gotten the weather right at the end of it. So for my next government function, I will try something that involves no data collection. The only thing at stake? The safety of myself and my family.

We currently do not have a Senate-confirmed surgeon general, who is supposed to be the “nation’s doctor.” But the president’s nominee for the role, Casey Means, has offered food-related advice for cutting the government out of your life. She is more of a doctor than I am (in that she finished medical school) but less of a doctor than you might want the nation’s doctor to be (in that she didn’t complete her residency and decided to get really into “good energy”). The week after the 2024 election, Means said something interesting about raw milk, in the context of burdensome government regulation, on Real Time With Bill Maher.

“I want to be able to form a relationship with a local farmer,” Means said, “understand his integrity, look him in the eyes, pet his cow, and then understand if I can drink his milk.”

Thus, I am at a farm in southern Maryland to do just that. The difficulty with raw milk is that it isn’t always legal to sell for human consumption. Fortunately, this farm sells allegedly delicious “pet milk” (wink, wink). It also gives its cows operatic names, such as Tosca, Traviata, and Renee Fleming. I have asked for permission to put Casey Means’s vision into practice here.

A farmer named Brian takes me to the cows, past the egg layers and the meat chickens, bivouacked in what he tells me are excellent conditions in a nearby field. (“Raise me this way and you can slaughter me too!” Farmer Brian says.)

In preparation for this visit, I spoke with a veterinarian, who told me how to assess the health of a cow. The vet said that I should be able to see some of the cow’s 13 sets of ribs, but not too many. The cow should not be oddly hunched. Its udder should be long and pendulous.

Brian introduces me to Melissa, who is named for a singer.

Brian laughs. No further information on Melissa’s surname is forthcoming.

Melissa just stands there, covered in flies.

“Flies help clean them up,” Farmer Brian tells me. Is this true? I add it to a growing list of Things I Am Not Sure Are Facts.

It used to be that milk only came raw, and everyone had to decide for themselves whether to drink it. The penalty for drinking subpar milk was that you died. In the 19th century, this happened fairly often, especially to American children. Then we discovered that diseases were caused by microorganisms. Tuberculosis, scarlet and typhoid fevers, diphtheria, brucellosis—all of these could be transmitted by milk.

At the urging of President Theodore Roosevelt, fresh off the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, a commission of public-health officers put out a 751-page report tracing recent outbreaks to contaminated milk. Milk was a wonderful environment for germs to grow in. Some of them could join your gut microbiome as helpful allies; others could give you deadly diarrhea. Instead of rolling the dice, the report made the case for pasteurizing milk—that is, heating it—to kill harmful microorganisms.

Making milk safe to drink was one of the greatest public-health breakthroughs in history. “For every 2 billion servings of pasteurized milk or milk products consumed in the U.S., only about one person gets sick,” the FDA reports.

I’ve been especially leery of diseases lately. FoodNet—the CDC’s Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network—is scaling back the germs it tracks, from eight to two (salmonella and one type of E. coli ). I guess we want listeria to come as more of a surprise. And now followers of the “Make America Healthy Again” movement are encouraging us to drink the kind of milk that we stopped drinking around 1924 because it was too risky.

Anyway, back to Melissa. She has horns. This is good, Farmer Brian says, because “horns are the antennae, and all the cosmic energy comes down in through the horns.” I add this to my list of Things I Am Not Sure Are Facts.

How long does this milk keep? “It doesn’t go bad,” Farmer Brian says. This feels famously untrue of milk. “If you’re on the standard American diet, it will give you the runs,” Farmer Brian admits.

I tentatively ask why this milk seems so much more shelf-stable than the milk I myself have been producing for my infant, which can last in the refrigerator for only four days. Brian seems puzzled by this, and hands me 13 pamphlets, including “Cod Liver Oil: Our Number One Superfood” and “After Raw Breast Milk, What’s Best?” They do not answer my question.

I pause in the farm’s gift shop, which has folk-music CDs, hats made out of alpaca wool, and books explaining why COVID was not caused by a virus (“are electro-smog, toxic living conditions, and 5G actually to blame?”). I had better buy some milk, I guess.

I bring the milk home and stare at it. It is in a plastic jug, with a label that says NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. I am starting to miss the government. It used to be that when I brought milk home, I could drink it. Now I have to do all of this research.

I leave the milk on the counter overnight. My husband wants to throw it out, on the grounds that it is confusing and growing stinky, but I explain that I am writing about it, and that we do not throw out the U.S. economy and politics (what he writes about) because they are confusing and growing stinky.

To make myself more comfortable with the milk on my counter, I read studies. The more I read, the more I am discouraged. A study from 2017 says that 96 percent of illnesses caused by contaminated dairy came from raw milk and cheese. I don’t like those odds.

I enjoyed petting Melissa and looking Farmer Brian in the eyes. But I don’t think that gave me the information I needed to understand whether I could drink the milk. What I should have done was scan the milk for microorganisms or simply boil it. In the time it has taken to figure this out, the milk has turned a cloudy yellow and formed three distinct strata.

Months later, I still have not thrown it away, or opened it. I am hoping that if I procrastinate long enough, it will simply become cheese.

I’m darting through grocery stores across D.C., trying to get someone to help me nail down the price of eggs over time. I have to get better at economic-data collection quickly, because the Trump administration is targeting the Bureau of Labor Statistics. You might wail something like: Who cares about the most bureaucratic-sounding bureau, at a time like this?

I do. I am becoming more of the government, every day, and it is going great.

The BLS is an attempt, through relentless data collection, to get everyone a nice set of shared facts about the economy and the workforce. Are there enough jobs to go around? The BLS puts out a monthly jobs report (though it missed October because of the shutdown). How far does your paycheck go? The BLS tabulates the Consumer Price Index, which identifies All the Things That People Buy and then figures out if they cost more or less than they used to. In essence—since 1884, when it was the Bureau of Labor—the BLS takes pictures of the economy for us.

But the pictures have not been very flattering lately, and so the Trump administration has responded by trying to smash the camera. After the July jobs report did not have enough jobs, the president fired the BLS commissioner. Trump’s 2026 budget proposes an 8 percent cut to the BLS budget. And DOGE’s hacking at the BLS may have contributed to a suspension of data collection in three cities: Buffalo, New York; Provo, Utah; and Lincoln, Nebraska.

To collect my own economic data, I need to become a “first-rate noticer,” says Jay Mousa, a former associate commissioner for the BLS office of field operations. That is part of what BLS field economists do. They are an army of perceptive extroverts who go from place to place, look around, talk with people, and find out what they are paying or charging for goods and services.

Mousa suggests that I go from store to store and find out the price of an item, now and in the past. Finding out the current price seems doable. But the past price? I could ask employees, he suggests. Perfect! I will use my thing-noticing, people-coaxing skills, just like a real BLS field economist.

Glancing at the dozens of items priced by the BLS in its list of average retail prices, I select eggs (one dozen, large, grade A). Eggs feel very present. They were the thing, during the 2024 election cycle, that people said cost too much, and now look where the country is.

I begin at a Safeway, asking a cashier what eggs cost now and what they cost earlier in the month. The clerk reports that eggs cost $4.99 a dozen, and remembers that they used to be a lot more expensive, like nine-something dollars. I feel awkward enough about this exchange that I buy the eggs. Did I collect data, or did I just go grocery shopping?

At Trader Joe’s, I stare at a sample cup of butternut-squash mac and cheese before knocking it back like a shot. Then I notice that I am being offered a fork. First-rate noticing! A cardboard gargoyle peers down at me from the corner of the store. “That is a gargoyle,” I say, trying to ease myself into conversation with the employee who offered me the mac and cheese.

“It’s cardboard,” the employee says. “It has been there five years.”

I ask him about the historic price of eggs and he says that the cost has gone down—eggs that are $2.99 were $3.99 a mere two days ago! A secret weekend egg deal? Like a real field economist might find? He doesn’t know. I leave the store with two specific numbers and without buying anything, which I consider a double win. Plus, I have data on the longevity of the cardboard gargoyle, just in case.

“I can’t help but notice we are in a Whole Foods,” I tell a Whole Foods employee who—perhaps having noticed me walking around with no shopping cart and a Geiger counter—has asked if I need help. “Is there any way of finding out what eggs used to cost in the past?”

He tells me that they have roughly doubled in price—eggs that are now $9 a carton were once $5; those that are now $4 were once $2.

These are the peaks of my data collection. At Giant, I am informed that eggs used to cost triple what they cost now. At Rodman’s, when I ask what eggs used to cost, all I get is the assurance that eggs are expensive everywhere. At Target, an employee responds to my inquiry about the historic price of eggs by asking if I want to go to the egg aisle and see for myself. “No,” I say, “I meant in the past.” I complete the rest of my self-checkout in silence.

I need something to show for this effort. So I make a table using the data that I collected for a dozen large eggs, grade A.

This takes me only three hours. Should I be averaging the variables? That feels like a thing I can do. Can you average a number ending in ish ?

Maybe it’s better not to collect too much economic data. Maybe doing so would frighten the economy. Maybe I’d better do something that can only help the economy: basic scientific research, which can ripple into world-changing breakthroughs. Did you know that studying the venom of gila monsters—decades ago, at a Veterans Affairs medical center—yielded a treatment for type 2 diabetes that, in the past few years, has spawned a weight-loss revolution?

And so I drive to Johns Hopkins University, where I hear they do a lot of science.

I have just destroyed eight human retinal organoids with my subpar pipetting.

Allie—a grad student in Professor Bob’s biology lab here at Johns Hopkins—is being very nice about it, but I feel terrible. She needs these retinas so she can study how different photoreceptors are made.

Johns Hopkins, “America’s first research university,” receives a lot of government funding. Or, at least, it used to. Something like $3 billion in grants were cut last year across the National Science Foundation and the NIH. When USAID was dismantled, Johns Hopkins lost $800 million in grants, leading to the elimination of more than 2,200 jobs around the world.

In Professor Bob’s lab, grad students are trying to figure out how genes are expressed and how that affects an organism’s physiology. Flies are helping them understand this by dying in large quantities. These are special flies whose genotype we know a lot about, and they live in jars full of a special sugary food, which they consume contentedly for their entire life (about 45 days).

They (the researchers, not the flies) suggest that I start small. My task will be to help flip the flies—move them from one jar full of a dense sugary substance to another jar—without releasing too many. Then I get to sex the flies, and then, with a microscope and forceps, I get to behead them. This is the closest I will ever get to being a praying mantis. The grad students report that informing people of the sex of nearby flies is a fun trick they perform at parties. (Gen Z needs to drink more.)

The percentage of the federal budget that goes to general science and basic research is not huge—about 0.2 percent—unless you consider the F-35 fighter jet a form of science. But the return is astounding. Google’s beginnings can be traced to a federal grant for digital libraries. Now look at the company, helping to keep the entire economy afloat—and leading me to Tim the balloon pilot!

“Without scientific progress,” the eminent engineer Vannevar Bush (also an eminent Atlantic writer) once wrote, “no amount of achievement in other directions can insure our health, prosperity, and security as a nation in the modern world.” He submitted a report to Harry Truman in 1945 to argue for creating an agency that could support and fund basic research around the country. His brainchild, the National Science Foundation, was born in 1950. Dedicated support for scientific research has given us GPS (where would we be without it?), cancer-research funding that’s helped save millions of lives (something we used to agree was an obvious good), and the atomic bomb (a parenthetical aside is the wrong venue to sum up my feelings about the atomic bomb).

So those are the stakes. Just millions of lives, the entire economy, and, of course, our health, prosperity, and security as a nation in the modern world.

I have to focus! My next task is to help grow human retinal organoids, for study. Grad Student Allie does this by starting out with a set of stem cells and then using chemicals to insist that those cells become retinas. She shows me the ones she has been working on, all in various stages of development. The newest ones resemble leaves with little nibbles around the edges; the more mature ones have become blobs with little meatballs attached; later, she removes the meatballs and, presto, a retina. To me, this is functionally witchcraft.

I do my best to help her in the earlier stages of retina development, by extracting waste from vials with growing retinas and then pipetting in pink liquid (food? Do baby retinas eat?).

I extract something that I hope is waste and gently squirt it into a waste container. Whatever it is, I guess it’s waste now. Then I use the pipette to draw up a quantity of pink liquid and squirt it into the tube. I do this slowly and carefully, in the same way that I drive slowly and carefully: in little, jagged bursts of speed, interrupted by long pauses. This is not ideal pipetting. Bubbles form. Retinas are destroyed.

Allie is very kind, despite the devastation I have wrought. I won’t be able to replicate this at home, anyway. I don’t have any stem cells—unless some are growing between the yellow strata in my jug of raw milk that might soon become cheese?

I am starting to unravel a little bit. Becoming aware of all of these things I did not formerly think about has only made me aware of even more things.

The Corporation for Public Broadcasting took a hit—perhaps I should make children’s programming?

Cuts to the IRS? I’ve got to audit things! Does anyone know a billionaire willing to share his tax records with me?

The U.S. Geological Survey’s budget might be cut by almost 40 percent. WHERE IS THE OCEAN? GET ME A MEASURING TAPE!

Did I mention that the first hot-air-balloon ride I booked—before I found Tim in Columbus—charged my credit card twice and sent me to a Cincinnati rendezvous point where no one showed up? No balloon, no balloon pilot, nothing! Does the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate balloon fraud? If it does, it probably won’t for much longer. Trump is trying to shut down the bureau.

Bridge inspectors at the Department of Transportation are still on the job, but maybe I should familiarize myself with the varieties of truss.

Who’s watching all of the airplanes? I play the simple games for aspiring air-traffic controllers that NASA (not the FAA, curiously) hosts on its website. These games offer all the fun of basic trigonometry, plus an ominous announcement, if you get the math wrong, reading, “SEPARATION LOST”—an aviation reference for occasioning a mid-air collision.

All the while, I have my Geiger counter, which is now a dear old friend, having stuck with me through it all. But what happens if I find actual radioactive material? My knowledgeable friends suggest vitrification, which can turn liquid waste into solid waste, because solid waste is much easier to deal with than liquid waste (as a parent of two young children, I can confirm). Unfortunately I do not have good vitrifying equipment in my kitchen.

I catch my husband Googling what price divorce, but he assures me it is just to help with my BLS research. Also, I made the mistake of telling my 3-year-old that I stepped in cow dung at the farm, and now every time she gets into the car, she claims that it “smells poopy.”

I’m tired of asking what I can do for my country! I’ll just go for a soothing walk.

But taking a soothing walk reminds me that the National Park Service, too, is suffering cuts; 24 percent of its permanent workforce is gone. But I don’t know how to help. I thought that maybe I could clean toilets on the National Mall; an internal NPS spreadsheet listed Areas Where It Was Stretched Thin, including bathroom maintenance. But when I poke my head in the stalls, the bathrooms around the Washington Monument seem just fine. Maybe everything’s just fine!

I think about offering my interpretive services at the World War I Memorial, but the plaques there imply that every day at 5 p.m., the actor Gary Sinise sends a bugler to play taps, and I don’t want to compete with Gary Sinise’s bugler.

I read in the same NPS spreadsheet that the Antietam battlefield has curbed its mowing and is “less-than-manicured,” which “may be viewed negatively by visitors.” Perhaps this is how I can help. I will go to the place that saw the bloodiest day of the Civil War and see what needs doing. Maybe I can tidy up? And maybe I can finally feel like I’m doing something for my country.

I am scrabbling in the dirt with my bare hands in Antietam National Battlefield, trying to clear a walking path around a felled tree. “I don’t think I’m helping!” I say, for the fifth or sixth time, to the photographer who is documenting my civic-minded humiliation. I am sweating. There is dirt under my nails and dirt in my boots. I have moved what feels like a lot of dirt around, but also I have not moved enough dirt around. The path is still blocked.

It is October. It is lovely in the autumn way of clear water moving over rocks as leaves fall. Antietam is the name of a creek, and something about the creek’s scale feels wrong, given what happened here 164 years ago. Too small, somehow. Suspiciously still.

I don’t know what else to do, in this current chapter of American turmoil, so I am doing this: clearing a path, because there ought to be a path here.

This task would be easy for a person with the right equipment. It would take an hour for someone with a chainsaw. But I am trying my best, and my best is no good at all.

“You have perhaps believed Government jobs to be ‘soft’ and ‘easy,’ ” Horace M. Albright, the superintendent of Yellowstone, wrote to park-ranger applicants in the summer of 1926. “Most of them are not, and certainly there are no such jobs in the National Park Service.”

The hard work of the park rangers at Antietam is to protect this place of history for visitors in the future. Antietam was brutal, with thousands of casualties—among them, arguably, slavery. After the battle, Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, declaring the end of slavery in the Confederate states. The bloodshed at Antietam helped extend the promises of the Declaration of Independence to more people.

The site needs to be preserved. It needs to be kept sightly. It needs … to be mowed.

I see some unkempt grass near a few cannons and get my friend Dave’s hand mower out of my trunk. The moment when you push a hand mower around Antietam is a moment when you must ask yourself questions, such as: How did I get here? How did we get here?

How I got here: a five-month experiment in self-government as an individual.

How we got here: a 250-year experiment in self-government as a group.

I push the mower forward, and think about truths that are self-evident. The world is full of threats to life and liberty, before you even start thinking about the pursuit of happiness. If you want to have life, that means you want to be able to buy a sandwich, take a bite out of it, and not die. You want your children to drink milk and not die. If a big storm is coming, you want to know about it so you can evacuate if you need to. Where there is nuclear waste, you want it put away properly. You want to increase your sum total of knowledge about the human body and the world, so that you can prevent disease, or cure it. And, ideally, you want passionate citizens to handle the specialized stuff—people who love flies, or dew points, or the price of eggs, or making sure airplanes don’t hit each other.

If there were a big button that said, “Hey, push this button and somebody else will handle all the hard, technical stuff, and in exchange you will pay a percentage of your annual income, but don’t worry: We will have a team of people to make sure that you pay the right amount; also, there will be large, beautiful places where you can go for walks and learn about nature and history. And all the time you save will be your own!,” I would absolutely push that button.

People have tried to walk away from the federal government before. To break it up. And on this hill that I am mowing, some men died saying, “No. You don’t get to do that. You’re in this with us.”

When I think of civil servants in this current uncivil moment—the air-traffic controllers who worked during the shutdown; the NOAA weather chasers flying into a hurricane to measure it, paycheck or no paycheck; the Park Service employees scrambling to keep bathrooms clean despite the cuts to their ranks—I will now think of Antietam.

I asked what I could do for my country and the answer was: alone, not much. Indeed, many things are weird at best, or destructive at worst, when you try to do them yourself. But if enough people get together and commit to doing them, you’ve got yourself a government.

Time to drive home from Antietam. Having mowed slightly, and been humbled greatly, I declare my experiment in self-government to be over. Save for one final task.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There’s a lot we don’t know about the shooting of Renee Nicole Good, who was killed yesterday by federal immigration agents deployed to Minnesota. But in the chaotic aftermath of the shooting, one thing became immediately clear: The Trump administration was lying about what happened.

Shortly after news began circulating about the shooting, the Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement on X that “rioters began blocking ICE officers and one of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them—an act of domestic terrorism.” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and the White House adviser Stephen Miller also described the incident as “domestic terrorism,” while President Donald Trump posted on his social network that Good “ran over the ICE Officer.”

Videos of the incident, taken by bystanders, show almost every element of McLaughlin’s statement to be false. There were no riots at the scene, and no rioters. The vehicle appears to be driving away from the armed federal agents, not toward them, and no one was run over. And there is no evidence that terrorism of any kind was involved. After the shooting, federal agents then reportedly prevented a bystander who identified himself as a physician from tending to Good. “They are already trying to spin this as an action of self-defense,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey told reporters. “Having seen the video of myself, I want to tell everybody directly, that is bullshit.”

A perverse absurdity of American law and culture, however, is that agents of the state empowered to use lethal force are rarely held to high standards for doing so. Good’s reasons for being in the neighborhood are not publicly known yet. What the witness sees, though, is simple: A scared woman is shot dead by an armed agent of the state. The Trump administration’s position is also simple: She deserved it. “Do you think this officer was wrong in defending his life against a deranged leftist who tried to run him over?” Vice President J. D. Vance posted.

Administration officials’ indifference to facts, to due process, to the dignity of the deceased, and to basic human decency is remarkable. They could have pleaded for patience and said the incident would be investigated—the standard response in such circumstances. They could have even done so while defending the federal agents they have deployed to terrorize areas they perceive as Democratic Party enclaves. Instead, they proceeded to make ostentatiously dishonest statements that they knew would be contradicted by the video evidence available to anyone with eyes to see it. The federal government now speaks with the voice of the right-wing smear machine: partisan, dishonest, and devoted to vilifying Trump’s perceived enemies rather than informing the public. Good’s mother, partner, and children have to cope not only with their unfathomable loss, but with a campaign designed to justify her killing. Their own lives will be subject to invasive scrutiny by the government and its allies, in a search for any derogatory information about Good that might somehow be used to justify her killing. For some, that won’t even be necessary. “I do not feel bad for the woman that was involved,” the Republican lawmaker Randy Fine told the right-wing network Newsmax.

As my colleague Quinta Jurecic has reported, the Trump administration has made a point of following through on absurd accusations by filing absurd charges. The most relevant example here is that of Marimar Martinez, who survived being shot multiple times by a federal agent in Chicago; DHS claimed that she, too, had rammed them with her car. The agent later bragged to his buddies about his eagle-eyed gunning-down of Martinez, who was  unarmed and hadn’t committed a crime. The charges against her were dropped.

The New York Times reported that the death of Good was the ninth shooting by an ICE officer since September, all of which officials called self-defense. In at least one of those incidents—the fatal shooting of Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, a Mexican immigrant—there was video evidence that contradicted DHS’s account. The administration has also charged Newark Mayor Ras Baraka with trespassing and Representative LaMonica McIver with assault, falsely accusing them of storming an ICE facility, when video of the encounter shows nothing of the kind. Baraka is now suing for defamation. Another supposed menace to society was accused of assault for scraping the knuckles of an FBI agent during a scuffle—the grand jury refused to indict over this harrowing example of anti-hand crime. In every one of these incidents, the administration lied about both the events and the civilians involved in them, in an attempt to justify the use of force or subsequent prosecution.

David A. Graham: A deadly shooting in Minnesota

The Trump administration has repeatedly targeted small and politically disempowered populations—Haitians, Somalis, trans people—in order to justify abuses of power. But its abuses of power are not limited to those communities. What the government can do to the most vulnerable among us, it can also do to you.

The blatant lies about Minneapolis serve several purposes. They perpetuate the false narrative that federal agents are in constant peril and therefore justified in using lethal force at the slightest hint of danger. They assure federal agents that they can harm or even kill American citizens with impunity, and warn those who might be moved to protest Trump’s immigration policies of the same thing. Perhaps most grim, they communicate to the public that if you happen to be killed by a federal agent, your government will bear false witness to the world that you were a terrorist.

This approach, of course, is quite familiar to communities that have been dealing with police abuses for as long as there have been professional police forces. In 2000, then–New York City Mayor and future Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani justified the killing of the Haitian American Patrick Dorismond by police by quipping that he was “no altar boy.” Embarrassingly for Giuliani, whose capacity for shame was overestimated even then, it turned out that Dorismond had literally been an altar boy. Dorismond’s mother responded to the campaign to justify her son’s killing with an observation that continues to haunt me decades later.

“They kill,” Dorismond said, “and after that, they kill him the other way—with the mouth.”

Taking Good’s life wasn’t enough. The moment she died, it became imperative for the administration to also destroy her memory.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Every few weeks I turn up in a hospital gown at a medical exam room in Massachusetts and describe a set of symptoms that I don’t really have. Students listen to my complaints of stomach pain, a bad cough, severe fatigue, rectal bleeding, shortness of breath, a bum knee, HIV infection, even stab wounds; on one occasion I simply shouted incoherently for several minutes, as if I’d had a stroke. Then the students do their best to help.

I have been given nearly 100 ultrasounds in just the past year, and referred to behavioral counseling dozens of times. I have been consoled for my woes, thanked for my forthrightness, congratulated for my efforts to improve my diet. I have received apologies when they need to lower my gown, press on my abdomen, or touch me with a cold stethoscope. Our encounters, which sometimes run as long as 40 minutes, end with the students giving me their diagnoses; detailing every test, treatment, and drug they want me to have; and then answering all of my questions without ever looking at their watch. Before leaving, they commend me for coming in and promise to check back in on me. It’s a shame I have to feign an illness to get that kind of care.

I learned about fake medical care four years ago when my son, an M.D.-Ph.D. student, mentioned that he was being graded on his skill at treating “standardized patients”: people who are paid to role-play illness. I’m fascinated by the practice of medicine, so I found this notion irresistible. I applied for a job in the standardized-patient program at the University of Massachusetts, and after two full days of training, plus a lot of reading and videos, I was ready to get started.

The practice of faking medical encounters for the sake of education dates back to 1963 at the University of Southern California, but UMass developed one of the first formalized programs in 1982 and has been a model since. Such programs are now, well, standard: According to a count published in a 2023 review of the practice, 187 of the 195 accredited medical schools in the U.S. describe the use of standardized patients on their websites.

Each specific case that an SP might inhabit—and there are hundreds—comes with a minimum of two hours of additional training in person or via Zoom, along with more reading. We’re buried in a blizzard of unique details to memorize about the patients we portray. By the time I’m ready for my fake exam, I can rattle off what vaccinations I’ve had, how long I’ve worked at my job, whether I’ve had my tonsils out, when my mother died, how much weight I’ve gained or lost in recent months, which vitamins I take, how much coffee I drink, how chatty I tend to be, and whether I’ve traveled recently (and might have parasites!).

There’s no script for my encounters, because you never know what the students might ask, say, and do. So I improvise most of my responses, in keeping with the facts I’ve been given. What do I usually eat for breakfast? What do they make at the factory where I work? What sexual acts do my partner and I engage in? My ad-libs are acceptable, according to the grades I get from staff members who occasionally observe the encounters via camera. But many of my colleagues are professional actors, and their performances are superb. We sometimes work in pairs, and more than once I’ve found myself deeply moved—even to the verge of tears—by my partner’s fake suffering.

Of course, we SPs are not the only ones faking it in these sessions; the students are playing along, too. We score them on as many as 50 different elements, including their tone of voice (was it friendly but professional?), their body language (did they lean in to show engagement?), and their facility at palpating our spleens (did they dig in firmly in the right spot?). Most important, we are meant to check that they are learning empathy. Numerous studies have shown that more empathetic care is correlated with better clinical outcomes, perhaps because it makes patients more inclined to share their full medical history, and more likely to stick with whatever treatment has been recommended. In one survey, orthopedic-surgery patients reported that a doctor’s empathy was more central to their satisfaction than the time it took to get an appointment, how long they were stuck in the waiting room, or even what sort of treatment they ended up receiving.

It may not even matter if the doctor’s kindness is sincere, as long as it sounds that way to patients. Dave Hatem, an internist and professor emeritus at UMass who has helped oversee the school’s SP curriculum, told me that even just the act of trying to say empathetic things is valuable for students. “If you get the right words to come out of your mouth, and you do it often enough, then you get to the point where you really mean it,” he said.

Most of the medical students who examine me do seem genuine in their concern. I suspect that if it were up to them, they’d practice medicine this way for the whole of their careers. But however much they might want to provide the superb treatment that I experience as a standardized patient, the health-care system won’t let them.

Elaine Thompson is a recent graduate of Emory University’s medical school, where she learned to provide the same sort of long, thoughtful, whole-person interactions that I get from students. For the past three years, she has been an ear, nose, and throat resident at Johns Hopkins Medicine, one of the best medical centers in the world. Her real-life patient encounters now last for an average of 10 minutes.

“You quickly learn as a resident that the job is to move things along,” Thompson told me. “I’m still curious about my patients as people and want to learn about their families, but if it’s not relevant to their current problem, then asking about it opens a door that will add time to the visit.” So much for chatting to put them at ease, soliciting a full narrative of their symptoms, hearing all their concerns, asking about their job, uncovering anxieties, addressing financial and social challenges, and encouraging their questions. (In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Johns Hopkins Medicine said that it is committed to delivering “patient-centered training” and “whole person care.”)

The same is true for Emily Chin, who received her medical degree from UMass in 2023 and is now an ob-gyn resident at UC San Francisco. She told me that she got the message about keeping visits short early on from senior residents, who made a point of tracking the length of her encounters. “I’d just have time to check the cervix, do a quick ultrasound, and then make a decision about admitting or discharging the patient,” she said. Another source of pressure is the knowledge that spending any extra time with a patient means that dozens of other patients will be waiting longer to be seen: “You see the patients piling up in the waiting room, and you see the schedule screen going red.” (UCSF’s vice dean for education, Karen Hauer, did not object to this characterization, but noted that the school advises its residents on how to establish patient rapport when time is short.)

Residents also learn that time is money. Hospitals and practices view a doctor’s interactions with a patient in terms of “revenue value units.” Reimbursement for seeing a patient whose high cholesterol leads to a prescription for a statin might bring $60 into the hospital or clinic. Reimbursement for extra time spent discussing the patient’s fears of side effects and concerns about affording the drug’s co-pay or making dietary changes brings in $0. “That doesn’t exactly encourage providing the most empathetic, patient-centered care,” a UMass Memorial Health resident named Hans Erickson told me.

The residents I spoke with worried that these time pressures were only going to get worse when they finished residency and became full-fledged doctors. In light of those constraints, does it still make sense to emphasize highly empathetic care for students? I asked that question of Melissa Fischer, the physician who directs the SP program and other simulation training at UMass. Fischer argues that the lessons we impart to students can survive the crush of residency, even if they have to be applied in abbreviated ways. “That interest in building connections to patients stays,” she said. “They just have to find faster ways to build them.”

Lisa Howley, an educational psychologist who serves as the senior director for transforming medical education at the Association of American Medical Colleges, told me that training up a generation of more empathetic medical students will make the health-care system better. “We think of young medical learners as agents of potential change,” she told me. “They’ll see the gaps and weaknesses, and they’ll look for ways to make improvements.” Besides, what would be the benefit of forcing medical students to learn about patient encounters in the hectic, abbreviated format they’ll confront as residents? “It doesn’t make sense to apply those pressures early in their education,” she said. After all, we don’t teach student pilots how to fly a plane while trying to make up for time lost to flight delays or dealing with unruly passengers.

All of the residents I spoke with said they look for ways to connect with patients despite the harsh realities of the system. “The desire to get to know the patient as a whole person doesn’t go away; it’s just a matter of finding ways to bring it to the surface as a stressed resident,” Erickson said. Chin put it this way: “It’s not that it’s challenging to keep up empathy, it’s that it’s hard to be empathetic all the time.”

At the end of my fake encounters, I try to be encouraging. I tell the students how I, as a patient, felt treated by them, and then I challenge them to give ideas for how they might improve. Sometimes, when one of them has done a bang-up job of making me feel heard, I tell them that I hope they’ll be able to sustain that level of engagement when they’re a practicing doctor—and I always get the sense that the students hope so too.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Few world capitals have been as shaken by the dramatic ouster of Nicolás Maduro as faraway Tehran. Anti-Americanism has united Iran and Venezuela in a tight alliance for more than two decades. As recently as 2022, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei welcomed Maduro to Tehran, praising the Venezuelan strongman’s “resistance” against America and his “anti-Zionist positions,” adding: “No two countries are as close as we are.”

Khamenei also promised that Iran would “come to the aid of its friends when they are faced with danger.” But when American troops rousted Maduro and his wife from bed early on the morning of January 3, neither Khamenei nor his more powerful allies in Moscow and Beijing came to the rescue.

By now, Khamenei has gotten used to losing friends. He appeared helpless to protect his main regional ally, Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, from being overthrown a year ago. Israeli strikes have decimated the so-called Axis of Resistance, a coalition of anti-Israel Arab militias backed by Iran. Khamenei has now also lost an alliance first forged with Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chávez, who christened it the Axis of Unity. A former Iranian official quipped on X that Iran had to accept Hezbollah’s disarmament next: Donald Trump’s “new order is not that hard to understand!”

The blow couldn’t come at a worse time for Iran’s dictator. Khamenei’s regime faces a new round of street protests and a deepening economic crisis. Iran’s 12-day war with Israel and America ended inconclusively last year; the possibility of renewed attacks is never far from mind. The U.S. president has already compared the success of the operation in Caracas to last year’s bombing of Iran. And if that were not ominous enough, Maduro’s capture took place on the sixth anniversary of the Trump-ordered killing of Qassem Soleimani, Khamenei’s top general.

And so the regime reacted with evident panic. Reports on Iran’s state broadcaster insisted for hours that the United States might be lying about capturing Maduro. Once that line became impossible to sustain, a well-known former member of parliament blustered that Maduro would return to power “as a national hero” and that America’s “revolutionary youth would send Trump to the dustbin of history.” Ahmad Vahidi, the newly appointed deputy commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, said that the operation signaled “America’s collapse and decline.”

Be that as it may, Khamenei’s partner in resistance had been spirited to a New York courtroom, and Russia and China, the great-power allies supposedly backing both Caracas and Tehran, had sat the whole episode out. What lesson was the Iranian regime to draw? One Guards-linked analyst concluded that international law was an illusion, and that Iran needed “military and economic power” to survive. Commentators in more reformist-leaning outlets countered that what Iran actually needed was a government with popular legitimacy.

Certainly the news from Caracas has emboldened the Iranian regime’s opponents. On social media, many Iranians joked about being jealous of Venezuelans. A journalist at a reformist daily taunted the rulers in Tehran: “If you don’t leave power with the vote of the people, you will have to do so by a larger foreign force.” A left-leaning dissident in Tehran simply posted, “Congratulations Venezuela.”

The implicit premise of these reactions is that Trump could be contemplating as bold an action in Tehran as he undertook in Caracas. One former U.S. official I spoke with was skeptical that the Trump administration has any interest in decapitating the Iranian regime. “Venezuela is a core U.S. interest in a way that Iran isn’t,” Alan Eyre, who was the Persian-language spokesperson for the State Department under President Barack Obama and is now a diplomatic fellow at the Middle East Institute, told me. “I think this administration is focused elsewhere, and is by and large content to leave Iran to Israel, unless and until Israeli actions in Iran threaten to further destabilize the region.”

Still, the chatter about regime change—whether affected by the U.S. and Israel or by protesters pressing against a weakened power structure—has been growing louder, and one figure has moved inescapably to its center. Former Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, from his American exile, has declared himself Iran’s transitional leader, and many Iranian protesters have chanted support for him in recent days. Pahlavi has told The Wall Street Journal that he doesn’t advocate military strikes on Iran. But he didn’t oppose the American and Israeli attacks over the summer, and some of those close to him, including his wife, Yasmine Pahlavi, openly backed them.

Is there a conceivable future in which an American-military intervention installs Pahlavi in power? Venezuela doesn’t offer a very promising precedent. Control in Caracas has passed not to the popular democratic opposition leader, María Corina Machado, but to Maduro’s vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, whom U.S. officials reportedly chose to lead the country weeks ago. One can easily imagine that in Iran, too, Washington would bypass exiled oppositionists in favor of a pliant strongman. And Pahlavi is a divisive figure, with less sway among Iranian-regime critics than Machado has with their Venezuelan counterparts. In fact, Ali Javanmardi, Trump’s appointee to head the Voice of America’s Persian-language service, claimed on air on Sunday that Trump had “concluded that the opposition groups can’t come to a consensus and thus can’t be defined as the alternative” to the regime. Javanmardi added that the U.S. State Department believes that “the alternative is inside Iran.”

Inside Iran, the protest movement appears to be growing, and Khamenei, besieged by his people and surrounded on all sides by foreign adversaries, must know that his days are numbered. No matter who comes out on top when he’s gone, the core structures and central policies of his regime are bound to change. How and by whom the Islamic Republic will be dismantled, and what will succeed it, are the questions that remain.</div>

            <h2>The Maduro Indictment Appears Legally Solid</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/maduro-indictment-legal-analysis-noriega-precedent/685550/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Hours after U.S. forces seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, from their home in Caracas, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced on X that Maduro would soon “face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts.” Bondi’s wording aside—typically lawyers understand the legal system as dispensing impartial justice, not “wrath”—the post underscores the administration’s claim that the Venezuelan invasion was justified because the United States was arresting a criminal defendant who has been charged with drug trafficking.

The indictment is relatively straightforward—especially when compared with Maduro’s rendition—and appears legally sound. Although Maduro has a number of options for challenging his prosecution, none of them is a sure bet. Critics of President Donald Trump who have grown used to federal courts checking his worst impulses may find themselves disappointed as the case against Maduro proceeds.

In significant part, the charging document repeats the allegations already set out by the government in a 2020 indictment against the Venezuelan leader, accusing Maduro of involvement in a cocaine-trafficking network stretching across the Western Hemisphere. The specific charges are the same: conspiring to import cocaine into the United States and to collaborate with narco-terrorist organizations to do so. On top of that are also two gun charges. It may sound odd that the United States can charge a foreign leader for possessing machine guns in his own country, but this sort of charge—a gun offense layered on top of an allegation of drug trafficking or violence—is, in contexts not involving heads of sovereign nations, a fairly common tool of federal prosecutors in international drug cases. To the extent that such a tactic seems like an overly broad use of prosecutorial power, that’s a reflection of the expansiveness of U.S. law and the Justice Department’s choice to treat Maduro like an everyday defendant.

The Justice Department has made a few tweaks since 2020, providing more detail on Maduro’s seizure of power after he lost Venezuela’s 2018 election and adding his wife and son to the list of defendants. Whereas the 2020 indictment focuses on Maduro’s alleged collaboration with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the Colombian guerrilla group known as FARC, the 2025 version adds a handful of other cartels and drug-trafficking groups to the mix. Newly woven into the indictment is the alleged role of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, whose supposed presence in the U.S. the administration has previously used as a paper-thin excuse to ship Venezuelan migrants to a nightmarish prison in El Salvador.

The government’s claims about Tren de Aragua are probably the most eyebrow-raising aspect of the indictment. “I don’t think of them as major transnational drug trafficker,” Will Freeman, a fellow for Latin American studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, told me. “It seems a bit surprising.” A critical reader could find other quirks—such as the absence of any mention of fentanyl trafficking, despite the administration’s previous insistence on blaming Maduro for the drug’s abuse by Americans. (Illicit fentanyl largely arrives in the U.S. from China.) But that is a problem for the administration’s public rhetoric, not the viability of the indictment.

Overall, though, the allegations against Maduro seem to more or less line up with what’s already known about the Venezuelan regime’s enmeshment with organized crime. The Trump administration’s reliance on the 2020 indictment is telling here. Those charges were filed by a Justice Department not yet deeply corrupted by the sort of aggressive political interference that has marked the president’s second term thus far, and by federal prosecutors whose Manhattan office was famous for its independence.

Although the indictment seems relatively unscathed by Trump’s signature recklessness, the same cannot be said of the circumstances of Maduro’s capture. Sending military forces into another country’s capital to seize its leader, unprovoked, is forbidden by the United Nations Charter, which prohibits states from using force against one another. The U.S. ambassador to the UN, Mike Waltz, has pointed to the charter’s exception for self-defense but failed to explain how the Venezuela operation could possibly fall into that category. What’s more, in the absence of congressional authorization—which Trump didn’t have—such an adventure is also likely illegal under all but the most extreme understandings of U.S. law. The administration’s arguments to the contrary depend on an overstretched reading of presidential powers that has been questioned even by advocates of strong executive authority. And while Vice President J. D. Vance pointed to the indictment against Maduro as a justification, the existence of criminal charges against a person does not provide the government with carte blanche to arrest a defendant in any way it likes.

But the dubious nature of his arrival in the U.S. may not help Maduro much in court. The Supreme Court has established repeatedly that even if someone is “kidnapped in the foreign country and brought by force against his will” to the United States, the government can nevertheless try that person in criminal court. In the early 1990s, the Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega failed to derail his drug-trafficking trial on those grounds after the United States captured and deposed him during the 1989 invasion of Panama.

Eventually, Noriega would be convicted by a South Florida jury and sentenced to 40 years in prison, of which he served 17 before being released and extradited to France for further criminal proceedings. He was the first foreign head of state to be captured by U.S. forces and tried in an American court. Maduro is the second, and Noriega’s other legal arguments offer a preview of what options might be available to Maduro’s defense team.

George Packer: Iraq was bad. This is absurd.

“I consider myself a prisoner of war,” Maduro said in court on Monday. Noriega also made this argument. It failed to win him his freedom, but it did allow him to wear his military uniform in court and secured him better prison conditions. Like Noriega, Maduro might also challenge the U.S. government’s ability to bring charges regarding conduct that took place outside the United States. In Noriega’s case, this, too, failed.

Maduro hinted at another potential argument when he insisted before Judge Alvin Hellerstein that he was “still president of my country.” This echoes Noriega’s claim that the United States lacked the authority to put him, as a foreign head of state, on trial and that international law likewise shielded him from criminal prosecution for any actions he had taken in his role as leader of Panama. But both the trial court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit rejected Noriega’s claims. Maduro may well have a stronger argument: Noriega, unlike Maduro for Venezuela, never legally served as Panama’s head of state under the country’s constitution. Still, despite the protections offered by international law, U.S. courts have tended to defer to the executive branch when it comes to such immunity claims.

The Noriega precedent has been on the books for decades, but its revitalization makes for an odd spectacle in this particular political moment. Trump ordered the arrest of a foreign leader who will now likely stand trial in the U.S. despite the immunity long observed under international law. Thanks to the Supreme Court’s 2024 ruling, though, Trump himself enjoys broad immunity from prosecution within the United States. The charges against Maduro may be legitimate, but the upcoming court proceedings—like the ongoing U.S. aggression toward Venezuela—will serve as yet another reminder of Trump’s own power and impunity.</div>

            <h2>A New Understanding of Human Beings’ Most Basic Desire</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/2026/01/the-mattering-instinct-rebecca-newberger-goldstein-book-review/685536/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Philosophers are generally expected to display wisdom and calm in the face of existential questions. I am just not one of those philosophers. I spent 30 years racing away from these thoughts by running and swimming obsessively, pretending that I had no physical limits. Certain evasions are bound to fail: At 40, I suffered a cardiac arrest after an ill-advised treadmill workout. The sheer physicality of the event—the stopped heart, the failing body, the onerous recovery—threw into sharp relief a question that had always lurked beneath the surface: Does my life have a purpose? Or, put another way, how can I justify my existence? This dilemma gnaws at us in times of crisis and whispers to us in quiet moments of self-reflection. Rebecca Newberger Goldstein’s new book, The Mattering Instinct, helped me understand this feeling, to see it not as a personal quirk or a philosophical indulgence but as a fundamental aspect of what it means to be human.

We are, Goldstein asserts, “creatures of matter who long to matter.” This phrase captures the central paradox of the human condition: We are physical beings governed by the indifferent laws of nature, yet we are consumed by an obsession with our own significance. Her book is about, as she puts it, “a missing piece in the puzzle of understanding ourselves, one another, and our troubled times.” Goldstein, a philosopher and novelist known for her ability to bridge the worlds of science and the humanities, undertakes an ambitious project. She seeks to trace the origin of this profound desire and redefine what it means for a human life to flourish. She comes to a somewhat-surprising conclusion: that happiness isn’t always attainable or even desirable, but that anyone can achieve a good life by working to create order out of nature’s chaos.

Goldstein’s analysis hinges on an unexpected concept: the second law of thermodynamics. This is the principle of entropy, the inexorable tendency of any closed system to slide from order into chaos. Entropy is why houses fall into ruin, relationships fray, and bodies age. Life, in this framework, becomes a temporary act of defiance. Every living thing, Goldstein writes, is an intricate, energy-driven project engaged in a “ceaseless struggle against entropy.”

Using the “mattering map”—a classification system Goldstein first developed in her 1983 novel, The  Mind-Body Problem—she explains that this struggle manifests in different ways in different types of people. These types include the “heroic striver,” who believes the meaning of life is found in the next A+; the “transcender,” who seeks fulfillment in a relationship with the divine;  the “competitor,” who is motivated by defeating others; and the “socializer,” who seeks to matter by mattering to others.  I am—for better and occasionally for much worse—a heroic striver, which probably explains why I almost killed myself on that treadmill.

We each resist entropy in our own way, but in every case we are enacting a primitive, biological imperative that Goldstein refers to as self-mattering. Every organism is metabolically programmed to prioritize its own survival. “Biology’s response to the supreme law of physics,” she writes, “is what makes self-mattering deeper than any instinct, making it, rather, the organizing principle behind all the instincts.” If our genes could speak, “they would make for the best of self-esteem coaches,” she imagines. They would “incessantly and urgently exhort the organism forward,” saying, “You are special, oh so special.” This universal drive is the raw material of our story, as Goldstein tells it, but it is not the finished product. The uniquely human drama begins when people start to reflect back on this instinct.

Read: What a cranky new book about progress gets right

This is the book’s central transformation. According to Goldstein, the leap from being simply a living thing to being a human occurs through the act of self-reflection, which turns us into what she dubs Homo iustificans—the creature who needs a reason. People’s capacity to “step back and survey themselves,” as the philosopher Thomas Nagel wrote, reveals a stark dissonance between our biological drive to survive and the fact that every life ends in death anyway. This realization gives rise to what Goldstein calls “the mother of all mattering questions—Do I matter?” The biological sense of importance is no longer enough. Instead, “We need to convince ourselves that our own self-mattering is warranted,” she writes. “We long to demonstrate that the reason we subjectively feel that we matter is that we objectively do.” That desire is what Goldstein defines as the “mattering instinct.”

Here, Goldstein makes a pivotal philosophical claim: Our inherent human dignity lies not in some immutable essence like a soul or a divine image, but in this very struggle. Recasting the story of Eden—a world without entropy—she argues that the expulsion from paradise was not a fall but a step into humanity, the moment we became “values-seeking creatures.” Goldstein isn’t the first philosopher to argue that we are driven by the quest to justify our existence, but she sees it as an overriding instinct, even when our attempts are flawed or lead us astray.

With this “mattering instinct” established as humans’ core driver, Goldstein redefines the goal of a well-lived life. She asks readers to look beyond what she considers a modern obsession with happiness, which she characterizes as a fleeting emotion, a mere “surge of neurotransmitters.” The true aim, she argues, is the richer, classical concept of “eudaimonia”—a deep and reflective sense that one’s life is being lived well. She borrows from Aristotle to underscore the point: Eudaimonia “is not found in amusement; for it would be absurd if the end were amusement, and our lifelong efforts and suffering aimed at amusing ourselves.” This thriving rests, instead, in feeling that our life is significant both to ourselves and to others.

Crucially, this state of flourishing can, and often does, coexist with great suffering. To illustrate this, Goldstein turns to figures such as Ludwig Wittgenstein, who experienced constant mental anguish yet who exclaimed on his deathbed, “Tell them I’ve had a wonderful life.” This, Goldstein contends, was a statement not about happiness but about eudaimonia. His life, for all its misery, had been ferociously engaged in a mattering project: He developed what is arguably the most rigorous philosophical system of the 20th century, the goal of which was to understand the limits of language and thought. This heroic undertaking, which brought him no small amount of distress, gave Wittgenstein’s life coherence and purpose.

Similarly, Goldstein examines the American philosopher William James, who had an existential crisis in his youth. In a thinly veiled anonymous account, James described the moment his sense of self collapsed: “Suddenly there fell upon me without any warning, just as if it came out of darkness, a horrible fear of existence,” he described it. “It was as if something hitherto solid within my breast gave way entirely, and I became a mass of quivering fear.” James’s recovery came from a decision to believe in his own “individual reality and creative power”—which contributed greatly to the field of empirical psychology, expanded American pragmatism, and reshaped theology in the 20th century. Both men struggled mightily in service of a project that made their lives feel not just bearable, but meaningful.

Of course, certain mattering projects are ill-conceived from the start, as Goldstein shows through the story of the former white supremacist Frank Meeink. According to his book, Autobiography of a Recovering Skinhead, after severe emotional and physical abuse during his childhood left him feeling worthless, Meeink was desperate never to be a victim again. He found a perverse sense of belonging and destiny in the neo-Nazi skinhead movement, which convinced him that he was, as he put it, a “warrior” and that being white was “all that mattered,” turning his extreme self-doubt into destructive power. Later, while in prison, Meeink grew close with Black inmates. After his release, a Jewish employer showed him unconditional respect and helped replace his hate with constructive self-worth. Transformed by these experiences, Meeink ultimately channeled his need to matter into a heroic project: dedicating his life to fighting extremism.

Read: To get happier, make yourself smaller

If the mattering instinct originates in life’s resistance to entropy, then this same principle can help provide a standard for what Goldstein calls “getting mattering right.” A flourishing, morally good life, she proposes, is counter-entropic: It increases “the spread of flourishing, knowledge, love, joyfulness, peace, kindness, comity, beauty.” A life lived wrongly is one that aligns with entropy, increasing the world’s sum of chaos, cruelty, and dissolution. “People’s effects on entropy,” she states plainly, “provide the best overarching means I know to assess their lives.”

Nowhere is this vision more powerfully embodied than in the subject of the book’s final portrait: Lou Xiaoying, an impoverished Chinese woman who survived by scavenging through rubbish and died around 2012. Over the course of her 88 years, she found and raised more than 30 abandoned baby girls left to die in dumpsters and on roadsides. As her adopted daughter Juju recalls, “If she had the strength enough to collect garbage, then how could she not recycle something as important as human lives?” Lou Xiaoying’s existence was one of almost uninterrupted  hardship, yet Juju describes her as happy, fulfilled by a purpose that was profoundly counter-entropic. She created life, connection, and love where society had left only waste and decay.

The Mattering Instinct is a testament to the idea that humans find purpose when, as the poet Rumi wrote, we “let the beauty we love be what we do.” In a world fractured by competing claims on what’s important, Goldstein offers a vision that is both intellectually resonant and humane, reminding us that the struggle to justify our existence is the very thing that makes our existence matter.

And we are free to not purchase their products... which it appears is happening more and more.

Thing is, at this point these panels don&#39;t cost much to make - but the TV makers (similar to the smartphone makers) are doing everything they can to pretend the stuff people actually want are basically commodities anymore. So they keep adding whatever gimmicks (3D, AI, etc. etc.) they can come up with, and do their best to keep their prices far higher than they probably should be at this point.

You say that, but try buying a non-SMART TV nowadays...Just don&#39;t connect them to the network. Ever. You don&#39;t *have* to use the smart features on most sets sold today. Granted, there are companies working on making it required, but it&#39;s up to us to keep ourselves educated enough to not buy from those companies.

There are plenty of &quot;smart TV&#39;s&quot; which can be used offline but it&#39;s a pain in the ass trying to determine which ones can and can&#39;t be used without an internet connection.  If anyone has a suggestion for a site to easily determine which ones can be offline vs need to be online, I&#39;d appreciate the tip.  I tried googling for that info and... well... google... yeeeeah...

Commercial monitors for digital signage.  These days they have some sort of playback system installed but the markets they are meant for means they work out of the box, no cameras, no mics, no internet needed:

Any smart features are handled via a connected box (e.g. Apple TV, Roku).

Watching &quot;tv&quot; on a different sized screen does not mean that they don&#39;t watch &quot;tv&quot; anymore...

I couldn&#39;t imagine watching the series &quot;How The Universe Works&quot; on anything other than a large screen format. But you&#39;re correct, that large screen does not need to be used as a TV. A friend of mine purchased a new 80&quot; monster display and didn&#39;t want his &quot;old&quot; 55&quot; curved screen Samsung any longer so he gave it to me. Works perfect as a large computer screen connected to my custom HTPC. I can imagine lots of people have older big screen TVs that they need to get rid of that would work just as well as monitor

Seriously, can we block the annoying AI apps with Pi-hole?

There may be some that can be blocked. But, like the ads in streaming services - impervious to DNS blocking without also blocking the stream itself - DNS blocking probably won&#39;t be effective against AI stuff.

Simply don&#39;t connect the TV to the internet at all.

Well I do have the SmartTV blocklist [github.com] for pihole and blocking the Internet is a bit of a problem with streaming services.  I guess we now need a &quot;block AI Slop list&quot;

You&#39;ll be fed HDMI video from I device which I have control over.

You&#39;ll have no connection to the internet.

TV&#39;s which won&#39;t work without an internet connection, or those with cellular modems integrated to get internet connectivity behind the back of the consumer will be returned to the point of purchase for a refund.

It&#39;s cool that we can do things like this -it is a great technical demonstration.  I still don&#39;t want to buy it.

We can&#39;t use our phone keyboard to browse the menus yet

I&#39;ll never use the smarts of a Smart TV again. I got pulled in at the beginning and was left high and dry when, they not only discontinued support, they deleted my perfectly functional apps and features.

Now, I require a display panel. It will not be directly connected to the internet. I use a PC or 3rd party box(Apple TV, Roku, Firestick) when I want those services and display them on my neutered TV display panel.

You want to spy on me and fuck up my experience, you&#39;ve got my phone. But, my display panel(TV) is mine alone.

Idiocracy was just a movie, not a rulebook!

* 3D TV* Motion Smoothing on everything* Curved Screens* Advertising-subsidized TV prices* Now... AI Television hardware.

&quot;Depoliticized&quot;?  I think the politics of this enterprise may be firmly placed in the camp of whatever political system makes it possible for an individual to accumulate more wealth than a major department of the government dedicated to that same enterprise.

&quot;Oligarchy&quot; means Eric Schmidt doesn&#39;t stand for election or Senate approval but still gets to be part of the club that dictates how the force of the state is employed against (or for) its citizens.

Oligarchy doesn&#39;t mean Eric Schmidt is rich enough to pay for a space telescope.

1/106 of his net worth. Like me splurging on a high end GPU.

Why not just have Gemini, or whatever you&#39;re calling yours, generate the pictures instead?  It&#39;d save a lot of money over a spaceborne telescope!

&quot;Former Google CEO Plans To Singlehandedly Fund a Hubble Telescope Replacement &quot;

Half a billion probably isn&#39;t going to fund a Hubble replacement, never mind four of them. Private funding for things like this aren&#39;t that uncommon either. Vera Rubin&#39;s mirror was at least partially privately funded.

That&#39;s fine. And Tailwind never gets updated again, and you have to go find another solution and other companies have to migrate off.

Tailwind generates an enormous value and cannot pay their employees to maintain that value. That&#39;s a problem. It&#39;s not like tailwind is 200 employees, either.

We need to have a better model for OSS that has product companies shouldering their fair share.

As we move forward, there will be less and less incentive to share useful information.

I&#39;ve been on the internet since the early 90s.  There was useful information back then.  The amount of useful info grew and grew over the following couple of decades.  Over time, though, attention-seeking/ad-seeking bullshit sites grew and slowly drowned out the useful info.  The internet has grown more and more resistant to new and correcting information.

They come and go. At some point everyone is laughing at you for choosing the wrong CSS framework. At some point your favorite CSS framework has to be replaced. Granted, your framework is still fine. You will be able to do amazing things if you&#39;re still using Blueprint of 960.gs. And while I rag on Tailwind as being Font Tags 2.0, that at least let web designers create pages don&#39;t look like that framework where every site using it looks the same.

Sucking in all the creativity and giving AI Slop.

But what drives this is trend of having the basic unit of reusability be the component, which is improved by Tailwind removing some of the other bigger sins of inline styles. There&#39;s other methods on the same front that sidestep class standardization, like Vue Component style scoping. With the end goal being an enterprise library / storybook of consistent pre-styled components to include in multiple projects with upgrades handled in the same way as other JS packages.

What we call &quot;Dumb TVs,&quot; the industry calls &quot;monitors.&quot; Use that search term and you&#39;ll find plenty.

Yup, plenty out there in all the common sizes, just won&#39;t find them nearly as cheap as your average living room TV;

Yeah, the prices are initially surprising. I guess all the spying, ads, and preloaded crapware/shovelware have massively increased the margins on Smart TVs, so that competitive pressures brought the price to way below benevolent TVs. That should give us all an idea how many dollars worth of fuckery a Smart TV inflicts.

To be fair these displays are generally built to higher quality standards as well, they&#39;re meant to go into environments to run 16/7 or 24/7 and are warrantied as such so they&#39;re just made different and they sell far less of them then the consumer sets.

... And anyone who doubts this is invited to go into a sports bar and count the TVs where the picture is blue, or full of bright/dark spots, or half of it&#39;s dim, or ...

Yeah this is right in my industry so I have had to make this case to customers dozens if not hundreds of times when they ask &quot;i can get a 55&quot; TV at best buy for like $300&quot;

And yes you can can and that&#39;s even a viable plan but your warranty is DOA as soon as you hang it up in a store or restaurant so be prepared to replace when it fails.  Sometimes that is the better value still!

The commercial one is $1200 but it has a 3 or 5 or even 7 year warranty that the vendor will send someone to repair on-site.  Just d

This is not a product endorsement; I have no familiarity with the product and all I did was search Amazon and pick the first result (which was also sponsored). That said: Amazon claims to sell this [amazon.com].

(This is not a store endorsement, either, but it looks like Amazon will let you put it in your shopping cart (and presumably buy it) without asking who is going to use it for what. I only mention this because someone else posted that some vendor refuses to sell monitors to individuals.)

Don&#39;t connect it to your wifi.
I have an LG C2 (circa 2019). I disabled everything I could through the menus. I never plugged in ethernet and had wifi disabled. One day my wife turned on the TV and it started doing an update. I flipped out on her for obviously having turned on wifi, how else could it update? Nearly (okay, not quite, but felt like it) got divorced over it, until I realized, no she really hadn&#39;t. The damn TV formed a mesh network with my neighbour&#39;s TV over bluetooth (I live in an apartment and apparently the concrete floor wasn&#39;t enough to block the signal).
 
These TVs will stop at nothing to phone home and get connectivity. When I phoned LG and freaked out at them, they told me there was some setting about 6 menus deep, totally unrelated to anything mesh or network connectivity that if I disabled would prevent it from connecting to other TVs. It was not obvious, not mentioned anywhere in the documentation, or in the many many pages of EULA that I actually read through when I first turned on my TV after purchase.
 
I want a TV that takes an HDMI (or DisplayPort) and displays it. No TV Tuner, built-in apps, or internet enabled anything. It aslo needs to support HDCP or else my AppleTV refuses to send video to it. Regular Monitors don&#39;t have HDCP support without being a smartTV. It&#39;s infuriating.

Nothing connected to the internet is safe anymore.

IME, not very well, assuming the objective is to block offensive functionality while still being able to use streaming services and whatnot.  I&#39;ve made a couple halfhearted attempts at this, and run into issues -- the only effective strategy is to block everything and whitelist specific hosts to allow things to work, and then every week some service or another changes something or pushes an update that breaks it.  And some TVs, Samsung being notable for this, will keep popping up nags if they have a network

While I don&#39;t agree with much that Ken Paxton does, I&#39;ll take this small win.  It&#39;s bad enough when &quot;smart&quot; TVs snoop what&#39;s being watched through apps and network connections -- this bullshit, screen-capturing whatever&#39;s being fed in via HDMI etc. and doing analysis on it to come up with &quot;insights&quot; to sell, yeah, fuck you very much.  I&#39;d never connect a TV to the Internet anyway, but I&#39;m in a small minority in that regard, and regular people have rights too.

Now that we&#39;re working on getting invasive surveillance technology out of the lives of everyday Americans minding their own business, perhaps, Mr. Paxton, you&#39;d like to have a word with Flock?   *crickets*

Everyone here is praising this. They&#39;re just also using the opportunity to trash on Praxton, which is perfectly justified.

No the slashdot logic would say Samsung should stop selling them in Texas. Or is that only when the EU does consumer protection laws?

Dumb as they are, sometimes they do something right.

Now, let&#39;s see them so the same to an American company that does the same thing...

Ken Paxton is running for US Senate in 2026.

He desperately wants Texans to forget that he was impeached by his own party members on 20 counts of public corruption, bribery, abuse of power, obstruction of justice, and abuse of the public trust.

Everything he is doing is to grab headlines and distract voters.

The TV has not been connected to the internet since I got it 4 years ago and installed updates back then.A few weeks ago I had to change a setting and had to dig out my remote. it had lost pairing for the remote, but what was really strange was that I got an error that the TVs storage was full and it said i had to do a factory reset or contact support.

Last month, the Supreme Court held arguments in Olivier v. City of Brandon, a little-discussed case out of the controversial 5th Circuit that sounded, at first, like it would boil down to familiar ideological flashpoints. An evangelical preacher challenged a city ordinance under the First and 14th amendments that confined protestors to a designated zone outside a public amphitheater in Brandon, Mississippi. After the city’s police chief restricted where and how he could speak outside the theater, the preacher was cited, paid a fine, and later sued to prevent the city from enforcing the ordinance against him again.

But inside the courtroom, the argument barely touched speech or religion. Instead, the justices together gravitated toward something else entirely: a problem about time, causation, and whether constitutional authority can be temporally partitioned. Does the Constitution operate only forward? Can a law be unconstitutional tomorrow yet legally untouchable yesterday? And can a single conviction permanently close the courthouse doors to the people most harmed by an unconstitutional rule?

Those questions animated nearly every exchange. The court was wrestling not with what the First Amendment protects, but with whether constitutional rights can be exhausted by a single successful act of punishment.

The case turns on Heck v. Humphrey, a 1994 decision holding that civil rights lawsuits cannot be used to undermine the validity of a still-standing criminal conviction. The idea is straightforward. If you want to challenge the legality of your conviction or confinement, you must proceed through habeas, not through a damages suit.

But Olivier is not asking to undo his past conviction. He is asking the court to prevent the city from enforcing the ordinance against him in the future. The 5th Circuit nevertheless held that even this forward-looking challenge is barred under Heck because success would “necessarily imply” that his earlier conviction was invalid.

That logic produces something like constitutional amnesia. A potentially unconstitutional law can be challenged by people who have never been punished under it, but not by the person who has already borne its force. The state’s prior enforcement becomes a kind of legal eraser, wiping away the injured party’s ability to seek future protection.

What makes this move especially strained is that Heck was never meant to function as a roving doctrine of constitutional quarantine. It was designed to prevent civil lawsuits from becoming backdoor appeals of criminal judgments. It polices remedies and the finality of convictions, not the enforceability of unconstitutional laws going forward. When the doctrine is stretched to block purely prospective relief, it stops mediating between two remedial systems and starts manufacturing a new form of immunity, one that insulates unconstitutional rules simply because they have already succeeded once. In that transformation, Heck ceases to be a rule about procedural sequencing and becomes a rule about who is permitted to invoke constitutional protection at all.

The court seemed acutely aware of the tension. Several justices pressed the same concern from different angles. If Olivier wins and the ordinance is declared unconstitutional, does that not logically demonstrate that his past conviction was unlawful too? Justice Elena Kagan put the problem plainly. If a court declares the statute unconstitutional, “what follows from that logically is that the past conviction was infirm.”

The discomfort was palpable. No one wanted to say out loud that constitutional protection must bend to the preservation of old judgments. Yet that is exactly what the 5th Circuit’s rule requires.

As the hypotheticals posed by the justices multiplied, the doctrine began to drift from lived reality. What if a defendant is still on probation when he seeks prospective relief? Would an injunction against future enforcement undermine the probation condition not to violate the law again? What if collateral consequences persist, such as reporting requirements or licensing barriers?

The answers became increasingly abstract. The law tried to slice time into clean compartments. Yesterday’s conviction remains untouched. Tomorrow’s enforcement is forbidden. Between the two sits a fragile procedural fiction the system clings to in order to pretend these worlds do not meaningfully collide.

This is where rights start to resemble procedural ghosts. They exist in theory but lose substance in practice. They hover over the future while refusing to acknowledge the bodies they already passed through. Law becomes ritualized rather than responsive, and the problem of temporality determines whether constitutional law recognizes continuity across lived experience or whether it tolerates a fragmented legal time in which the same rule can be forbidden prospectively yet insulated retrospectively.

One irony hovered over the argument. The person with the strongest proof that the ordinance threatens constitutional injury is Olivier himself. He has already been stopped, cited, and punished. Past enforcement is the clearest evidence that future enforcement is likely. Even the government conceded that a third party could bring the same challenge and that such a ruling would equally undermine the logic of Olivier’s conviction.

The result is a system in which the people most harmed by unconstitutional laws become the least able to contest them and the Constitution speaks through hypothetical plaintiffs rather than lived ones. Beneath the doctrinal sparring lies a familiar institutional fear characterized by destabilizing final judgments, opening procedural floodgates, and unraveling the architecture of criminal finality. Courts value closure, fear endless relitigation, and worry about conflicting judgments.

Those concerns are not frivolous. But they carry a cost. When administrative peace becomes the dominant value, constitutional rights risk becoming archival artifacts rather than living guarantees. The question is not whether finality matters, but whether finality should subordinate the Constitution itself.

At its core, Olivier asks whether constitutional rights belong to citizens as ongoing protections or merely as retrospective abstractions that harden once violated. Can the Constitution operate only in the future while the past is sealed off as doctrinally untouchable? Or does constitutional meaning necessarily travel across time, illuminating both what was done and what may not be done again?

If constitutional protections can expire the moment the state successfully enforces a law once, then what exactly are they protecting?

The first year of President Donald Trump’s second term in office has seen him unleash heavily armed Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection agents in Democratic-leaning cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and Minneapolis in what clearly appears to be a campaign of harassment and intimidation aimed at punishing those cities for their citizens’ political views. These officers’ behavior has been violent enough that Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker recently established a commission to look into charging federal agents in state court for their actions. So far, however, despite a growing list of violent and threatening acts by ICE and CBP, no local prosecutor in any city that ICE and CBP has “blitzed” has filed charges against any federal officers.

That may now change. On Wednesday, an ICE officer shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old widowed mother of a now-orphaned 6-year-old child, whose car was blocking theirs. While the Department of Homeland Security quickly claimed the officer was acting in self-defense—DHS Secretary Kristi Noem hyperbolically said the officer was defending himself against “domestic terrorism”—cellphone videos taken by people on the scene tell a much different story. The officers aggressively approached the car, and none of the officers involved appear to be in much risk of harm before one opens fire at almost point-blank range, firing multiple shots through the window of the car, striking Good in the head and killing her. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has already said the state will “ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice.” And the Minneapolis police chief has likewise called for an investigation in a statement that put Good’s life, not the officer’s safety, in the foreground. All this certainly seems to suggest there is a real chance that local officials are open to arresting the still-unnamed ICE officer and charging him with homicide.

Which, to be clear, they legally can do. Back in October, Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of state for policy who is the driving force behind the current militaristic deployment of ICE and CBP, publicly told ICE officers during a Fox News interview that local officials could not even stop them, much less arrest them. But he is wrong. While it is true that federal courts have read the U.S. Constitution’s “supremacy clause” to give federal law enforcement a lot of protection from local charges, that protection can disappear if those officers act too recklessly, as is certainly plausible here.

It is also important to note that the claim made on Thursday by Noem that the FBI is excluding Minnesota authorities from the investigation because only the FBI has jurisdiction is completely incorrect as well. The FBI’s own website acknowledges that it cannot “take over” investigations from local authorities.

So the question now becomes not whether local officials can prosecute the ICE agent, but whether an investigation yields proof a crime was committed and they have the political desire to follow through with charges. At the investigatory level, it is not promising that the Minnesota’s state-level Bureau of Criminal Apprehension announced that it was no longer investigating the shooting due to the FBI’s refusal to cooperate, a choice that is not legally required by the FBI’s obstructive actions. But the Minneapolis Police Department, which is ultimately under the control of a clearly-angry Mayor Jacob Frey, is still free to conduct its own investigation,

Perhaps more important, there is certainly evidence to suggest that the Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty—who can bring charges even without any arrest—is not one to back down from a case like this. The former chief public defender for Hennepin County (the home of Minneapolis), she ran as a reform candidate for the top prosecutor job in 2022; one of her platform’s positions was the need to better hold police accountable for misconduct, including charging them when they break the law.

Since taking office, she has sought to do so, if perhaps sometimes arguably too aggressively. In 2024, she found herself caught up in a controversy over charging a state trooper, Ryan Londregan, with homicide when he shot and killed Ricky Cobb II during a traffic stop. Londregan shot and killed Cobb when, he claimed, Cobb was reaching for his gun during a struggle during the stop. While Moriarty pushed for charges, she eventually had to hire outside counsel to pursue the case because allegedly no prosecutors in her own office were willing to. At one point the state attorney general, Keith Ellison, said he was keeping tabs on the case in case he needed to step in to deal with it himself, likely out of concern that Moriarty was being overly aggressive. Tellingly, the state police union, the MPPOA, asked for Ellison—the man whose office convicted Derek Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd—to intervene, although Moriarty eventually dropped the charges on her own.

In other words, Moriarty does not appear to be one who would back down from a fight here. And it is a fight that will likely be politically popular. ICE is deeply unpopular nationwide. The only federal agency that is liked less is the IRS. And despite a massive media and sign-on incentive campaign fueled by billions of unrestricted dollars that Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” gave ICE, the agency has struggled to find people willing to join it. Moreover, Moriarty represents the people of Hennepin County, where Kamala Harris defeated Trump in 2024 by over 40 points, and ICE is absolutely detested by Democrats and independents. In a November 2025 YouGov poll, 85 percent of Democrats and 62 percent of independents said they “somewhat or strongly disapprove” of ICE. And while GOP support for ICE remains quite high, we saw in Chicago that even Republicans seem to tire of ICE when it arrives in their communities.

One important caveat: The political upside is not directly relevant for Moriarty, since she announced this summer that she is not running for reelection. But she said that she was declining to run because she wanted the rest of her term to be about putting criminal legal reform in a good light and felt controversies around her distracted from that, so the politics of charging an ICE officer likely still matter to her. And the outrage already clearly brewing in Minneapolis makes it clear that the people of Hennepin are demanding accountability.

It’s also worth asking why we haven’t seen any similar efforts to prosecute federal officers in other strongly Democratic-leaning counties that have seen aggressive, violent ICE and CBP enforcement. Part of it is likely just the nature of the cases: The other lethal shootings have seemed more ambiguous, and the returns on going after nonhomicide assaults—even egregious ones like sniping a reverend in the head with a pepper ball—may not justify the unavoidable challenges of trying to convict federal officials on state charges.

But part of it may also be that we are seeing some of the costs of the Democrats’ only-lukewarm embrace of criminal legal reform. In 2024, a tough-on-crime Democrat, who received the endorsement of the local police union, squeaked out a razor-thin win over a more reform-minded candidate in the primary for Cook County state’s attorney, leaving Chicago with a prosecutor disinclined to go after the police in general as “Operation Midway Blitz” kicked off. And in Los Angeles, reformer George Gascón lost his reelection campaign in 2024 to a former federal prosecutor who has often remained distinctly quiet in the face of aggressive ICE behavior. By electing prosecutors less willing to confront police misconduct, two cities hit hard by ICE also found themselves with prosecutors less willing to stand up against ICE for them. (At least in California, however, the state attorney general still has the freedom to step in to pick up any perceived slack; the Illinois attorney general has less power in this regard.)

But whatever hesitancy we have seen elsewhere, it’s certainly possible that Minneapolis will be the first city to push back against the current right-wing authoritarianism in D.C. by indicting one of its federal agents for murder. The video evidence is shocking, the public outrage in Minneapolis and beyond is growing, and the city happens to be home to a prosecutor who has spent her legal career fighting police violence.

After nine months of relative silence on the matter, President Donald Trump is once again making noise about taking over Greenland, by force if necessary.

Perhaps it’s the result of his sugar-high, brought on by last weekend’s military operation in Venezuela, a country that he now says he “runs” and whose potentially vast oil resources he claims to control.

In any case, U.S. allies worldwide are alarmed—some are even uncharacteristically objecting in public—by Trump’s unabashedly imperialist turn. Others, notably Russia and China, may be tempted by the implicit green light that he has signaled, intentionally or not, toward their own ambitions for regional domination of Ukraine and Taiwan, respectively.

Many are simply baffled by this obsession with territorial expansion. House Speaker Mike Johnson insists that Trump has no intention of launching a military invasion of Greenland. Secretary of State and National Security Adviser Marco Rubio notes that Trump wants to buy Greenland, not conquer the place—though this provides little reassurance about the president’s mindset.

Yet this desire to take over Greenland seems to stem from an impulse even cruder than one might suspect. Susan Glasser and Peter Baker reported in their book, The Divider, about Trump’s first term as president, that the idea was inspired by his friend and supporter billionaire perfume heir Ronald Lauder, who one day pointed to a map alleging to show the appeal of acquiring Greenland.

Not long after, the president raised the idea at a National Security Council meeting. As Trump himself recounted to the authors:

I said, “Why don’t we have that?” You take a look at a map. I’m a real-estate developer. I look at a corner, I say, “I’ve got to get that store for the building that I’m building,” etc. It’s not that different. I love maps. And I always said, “Look at the size of this [Greenland]. It’s massive. That should be part of the United States.”

Actually, it’s not that massive. Flat Mercator-projection maps, like the one Lauder showed Trump, exaggerate the size of landmasses near the Earth’s north and south poles. Greenland, which looks larger than the United States on such maps, is in fact only slightly larger than Mexico, which Trump hasn’t coveted for its size, even though it’s right on our border, not 1,200 miles from our closest coastline.

Still, could that be it? Trump’s a real-estate magnate; he sees a big slab of land; he wants it? Seems so. In fact, back in 2019, when he first talked publicly about buying the land, he thought his right to do so was so self-evident that he was shocked when the prime minister of Denmark—which has long controlled Greenland as an autonomous territory—told him it wasn’t for sale; he even canceled an upcoming visit to Copenhagen over her “nasty” rejection.

Other rationales for grabbing the island nation have since entered the picture, perhaps after briefings by aides who know that part of their job involves feeding the boss’ appetite, however bizarre. Though it’s largely uninhabited—with just 56,000 residents, most of them Inuits—Greenland does hold massive, though ice-covered, mineral deposits. And it has geostrategic value. During the Cold War, admirals talked about the “GIUK Gap,” the initials standing for Greenland, Iceland, and the United Kingdom. U.S. air and naval policy in those days was to keep Soviet ships and submarines holed up north of the Gap, so they don’t pose much of a threat; let them into the Gap, and they could threaten the Atlantic’s vital sea lanes. The same is true today, as the melting of Arctic ice allows Russian and Chinese vessels new routes into the lanes.

But so what? The U.S. can defend those lanes without annexing Greenland. It and Denmark are both members of NATO. The United States has an enormous air and missile-defense base in Greenland. It has also signed deals for vast access to bases in Denmark, and Danish leaders have offered to expand the terms and the size of U.S. troop deployments. There are also many other bases nearby, manned and operated by U.S. and various European defense forces.

This is one reason a country has allies and foreign bases—so it can defend its interests without having to invade or buy up half the world.

Of course, Trump’s renewed rumblings about Greenland—which seem less fantastical since his openly imperial operation in Venezuela—are disrupting those alliances. Some close U.S. allies voted to condemn the Caracas raid at an emergency session of the U.N. Security Council. Others—including British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has taken great pains to avoid confrontations with the sensitive American president—warned Trump very sternly not to make serious moves on Greenland. Denmark’s prime minister said that such a move—one NATO country threatening the sovereignty of another—would destroy the alliance and crater the foundations of peace in Europe since World War II.

Commentators in South Korea and Japan who are closely aligned with their governments’ political positions have noted that Trump’s latest words and deeds provide growing evidence—even more so than earlier words and deeds—that the largest democracies in Asia can no longer rely on the U.S. for protection. The resulting dangers are considerable—the possibility of nuclear proliferation and new arms races (as allies, who have relied on America’s “nuclear umbrella” for their ultimate defense, conclude they need to erect their own) or even armed conflict (as, for instance, China or North Korea see the need to pounce while the U.S. veers away).

Back during Trump’s eruptions of bombast over Greenland in his first term, H.R. McMaster, who had recently stepped down (or been fired) as his national security adviser, waved away concerns, saying, “This is just President Trump being President Trump.”

Now, not quite a year into his much more volcanic and disruptive second term, McMaster’s wave-off reads as something other than reassurance today. Yes, this is President Trump. The world is very worried, and we should be too.

Shortly after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis on Wednesday, city leaders began looking into whether the officer had violated state criminal law.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said, “We collectively are going to do everything possible to get to the bottom of this, to get justice, and to make sure that there is an investigation that is conducted in full.” Police Chief Brian O’Hara followed up by saying that the state’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is “investigat[ing] whether any state laws within the state of Minnesota have been violated.”

If they conclude that state law has been violated, the question is: What next? Contrary to recent assertions from some federal officials, states can prosecute federal officers for violating state criminal laws, and there is precedent for that.

Although federal officers do have immunity in some circumstances, that protection applies only if their actions were authorized under federal law and “necessary and proper” in fulfilling federal duties. When federal officers violate federal law or act unreasonably when carrying out their duties, they can face state charges.

States have a long history of prosecuting federal officials for allegedly using excessive force on the job. And when federal courts agree that the force may not have been legally justified, they have allowed the state prosecution to proceed.

In a high-profile incident from the 1990s, for example, an FBI sniper shot and accidentally killed an unarmed woman while carrying out a siege of a cabin near Ruby Ridge, Idaho. U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno decided not to pursue charges, but a county prosecutor in the state did, charging the sniper with involuntary manslaughter. The federal 9th Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the state prosecution to proceed, concluding that there were “material questions of fact” about whether the sniper’s use of deadly force was reasonable. If it wasn’t, the court explained, he would not be immune from state prosecution. (The charges were later dropped after the prosecutor who brought the case left office.)

Similarly, in 1906, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed a state prosecution to go ahead against two federal soldiers who had shot and killed a man they believed was stealing from federal property. As with the Idaho case, key facts were in dispute. The court concluded that if the man had stopped and surrendered, as multiple witnesses attested, “it could not reasonably be claimed that the fatal shot was fired in the performance of a duty imposed by the Federal law,” and the soldiers could be held liable.

There are also a host of cases from the early-1900s prohibition era in which states charged federal officers with murder, attempted murder, or other crimes when they used lethal force to carry out prohibition-related arrests or seize distillery equipment. Again, when federal courts concluded that the federal officers’ use of force appeared unreasonable—such as by shooting into cars that officers believed were transporting alcohol—the courts allowed the state prosecutions to proceed.

To be sure, there are also plenty of cases in which federal courts have instead dismissed state prosecutions on the grounds that the federal officers were properly discharging their federal duties. For example, the foundational Supreme Court case on this type of immunity dismissed a state murder prosecution of a U.S. marshal who had justifiably killed an attacker while protecting a Supreme Court justice. But when an officer’s actions are not authorized by federal law or are not “necessary and proper” to fulfill federal duties—such as when an officer uses unreasonable force—state prosecutions can and do go ahead.

If state or local prosecutors in Minnesota were to charge a federal officer with a state crime, that case would play out differently from a typical state criminal prosecution.

Most significantly, it would likely take place in federal court rather than state court. A federal statute allows federal officers to move state criminal cases from state to federal court if they have a defense rooted in federal law. Any federal officer charged with a state-law crime for actions committed on the job will almost certainly try to claim federal immunity from state prosecution. That defense will typically suffice to get the case into federal court, even if the immunity claim ultimately fails.

But the move to federal court doesn’t mean that federal players would take over the entire process. The state or local prosecutor would still prosecute the case in federal court. And the criminal charges would still be for state-law crimes. Importantly, this means that if an officer were convicted, the president could not pardon them. The president can pardon individuals only for federal crimes, not state crimes.

Additionally, if state or local prosecutors do bring charges, the pretrial litigation over immunity could well be lengthy. In the Idaho case discussed above, for example, the incidents took place in 1992, and it wasn’t until 2001 that the 9th Circuit ultimately ruled that the case could go ahead. The various lower-court proceedings and appeals took considerable time.

Despite these procedural complexities, the bottom line is that federal officers are not categorically immune from state prosecution for actions carried out while on duty. And states have long demonstrated that they are willing to bring such charges when it comes to excessive use of force.

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/08/nvidia_h200_china/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nvidia&#39;s H200 GPUs could begin trickling into China as soon as this quarter, but there&#39;s a catch. Due to all the geopolitical turmoil that&#39;s ravaged US-China trade relations over the past year, buyers may need to pay up front for the coveted AI accelerators. And they won&#39;t get a refund if China decides to block the imports!

On Thursday, Bloomberg reported that authorities in Beijing could green-light shipments of H200s - currently the most powerful GPU Uncle Sam has ever allowed Nvidia to sell in China - as soon as this quarter.

However, on the off chance that the Chinese government changes its mind, Reuters, citing multiple anonymous sources, reports Nvidia is requiring advance payment for the chips with no option for a refund if they&#39;re canceled.

These conditions, the report notes, aren&#39;t entirely new. Apparently, Nvidia has previously required advance payments from customers in the Middle Kingdom, but it wasn&#39;t uncommon for the chip biz to grant exceptions allowing orders to be placed with just a deposit.

For the H200, the newswire claims Nvidia has cracked down on this mandate in order to de-risk the transactions with some exceptions being made to allow for commercial insurance or asset collateral.

The Trump administration lifted a Biden-era restriction on Nvidia&#39;s H200 sales to China last month in exchange for a 25 percent fee on the resulting revenue. Since then, Chinese hyperscalers and model builders are said to have placed orders for more than two million of the now two-year-old AI accelerators.

Despite its advancing age and a growing number of domestic alternatives, the H200 is still among the most potent chips available in the region, boasting performance roughly 6x that of the H20.

TikTok parent company ByteDance is apparently so enthused by the chip that it plans to spend about $14 billion on them in 2026 alone.

Unfortunately for Nvidia, its existing stockpile of H200s won&#39;t be enough to satiate Chinese customers. According to earlier reports, Nvidia currently has about 700,000 H200 accelerators in its inventory and has approached TSMC about reramping production of the chips, which use an older process tech than what&#39;s found in its Blackwell and Rubin generations, to meet demand.

Those chips, we&#39;ll note, still aren&#39;t available for sale in China, though Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang remains optimistic that, with time, its latest generation of chips will find their way to the Middle Kingdom. Huang certainly has reason to be excited about regaining access to the Chinese market. During an earnings call last summer, he quipped that China would have been a $50 billion a year market if the chip biz were able to flog its best products there.

With that said, reramping production of the aging chips is inherently risky. With two generations of Blackwell GPUs and Nvidia&#39;s next-gen Rubin GPUs unveiled this week, the market for H200s outside of China has never been smaller. If trade relations were to sour between the US and China, Nvidia could find itself with a glut of outdated silicon on its hands.

It wouldn&#39;t be the first time US trade policy has caused headaches for the AI arms dealer. Last spring, the Trump administration moved to block sales of H20 accelerators to China. That decision was later reversed, but not before dealing Nvidia a roughly $10.5 billion revenue hit across the first half of its 2026 fiscal year.

Nvidia declined to comment on this story. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We hope you like more AI in your Gmail inbox, because Google is &quot;bringing Gmail into the Gemini era.&quot; It&#39;ll be on by default, but the good news is that you can disable it.

The threat, issued on Thursday by Google&#39;s VP of product Blake Barnes, sees the company expanding the reach of a trio of inbox AI features that were previously only available to Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers. You know - the folks who actually wanted the stuff.

Now, Barnes explained, everyone will be getting a dose of Google&#39;s much-derided AI Overviews in their Gmail inbox, along with Help Me Write features and new Suggested Reply features that are supposed to be more contextual, based on a user&#39;s writing style, and helpful.

&quot;Just like they do in Google Search, AI Overviews turn information into answers without the digging,&quot; Barnes said. &quot;When you open an email with dozens of replies, Gmail synthesizes the entire conversation into a concise summary of key points.&quot;

Google is also rolling out natural language inbox search, which could be the most helpful of the new features. Unfortunately for the many non-paying plebeians using Gmail for free, that feature is only available for Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers - hey, gotta give them something if those previously paid AI features are being rolled out to everyone.

As for composition help, &quot;everyone can use Help Me Write to polish emails or draft them from scratch,&quot; Barnes said. Smart Replies - the prior trio of AI-generated responses to emails - are also being updated with Suggested Replies, &quot;which use the context of your conversation to offer relevant, one-click responses that match how you write.&quot;

AI proofreading, which we assume will be more helpful than the current squiggly underlining of incorrectly spelled words and poor grammar, is also being rolled out on Thursday, but just to Pro and Ultra subscribers, Google explained.

Barnes also threatened Gmail users with a full-on &quot;AI Inbox&quot; view that is only being rolled out to select testers for now, but will be more broadly available in the coming months. That view, as demonstrated in a video published by Google on Thursday, turns the standard Gmail inbox into a list of daily to-dos designed to help users prioritize their inbox workload &quot;based on signals like people you email frequently, those in your contacts list and relationships it can infer from message content.&quot;

Gmail users in the US with English set as their primary language are the first ones to be subjected to these new features, which a Google spokesperson told us should be gradually rolling out to users in the next few days.

For those worried about the privacy of their Gmail content, Google claimed in an email that it&#39;s not going to use personal message text to train its foundational models and does all AI processing in an isolated environment.

&quot;When Gmail connects the dots between your emails to answer a question, it does that work in a private space dedicated solely to your task,&quot; the spokesperson explained. &quot;The data is processed to give you an answer, and it never leaves that secure boundary.&quot;

Of course, this assumes the answers you get from Gemini in Gmail will be accurate, and that&#39;s far from a guarantee. Take, for example, a recent Google job posting for an AI answers quality engineer. While the job posting will see a new Google employee &quot;help the AI Answers Quality team deliver AI Overviews to users&#39; hard and complicated queries on the [search results page] and in AI Mode,&quot; where there&#39;s AI smoke, there may be AI fire, and it&#39;s entirely possible the version of Gemini that&#39;s stuffed into people&#39;s email inboxes could make mistakes, too.

For those who&#39;d prefer to skip the Gemini-ification of their email, Google also told us that the features can all be disabled, though that comes with a slight catch: Disabling AI in Gmail requires disabling Gmail smart features entirely, which means no more inbox tabs or messages sorted by type.

To disable Smart Features, just navigate to Settings -> General and scroll down until you see the &quot;Smart features&quot; header. Uncheck the &quot;Turn on smart features&quot; box and you should be good to go.

To avoid dealing with future forced AI insertion into your email business, it&#39;s also not a bad idea to check out a standalone email application like Thunderbird, or the built-in email client in your operating system, all of which support Gmail and don&#39;t require dealing with an ever-changing web interface to access your messages. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/08/rcisco_ise_bug_poc/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Cisco patched a bug in its Identity Services Engine (ISE) and ISE Passive Identity Connector (ISE-PIC) products that allows remote attackers with admin-level privileges to access sensitive information - and warned that a public, proof-of-concept exploit for the flaw exists online.

ISE is Cisco&#39;s network access control and security policy platform, and companies use it to centrally manage and enforce security policies across users and devices.

The bug, tracked as CVE-2026-20029, received a medium-severity 4.9 CVSS rating and it affects ISE and ISE-PIC, regardless of device configuration. It&#39;s due to improper parsing of XML processed by ISE and ISE-PIC&#39;s web-based management interface.

&quot;An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a malicious file to the application,&quot; according to the Wednesday security advisory. &quot;A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read arbitrary files from the underlying operating system that could include sensitive data that should otherwise be inaccessible even to administrators.&quot;

Cisco credited Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative&#39;s bug hunter Bobby Gould with spotting and reporting this vulnerability.

&quot;This vulnerability does require authentication, so that&#39;s the first barrier to exploitation,&quot; ZDI&#39;s Head of Threat Awareness Dustin Childs told The Register, adding that ZDI doesn&#39;t expect to see widespread abuse of this flaw given its high-privilege requirements.

But, assuming that an attacker stole or otherwise obtained admin credentials, they &quot;could leak the contents of files on an affected system,&quot; Childs added.

The good news is that, as of now, Cisco and ZDI say they&#39;re not aware of any in-the-wild abuse of this CVE.

But considering the existence of a POC, which provides a blueprint on how to exploit the bug, we&#39;re guessing that CVE-2026-20029&#39;s exploitation status will soon change - so patch now.

It&#39;s unclear who published the POC, and Childs told us it wasn&#39;t ZDI. &quot;We have not published PoC for this bug and have no plans to do so,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#39;re not aware where the public PoC was published.&quot;

Companies should prioritize implementing this fix as networking devices are long-time favorites among government-backed attackers - and especially those from China - which means companies shouldn&#39;t leave these holes open for long.

In November, Amazon warned that an &quot;advanced&quot; attacker had exploited a max-severity ISE bug (CVE-2025-20337) as a zero-day to deploy custom malware.

In July, researchers warned that miscreants had been exploiting another 10 out of 10 CVSS-rated ISE flaw (CVE-2025-20281), prompting Cisco to acknowledge in-the-wild activity and urge customers to patch.

The networking giant had originally disclosed CVE-2025-20281 in a June security advisory covering multiple max-severity flaws in the same ISE products, and later updated the bulletin as exploitation emerged. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Today, it is hard to escape LLM bots and the endless slop they emit, but the Linux kernel might be largely safe … for now.

Linus Torvalds has spoken up on the contentious topic of LLM-assisted software development. Despite his previous guardedly positive stance, for now, he seems to have come out strongly against it in the context he cares about the most – developing code for the Linux kernel. But he also doesn&#39;t want the documentation to become a political battlefield over this point.

He was responding to a message from Oracle-affiliated kernel developer Lorenzo Stokes, which seems to us to be guardedly anti-LLM: &quot;Thinking LLMs are &#39;just another tool&#39; is to say effectively that the kernel is immune from this. Which seems to me a silly position.&quot;

There is zero point in talking about AI slop. That&#39;s just plain stupid.

Why? Because the AI slop people aren&#39;t going to document their patches as such. That&#39;s such an obvious truism that I don&#39;t understand why anybody even brings up AI slop.

The documentation is for good actors, and pretending anything else is pointless posturing.

As I said in private elsewhere, I do not want any kernel development documentation to be some AI statement. We have enough people on both sides of the &quot;sky is falling&quot; and &quot;it&#39;s going to revolutionize software engineering&quot;, I don&#39;t want some kernel development docs to take either stance.

It&#39;s why I strongly want this to be that &quot;just a tool&quot; statement.

And the AI slop issue is NOT going to be solved with documentation, and anybody who thinks it is either just naive, or wants to &quot;make a statement&quot;.

Neither of which is a good reason for documentation.

Rather than try to paraphrase the great man, we thought we&#39;d just give you his own words. However, we do also face the slight issue that it&#39;s not entirely clear to us what Torvalds&#39;s position here really is.

Stokes was replying to an email from Dave Hansen. As Linux benchmark and commentary site Phoronix reported in November, a team is working on a set of clear, unambiguous guidelines concerning LLM-bot-assisted contributions to the kernel.

It&#39;s a pressing issue. People are already using LLM coding assistants to work on kernel code: for instance, last year, Wikimedia developer Dmitry Brant blogged about Using Claude Code to modernize a 25-year-old kernel driver.

The Register has reported on Torvalds&#39;s various comments on LLM-bot-assisted coding several times in recent years. In 2024, he said that 90 percent of AI marketing is hype. (To be honest, the Reg FOSS desk thinks that&#39;s generous: we&#39;d be happy to learn it was as low as 90 per cent.) A year later, he commented that he was OK with vibe coding as long as it&#39;s not used for anything that matters, which was a little unexpected. The Reg&#39;s own Rupert Goodwins begged to differ, writing &quot;Vibe coding: What is it good for? Absolutely nothing (Sorry, Linus)&quot;.

For now, LLM coding assistants are so popular with so many that Torvalds is right: if the kernel flatly prohibits their use, then they&#39;ll get used anyway. They can and do emit code-like text, and lots of it, and currently they&#39;re cheap. Ban them, and they&#39;ll still be used – the users will just deny it.

Of course, they might not remain cheap. This vulture strongly suspects that another AI winter is coming. The first one was circa 1984, and the second about a decade later, with the end of the Fifth Generation Computer Systems project sponsored by Japan&#39;s Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI). Now, all that is left of the FGCS is a web museum.

We suspect that the third and biggest AI winter is imminent. Some analysts think so too, while others feel that what&#39;s left behind will remain valuable. Right now, the &quot;generative AI&quot; industry is spending vast amounts to subsidize these models and their use, propping up the US economy in the hope of future trillion-dollar-scale profitability. If that doesn&#39;t happen and the industry collapses, the coding-assistant advocates may suddenly find that plain old human brainpower is much cheaper than hundreds of billions of dollars&#39; worth of datacentres.

Some large model prices are already increasing sharply. Put another few zeros on the end of the pricing and we suspect people may get much less keen on using them. This may yet prove to be a self-correcting issue, given a few years. ®

            <h2>Why colos are city slickers and hyperscalers are country bumpkins</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Datacenter building decisions tend to fall into two camps with colocation providers plumping for urban areas while hyperscalers seek sites where electricity, land, and construction costs come cheaper.

A study by the William Marsh Rice University in Texas, commonly referred to as Rice University, found that colocation facilities tend to be found in areas such as cities for proximity to their business customers, while hyperscale server farms follow a different tack.

Giants like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft prefer to concentrate massive facilities in a relatively small number of lower-density regions, where energy, land, and construction costs are lower, making economies of scale easier to achieve, the researchers say.

The study, by assistant professor of strategic management Tommy Pan Fang at Rice University and Shane Greenstein of Harvard Business School, offers a large-scale statistical analysis of datacenter location strategies across the US. The aim is to provide both policymakers and firms with a clearer understanding of how different types of facility get located in response to economic and strategic incentives.

Using county-level data, the researchers say they were able to model how population density, the mix of industries, and operating costs all help to predict where new datacenters are most likely to be sited.

Third-party providers, meaning colocation and hosting companies, locate in urban areas because that&#39;s where customers (financial, etc) are based, and they place a high value on low latency, secure storage, and compliance with regulatory standards.

But that doesn&#39;t mean that hyperscale campuses are likely to pop up in any old rural setting. As well as power and water, datacenters need network infrastructure that is sufficient to meet their requirements.

This is why areas such as Northern Virginia, the world&#39;s &quot;datacenter capital,&quot; have proven such a hotspot for server farms, and hyperscale facilities in particular. Here, between 10 to 15 percent of global hyperscale capacity is located, at least double that of anywhere else, having benefited from early network infrastructure investment that made it a draw for digital traffic, the researchers say.

But future datacenter expansion may follow a more hybrid pattern, according to the study&#39;s authors, with massive regional hubs complemented by strategic colocation facilities where latency becomes an issue.

Previous reports found that datacenters predominantly focused on AI workloads are less sensitive to latency, and may be located some distance from cities, so long as power is available.

Meanwhile, in Europe, the availability of land and high energy costs are the main factors, alongside long delays to get connected to the grid. High demand in the main Euro datacenter hubs is driving investment in emerging secondary markets, including Oslo and Madrid. ®

            <div id="article-text">NASA has postponed today&#39;s spacewalk outside the International Space Station (ISS) due to an undisclosed &quot;medical concern&quot; with a crew member.

The US space agency has shared few details, other than the fact that the issue arose yesterday and resulted in today&#39;s spacewalk being delayed. The single crew member involved is in stable condition, according to a NASA spokesperson.

The spokesperson added: &quot;Safely conducting our missions is our highest priority, and we are actively evaluating all options, including the possibility of an earlier end to Crew-11&#39;s mission. These are the situations NASA and our partners train for and prepare to execute safely.&quot;

The SpaceX Crew-11 mission is the 11th SpaceX operational mission, and the crew consists of NASA astronauts Mike Fincke and Zena Cardman, JAXA astronaut Kimiya Yui, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Oleg Platonov.

While there is no definitive end date for the Crew-11 mission, the SpaceX Crew-12 mission is due to launch no earlier than February 15, 2026.

Fincke, a Space Shuttle veteran, was initially set to fly on Boeing&#39;s CST-100 Starliner Crew Flight Test before being made the pilot of the first operational mission of the Calamity Capsule. He was then moved to the SpaceX Crew-11 mission, along with Yui. Cardman was to have been the commander of the SpaceX Crew-9 mission before being removed (along with fellow astronaut Stephanie Wilson) to make room for the returning Starliner astronauts, Barry Wilmore and Sunita Williams.

Station commander Fincke and flight engineer Cardman were set to venture outside the orbiting laboratory for a six-and-a-half-hour spacewalk to route cables for a future solar array, install jumper cables, snap photos of hardware, and collect microorganism samples.

Shortly before NASA&#39;s announcement, Cardman shared an image of Yui reflected in the visor of a helmet. Yui and NASA astronaut Chris Williams were to run the suit-up operations for today&#39;s postponed spacewalk.

While Yui, Williams, Cardman, and Fincke were preparing for the spacewalk, Roscosmos flight engineers Sergey Kud-Sverchkov and Oleg Platonov were investigating the use of AI to transcribe audio files documenting crew activities, and Sergei Mikaev worked on uninstalling a camera that photographed landmarks during the crew&#39;s sleep shift.

Williams and Yui later worked on physics and microbiology research.

While the nature of the medical concern is private, NASA is expected to share a new date for the upcoming spacewalk in the near future. ®

            <div id="article-text">﻿From rollable concepts to sleek dual-screens.

﻿From rollable concepts to sleek dual-screens.

CES is always jam-packed with new laptop announcements, acting as a barometer for the year’s upcoming releases. The proofs of concept at the show display what could potentially come further in the future. 2026 will soon bring us new chip options from Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm. While I’m excited to see how the latest horse race shakes out, some of the new designs and form factors displayed at the show are easily more compelling.

There was a myriad of new models shown from Asus, Lenovo, Dell, MSI, Acer, and HP. Here’s my shortlist of all the ones I’m most looking forward to testing — or hoping that there will even be an opportunity to test in the future.

I love OLEDs and I enjoy a good gaming laptop. The Asus ROG Zephyrus Duo is a gaming laptop based on the excellent Zephyrus G16, but with two full-size OLED displays. Sign me up.

The original Zephyrus Duo was a strange experiment for a laptop with two screens. The lower display was a decently sized strip across the bottom, but now for 2026 the second screen is the whole dang bottom half of the laptop like it should have always been. Asus basically took the dual-screen design it established a couple years ago with the productivity-focused Zenbook Duo and translated it into a Zephyrus gaming laptop. It’s going to make tradeoffs, because the new Zephyrus Duo is likely going to cost more than the standard Zephyrus G16 while not being as powerful, but in exchange you get two 16-inch OLEDs with a 120Hz refresh rate for a multi-monitor setup you can take on the go.

The 2026 Zephyrus Duo looks very promising as a combination gaming laptop and power-user-friendly multiscreen workhorse. There’s really nothing else quite like it. Now let’s cross our fingers that this unique laptop doesn’t get a uniquely high price to match.

I was instantly a fan of rollable laptops when I got to see Lenovo’s concept become a reality at last year’s CES, and its usefulness was proven once I reviewed it. But I, and I wager many of you, wondered if a laptop screen that extended horizontally might be even better. Lenovo’s Legion Pro Rollable concept proves there’s something to that, as I couldn’t help smiling once I saw this gaming laptop extend from 16 inches to an ultrawide 24 inches before my eyes.

This concept was still rough around the edges, with noisy motors that occasionally stuttered, resolution that didn’t adjust to the screen’s changing size, and a massive panel gap in the lid. But if all that gets ironed away, and I expect that it will if it ever comes out, this could be my ideal gaming laptop. You get the immersion and multitasking benefits of an ultrawide monitor on demand, and you get to tuck it away and take it with you. It’s unlike anything else, and I’m really rooting for it to make it past the proof-of-concept stage. I want another moment like last year where we get to say, “and you can own this if you’d like.” I still do shudder to think what it may cost, though.

I wasn’t fond of haptic trackpads and their simulated clicks when Apple started putting them in MacBooks around 10 years ago, but at some point I came around to them and the ability to click anywhere on their surface from corner to corner. Now, Acer’s new Swift 16 AI has the largest haptic trackpad around, complete with stylus support, and it’s instantly one of Acer’s most interesting offerings at CES because of it.

We don’t know how much the Acer Swift 16 AI will cost (an unfortunate trend for some laptop companies at CES 2026), but I’m intrigued to see where this model in particular lands. That football field of a haptic trackpad, combined with a generous port selection (which the Swifts are typically known for) and an OLED display, has a lot of potential if the price is right.

I’m so relieved that Dell caved to the pressure from last year and resurrected the XPS line. I don’t want to give too much credit, as I found many faults in the last XPS model I tested. But things already look much more promising in the new XPS 14 and 16 (they even have nice new lid logos). The physical function row is back, the seamless haptic trackpad now has some nice etched lines to inform you of its boundaries, and these machines are freaking thin. The thinness makes me a little nervous, as there have been many XPS laptops in the past that struggled with heat, but we’ll have to see when the time comes for testing.

The new XPS models also have a unique feature: variable refresh rate screens that go as high as 120Hz and as low as just 1Hz. That’s the kind of tech that has helped phone screens remain buttery smooth during scrolling while saving battery life when viewing static elements like a document. And this feature will be on the base-model XPS 14 and 16 with lowly IPS displays, as well as fancier configurations with bright tandem OLEDs. I’m tempering my expectations, especially since there are no discrete GPU options like previous XPS generations, but much of this XPS resurgence looks good.

It’s another rollable Lenovo concept, yes, but a ThinkPad with a rollable screen is a big deal. This is Lenovo’s bread-and-butter business laptop line, and the concept here isn’t to reinvent the wheel but to potentially augment its offerings. That flexible OLED screen you see there, wrapping around its own lid, extends upward from a standard 13.3 inches to an extra-tall 15.9 inches.

I agree with commenters that the exposed screen on the outside could make a workhorse laptop feel much more fragile, even with something as simple as throwing it into your bag. But the exciting thing here is that Lenovo continues to tinker with how it can deliver the rollable form factor. Since the ThinkPad Rollable XD keeps the motors and flexible OLED contained in the lid, it could one day be offered as a display configuration for regular ThinkPads. Anything that means rollable form factors could become more common (and ideally, cheaper) sounds good in my book. And that seethrough lid that shows the mechanics of the extendable screen at work? Chef’s kiss!

It’s likely obvious to you that I love big displays, and at 2.65 pounds the Asus Zenbook A16 is one of the lightest 16-inchers around. It’s also got another thing that’s near and dear to my heart: a full-size SD card reader. That’s a rare find these days in thin-and-light devices, and it makes the life of a photographer like me much easier.

But there are other compelling factors to the A16 other than my personal love for card slots: It’s got an OLED with 2880 x 1800 resolution and 120Hz refresh, a solid selection of ports, and it can be configured with Qualcomm’s highest-end Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme chip. I imagine that’s going to be a pricey spec, but it could be worth it for someone in need of a big Windows laptop that doesn’t feel big — and one that should have equally large-and-in-charge battery life.

MSI really shook things up in the looks department this year for its non-gaming laptops. The new Prestige models look like something you wouldn’t be embarrassed to bring to an office, and they’re really quite sleek overall. The refined design of the new Stealth 16 creator / softcore gaming laptop also looks great (even if it could stand to be just a little stealthier). It’s got some wannabe MacBook Pro vibes, but it offers plenty of ports (including ethernet). It also comes standard with a 240Hz OLED display, Intel’s new Panther Lake chips, and Nvidia RTX 50-series GPUs. Last year I tested the absolutely over-the-top MSI Titan, and I’m eager to review something from MSI that’s more subdued than its usually garish gaming laptops.

Asus’ TUF line is the lower-cost rung of its gaming laptop offerings. They’re designed to be as cheap as you can get an Asus laptop with a discrete Nvidia GPU. But there’s a new TUF A14 coming with AMD Strix Halo — yes, integrated graphics. And it looks very intriguing.

Last year’s Asus ROG Flow Z13 proved that integrated graphics can be great. Now in 2026, we’ll see a TUF with integrated graphics in a fairly compact chassis. Ideally, it should be an affordable (well, affordable-ish) gaming laptop that’s also good at other laptop-y things like battery life. But Strix Halo is not known for being an affordable chip. Maybe the new versions AMD is making will help, but we’ll have to hope Asus is able to land on a price that makes sense for this little guy.

The Eliteboard G1a “keyputer” is essentially a headless laptop put into an unassuming HP keyboard. I was so ready to write it off as just a fun oddity for boring suits and IT folks — even if it does sort of harken back to the olden days of the Commodore 64. But I’ll level with you guys: I have no idea why our silly little video on this thing absolutely blew up on social media. (Is it my shirt? Tell me it’s my shirt.)

Should I review the Eliteboard once it’s available? Something tells me I’ve already answered my question as I type this.

The company is making a few changes to search filters, including adding a new ‘Popularity’ one.

As part of a few changes to its search filters, YouTube is going to allow you to search specifically for Shorts or longform videos. Right now, a filter-less search shows a mix of longform and short form videos, which can be annoying if you just want to see videos in one format or the other. But in the new search filters, among other options, you can pick to see “Videos,” which in my testing has only showed a list of longform videos, or “Shorts,” which just shows Shorts.

YouTube is also removing the “Upload Date - Last Hour” and “Sort by Rating” filters because they “were not working as expected and had contributed to user complaints.” The company will still offer other “Upload Date” filters, like “Today,” “This week,” “This Month,” and “This Year,” and you can also find popular videos with the new “Popularity” filter, which is replacing the “View count” sort option. (With the new “Popularity” filter, YouTube says that “our systems assess a video’s view count and other relevance signals, such as watch time, to determine its popularity for that specific query.”)

YouTube has also renamed the “Sort By” menu in search filters to “Prioritize,” saying that “this refined sorting menu aims to maximize utility.”

Musk said that Tesla’s Full Self-Driving would finally be ready for unsupervised operation by the end of year. Guess what happened?

Last year, Tesla defied its critics by boldly launching a robotaxi service that, by the end of the year, required no human supervision and was available to over 50 percent of the US population.

At least that’s what Tesla CEO Elon Musk told us would happen by the end of 2025. The reality, of course, was much different.

Tesla’s “robotaxi” service, as it stands today in Austin and San Francisco, is still not available to anyone who wants to use it. It is still supervised by an employee who sits in either the driver or front passenger seat with access to a “kill switch” if anything goes wrong. (There have been some unsupervised tests, but its unclear how many.) And last I checked, those two cities don’t comprise 50 percent of the population of the US.

In other words, Musk’s predictions about self-driving cars have yet again failed to come true. And just today, the billionaire purveyor of nonconsensual deepfake porn has moved the goalposts yet again. In his new comment, as first noted by Electrek, Musk stated that Tesla needs to accumulate roughly 10 billion miles of data before it can achieve “safe unsupervised self-driving.”

For months now, Musk has been promising an “unsupervised” version of Tesla’s Full Self-Driving software that he claims will enable drivers to, among other things, use their phones while driving. The current version of FSD is a Level 2 “supervised” system, meaning drivers are required to stay focused on the road and be ready to take control of the vehicle when prompted. (In other words, not full self-driving.) And for years, Musk has been hyping a moment when Tesla’s vehicles will actually drive themselves — no supervision required.

But here we are, in the year 2026, and Tesla’s FSD is still very much a supervised system. Now Musk is saying it needs 10 billion miles in order to achieve this milestone. Right now, it has a little more than 7 billion miles, according to Tesla’s FSD dashboard. All of which begs the question why was Musk promising unsupervised FSD by the end 2025, when he knew Tesla had yet to achieve this new metric?

The answer is the goalpost is always shifting. In Tesla’s Master Plan Part Deux, released in 2016, Musk wrote that the company would likely need 6 billion miles “before true self-driving is approved by regulators.” Of course, there are no regulations standing in Musk’s way from launching a fully driverless, unsupervised system. Waymo seems to have all its permits in place.

My guess is that Tesla’s legal team is calling the shots here. As long as the driver remains responsible for what happens in the vehicle, Tesla can get away with the occasional wrongful death lawsuit. Unlike Waymo, Tesla doesn’t take responsibility for any incidents because it knows its vehicles aren’t fully autonomous. Why would it take responsibility for a Level 2 system? When Tesla owners have tried to force the company to accept liability for certain incidents, it has fought back in court — and often won.

But as soon as the system becomes unsupervised, the liability floodgates could open wide.

The new year has brought a wave of deals on wireless earbuds and headphones, from the fitness-focused Beats Powerbeats Fit to the open-ear Shokz OpenRun Pro. Now, Nothing has joined in with a sale of its own, offering the Nothing Headphone (1), CMF Headphone Pro, and Nothing Ear (3) earbuds at their lowest prices to date. The most notable deal, though, is on the Nothing Ear (a), which are currently available from Amazon and Nothing for $59 ($40 off) for the first time since Black Friday, matching their lowest price to date.

Nothing’s inexpensive wireless earbuds are among the more eye-catching you can buy, thanks to a bright yellow option and a super small, translucent charging case (they also come in black and white). That said, their appeal goes beyond looks, with a feature set that impressed us enough to make them our go-to pick for shoppers on a tight budget. They nail the basics, and their sound quality exceeds expectations for the price, delivering expressive, enjoyable audio that’s adjustable via Nothing’s companion app. You also get active noise cancellation to cut down on unwanted distractions, along with three sizes of silicone ear tips for a more comfortable, secure fit.

Battery life is good for the price, too, allowing you to eke out over eight hours of continuous playback on a single charge with ANC turned off (or 5.5 hours with it enabled), while an IP54 dust and water resistance rating means they can handle sweat and light rain. You also get support for multipoint Bluetooth pairing, allowing you to stay connected to two devices at once, and a low-latency gaming mode, which is unusual for a pair of earbuds under $100, let alone under $60. They even offer ChatGPT integration for Nothing phone owners thanks to a post-launch update, letting you query the LLM with a quick pinch.

Things are looking bright for those who want to nab a great TV in 2026 at a substantial discount. Even though the year’s biggest, brightest, and priciest TVs were announced at CES 2026, there’s usually a great deal happening on a mid- or high-end TV from LG, Sony, Hisense, or Samsung. With the Super Bowl coming up, you’re right to start hunting for deals now on TVs, as well as for speaker systems.

Right now, there are a number of discounted 4K TVs to choose from, spanning a wide variety of prices, sizes, and feature sets. Whether you want a secondary screen for the bedroom or a high-end OLED that’s built to provide the ultimate gaming or cinematic experience, we’ve picked out the best TV deals.

Samsung’s Q8F is available for around $697.99 ($52 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo in its 55-inch configuration, which is a decent value for a QLED 4K TV. Its quantum dot LED panel boasts great contrast (especially in HDR content). The Q8F has a 120Hz panel and four HDMI 2.0 ports. This means you can play in 4K at up to 60Hz with a Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox Series S/X, or a PlayStation 5 Pro, or at a faster 120Hz refresh rate bumped down to 1440p resolution. Samsung is also including two free months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate with purchase, which will allow you to stream games directly to your TV through the cloud, eliminating the need for a console.

The TV is powered by Samsung’s Q4 AI processor, which is used to upscale HD video to 4K when necessary, to optimize the picture in real-time, and make navigating its interface feel snappy. Samsung also touts the Q8F’s audio system, which adjusts the EQ and boost dialogue volume when needed. If you’ve cut the cord with cable, you can watch over 2,700 free channels of TV (over 400 of which are exclusive to Samsung TVs) in addition to streaming services. You can save $302 by jumping up to the 85-inch model, which is on sale for around $1,697.99 or so at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo.

If you’re looking for a 65-inch TV for watching sports, TV shows, movies, or playing video games, Hisense’s U65QF is a great choice, one you can currently purchase at Amazon and Best Buy for $699.99 ($147 off). The TV features a native 144Hz refresh rate and two HDMI 2.1 ports, both of which can take full advantage of the high-speed display. It also sports a pair of HDMI 2.0 ports — which can carry a 4K signal at up to 60Hz — and a port assortment that makes it a good choice for current-gen consoles, 4K Blu-ray players, and streaming devices. If you connect a gaming PC with an AMD graphics card, you can even take advantage of the TV’s support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, which reduces graphical glitches such as screen tearing.

The U65QF has an LED screen, which means it can’t match the black levels or per-pixel brightness control you’d get with an OLED display. However, its full array lighting panel offers 300 local dimming zones. The TV can control the brightness of each zone to reduce blooming, which is what happens when the area around a bright object (think a lit torch in a cave) looks unnaturally bright. Additionally, the TV has a maximum brightness of 1,000 nits, so the image it produces should look good even in a room with some light interference. The U65QF also supports Dolby Vision, HLG, and HDR10 Plus for better color reproduction, and it features a Hi-View AI chip that automatically processes the image on screen so that it appears sharper.

As for its operating system, Hisense’s U65QF runs on Amazon’s Fire OS and features Amazon Alexa built in. You can use the smart assistant to control the TV’s many functions, search for content, control compatible smart home accessories, and look up answers to various questions with your voice. If you want an even larger screen, you can also pick up a 75-inch model for around $895.99 (originally $1,299) at Amazon and Best Buy.

TCL’s Nxtvision is an entry-level “art TV,” and both the 65- and 75-inch models are currently on sale at Best Buy for $999.99 ($300 off) and $1,699.99 ($100 off), respectively. The 4K TV set has a matte 120Hz QLED screen with a brightness of around 441 nits, and it can display more than 100,000 pre-generated AI artworks, your own photos, or one of over 300 pieces of art from its built-in library. It features two HDMI 2.1 ports best suited for current-gen game consoles and PC gaming, along with HDMI 2.0 ports, which are fine if you want to hook up a 4K Blu-ray player or previous-gen game system.

Verge senior reviewer John Higgins tested the A300W and liked the way the TV looked once its included bezel set was installed, which made the TV look more like an actual painting. He also liked that it uses Google’s TV platform, an operating system he found easy to navigate and use. However, it was noticeably dimmer than the other art TVs he tested, and the artwork quality could vary from piece to piece. Still, the A300W is a great choice if you’ve been curious about getting an art TV but don’t want to immediately make the jump to a higher-end model like Samsung’s Frame Pro.

If your budget is under $500, the 55-inch Hisense QD7 has a lot to offer, especially now that it’s on sale for $399.99 ($100 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. It features a QLED panel that can deliver more contrast and brightness than a typical LED TV, with support for HDR10 Plus and Dolby Vision, with a peak brightness of 600 nits. The 4K set features a processor capable of AI upscaling and full array local dimming with 160 local dimming zones. A panel with full array local dimming offers better control of brightness and contrast than direct- or edge-lit LED panels (this video from LG shows how it works), providing a more consistent picture across the entire screen. The QD7’s obvious weak point is gaming, due to its 60Hz refresh rate, but if that’s not important to you, it remains a superb value. If you want a larger TV, you can get a 65-inch model for around $448 ($152 off) at Amazon and Best Buy.

If you want a TV that produces reference-quality images, Sony’s Bravia 8 II (K65XR80M2) is the best choice. It was selected as the top TV in Valve Electronics’ 10th annual TV Shootout based on objective and subjective tests conducted by a panel of experts comparing each set to the image on a $43,000 reference monitor (Disclosure: Verge editor-in-chief Nilay Patel was one of the judges). The 65-inch model is currently available with a $500 price cut, dropping it to around $2,998 at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo.

Sony’s premium set has a 120Hz refresh rate panel, with two HDMI 2.1 ports that support 4K at 120Hz and two HDMI 2.0 ports that top out at 4K / 60Hz. It doesn’t support Nvidia’s G-Sync or AMD’s FreeSync Pro, so there aren’t any specific features on this TV that PC gamers can take advantage of. The TV runs on Sony’s XR processor, which uses AI to adjust the color, contrast, and clarity of whatever you’re watching in real time to look better. Sony also says its TV has modes that are specifically calibrated for Netflix, Prime Video, and its own Sony Pictures Core streaming services.

The last-gen LG C4 remains one of the best OLED TVs you can buy, and the 65-inch model is currently on sale for $1,299.95 ($1,200 off) at B&H Photo. Like LG’s newer C5 OLED, it has a 120Hz panel with support for VRR, Nvidia G-Sync, and AMD FreeSync Premium (the option exists to enable a 144Hz mode if you dig in the TV’s options). Its embedded A9 AI Processor Gen7 offers higher-quality video upscaling and image optimization compared to the C3. The biggest difference between the C4 and C5 is their maximum brightness. The C4 tops out at an advertised 1,000 nits, while the C5 tops out at around 1,165 according to tests conducted by Tom’s Guide.

Additionally, the C4 features a three-channel audio system, which might sound impressive compared to other TVs, but still can’t compete with a soundbar. When you’re not watching videos or playing games, you can also enable the C4’s Gallery Mode to display art. Basically, the LG C4 offers many of the same features as the C5, but retails for nearly $400 less. You can also save on the 77-inch model, which is on sale for $1,799.95 ($1,700 off) at B&H Photo.

If you want an OLED, but don’t have a lot of space, Samsung’s 42-inch S90F is down to a new low of around $1.097.99 ($100 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo. The TV features a 120Hz panel and four HDMI 2.1 ports, letting you play games in 4K at up to 120 frames per second. The ability to connect all your current-gen consoles and a gaming PC simultaneously without sacrificing resolution or speed is impressive for an OLED TV under $1,000. The TV can also access Samsung’s Gaming Hub, which allows you to play games available through Nvidia GeForce Go, Amazon Luna, and other cloud gaming services on your TV without any additional hardware — besides a controller, of course.

The S90F supports Samsung’s OLED HDR, and it has an NQ4 AI Gen3 processor that optimizes its picture quality and can upscale non-4K video. The TV also runs on Samsung’s Tizen operating system, which offers apps for every major streaming service, and features support for both Alexa and Samsung Bixby, so you can use either virtual assistant to control your various smart home gadgets. If you like the S90F’s features but want a larger TV, the 65-inch model is also on sale for an all-time low of around $1,597.99 ($102 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo.

If you want a premium TV but don’t want an OLED set, Hisense’s U8QG is an excellent alternative that’s currently available at Amazon and Best Buy in its 65-inch configuration for $1,299.99 (about $200 off its regular 2025 price, but higher than it has recently sold for). The TV has a mini-LED panel with full-array local dimming, so blooming shouldn’t be a huge issue. It also features a 165Hz refresh rate and three HDMI 2.1 ports, making it a great choice for those with a gaming PC or a current-gen console like the PlayStation 5. It also supports AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, so gaming PCs outfitted with an AMD card should experience fewer graphical glitches, including screen tearing.

Hisense says the U8QG has a maximum screen brightness of 5,000 nits, which is substantially higher than the OLED TVs we’re recommending here. It also supports all your major HDR formats, including Dolby Vision IQ, HDR10 Plus, HLG, and Advanced HDR by Technicolor, so it’ll show vibrant colors regardless of how the video you’re watching — or game you’re playing — was mastered. Its AI processor was also designed to improve the clarity and brightness of SDR content, and the TV’s high refresh rate and peak brightness make up for the fact that its panel offers lower contrast than an OLED TV.

According to The Verge’s own John Higgins, Samsung’s Frame Pro is the best “art TV” you can buy for watching TV shows, and the 65-inch model is a couple hundred dollars off, selling for around $1,897.99 at Amazon and Best Buy. Both Amazon and Best Buy have also knocked the price of the larger 75-inch model to around $2,497.99 ($1000 off its original price).

Samsung’s art-inspired 4K TV features a 120Hz LED panel with a peak brightness of over 1,000 nits and better color accuracy (especially in filmmaker mode) than its competitors. Its matte screen reflects less light than a typical LCD or OLED screen, which is helpful whether you’re watching TV shows in a bright room or using the TV’s “Art Mode,” which allows you to display famous paintings. The TV comes with a small selection of free art, but you can gain access to more than 4,000 pieces by subscribing to the Samsung Art Store for $50 a year.

The Frame Pro also comes with the wireless Connect Box, which features four HDMI ports, two USB-A ports, a coaxial input, an ethernet port, and an optical audio input. You plug devices into the wireless Connect Box, which then sends audio and video from your source to the TV. Samsung recommends keeping it within 10 meters of the TV, but the wireless latency (lag) from the setup shouldn’t matter much when watching videos; however, it may be noticeable if you’re playing fast-paced video games, including first-person shooters.

            <div id="article-text">AI is everywhere, but it really shouldn’t be.

AI is everywhere, but it really shouldn’t be.

You can’t shake a stick without hitting an AI gadget at CES this year, with artificial smarts now embedded in just about every wearable, screen, and appliance across the show floor, not to mention the armies of AI companions, toys, and robots.

But those are just the beginning. We’ve seen AI pop up in much stranger places too, from hair clippers to stick vacs, and at least one case where even the manufacturer itself seemed unsure what made its products “AI.”

Here are the gadgets we’ve seen at CES 2026 so far that really take the “intelligence” out of “artificial intelligence.”

This is a product that would be silly enough without the AI add-on. These smart hair clippers help amateur hairdressers deliver the perfect fade by dynamically altering the closeness of the cut, helped along by an ominous face mask that looks like it belongs in an optician’s office.

But it’s taken to the next level by the real-time AI coach, which gives you feedback as you cut. Glyde told me it’s working on voice controls for the AI too, and that eventually it will be able to recommend specific hairstyles, so long as you’re willing to trust its style advice. Are you?

That was the message emblazoned across the SleepQ booth, where company reps were handing out boxes of pills — a multivitamin with ashwagandha extract according to the box, supposedly good for sleep, though I wasn’t brave enough to test that claim on my jetlag.

Manufacturer Welt, originally spun out of a Samsung incubator, calls its product “AI-upgraded pharmacotherapy.” It’s really just using biometric data from your smartwatch or sleep tracker to tell you the optimal time to take a sleeping pill each day, with plans to eventually cover anxiety meds, weight-management drugs, pain relief, and more.

There may well be an argument that fine-tuning the time people pop their pills could make them more effective, but I feel safe in saying we don’t need to start throwing around the term “AI-enhanced drugs.”

Startup Deglace claims that its almost unnecessarily sleek-looking Fraction vacuum cleaner uses AI in two different ways: first to “optimize suction,” and then to manage repairs and replacements for the modular design.

It says its Neural Predictive AI monitors vacuum performance “to detect issues before they happen,” giving you health scores for each of the vacuum’s components, which can be conveniently replaced with a quick parts order from within the accompanying app. A cynic might worry this is all in the name of selling users expensive and proprietary replacement parts, but I can at least get behind the promise of modular upgrades — assuming Deglace is able to deliver on that promise.

Most digital picture frames let you display photos of loved ones, old holiday snaps, or your favorite pieces of art. Fraimic lets you display AI slop.

It’s an E Ink picture frame with a microphone and voice controls, so you can describe whatever picture you’d like, which the frame will then generate using OpenAI’s GPT Image 1.5 model. The frame itself starts at $399, which gets you 100 image generations each year, with the option to buy more if you run out.

What makes the AI in Fraimic so dubious is that it might be a pretty great product without it. The E Ink panel looks great, you can use it to show off your own pictures and photos too, and it uses so little power that it can run for years without being plugged in. We’d just love it a lot more without the added slop.

Infinix, a smaller phone manufacturer that’s had success across Asia for its affordable phones, didn’t launch any actual new products at CES this year, but it did bring five concepts that could fit into future phones. Some are clever, like various color-changing rear finishes and a couple of liquid-cooling designs. And then there’s the AI ModuVerse.

Modular phone concepts are nothing new, so the AI hook is what makes ModuVerse unique — in theory. One of the “Modus” makes sense: a meeting attachment that connects magnetically, generating AI transcripts and live translation onto a mini display on the back.

But when I asked what made everything else AI, Infinix didn’t really have any good answers. The gimbal camera has AI stabilization, the vlogging lens uses AI to detect faces, and the microphone has AI voice isolation — all technically AI-based, but not in any way that’s interesting. As for the magnetic, stackable power banks, Infinix’s reps eventually admitted they don’t really have any AI at all. Color me shocked.

There’s a growing trend for AI and robotic cooking hardware — The Verge’s Jen Tuohy reviewed a $1,500 robot chef just last month — but Wan AIChef is something altogether less impressive: an AI-enabled microwave.

It runs on what looks suspiciously like Android, with recipe suggestions, cooking instructions, and a camera inside so you can see the progress of what you’re making. But… it’s just a microwave. So it can’t actually do any cooking for you, other than warm up your food to just the right temperature (well, just right plus or minus 3 degrees Celsius, to be accurate).

It’ll do meal plans and food tracking and calorie counting too, which all sounds great so long as you’re willing to commit to eating all of your meals out of the AI microwave. Please, I beg you, do not eat all of your meals out of the AI microwave.

The tech industry absolutely loves reinventing the vending machine and branding it either robotics or AI, and AI Barmen is no different.

This setup — apparently already in use for private parties and corporate events — is really just an automatic cocktail machine with a few AI smarts slapped on top.

The AI uses the connected webcam to estimate your age — it was off by eight years in my case — and confirm you’re sober enough to get another drink. It can also create custom drinks, with mixed success: When asked for something to “fuck me up,” it came up with the Funky Tequila Fizz, aka tequila, triple sec, and soda. What, no absinthe?

Should you buy your kid an AI toy that gives it a complete LLM-powered chatbot to speak to? Probably not. But what if that AI chatbot looked like chibi Elon Musk?

He’s just one of the many avatars offered by the Luka AI Cube, including Hayao Miyazaki, Steve from Minecraft, and Harry Potter. Kids can chat to them about their day, ask for advice, or even share the AI Cube’s camera feed to show the AI avatars where they are and what they’re up to. Luka says it’s a tool for fun, but also learning, with various educational activities and language options.

The elephant in the room is whether you should trust any company’s guardrails enough to give a young kid access to an LLM. Leading with an AI take on Elon Musk — whose own AI, Grok, is busy undressing children as we speak — doesn’t exactly inspire confidence.

            <h2>America’s new dietary guidelines ignore decades of scientific research</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/08/1130905/americas-diet-guidelines-ignore-scientific-research-red-meat-beef-tallow/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The new year has barely begun, but the first days of 2026 have brought big news for health. On Monday, the US’s federal health agency upended its recommendations for routine childhood vaccinations—a move that health associations worry puts children at unnecessary risk of preventable disease.

There was more news from the federal government on Wednesday, when health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his colleagues at the Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture unveiled new dietary guidelines for Americans. And they are causing a bit of a stir.

That’s partly because they recommend products like red meat, butter, and beef tallow—foods that have been linked to cardiovascular disease, and that nutrition experts have been recommending people limit in their diets.

These guidelines are a big deal—they influence food assistance programs and school lunches, for example. So this week let’s look at the good, the bad, and the ugly advice being dished up to Americans by their government.

The government dietary guidelines have been around since the 1980s. They are updated every five years, in a process that typically involves a team of nutrition scientists who have combed over scientific research for years. That team will first publish its findings in a scientific report, and, around a year later, the finalized Dietary Guidelines for Americans are published.

The last guidelines covered the period 2020 to 2025, and new guidelines were expected in the summer of 2025. Work had already been underway for years; the scientific report intended to inform them was published back in 2024. But the publication of the guidelines was delayed by last year’s government shutdown, Kennedy said last year. They were finally published yesterday.

Nutrition experts had been waiting with bated breath. Nutrition science has evolved slightly over the last five years, and some were expecting to see new recommendations. Research now suggests, for example, that there is no “safe” level of alcohol consumption.

We are also beginning to learn more about health risks associated with some ultraprocessed foods (although we still don’t have a good understanding of what they might be, or what even counts as “ultraprocessed”.) And some scientists were expecting to see the new guidelines factor in environmental sustainability, says Gabby Headrick, the associate director of food and nutrition policy at George Washington University’s Institute for Food Safety & Nutrition Security in Washington DC.

Many of the recommendations are sensible. The guidelines recommend a diet rich in whole foods, particularly fresh fruits and vegetables. They recommend avoiding highly processed foods and added sugars. They also highlight the importance of dietary protein, whole grains, and “healthy” fats.

But not all of them are, says Headrick. The guidelines open with a “new pyramid” of foods. This inverted triangle is topped with “protein, dairy, and healthy fats” on one side and “vegetables and fruits” on the other.

There are a few problems with this image. For starters, its shape—nutrition scientists have long moved on from the food pyramids of the 1990s, says Headrick. They’re confusing and make it difficult for people to understand what the contents of their plate should look like. That’s why scientists now use an image of a plate to depict a healthy diet.

“We&#39;ve been using MyPlate to describe the dietary guidelines in a very consumer-friendly, nutrition-education-friendly way for over the last decade now,” says Headrick. (The UK’s National Health Service takes a similar approach.)

And then there’s the content of that food pyramid. It puts a significant focus on meat and whole-fat dairy produce. The top left image—the one most viewers will probably see first—is of a steak. Smack in the middle of the pyramid is a stick of butter. That’s new. And it’s not a good thing.

While both red meat and whole-fat dairy can certainly form part of a healthy diet, nutrition scientists have long been recommending that most people try to limit their consumption of these foods. Both can be high in saturated fat, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease—the leading cause of death in the US. In 2015, on the basis of limited evidence, the World Health Organization classified red meat as “probably carcinogenic to humans.”

Also concerning is the document’s definition of “healthy fats,” which includes butter and beef tallow (a MAHA favorite). Neither food is generally considered to be as healthy as olive oil, for example. While olive oil contains around two grams of saturated fat per tablespoon, a tablespoon of beef tallow has around six grams of saturated fat, and the same amount of butter contains around seven grams of saturated fat, says Headrick.

“I think these are pretty harmful dietary recommendations to be making when we have established that those specific foods likely do not have health-promoting benefits,” she adds.

Red meat is not exactly a sustainable food, and neither are dairy products. And the advice on alcohol is relatively vague, recommending that people “consume less alcohol for better overall health” (which might leave you wondering: Less than what?).

There are other questionable recommendations in the guidelines. Americans are advised to include more protein in their diets—at levels between 1.2 and 1.6 grams daily per kilo of body weight, 50% to 100% more than recommended in previous guidelines. There’s a risk that increasing protein consumption to such levels could raise a person’s intake of both calories and saturated fats to unhealthy levels, says José Ordovás, a senior nutrition scientist at Tufts University. “I would err on the low side,” he says.

Some nutrition scientists are questioning why these changes have been made. It’s not as though the new recommendations were in the 2024 scientific report. And the evidence on red meat and saturated fat hasn’t changed, says Headrick.

In reporting this piece, I contacted many contributors to the previous guidelines, and some who had led research for 2024’s scientific report. None of them agreed to comment on the new guidelines on the record. Some seemed disgruntled. One merely told me that the process by which the new guidelines had been created was “opaque.”

“These people invested a lot of their time, and they did a thorough job [over] a couple of years, identifying [relevant scientific studies],” says Ordovás. “I’m not surprised that when they see that [their] work was ignored and replaced with something [put together] quickly, that they feel a little bit disappointed,” he says.

Researchers are getting organoids pregnant with human embryos

At first glance, it looks like the start of a human pregnancy: A ball-shaped embryo presses into the lining of the uterus then grips tight, burrowing in as the first tendrils of a future placenta appear. This is implantation—the moment that pregnancy officially begins.

Only none of it is happening inside a body. These images were captured in a Beijing laboratory, inside a microfluidic chip, as scientists watched the scene unfold.

In three recent papers published by Cell Press, scientists report what they call the most accurate efforts yet to mimic the first moments of pregnancy in the lab. They’ve taken human embryos from IVF centers and let these merge with “organoids” made of endometrial cells, which form the lining of the uterus. Read our story about their work, and what might come next.

LLMs contain a LOT of parameters. But what’s a parameter?

A large language model’s parameters are often said to be the dials and levers that control how it behaves. Think of a planet-size pinball machine that sends its balls pinging from one end to the other via billions of paddles and bumpers set just so. Tweak those settings and the balls will behave in a different way.

OpenAI’s GPT-3, released in 2020, had 175 billion parameters. Google DeepMind’s latest LLM, Gemini 3, may have at least a trillion—some think it’s probably more like 7 trillion—but the company isn’t saying. (With competition now fierce, AI firms no longer share information about how their models are built.)

But the basics of what parameters are and how they make LLMs do the remarkable things that they do are the same across different models. Ever wondered what makes an LLM really tick—what’s behind the colorful pinball-machine metaphors? Let’s dive in.

What new legal challenges mean for the future of US offshore wind

For offshore wind power in the US, the new year is bringing new legal battles.

On December 22, the Trump administration announced it would pause the leases of five wind farms currently under construction off the US East Coast. Developers were ordered to stop work immediately.

The cited reason? Concerns that turbines can cause radar interference. But that’s a known issue, and developers have worked with the government to deal with it for years.

Companies have been quick to file lawsuits, and the court battles could begin as soon as this week. Here’s what the latest kerfuffle might mean for the US’s struggling offshore wind industry.

            <h2>Using unstructured data to fuel enterprise AI success</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/08/1129506/using-unstructured-data-to-fuel-enterprise-ai-success/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Enterprises are sitting on vast quantities of unstructured data, from call records and video footage to customer complaint histories and supply chain signals. Yet this invaluable business intelligence, estimated to make up as much as 90% of the data generated by organizations, historically remained dormant because its unstructured nature makes analysis extremely difficult.

But if managed and centralized effectively, this messy and often voluminous data is not only a precious asset for training and optimizing next-generation AI systems, enhancing their accuracy, context, and adaptability, it can also deliver profound insights that drive real business outcomes.

A compelling example of this can be seen in the US NBA basketball team the Charlotte Hornets who successfully leveraged untapped video footage of gameplay—previously too copious to watch and too unstructured to analyze—to identify a new competition-winning recruit. However, before that data could deliver results, analysts working for the team first had to overcome the critical challenge of preparing the raw, unstructured footage for interpretation.

Unstructured data presents inherent difficulties due to its widely varying format, quality, and reliability, requiring specialized tools like natural language processing and AI to make sense of it.

Every organization’s pool of unstructured data also contains domain-specific characteristics and terminology that generic AI models may not automatically understand. A financial services firm, for example, cannot simply use a general language model for fraud detection. Instead, it needs to adapt the model to understand regulatory language, transaction patterns, industry-specific risk indicators, and unique company context like data policies.

The challenge intensifies when integrating multiple data sources with varying structures and quality standards, as teams may struggle to distinguish valuable data from noise.

When the Charlotte Hornets set out to identify a new draft pick for their team, they turned to AI tools including computer vision to analyze raw game footage from smaller leagues, which exist outside the tiers of the game normally visible to NBA scouts and, therefore, are not as readily available for analysis.

“Computer vision is a tool that has existed for some time, but I think the applicability in this age of AI is increasing rapidly,” says Jordan Cealey, senior vice president at AI company Invisible Technologies, which worked with the Charlotte Hornets on this project. “You can now take data sources that you&#39;ve never been able to consume, and provide an analytical layer that&#39;s never existed before.”

By deploying a variety of computer vision techniques, including object and player tracking, movement pattern analysis, and geometrically mapping points on the court, the team was able to extract kinematic data, such as the coordinates of players during movement, and generate metrics like speed and explosiveness to acceleration.

This provided the team with rich, data-driven insights about individual players, helping them to identify and select a new draft whose skill and techniques filled a hole in the Charlotte Hornets’ own capabilities. The chosen athlete went on to be named the most valuable player at the 2025 NBA Summer League and helped the team win their first summer championship title.

Before data from game footage can be used, it needs to be labeled so the model can interpret it. The x and y coordinates of the individual players, seen here in bounding boxes, as well as other features in the scene, are annotated so the model can identify individuals and track their movements through time.

From this successful example, several lessons can be learned. First, unstructured data must be prepared for AI models through intuitive forms of collection, and the right data pipelines and management records. “You can only utilize unstructured data once your structured data is consumable and ready for AI,” says Cealey. “You cannot just throw AI at a problem without doing the prep work.”

For many organizations, this might mean they need to find partners that offer the technical support to fine-tune models to the context of the business. The traditional technology consulting approach, in which an external vendor leads a digital transformation plan over a lengthy timeframe, is not fit for purpose here as AI is moving too fast and solutions need to be configured to a company’s current business reality.

Forward-deployed engineers (FDEs) are an emerging partnership model better suited to the AI era. Initially popularized by Palantir, the FDE model connects product and engineering capabilities directly to the customer’s operational environment. FDEs work closely with customers on-site to understand the context behind a technology initiative before a solution is built.

“We couldn&#39;t do what we do without our FDEs,” says Cealey. “They go out and fine-tune the models, working with our human annotation team to generate a ground truth dataset that can be used to validate or improve the performance of the model in production.”

Second, data needs to be understood within its own context, which requires models to be carefully calibrated to the use case. “You can&#39;t assume that an out-of-the-box computer vision model is going to give you better inventory management, for example, by taking that open source model and applying it to whatever your unstructured data feeds are,” says Cealey. “You need to fine-tune it so it gives you the data exports in the format you want and helps your aims. That&#39;s where you start to see high-performative models that can then actually generate useful data insights.”

For the Hornets, Invisible used five foundation models, which the team fine-tuned to context-specific data. This included teaching the models to understand that they were “looking at” a basketball court as opposed to, say, a football field; to understand how a game of basketball works differently from any other sport the model might have knowledge of (including how many players are on each team); and to understand how to spot rules like “out of bounds.” Once fine-tuned, the models were able to capture subtle and complex visual scenarios, including highly accurate object detection, tracking, postures, and spatial mapping.

Lastly, while the AI technology mix available to companies changes by the day, they cannot eschew old-fashioned commercial metrics: clear goals. Without clarity on the business purpose, AI pilot programs can easily turn into open-ended, meandering research projects that prove expensive in terms of compute, data costs, and staffing.

“The best engagements we have seen are when people know what they want,” Cealey observes. “The worst is when people say ‘we want AI’ but have no direction. In these situations, they are on an endless pursuit without a map.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For offshore wind power in the US, the new year is bringing new legal battles.

On December 22, the Trump administration announced it would pause the leases of five wind farms currently under construction off the US East Coast. Developers were ordered to stop work immediately.

The cited reason? National security, specifically concerns that turbines can cause radar interference. But that’s a known issue, and developers have worked with the government to deal with it for years.

Companies have been quick to file lawsuits, and the court battles could begin as soon as this week. Here’s what the latest kerfuffle might mean for the struggling offshore wind industry in the US.

This pause affects $25 billion in investment in five wind farms: Vineyard Wind 1 off Massachusetts, Revolution Wind off Rhode Island, Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind off New York, and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind off Virginia. Together, those projects had been expected to create 10,000 jobs and power more than 2.5 million homes and businesses.

In a statement announcing the move, the Department of the Interior said that “recently completed classified reports” revealed national security risks, and that the pause would give the government time to work through concerns with developers. The statement specifically says that turbines can create radar interference (more on the technical details here in a moment).

Three of the companies involved have already filed lawsuits, and they’re seeking preliminary injunctions that would allow construction to continue. Orsted and Equinor (the developers for Revolution Wind and Empire Wind, respectively) told the New York Times that their projects went through lengthy federal reviews, which did address concerns about national security.

This is just the latest salvo from the Trump administration against offshore wind. On Trump’s first day in office, he signed an executive order stopping all new lease approvals for offshore wind farms. (That order was struck down by a judge in December.)

The administration previously ordered Revolution Wind to stop work last year, also citing national security concerns. A federal judge lifted the stop-work order weeks later, after the developer showed that the financial stakes were high, and that government agencies had previously found no national security issues with the project.

There are real challenges that wind farms introduce for radar systems, which are used in everything from air traffic control to weather forecasting to national defense operations. A wind turbine’s spinning can create complex signatures on radar, resulting in so-called clutter.

Previous government reports, including one 2024 report from the Department of Energy and a 2025 report from the Government Accountability Office (an independent government watchdog), have pointed out this issue in the past.

“To date, no mitigation technology has been able to fully restore the technical performance of impacted radars,” as the DOE report puts it. However, there are techniques that can help, including software that acts to remove the signatures of wind turbines. (Think of this as similar to how noise-canceling headphones work, but more complicated, as one expert told TechCrunch.)

But the most widespread and helpful tactic, according to the DOE report, is collaboration between developers and the government. By working together to site and design wind farms strategically, the groups can ensure that the projects don’t interfere with government or military operations. The 2025 GAO report found that government officials, researchers, and offshore wind companies were collaborating effectively, and any concerns could be raised and addressed in the permitting process.

This and other challenges threaten an industry that could be a major boon for the grid. On the East Coast where these projects are located, and in New England specifically, winter can bring tight supplies of fossil fuels and spiking prices because of high demand. It just so happens that offshore winds blow strongest in the winter, so new projects, including the five wrapped up in this fight, could be a major help during the grid’s greatest time of need.

One 2025 study found that if 3.5 gigawatts’ worth of offshore wind had been operational during the 2024-2025 winter, it would have lowered energy prices by 11%. (That’s the combined capacity of Revolution Wind and Vineyard Wind, two of the paused projects, plus two future projects in the pipeline.) Ratepayers would have saved $400 million.

Before Donald Trump was elected, the energy consultancy BloombergNEF projected that the US would build 39 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2035. Today, that expectation has dropped to just 6 gigawatts. These legal battles could push it lower still.

What’s hardest to wrap my head around is that some of the projects being challenged are nearly finished. The developers of Revolution Wind have installed all the foundations and 58 of 65 turbines, and they say the project is over 87% complete. Empire Wind is over 60% done and is slated to deliver electricity to the grid next year.

To hit the pause button so close to the finish line is chilling, not just for current projects but for future offshore wind efforts in the US. Even if these legal battles clear up and more developers can technically enter the queue, why would they want to? Billions of dollars are at stake, and if there’s one word to describe the current state of the offshore wind industry in the US, it’s “unpredictable.”

            <h2>Deploying a hybrid approach to Web3 in the AI era</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/07/1129490/deploying-a-hybrid-approach-to-web3-in-the-ai-era/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When the concept of “Web 3.0” first emerged about a decade ago the idea was clear: Create a more user-controlled internet that lets you do everything you can now, except without servers or intermediaries to manage the flow of information.

Where Web2, which emerged in the early 2000s, relies on centralized systems to store data and supply compute, all owned—and monetized by—a handful of global conglomerates, Web3 turns that structure on its head. Instead, data and compute are decentralized through technologies like blockchain and peer-to-peer networks.

What was once a futuristic concept is quickly becoming a more concrete reality, even at a time when Web2 still dominates. Six out of ten Fortune 500 companies are exploring blockchain-based solutions, most taking a hybrid approach that combines traditional Web2 business models and infrastructure with the decentralized technologies and principles of Web3.

Popular use cases include cloud services, supply chain management, and, most notably financial services. In fact, at one point, the daily volume of transactions processed on decentralized finance exchanges exceeded $10 billion.

Among the advantages of Web3 for the enterprise are greater ownership and control of sensitive data, says Erman Tjiputra, founder and CEO of the AIOZ Network, which is building infrastructure for Web3, powered by decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), blockchain-based systems that govern physical infrastructure assets.

More cost-effective compute is another benefit, as is enhanced security and privacy as the cyberattack landscape grows more hostile, he adds. And it could even help protect companies from outages caused by a single point of failure, which can lead to downtime, data loss, and revenue deficits.

But perhaps the most exciting opportunity, says Tjiputra, is the ability to build and scale AI reliably and affordably. By leveraging a people-powered internet infrastructure, companies can far more easily access—and contribute to—shared resource like bandwidth, storage, and processing power to run AI inference, train models, and store data. All while using familiar developer tooling and open, usage-based incentives.

“We’re in a compute crunch where requirements are insatiable, and Web3 creates this ability to benefit while contributing,” explains Tjiputra.

In 2025, AIOZ Network launched a distributed compute platform and marketplace where developers and enterprises can access and monetize AI assets, and run AI inference or training on AIOZ Network’s more than 300,000 contributing devices. The model allows companies to move away from opaque datasets and models and scale flexibly, without centralized lock in.

Despite the promise, it is still early days for Web3, and core systemic challenges are leaving senior leadership and developers hesitant about its applicability at scale.

One hurdle is a lack of interoperability. The current fragmentation of blockchain networks creates a segregated ecosystem that makes it challenging to transfer assets or data between platforms. This often complicates transactions and introduces new security risks due to the reliance on mechanisms such as cross-chain bridges. These are tools that allow asset transfers between platforms but which have been shown to be vulnerable to targeted attacks.

“We have countless blockchains running on different protocols and consensus models,” says Tjiputra. “These blockchains need to work with each other so applications can communicate regardless of which chain they are on. This makes interoperability fundamental.”

Regulatory uncertainty is also a challenge. Outdated legal frameworks can sit at odds with decentralized infrastructures, especially when it comes to compliance with data protection and anti-money laundering regulations.

“Enterprises care about verifiability and compliance as much as innovation, so we need frameworks where on-chain transparency strengthens accountability instead of adding friction,” Tjiputra says.

And this is compounded by user experience (UX) challenges, says Tjiputra. “The biggest setback in Web3 today is UX,” he says. “For example, in Web2, if I forget my bank username or password, I can still contact the bank, log in and access my assets. The trade-off in Web3 is that, should that key be compromised or lost, we lose access to those assets. So, key recovery is a real problem.”

Although such systemic challenges won’t be solved overnight, by leveraging DePIN networks, enterprises can bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3, without making a wholesale switch. This can minimize risk while harnessing much of the potential.

AIOZ Network’s own ecosystem includes capacity for media streaming, AI compute, and distributed storage that can be plugged into an existing Web2 tech stack. “You don’t need to go full Web3,” says Tjiputra. “You can start by plugging distributed storage into your workflow, test it, measure it, and see the benefits firsthand.”

The AIOZ Storage solution, for example, offers scalable distributed object storage by leveraging the global network of contributor devices on AIOZ DePIN. It is also compatible with existing storage systems or commonly used web application programming interfaces (APIs).

“Say we have a programmer or developer who uses Amazon S3 Storage or REST APIs, then all they need to do is just repoint the endpoints,” explains Tjiputra. “That&#39;s it. It’s the same tools, it&#39;s really simple. Even with media, with a single one-stop shop, developers can do transcoding and streaming with a simple REST API.”

Built on Cosmos, a network of hundreds of different blockchains that can communicate with each other, and a standardized framework enabled by Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), AIOZ Network has also prioritized interoperability. “Applications shouldn’t care which chain they’re on. Developers should target APIs without worrying about consensus mechanisms. That’s why we built on Cosmos and EVM—interoperability first.”

This hybrid model, which allows enterprises to use both Web2 and Web3 advantages in tandem, underpins what Tjiputra sees as the longer-term ambition for the much-hyped next iteration of the internet.

“Our vision is a truly peer-to-peer foundation for a people-powered internet, one that minimizes single points of failure through multi-region, multi-operator design,” says Tjiputra. “By distributing compute and storage across contributors, we gain both cost efficiency and end-to-end security by default.

“Ideally, we want to evolve the internet toward a more people-powered model, but we’re not there yet. We’re still at the starting point and growing.”

Indeed, Web3 isn’t quite snapping at the heels of the world’s Web2 giants, but its commercial advantages in an era of AI have become much harder to ignore. And with DePIN bridging the gap, enterprises and developers can step into that potential while keeping one foot on surer ground.

Europe’s drone-filled vision for the future of war

Last spring, 3,000 British soldiers deployed an invisible automated intelligence network, known as a “digital targeting web,” as part of a NATO exercise called Hedgehog in the damp forests of Estonia’s eastern territories.The system had been cobbled together over the course of four months—an astonishing pace for weapons development, which is usually measured in years. Its purpose is to connect everything that looks for targets—“sensors,” in military lingo—and everything that fires on them (“shooters”) to a single, shared wireless electronic brain.Eighty years after total war last transformed the continent, the Hedgehog tests signal a brutal new calculus of European defense. But leaning too much on this new mathematics of warfare could be a risky bet. Read the full story.

MIT Technology Review Narrated: How one controversial startup hopes to cool the planet

Stardust Solutions believes that it can solve climate change—for a price.The Israel-based geoengineering startup has said it expects nations will soon pay it more than a billion dollars a year to launch specially equipped aircraft into the stratosphere. Once they’ve reached the necessary altitude, those planes will disperse particles engineered to reflect away enough sunlight to cool down the planet, purportedly without causing environmental side effects.

But numerous solar geoengineering researchers are skeptical that Stardust will line up the customers it needs to carry out a global deployment in the next decade. They’re also highly critical of the idea of a private company setting the global temperature for us.

Inside the decades-long fight over Yahoo’s misdeeds in ChinaWhen you think of Big Tech these days, Yahoo is probably not top of mind. But for Chinese dissident Xu Wanping, the company still looms large—and has for nearly two decades.In 2005, Xu was arrested for signing online petitions relating to anti-Japanese protests. He didn’t use his real name, but he did use his Yahoo email address. Yahoo China violated its users’ trust—providing information on certain email accounts to Chinese law enforcement, which in turn allowed the government to identify and arrest some users.Xu was one of them; he would serve nine years in prison. Now, he and five other Chinese former political prisoners are suing Yahoo and a slate of co-defendants—not because of the company’s information-sharing (which was the focus of an earlier lawsuit filed by other plaintiffs), but rather because of what came after.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">I’ve said this many times: the products we see on the market are rarely visionary leaps. Most of the time, they are mirrors. They reflect people’s habits, shortcuts, fears, and small daily behaviours. Design follows behaviour. Always has.

Think about it. You probably know at least one person who already uses ChatGPT for health-related questions. Not occasionally. Regularly. As a second opinion. As a place to test concerns before saying them out loud. Sometimes even as a therapist, a confidant, or a space where embarrassment does not exist.

When habits become consistent, companies stop observing and start building. At that point, users are no longer just customers. They are co-architects. Their behaviour quietly shapes the product roadmap.

That context matters when looking at what OpenAI announced on January 7, 2026: the launch of ChatGPT Health, a dedicated AI-powered experience focused on healthcare. OpenAI describes it as “a dedicated experience that securely brings your health information and ChatGPT’s intelligence together.”

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Access is limited for now. The company is rolling it out through a waitlist, with gradual expansion planned over the coming weeks. Anyone with a ChatGPT account, Free or paid, can sign up for early access, except users in the European Union, the UK, and Switzerland, where regulatory alignment is still pending.

The stated goal is simple on paper: help people feel more informed, more prepared, and more confident when managing their health. But the numbers behind that decision say more than the press language ever could. According to OpenAI, over 230 million people worldwide already ask health or wellness questions on ChatGPT every week.

That figure raises uncomfortable questions.

Why do so many people turn to an AI for health questions? Is it speed? The promise of an immediate answer? The way our expectations have shifted toward instant clarity, even for complex or sensitive issues? Is it discomfort, the reluctance to speak openly with a doctor about certain topics? Or something deeper, a quiet erosion of trust in human systems, paired with a growing confidence in machines that do not judge, interrupt, or rush?

ChatGPT Health does not answer those questions. It simply formalises the behaviour.

According to OpenAI, the new Health space allows users to securely connect personal health data, including medical records, lab results, and information from fitness or wellness apps. Someone might upload recent blood test results and ask for a summary. Another might connect a step counter and ask how their activity compares to previous months.

The system can integrate data from platforms such as Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, Peloton, AllTrails, and even grocery data from Instacart. The promise is contextual responses, not generic advice. Lab results explained in plain language. Patterns highlighted over time. Suggestions for questions to ask during a medical appointment. Diet or exercise ideas grounded in what the data actually shows.

What ChatGPT Health is careful not to do matters just as much as what it can do.

OpenAI is explicit: this is not medical advice. It does not diagnose conditions. It does not prescribe treatments. It is designed to support care, not replace it. The framing is intentional. ChatGPT Health positions itself as an assistant, not an authority. A tool for understanding patterns and preparing conversations, not making decisions in isolation.

That distinction is crucial. And, frankly, it is one I hope users take seriously.

Behind the scenes, OpenAI says the system was developed with extensive medical oversight. Over the past two years, more than 260 physicians from roughly 60 countries reviewed responses and provided feedback, contributing over 600,000 individual evaluation points. The focus was not only accuracy, but tone, clarity, and when the system should clearly encourage users to seek professional care.

To support that process, OpenAI built an internal evaluation framework called HealthBench. It scores responses based on clinician-defined standards, including safety, medical correctness, and appropriateness of guidance. It is an attempt to bring structure to a domain where nuance matters and mistakes carry weight.

Privacy is another pillar OpenAI insists on emphasising. ChatGPT Health operates in a separate, isolated environment within the app. Health-related conversations, connected data sources, and uploaded files are kept entirely separate from regular chats. Health data does not flow into the general ChatGPT memory, and conversations in this space are encrypted.

OpenAI also states that health conversations are not used to train its core models. Whether that assurance will be enough for all users remains to be seen, but the architectural separation signals an awareness of how sensitive this territory is.

In the United States, the system goes a step further. Through a partnership with b.well Connected Health, ChatGPT Health can access real electronic health records from thousands of providers, with user permission. This allows it to summarise official lab reports or condense long medical histories into readable overviews. Outside the US, functionality is more limited, largely due to regulatory differences.

There are potential downstream effects for healthcare providers as well. If patients arrive at appointments already familiar with their data, already aware of trends, already prepared with focused questions, consultations could become more efficient. Less time decoding numbers. More time discussing decisions.

And inevitably, the question surfaces: should doctors be worried?

AI is not a medical professional. It does not examine patients. It does not carry legal responsibility. It cannot replace clinical judgement, experience, or accountability. ChatGPT Health does not change that. It is not a shortcut to self-diagnosis, and it should not be treated as one.

What it does change is the starting point of the conversation.

Used responsibly, ChatGPT Health can help people engage with their own health information instead of avoiding it. Misused, it could reinforce false certainty or delay necessary care. The responsibility, as always, is shared between the tool and the person using it.

Users should stay aware of privacy implications, seek professional advice when it matters, and treat AI guidance as one input among many, not a final answer.

One thing is clear, though. 2026 did not arrive quietly.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The AI industry has become adept at measuring itself. Benchmarks improve, model scores rise, and every new release arrives with a list of metrics meant to signal progress. And yet, somewhere between the lab and real life, something keeps slipping.

Which model actually feels better to use?
Which answers would a human trust?
Which system would you put in front of customers, employees, or citizens and feel comfortable standing behind it?

That gap is where LMArena has quietly built its business, and why investors just put $150 million behind it at a $1.7 billion valuation, in a Series A round. The lead investors were Felicis and UC Investments, with participation from major venture firms (Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed, The House Fund, Laude Ventures).

For years, benchmarks were the currency of AI credibility: accuracy scores, reasoning tests and standardized datasets. They worked until they didn’t. As models grew larger and more similar, benchmark improvements became marginal. Worse, models began to optimize for the tests themselves rather than real use cases. Static evaluations struggled to reflect how AI behaves in open-ended, messy human interactions.

At the same time, AI systems moved out of labs and into everyday workflows: drafting emails, writing code, powering customer support, assisting with research and advising professionals. The question shifted from “Can the model do this?” to “Should we trust it when it does?”

That’s a different kind of measurement problem.

LMArena’s answer was simple and radical: stop scoring models in isolation. On its platform, users submit a prompt and receive two anonymized responses. No branding. No model names. Just answers. Then the user picks the better one, or neither.

One vote. One comparison. Repeated millions of times.

The result isn’t a definitive “best,” but a living signal of human preference , how people respond to tone, clarity, verbosity and real-world usefulness. When the prompt isn’t clean or predictable, that signal changes. And it captures something benchmarks often miss.

LMArena isn’t about whether a model produces a factually correct answer. It’s about whether humans prefer it when it does. That distinction is subtle but meaningful in practice. Rankings on the Arena leaderboard are now referenced by developers and labs before releases and product decisions. Major models from OpenAI, Google and Anthropic are regularly evaluated there.

Without traditional marketing, LMArena became a mirror the industry watches.

The $150 million round isn’t just a vote of confidence in LMArena’s product. It signals that AI evaluation itself is becoming infrastructure. As the number of models explodes, enterprise buyers face a new question: not how to get AI, but which AI to trust. Vendor claims and classical benchmarks don’t always translate to real-world reliability. Internal testing is expensive and slow.

A neutral, third-party signal, something that sits between model builders and users  is emerging as a critical layer. That’s where LMArena lives. In September 2025, it launched AI Evaluations, a commercial service that turns its crowdsourced comparison engine into a product enterprises and labs can pay to access. LMArena says this service achieved an annualized run rate of about $30 million within months of launch.

For regulators and policymakers, this kind of human-anchored signal matters too. Oversight frameworks need evidence that reflects real usage, not idealized scenarios.

LMArena’s approach isn’t without debate. Platforms that rely on public voting and crowdsourced signals can reflect the preferences of active users, which may not align with the needs of specific professional domains. In response, competitors like Scale AI’s SEAL Showdown have emerged, aiming to offer more granular, representative model rankings across languages, regions and professional contexts.

Academic research also notes that voting-based leaderboards can be susceptible to manipulation if safeguards aren’t in place, and that such systems may favor superficially appealing responses over technically correct ones if quality control isn’t rigorous.

These debates highlight that no single evaluation method captures every dimension of model behavior, but they also underscore the demand for richer, human-grounded signals beyond traditional benchmarks.

There’s a quiet assumption in AI that trust will emerge naturally as models improve. Better reasoning, so the logic goes, will lead to better outcomes. That framing treats alignment as a technical problem with technical solutions.

LMArena challenges that idea. Trust, in real contexts, is social and contextual. It’s built through experience, not claims. It’s shaped by feedback loops that don’t collapse under scale. By letting users, not companies, decide what works, LMArena introduces friction where the industry often prefers momentum. It slows things down just enough to ask, “Is this actually better, or just newer?”

That’s an uncomfortable question in a market driven by constant release cycles. It’s also why LMArena’s rise feels inevitable.

LMArena doesn’t promise safety. It doesn’t declare models good or bad. It doesn’t replace regulation or responsibility. What it does is simpler and more powerful: it keeps score in public. As AI systems become embedded in everyday decisions, tracking performance over time becomes less optional. Someone has to notice regressions, contextual shifts and usability patterns.

In sports, referees and statisticians fill this role. In markets, auditors and rating agencies do. In AI, we’re still inventing that infrastructure.

LMArena’s funding round suggests investors believe this role won’t stay marginal for long. Because when AI is everywhere, the hardest questions aren’t what it can do. They are who we trust when it does it, and how we know we’re right.

            <div id="article-text">For years, the tech industry equated success with scale. Bigger stages, larger crowds, more logos, more panels, more noise. Five thousand people became ten thousand. Ten thousand became the goal.

Somewhere along the way, that stopped making sense.

Founders and executives didn’t announce a boycott. They simply stopped showing up.

What we see today is not a rejection of events, but a correction in how people who actually run companies choose to spend their time. The shift is subtle, but consistent. Fewer large conferences. More small, curated gatherings. More closed rooms. More dinners. More tables of twelve.

Big tech events struggle because they optimize for visibility, not usefulness. A founder does not need three days of generic content, dozens of panels with no real interaction, or networking sessions where relevance is left to chance.

At scale, everything becomes superficial by default. Conversations shorten. Access disappears. The signal is drowned by the format itself.

What founders look for instead is simple. Context. Trust. Direct access. Conversations without performance. The kind of environment where people can speak honestly, not publicly.

Even when larger conferences still make sense, there is a clear psychological ceiling. Around one thousand participants, in exceptional cases. Beyond that point, quality becomes impossible to control. The event stops being a place where decisions are made and turns into a product designed for mass consumption.

And tech, especially at the founder and executive level, no longer behaves like a mass industry. It behaves like a precision one.

This is why smaller, niche conferences outperform larger ones on every meaningful metric. Ten relevant people in a room will always create more value than a thousand irrelevant ones in a hall.

At a small table, access is natural. No one needs to chase anyone. Trust forms faster. Real conversations happen because there is no audience to impress.

The most important discussions in tech have never happened on stage. They happen before the lights turn on and after the microphones are off.

In parallel with this shift, we have been preparing a private community limited to one thousand founders and executives. It is strictly invite only. Not a platform. Not a public group. Not designed for scale. Designed for relevance. Quality is protected precisely by limitation.

One thing we can say publicly is that TNW will return with an event in 2026. Details, format, and the official launch will be announced soon, but not here. What matters is that this return will not mirror the old model. It will reflect how the industry actually operates today.

Big events are not disappearing. They are simply no longer where important decisions are made.

Across the industry, the shift is already happening. Smaller rooms. Sharper conversations. People who actually need to be there.

            <div id="article-text">Five stars used to mean something. People still read reviews before buying software. They just don’t trust them the way they used to. And no, this isn’t about fake reviews or obvious scams. Those are easy to spot. The real problem is more uncomfortable. The review economy didn’t collapse. It slowly drifted away from its original purpose.

User reviews began as authentic buyer guidance, but they’ve morphed into strategic assets for businesses. Scroll through any app store or e-commerce site: everything is “top-rated” and lavished with praise. If every product gleams with a 4.8/5 rating, those stars start to lose their meaning.

Consumers aren’t fooled, in fact, the share of people who trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations plummeted from nearly 80% in 2020 to just 42% in 2025

We read the glowing comments, but we’ve learned to read between the lines.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

It’s not hard to see why trust has eroded. Companies have figured out that great reviews drive sales, so they’ve turned the whole system into a numbers game. High ratings aren’t just social proof now, they’re a growth tactic.  In other words, more stars = more money. So of course businesses are chasing stars like their life depends on it. And in a way, it does.

Behind the scenes, many companies actively engineer their review scores. One common tactic is to time the ask just right. For instance, some businesses send out a Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey to gauge your sentiment “How likely are you to recommend us?”

If you rate them a 9 or 10 (a promoter), you’re immediately nudged to post a public review. If you give a lukewarm or low score, the feedback form quietly thanks you and never mentions writing a review at all.

Only the happiest customers get the gentle push to “Share your experience!” This practice is so widespread it even has a name: “review gating.”

It’s essentially filtering which customers get invited to leave a review based on their initial feedback. Platforms officially frown on it (Google outright forbids “selectively soliciting positive reviews”), but behind closed doors it remains a growth hacker’s favorite trick.

Then there’s the outright incentivization. Perhaps you’ve received an email offering a discount, gift card, or free month of service in exchange for writing a review. It’s framed as a thank-you for your time, of course – “Share your honest feedback and get 10% off your next purchase!” – but the intent is clear.

In an economy of fake praise, even regulators have had to step in to remind everyone that trust isn’t a commodity to be bought. Companies know how to play the game from the other side too: suppressing negativity.

Unhappy customer feedback is quietly diverted to support teams or private channels, where it can be resolved (or simply contained) out of public view. The result is a skewed reality, a glossy wall of five-star testimonials that obscure any hint of dissatisfaction. It’s a great sales tool. It’s terrible for the truth.

Why go to such lengths to manicure the ratings? Because the platforms themselves reward it. The algorithms that sort and highlight products aren’t trying to surface the most truthful review; they’re trying to maximize engagement and conversion.

High ratings and large volumes of reviews make people more likely to click “Buy Now.” That means more conversion for sellers and more commission for the marketplace. In other words, the algorithm is biased toward whatever boosts the platform’s monetization metrics.

A bunch of five-star reviews isn’t just ego bait,  it’s algorithm bait.

Think about it: products with a 4.7-star average and hundreds of reviews tend to appear at the top of search results and recommendation lists. They convert better, so the system pushes them more.

More visibility leads to more sales, which reinforces the high ranking. It’s a feedback loop powered by positive feedback (pun intended). If a vendor can game their way into that virtuous cycle, via perfectly timed prompts or purchased praise, the platform’s code will happily amplify them.

Authenticity doesn’t earn you a top slot; performance does. The incentive is clear: keep it positive, and keep it plentiful. In the review economy, volume and sentiment are king.

Worse, some marketplaces have blurred the line between genuine high-rated listings and paid placement. It’s an open secret that many platforms offer sponsored spots or pay-to-play schemes, think “featured” placements, ads masquerading as top picks, or vendor subscriptions that subtly boost visibility.

Money talks, even if it speaks over the voice of authentic customer feedback. (To be fair, a few holdouts still refuse to monetize their review rankings or sell out their star system, but they’re the exception, not the rule).

Consumers aren’t sitting idly by in this charade. We’ve become savvy at sniffing out over-polished BS. The modern buyer knows how the game is played, and many are adapting their behavior to cope with the broken review system.

First, there’s a migration of trust to private networks and off-platform channels. Instead of relying on the star-average on a marketplace, people turn to friends, colleagues, and niche communities for real advice.

Think about the last time you were unsure about a purchase, maybe you shot a quick message to a group chat, or asked in a private Slack channel, “Hey, has anyone used this product? Is it actually any good?” Personal recommendations feel reliable again, precisely because they’re not part of the public review circus.

Second, savvy consumers cross-check everything. Rather than trusting one site’s reviews, they compare across multiple sources, the product might be 4.8 on the official store, but what’s it rated elsewhere?

Is there a discrepancy between the slick website testimonials and the chatter on Reddit? More often than not, shoppers now triangulate information. In fact, three out of four people use two or more sites when reading reviews, rather than putting all their faith in one platform’s word. We instinctively seek a consensus of truth across the noise.

Finally, many have decided the best judge is themselves. “Try before you buy” has made a comeback as a defense against dubious reviews. Free trials, freemium tiers, generous return policies, consumers leverage them all to test products firsthand.

If a software platform promises the world in its curated testimonials, a savvy buyer will take the 14-day free trial and see if it lives up to the hype. In sectors like enterprise software, where choices are costly and critical, buyers might run a pilot program or proof-of-concept rather than trust glossy case studies. Essentially, experience has become the new review.

All this has serious implications for platforms and software marketplaces. These businesses built their empires on user-generated trust, turning customer opinion into a key part of the shopping experience.

If that trust evaporates, the model cracks. We’re already seeing the early signs: users skipping the review tab, or treating every five-star rating with a healthy dose of skepticism.

If the review economy continues on its current path, platforms risk becoming mere transaction processors rather than trust brokers.

For the marketplaces, this is both a crisis and an opportunity. The crisis is obvious: loss of credibility. If people no longer believe what they read on your platform, they’ll seek validation elsewhere, and your influence over purchase decisions diminishes.

But the opportunity lies in reform. Platforms could double down on authenticity as a feature, verifying purchases, cracking down harder on fraudulent and incentivized reviews, and highlighting more qualitative, nuanced feedback instead of simple star counts.

There’s even a chance to innovate with new trust signals (some are experimenting with things like verified buyer badges, AI analysis for suspicious patterns, or weighted ratings that account for reviewer reputation). The platforms that find ways to genuinely restore faith in their review systems will win back weary consumers. Those that don’t will see their communities drift away, bit by bit.

Importantly, not all platforms have given in to the dark side. A handful still refuse pay-for-play tactics, no paid reviews, no under-the-table boosting of rankings for advertisers.

These holdouts demonstrate that integrity in reviews is possible, even if it means slower growth in the short term.

In the end, the broken review economy is forcing a rebalance of how we decide what to trust. Buyers are adapting, finding new ways to cut through the noise. And the platforms that once thrived on being the ultimate source of truth in purchasing may have to rethink their approach if they want to stay relevant.

Trust, once lost, is hard to regain. The five-star system doesn’t shine as bright as it used to; perhaps it’s time for the next evolution in how we share and earn trust online.

            <div id="article-text">2025 was the year technology stopped being tomorrow’s promise and became today’s anchor. What began as a surge in generative AI and platform innovation two years prior crystallized this year into concrete shifts in how people work, governing bodies legislate, and markets invest. Across continents and industries, the arc of technology bent toward practical impact, regulatory reality, and economic weight!

At the heart of the year’s story was artificial intelligence’s jump from novelty to infrastructure. LLMs and multimodal models moved beyond demos into everyday workflows, influencing how documents are written, campaigns are conceived, products designed, and code generated.

Enterprises that once hesitated began deploying AI tools at scale, with early adopters reporting measurable productivity gains by integrating copilots into core processes, a trend visible in surveys showing widespread adoption among software professionals.

This editorial isn’t a chronicle of every press release.

It’s a reflection on how 2025, at the crossroads of technology, governance, and economic strategy, brought about a series of inflection points that will shape the next era of creation, competition, and control.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

OpenAI’s release of GPT-5 in August pushed the boundaries of what AI could do, delivering notable gains in coding, math, and multimodal understanding. But unlike the jaw-dropping debut of ChatGPT a couple years prior, this new generation of foundation models arrived to a more measured reception.

Tech leaders and investors had begun asking harder questions: beyond impressive demos, could these models drive real products and revenue?

Google’s answer was Gemini 3, launched in November as its “most intelligent model” and immediately woven into Google’s flagship product, Search. For the first time, an AI model upgrade wasn’t just about boastful leaderboard scores, it was about transforming user experience.

Typing a query into Google now often meant receiving an AI-generated synthesis instead of the familiar list of links, a sea change in how information is delivered. Google even unveiled a Gemini “agent” that could execute multi-step tasks like booking travel or organizing email, hinting at a future where AI acts more like a digital butler than a chatbox.

Anthropic’s Claude 4 model, for instance, gained a strong following among developers by expanding how much it could handle at once, processing entire codebases with tens of thousands of lines, rather than by producing viral one-liners.

AI grew up in 2025: it was still improving at breakneck speed, but it also had to earn its keep in real products and justify the billion-dollar bets fueling its rise.

Driving this AI explosion was a parallel leap in hardware. The hunger for AI computers in 2025 was insatiable, and chipmakers raced to deliver.

NVIDIA, whose GPUs had become the era’s essential infrastructure, rolled out its new Blackwell architecture with chips like the B200 that boasted up to 3× the training speed of its predecessor. Cloud data centers around the world scrambled to deploy these to keep up with demand from model training and inference.

Rival chipmakers weren’t idle either: AMD and a cadre of startups pushed innovative AI accelerators, while even Intel signaled ambitions to catch up, reportedly exploring an acquisition of AI chip designer SambaNova.

Perhaps most tellingly, tech giants themselves started designing silicon tailored for AI workloads, recognizing that owning the chip means owning the future of computing.

Beyond AI chips, consumer hardware saw its own milestones. After years of anticipation, augmented reality glasses and mixed-reality headsets finally had their moment, sort of.

Apple’s Vision Pro headset, unveiled in late 2023, reached select markets in 2024; by 2025 developers were crafting the first wave of immersive apps. However, mass adoption lagged due to the device’s sky-high price and bulky format.

Competitors like Meta’s Quest line offered cheaper VR headsets and modest improvements, but the “metaverse” hype of yesteryear largely fizzled out, users and investors had shifted their excitement to generative AI and tangible productivity tools.

Smartphones and laptops in 2025 continued incremental improvements (faster Apple M3/M4 chips, foldable screens becoming more common), yet it was clear the next paradigm shift in personal tech was still on the horizon.

Even so, one hardware frontier made concrete progress: quantum computing. Industry leaders like IBM and Google demonstrated prototype systems with ever-larger qubit counts and made strides in error correction, inching closer to viable quantum machines.

These advances, while esoteric to the public, underscored a broader theme, from AI accelerators to quantum chips, the machinery under the hood of tech was evolving rapidly to enable the software of tomorrow.

If 2025 proved anything, it’s that technology no longer operates above the law. This was the year regulators moved from intent to enforcement, with Europe leading the charge.

After years of debate, the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act came into force, becoming the world’s first complex AI law. From February, certain “unacceptable risk” uses, such as social scoring and real-time biometric surveillance, were banned outright.

By August, transparency rules followed, forcing companies to label AI-generated content and comply with new obligations for general-purpose models. The signal was unmistakable: in Europe, the era of unchecked AI was over.

Companies now face audits, penalties, and real consequences if their systems cross legal or ethical lines, a regulatory moment European officials openly compared to GDPR’s impact on data privacy.

The pressure didn’t stop with AI. In 2025, regulators also went after the gatekeepers. The EU’s Digital Markets Act forced long-resistant changes from Big Tech, most notably when Apple opened the iPhone to third-party app stores and sideloading in Europe, dismantling a 15-year walled garden.

At the same time, enforcement of the Digital Services Act intensified. Platforms were scrutinized for how they handle disinformation, with companies like X warned or penalized during periods of geopolitical tension. In response, social networks expanded moderation teams, adjusted algorithms, and exposed more of their inner workings to researchers.

The US issued an AI executive order and signaled tougher enforcement through agencies like the FTC, while states stepped in, including New York’s law requiring mental-health warnings on addictive social features.

In China, new draft rules targeted AI systems designed for human-like interaction, tightening licensing and ideological oversight. By the end of the year, the freewheeling phase of tech disruption had given way to something more restrained. The question was no longer whether regulation would catch up, but how deeply it would reshape innovation itself.

The platform shake-up that began in 2023 gathered real momentum in 2025, as both companies and users adjusted to a post-pandemic, AI-saturated reality.

Nowhere was this clearer than in social media. Elon Musk’s X, which entered the decade with noise and bravado, found itself on the defensive. Meta’s Threads, initially dismissed after an early spike, steadily closed the gap, nearing parity with X in daily mobile users by mid-year.

X’s audience shrank as policy whiplash and leadership churn eroded confidence, and while its remaining users were still deeply engaged, the era of unquestioned Twitter dominance was over. Disenchanted users scattered across a fragmented landscape, from Meta’s polished Threads to decentralized alternatives like Bluesky and Mastodon, breaking the old Facebook–Instagram–Twitter equilibrium.

The recalibration extended well beyond social feeds.

Major platforms retooled around changing habits: Google reshaped Search around generative answers to fend off AI assistants and algorithmic discovery, while Microsoft pushed its Copilot deeper into Windows, Office, and Bing, betting on “AI inside” as a platform reset.

Everyday behavior shifted too. Smarter voice and chat assistants returned to daily use, handling emails, refunds, and scheduling with little friction. At the same time, screen fatigue set in. Digital-detox travel gained traction, and younger users gravitated toward apps that promised less algorithmic pressure and more human curation. Even streaming came full circle.

After years of fragmentation, providers began rebundling services, offering combined video, music, and gaming packages that looked suspiciously like cable TV reborn, a reminder that while technology moves forward, user preferences often move in cycles.

Amid the gains and momentum, 2025 also became a year of reckoning. As AI systems spread, society began grappling with their cultural and ethical cost. Creators who once marveled at generative tools started pushing back, arguing that their work had been absorbed without consent or compensation.

A wave of lawsuits moved through US courts, with authors accusing companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google of scraping books and articles to train models. By year’s end, the message was unmistakable: if AI is built on human creativity, many believe its rewards can no longer flow in one direction alone.

Public trust in technology was also tested by a rise in malicious uses and misuses. In the financial domain, sophisticated deepfake scams caused real damage. The frequency of such incidents spiked sharply; cybersecurity firms reported a 3000% increase in deepfake-related fraud over two years, and authorities scrambled to educate businesses on new verification practices.

Misinformation continued to be a menace: during elections and conflicts, AI-generated fake images and videos spread on social media, forcing newsrooms to set up rapid-response fact-checking teams.

Encouragingly, 2025 also saw growth in countermeasures, from better deepfake detection algorithms to nascent standards for cryptographic content authentication (the Coalition for Content Provenance, including major publishers and tech platforms, expanded efforts to watermark authentic media).

Still, the information ecosystem remained fraught, as even savvy citizens found it ever harder to tell the truth from fabrication online.

And then there’s the human element: how all this tech is affecting everyday lives and livelihoods. Workplace AI adoption soared this year; tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot and a host of AI assistants became common on office desktops. Studies showed productivity boosts but also raised concerns about workers becoming overly reliant on AI suggestions.

Meanwhile, fears of automation resurfaced in certain sectors, for example, as chatbots took over more customer service and code-generation tools improved, professionals in call centers and junior programming positions wondered about long-term job security.

These anxieties fueled calls for new approaches to education and training, so that the workforce of 2030 will be prepared for more creative, complex tasks that AI can’t easily handle.

Lovable (Stockholm, Sweden) came as one of the most remarkable AI software stories of the year, for me. What began as an open-source project evolved into a commercial platform that lets users build fully functional websites and apps using plain-language prompts, no traditional coding required.

This approach, known in the industry as “vibe coding,” turns ideas into production-ready software simply by describing what you want in natural language.

Lovable’s growth in 2025 was extraordinary by any measure. Eight months after its launch, the company hit over $100 million in annual recurring revenue and raised a $200 million Series A at a roughly $1.8 billion valuation, making it one of Europe’s fastest-growing software startups ever.

By year’s end, Lovable had secured $330 million in Series B funding at about a $6.6 billion valuation, and was rapidly scaling globally.

What makes Lovable meaningful beyond the numbers is what it represents: a shift in how software is built. It demonstrated that AI can democratize development, giving power to non-technical founders, creators, and teams to go from concept to product without traditional engineering barriers.

In an industry long centered on specialized skills and team structures, Lovable’s rise suggested a future where natural language becomes the primary interface to software creation.

On a more hopeful note, 2025 showed signs of a maturing tech culture. Ethical design moved from talking point to practice. Major platforms began experimenting with limits, turning off infinite scroll for teens, adding prompts that nudged users to pause, and treating “time well spent” as a real metric rather than a slogan.

In AI, transparency gained ground. Under pressure from regulators and researchers, companies like OpenAI and Google disclosed more about how their models are trained and where they fall short.

Researchers formed new alliances to share safety techniques, and a second global AI Safety Summit brought dozens of countries together around questions of alignment and control.

None of it amounted to binding rules, but it marked a shift in tone: even the architects of powerful systems openly acknowledged the need for restraint.

Taken together, these moments made 2025 a turning point. For years, technology had surged ahead of the institutions meant to guide it. This year, that gap began to close.

The breakthroughs were real and transformative, but so were the responses to them: laws passed, norms reset, alliances formed. If 2024 was the year the world grasped the power of generative AI, 2025 was the year it began deciding how that power should be used.

The story of technology is no longer just about what can be built, but about how it fits into the lives it shapes, and who gets to decide that fit.

            <div id="article-text">My name is Alexandru Stan, and this article continues the dialogue I began following the acquisition of TNW.

Following the recent transaction, TNW Spaces remains with the Financial Times, while we continue the mission of the website, the events, and the global community.

We already have a dedicated team at tekpon operating the platform, events, and community initiatives. Our objective is to expand and strengthen the team as TNW accelerates its next chapter.

TNW is already a global media platform with millions of readers. We’re not starting over. We are building forward.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Technology is entering a decisive stage: AI is reshaping workflows, distribution is shifting, capital is becoming more selective, and founders are expected to demonstrate value rather than potential.

The world doesn’t need more noise.
It needs clarity, execution, and access to trustworthy knowledge and people.

TNW will serve that need through editorial independence, real expertise, and community-built intelligence.

Success for TNW looks like this: more accurate understanding, faster access to verified knowledge, and direct pathways from insight to action.

I’ve been an entrepreneur since 2007, building in B2B SaaS, marketplaces, and scalable systems. I believe deeply in servant leadership. Without people, I am zero.

I lead two private networks grounded in practice rather than theory:

These groups ensure TNW remains rooted in lived experience, informed by operators, not commentators.

Our mission is to build the most trusted European tech media platform with global reach, focused on practical innovation, responsible scaling, and transparency.

We will continue to host events across Europe’s major capitals including Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Monaco.

These will not be festivals. We are introducing a concept validated through tekpon events: curated gatherings built for meaningful relationships, deep content, and tangible business outcomes.

In 2026, we return to Amsterdam for a special edition centered on AI among other fields. We will explore technologies and strategies shaping the future of work and business:

The editorial focus remains European, while the audience is global.

AI is not a threat to publishing. It is the infrastructure of the next generation of content and knowledge.

At TNW, we will use AI to accelerate research, enable personalized intelligence, reduce noise and bias, and amplify high-quality human expertise. Technology assists. Human judgment remains central.

Because this moment in Europe matters.
Because founders here are ready to scale responsibly.
Because independent media with integrity is rare.
Because innovation deserves a platform built around people, not hype.

TNW will continue its legacy with a renewed emphasis on contribution, execution, and community built through trust.

If you are building, scaling, or researching the next wave of technology, I invite you to engage with us, contribute insights, and participate in shaping the conversation.

The next era begins now. Let’s shape it together.
