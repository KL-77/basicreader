            <h2>Driven: The 2026 Lamborghini Temerario raises the bar for supercars</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/02/driven-the-2026-lamborghini-temerario-raises-the-bar-for-supercars/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">While mainstream vehicles usually get comprehensive updates every few years, low-volume exotics tend evolve more gradually. Supercar platforms often remain unchanged for a decade or more, with manufacturers instead focusing on what can be tuned, massaged, added, or subtracted to keep their lineups fresh. Every once in a while, though, a performance car debuts that truly earns the label “all-new,” and the Lamborghini Temerario is one of them.

As the replacement for the Huracán, Lamborghini’s bestselling sports car to date, the Temerario has big shoes to fill. At first glance, it might seem like a more subdued affair than its predecessor, but the Huracán debuted in a similar fashion before wilder iterations like the STO and Sterrato were introduced to the lineup.

During a technical briefing late last year, Lamborghini sales chief Frederick Foschini noted that the Temerario’s streamlined look is intentional. The team sought to increase downforce by more than 100 percent compared with the Huracán Evo through the car’s core design, rather than relying on big wings, splitters, and other racy aerodynamic bits. Designers were also tasked with creating an all-new car that was distinctive yet instantly recognizable as a Lamborghini. Judging by the number of heads this car turned during my time with it, I’d say the company was successful.

It’s not obvious from a cursory look at the exterior, but the Temerario is longer, wider, and taller than the car it replaces. Underpinned by a new all-aluminum spaceframe that’s more than 20 percent stiffer than the Huracán’s, the Temerari’s dimensional changes become immediately evident when you settle in behind the wheel, as head and legroom are noticeably improved over the outgoing car. I’m 6 feet, 3 inches (1.9 m), and at a rained-out track session at Sonoma Raceway back in November, I was able to position my seat however I wanted with headroom to spare, even with a helmet on.

The Temerario is also a big step forward ergonomically, as Lamborghini seems to be taking a more pragmatic approach to the control layout, which, like the Revuelto, sees the majority of often-used features accessed on the steering wheel. The tightly packed array of buttons and knobs looks overwhelming at first, but once you’re used to it, having everything directly in front of you—and controlled by physical buttons rather than capacitive surfaces—means your attention can stay on the road.

These are definitely welcome improvements, but the star of the show, and arguably the most controversial element of the Temerario, is its all-new powertrain. While the Huracán was motivated by a lovely naturally aspirated V10, the Temerario gets its propulsion from a 4.0 L twin-turbocharged DOHC dry-sump V8 that revs to a searing 10,000 rpm. An axial-flux electric motor is sandwiched between the flywheel and the eight-speed dual clutch gearbox. Combined with two additional electric motors that power the front wheels, the total system output is a healthy 907 hp (676 kW) and 538 lb-ft (730 Nm) of torque.

A 3.8 kWh lithium-ion battery mounted in the central tunnel of the spaceframe powers the electric motors and provides about six miles (10 km) of all-electric range. Though it can be recharged in about 30 minutes on a Level 2 charger, the hybrid system is designed to capture energy from the internal combustion engine and regenerative braking, so owners won’t need to plug in very often, if ever.

The sophisticated setup adds some heft: Lamborghini cites a dry weight of 3,726 lbs (1,690 kg), which means the Temerario weighs about 600 lbs (272 kg) more than the Huracán Evo. Additional mass is never a welcome development for a sports car, but to the automaker’s credit, Lamborghini has done a truly commendable job of hiding it.

Although I had originally planned to drive the Temerario exclusively on track at Sonoma, heavy rain forced us to scrap that idea after a slippery autocross session and a few harrowing laps around the course. To make up for the false start, Lamborghini graciously provided me with a Blu Marinus example for a few days at my home in Los Angeles. While the dry weather seat time reinforced the notion that you really do need to get this thing on a racetrack to see what it’s capable of, I was pleased to find it’s not a one-trick pony.

As with the Revuelto, the Temerario defaults to Citta (Italian for “city”), its all-electric drive mode, each time it’s started. This makes pressing the jet-fighter-style start/stop button less exciting than it was in the Huracán, but it gives the Temerario an element of stealth that its predecessor never had.

There are 13 drive modes, but only four main ones (Citta, Strada, Sport, and Corsa), which can be augmented with additional settings selected via the EV knob on the upper right-hand side of the steering wheel. The latter offers Recharge and Hybrid settings in all four main modes, while a third Performance setting is available only in Sport and Corsa. Each of these EV-related settings alters how the hybrid system behaves and how the battery’s state of charge is managed. The Performance setting is the only way to get the full 907 hp out of the powertrain.

The Temerario can reach highway speeds solely with electricity, but it’s not a particularly exciting way to get around. Acceleration is best described as leisurely, and the front motors’ torque output can struggle to contend with even a moderately steep hill, which often triggers the internal combustion engine to spring to life. But the engine has its own required warm-up process, so situations like this sometimes result in less-than-graceful powertrain handoffs.

Once all the systems are working together, though, the Temerario proves to be a surprisingly competent tourer, thanks to improved ergonomics and a firm but forgiving adaptive suspension that, in its softer setting, absorbs bumps on the highway instead of bouncing over them. But as impressive as the Temerario is at handling everyday driving tasks, everything starts to feel like a mere lead-up to the main event once you’ve unleashed it on a fast stretch of canyon road. Given room to stretch its legs, the V8 emits a superbike-like snarl as the revs climb, and the sheer thrust of the powertrain makes chasing its 10,000 rpm redline feel like a test of bravery, even in lower gears.

The way this car piles on speed is stunning on its own, but it’s the accessibility—and how confidently it can maintain a pace—that truly sets it apart from the Huracán. It feels every bit as nimble as the Huracan, delivering relentless grip even on standard Bridgestone Potenza Sport summer tires, while the brakes—which now use ten-piston calipers instead of the Huracán’s eight-piston setup—offer strong, repeatable stopping power at top speeds.

I did find myself occasionally wishing for more aero stability during these moments, though. Fortunately, for any would-be Temerario owners who plan to track their cars regularly, Lamborghini also offers the Alleggerita package. This add-on increases downforce by 67 percent versus the standard Temerario while swapping the Bridgestone Potenza Sport tires out for track-ready Bridgestone Potenza Race rubber. The package also includes a raft of carbon fiber components for modest weight savings over the standard car.

All this doesn’t come cheap, though. Temerario’s base price of $389,554 ($486,721 as-tested) represents a six-figure jump over the last Huracán, and you can tack on another 45 grand if you opt for the Alleggerita package in its most basic form.

That’s a tall ask, especially when cars like the Corvette ZR1 offer similarly incredible performance for substantially less coin. But something tells me that Lamborghini won’t have any problems moving its latest “entry level” model. Then again, have you seen the price of bitcoin lately?</div>

            <h2>New critique debunks claim that trees can sense a solar eclipse</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/new-critique-debunks-claim-that-trees-can-sense-a-solar-eclipse/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last year, a team of scientists presented evidence that spruce trees in Italy’s Dolomite mountains synchronized their bioelectrical activity in anticipation of a partial solar eclipse—a potentially exciting new insight into the complexities of plant communication. The findings naturally generated media interest and even inspired a documentary. But the claims drew sharp criticism from other researchers in the field, with some questioning whether the paper should even have been published. Those initial misgivings are outlined in more detail in a new critique published in the journal Trends in Plant Science.

For the original paper, Alessandro Chiolerio, a physicist at the Italian Institute of Technology, collaborated with plant ecologist Monica Gagliano of Southern Cross University and several others conducting field work in the Costa Bocche forest in the Dolomites. They essentially created an EKG for trees, attaching electrodes to three spruce trees (ranging in age from 20 to 70 years) and five tree stumps in the forest.

Those sensors recorded a marked increase in bioelectrical activity during a partial solar eclipse on October 22, 2022. The activity peaked mid-eclipse and faded away in its aftermath. Chiolerio et al. interpreted this spike in activity as a coordinated response among the trees to the darkened conditions brought on by the eclipse. And older trees’ electrical activity spiked earlier and more strongly than the younger trees, which Chiolerio et al. felt was suggestive of trees developing response mechanisms—a kind of memory captured in associated gravitational effects. Older trees might even transmit this knowledge to younger trees, the authors suggested, based on the detection of bioelectrical waves traveling between the trees.

Soon, other plant scientists weighed in, expressing strong skepticism and citing the study’s small sample size and large number of variables, among other concerns. Justine Karst, a forest ecologist at the University of Alberta in Canada, unfavorably compared Chiolerio et al.’s findings to a 2019 study claiming evidence for the controversial “wood-wide web” concept, in which trees communicate and share resources via underground networks of mycorrhizal fungi. Karst co-authored a 2023 study demonstrating insufficient evidence for the wood-wide-web.

Ariel Novoplansky, an evolutionary ecologist at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel, was among those who objected to the study’s publication—so much so that he co-authored the new critique with his Ben-Gurion colleague Hezi Yizhaq. He thinks it’s far more likely that the spikes in bioelectrical activity were due to temperature shifts or lightning strikes.

“My serious doubts had arisen from the very basic premise regarding the adaptive rationale the entire study hinged upon—namely, that those trees would be functionally affected by such a minor ‘passing cloud’ effects of such a (very) partial eclipse [with] a mere 10.5 percent reduction in sunlight for two hours,” Novoplansky told Ars. “I then thought about the possibility that thunderstorms might be involved in the heightened ‘anticipatory’ electrical activity of the trees, and it rolled from there.”

The forest trees frequently experience far greater fluctuations in cloud cover, and hence light quality and quantity, than occurred during the partial eclipse, according to Novoplansky. He also objected to the suggestion of older trees sharing prior eclipse “knowledge” with younger trees, pointing out that each solar eclipse follows a unique path. So even if older trees “remembered” an earlier eclipse, it would not translate into being able to anticipate future ones. And any gravitational changes associated with a partial eclipse would be minor, on par with a new moon. Thus, for Novoplansky, the 2025 paper “represents the encroachment of pseudoscience into the heart of biological research.”

“This field of plant behavior/communication is rampant with poorly designed ‘studies’ that are then twisted into a narrative that promotes personal worldviews and/or enhances personal celebrity,” said James Cahill, a plant ecologist at the University of Alberta in Calgary, Canada, who voiced objections when the original paper was published and is cited in Novoplansky’s acknowledgements. “The textbook example of this is the [Suzanne] Simard ‘mother tree’ debacle. Ariel is trying to get the science back on track, as are many of us.”

(Cahill recently co-authored a paper in Trends in Ecology and Evolution on the issue of cognition in plants, including commentary on “how we might stop fighting and do actual science.”)

“He puts forward logical alternative hypotheses,” said Cahill of Novoplansky’s critique. “The original work should have tested among a number of different hypotheses rather than focusing on a single interpretation. This is in part what makes it pseudoscience and promoting a worldview.”

Granted, “[p]lants have extensive and well established mechanisms of communication, with that of volatiles being the most well studied and understood,” he added. “There is also growing recognition that root exudates play a role in plant-plant interactions, though this is only now being deeply investigated. Nothing else, communication through mychorriza, has withstood independent investigation.”

Chiolerio and Gagliano stand by their research, saying they have always acknowledged the preliminary nature of their results. “We measured [weather-related elements like] temperature, relative humidity, rainfall and daily solar radiation,” Chiolerio told Ars. “None of them shows strong correlation with the transients of the electrome during the eclipse. We did not measure environmental electric fields, though; therefore, I cannot exclude effects induced by nearby lightnings. We did not have gravitational probes, did not check neutrinos, cosmic rays, magnetic fields, etc.”

“I’m not going to debate an unpublished critique in the media, but I can clarify our position,” Gagliano told Ars. “Our [2025] paper reports an empirical electrophysiological/synchrony pattern in the eclipse window, including changes beginning prior to maximum occultation, and we discussed candidate cues explicitly as hypotheses rather than demonstrated causes. Describing weather/lightning as ‘more parsimonious’ is not evidence of cause. Regional lightning strike counts and other proxies can motivate a competing hypothesis, but they do not establish causal attribution at the recording site without site-resolved, time-aligned field measurements. Without those measurements, the lightning/weather account remains a hypothesis among other possibilities rather than a supported or default explanation for the signals we recorded.”

“We acknowledged the limited sample size and described the work as an initial field report; follow-up work is ongoing and will be communicated through peer-reviewed channels,” Gagliano added. As for the suggestion of pseudoscience, “I won’t engage with labels; scientific disagreements should be resolved with transparent methods, data, and discriminating tests.”

“It seems that the public appeal is something particularly painful for the colleagues who published their opinion on Trends in Plant Science,” Chiolerio said. “We did not care about public appeal, we wanted to share as much as possible the results of years of hard work that led to interesting data.”

            <h2>Stellantis swallows $26 billion costs as it rethinks its EV strategy</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/02/stellantis-swallows-26-billion-costs-as-it-rethinks-its-ev-strategy/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The automotive industry’s big bet on a rapid adoption of electric vehicles—at least here in the United States—continues to unwind. Today, Stellantis, which owns brands like Jeep and Dodge, as well as Fiat, Peugeot, and others, announced that it has “reset” its business to adapt to reality, which comes with a rather painful $26.2 billion (22.2 billion euro) write-down.

It wasn’t that long ago that everyone was more bullish on electrification. Even the US had relatively ambitious plans to boost EV adoption into the next decade, including a big commitment to charging infrastructure. Ten new battery factories were announced, and the future looked bright.

Not everyone agreed. Some automakers, having been left behind by the push toward battery EVs and away from simple hybrids that offered little in the way of true decarbonization, lobbied hard to relax fuel efficiency standards. Car dealers, uncomfortable with the prospect of investing in and learning about new technology, did so, too. When the Republican Party won the 2024 election, the revanchists got their wish.

Gone were the incentives to consumers and businesses to buy EVs, which helped offset the higher purchase price. Out went funding for that national network of high-speed chargers. Tough future emissions standards were torn up, and inefficient and polluting gasoline engines will instead be the order of the day. And automakers were told to forget about being fined under the existing regulations—&quot;sell as many gas-guzzlers as you like” was the message. (But also, bizarrely, import those tiny Japanese Kei cars, too.)

Stellantis is hardly alone in feeling this pain; in December, Ford announced a $19.5 billion write-down as it reprioritized combustion-engine platforms going forward. GM followed in early January with news that canceling some of its EV plans would cost the company $6 billion. Neither bill is quite as large as the one facing Stellantis (and its shareholders).

The automaker has lagged behind Ford and General Motors in terms of its electrification strategy. In the time that Ford’s F-150 Lightning electric truck has come and gone, and as GM will sell you a couple of different EV pickups, Ram never got that far—and likely never will now that its giant-batteried truck has been canceled. And Jeep’s first US EV was more than a bit underwhelming.

Those canceled products will cost Stellantis about $3.4 billion (2.9 billion euros), with another $7.1 billion (6 billion euros) from platforms that will no longer be amortized over nearly as many units. Another $6.8 billion (5.8 billion euros) will be paid as cash over the next four years due to existing contracts.

Resizing the company’s supply chain will cost another $2.5 billion (2.1 billion euros) as it needs fewer batteries. Laying off workers in Europe will cost another $1.5 billion (1.3 billion euros), with an additional $4.8 billion (4.1 billion euros) due to ongoing warranty issues.

“The charges announced today largely reflect the cost of over-estimating the pace of the energy transition that distanced us from many car buyers’ real-world needs, means and desires. They also reflect the impact of previous poor operational execution, the effects of which are being progressively addressed by our new team,” said Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa.

Going forward, Stellantis says it will invest $13 billion in the US, where it plans to add 5,000 jobs as it builds more trucks and SUVs. Among these will be a new V8 version of the Ram 1500 pickup, a gas-powered version of the Dodge Charger, and some Jeeps.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/congress-advances-bill-requiring-nasa-to-reconsider-deorbiting-space-station/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Members of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee voted to approve a NASA authorization bill this week, advancing legislation chock full of policy guidelines meant to give lawmakers a voice in the space agency’s strategic direction.

The committee met to “mark up” the NASA Reauthorization Act of 2026, adding more than 40 amendments to the bill before a unanimous vote to refer the legislation to the full House of Representatives. Wednesday’s committee vote was just one of several steps needed for the bill to become law. It must pass a vote on the House floor, win approval from the Senate, and then go to the White House for President Donald Trump’s signature.

Ars has reported on one of the amendments, which would authorize NASA to take steps toward a “commercial” deep space program using privately owned rockets and spacecraft rather than vehicles owned by the government.

Another add-on to the authorization bill would require NASA to reassess whether to guide the International Space Station (ISS) toward a destructive atmospheric reentry after it is decommissioned in 2030. The space agency’s current plan is to deorbit the space station in 2031 over the Pacific Ocean, where debris that survives the scorching reentry will fall into a remote, unpopulated part of the sea.

The most recent NASA authorization act, passed in 2022, extended the US government’s support for the ISS program until 2030. The amendment tacked onto this year’s bill would not change the timeline for ending operations on the ISS, but it asks NASA to reconsider its decision about what to do with the complex after retirement.

The amendment would direct NASA to “carry out an engineering analysis to evaluate the technical, operational, and logistical viability of transferring the ISS to a safe orbital harbor and storing the ISS in such harbor after the end of the operational low-Earth orbit lifetime of the ISS to preserve the ISS for potential reuse and satisfy the objectives of NASA.”

Rep. George Whitesides (D-Calif.) submitted the amendment with cosponsorship from Rep. Nick Begich (R-Alaska). The proposal passed the committee through a voice vote with bipartisan support. Whitesides was a NASA chief of staff and longtime executive in the space industry before his election to the House last year.

“The International Space Station is one of the most complex engineering achievements in human history,” Whitesides said. “It represents more than three decades of international collaboration and investment by US taxpayers estimated at well over $100 billion. Current plans call for the station to be deorbited at the end of its service life in 2030. This amendment does not seek to change that policy. Instead, it asks a straightforward question: Before we permanently dispose of an asset of this magnitude, should we fully understand whether it’s viable to preserve it in orbit for potential use by future generations?”

In 2024, NASA awarded SpaceX a nearly $1 billion contract to develop a souped-up version of its Dragon spacecraft, which would be equipped with additional thrusters and propellant tanks to provide the impulse required to steer the space station toward a targeted reentry. The deorbit maneuvers will slow the station’s velocity enough for Earth’s gravity to pull it back into the atmosphere.

The deorbit vehicle needs to slow the station’s speed by about 127 mph (57 meters per second), a tiny fraction of the spacecraft’s orbital velocity of more than 17,000 mph (7.7 kilometers per second). But the station mass is around 450 tons (400 metric tons), equivalent to two freight train locomotives, and measures about the length of a football field. Changing its speed by just 127 mph will consume about 10 tons (9 metric tons) of propellant, according to a NASA analysis released in 2024.

The analysis document shows that NASA considered alternatives to discarding the space station through reentry. One option NASA studied involved moving the station into a higher orbit. At its current altitude, roughly 260 miles (420 kilometers) above the Earth, the ISS would take one to two years to reenter the atmosphere due to aerodynamic drag if reboosts weren’t performed. NASA does not want the space station to make an uncontrolled reentry because of the risk of fatalities, injuries, and property damage from debris reaching the ground.

Boosting the space station’s orbit to somewhere between 400 and 420 miles (640 to 680 kilometers) would require a little more than twice the propellant (18.9 to 22.3 metric tons) needed for deorbit maneuvers, according to NASA’s analysis. At that altitude, without any additional boosts, NASA says the space station would likely remain in orbit for 100 years before succumbing to atmospheric drag and burning up. Going higher still, the space station could be placed in a 1,200-mile-high (2,000-kilometer) orbit, stable for more than 10,000 years, with about 146 tons (133 metric tons) of propellant.

There are two problems with sending the ISS to higher altitudes. One is that it would require the development of new propulsive and tanker vehicles that do not currently exist, according to NASA.

“While still currently in development, vehicles such as the SpaceX Starship are being designed to deliver significant amounts of cargo to these orbits,” NASA officials wrote in their analysis. “However, there are prohibitive engineering challenges with docking such a large vehicle to the space station and being able to use its thrusters while remaining within space station structural margins. Other vehicles would require both new certifications to fly at higher altitudes and multiple flights to deliver propellant.”

Going higher would also expose the space station to an increased risk of collision with space junk. The hazards from space debris are most severe at about 500 miles (800 kilometers), according to the engineers who conducted the analysis. “This means that the likelihood of an impact leaving station unable to maneuver or react to future threats, or even a significant impact resulting in complete fragmentation, is unacceptably high.”

Whitesides’ office did not respond to Ars’ questions, but he said in Wednesday’s hearing that his amendment would direct NASA to further examine the costs and risks of putting the ISS in a higher orbit. The legislation “simply ensures that Congress receives a rigorous fact-based analysis so that future decisions involving the ISS are informed by scientific reality,” he said.

“At a time when we’re thinking seriously about sustainability in space, this amendment protects taxpayer investments and ensures that we fully understand our options before an irreplaceable asset is permanently retired.”

Rep. Brian Babin (R-Texas) said he “wholeheartedly” supports Whitesides’ amendment. Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) also endorsed it in brief remarks during Wednesday’s markup hearing.

“I just hate the thought that we would take something not just that we spent all the money on, but such an important part of human history, and dump it in the Pacific Ocean, never to be seen again, rather than preserving it,” Beyer said. “We don’t know whether we can do it in orbit, but if we can, we should really explore that hard.”

Although NASA’s official policy is still to decommission the ISS in 2030, the door hasn’t closed on extending the lab’s operations into the next decade. There are some concerns about aging hardware, but NASA said in 2024 that engineers have “high confidence” that the primary structure of the station could support operations beyond 2030.

The oldest segments of the station have been in orbit since 1998, undergoing day-night thermal cycles every 45 minutes as they orbit the planet. The structural stability of the Russian section of the outpost is also in question. Russian engineers traced a small but persistent air leak to microscopic structural cracks in one Russian module, but cosmonauts were able to seal the cracks, and air pressure in the area is “holding steady,” a NASA spokesperson said last month.

One of the lab’s most critical elements, its power-generation system, is in good shape after NASA recently installed upgraded solar arrays outside the station. Another set of upgraded solar panels is scheduled to arrive at the station later this year, just a few years before the complex is to be retired.

NASA’s strategy is to decommission the ISS and turn to the commercial sector for new, cheaper, smaller space stations to continue conducting research in low-Earth orbit. This would allow NASA to buy time on a commercial space station for its astronauts and experiments, while the agency’s human spaceflight program focuses on missions to the Moon.

That’s a fine plan, but NASA’s program to support commercial space stations, known as Commercial LEO Destinations (CLDs), is going nowhere fast. Supporters of the CLD program say it has been underfunded from the start, and the strategy became more muddled last year when Sean Duffy, then NASA’s acting administrator, changed the agency’s rules for private space stations. NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman is reviewing the changes, and the requirements for stations may shift again.

NASA spends more than $3 billion per year for ISS operations, including crew and cargo transportation services to staff and support the outpost. NASA’s budget for deep space exploration in fiscal year 2026 is nearly $7.8 billion. NASA is receiving $273 million for the Commercial LEO Destinations program this year, with the money to be divided among multiple companies.

Any private space station will need to sustain itself, at least partially, on commercial business to be profitable. Developers have raised concerns that they will be unable to attract sufficient commercial business—in areas like pharmaceutical research, tech demos, or space tourism—as long as the government-funded ISS is still operating.

One of the companies vying for NASA funding is Vast, which plans to launch its first single-module private outpost to orbit in early 2027. This first station, named Haven-1, will accommodate crews for short-duration temporary stays. Vast plans to follow Haven-1 with a much larger complex capable of supporting a permanent crew.

Max Haot, Vast’s CEO, does not seem bothered by lawmakers’ efforts to revisit the question of deorbiting the International Space Station.

“The amendment directs NASA to study the feasibility of something other than deorbit and disposal after ISS end of life, which is separate from the issue of retiring the space station and transitioning to commercial partners,” Haot said in a statement to Ars. “We support President Trump’s directive in national space policy to replace the ISS by 2030, with commercial partners who can ensure there is no gap in America’s continuous human presence in space.”

The other top contenders in the commercial space station arena are Starlab, a joint venture between Voyager Space and Airbus, the Blue Origin-led Orbital Reef project, and Axiom Space. Voyager and Blue Origin did not respond to requests for comment from Ars, and an Axiom spokesperson was unable to provide a statement by publication time.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Move over Snoopy, because NASA has a new character helping to promote its deep space exploration plans. His name is Uncle Traveling Matt.

Fraggle Rock: A Space-y Adventure has taken over the same theater the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Florida previously used for All Systems Are Go, featuring the comic strip beagle. The new stage show stars the Jim Henson Company’s subterranean Muppets as they discover outer (outer) space for the first time.

“I went back through the canon of the original [1983 HBO] series and then our reboot [Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock for Apple TV], and I was like, ‘Wait, Uncle Matt never really questioned what’s beyond, because he thinks he’s done it all.’ He’s like, ‘Oh, I’ve explored outer space’—that’s what the Fraggles call our world, right? So he’s like, ‘I’ve done it,’” said John Tartaglia, the show’s director, writer, and choreographer as well as creative supervisor for Fraggle Rock at the Henson Company, in an interview with collectSPACE.com.

“So for him to have his mind blown that there’s something even beyond that, I thought that was such a fun way to push that character’s journey forward,” said Tartaglia.

To differentiate between the Fraggles’ use of “outer space&quot;—the land where the “silly creatures,” aka, us humans live—and our “outer space,” the show refers to the latter as “outer outer space.” (It is unclear if that concept will live on beyond the NASA show. “I think it could be,” Tartaglia said. “We haven’t explored that yet.” No pun intended.)

As Fraggle Rock: A Space-y Adventure opens, Gobo, Red, and their friends are still at home, and we “silly creatures” are at Kennedy Space Center. The trick, said Tartaglia, was finding ways to bridge that gap while staying true to both realities.

“We always want to stay true to the world,” said Tartaglia. “You have to justify why the Fraggles are there.”

The Doozers offered one way. The show’s small, green, industrious creatures are, in their more modern incarnations, technologically adept and have developed DoozerCam, a FaceTime-like video call system that is able to connect Fraggle Rock with outer space.

As the show opens, the DoozerCam shows the Fraggles in the midst of a familiar scene—the title sequence from the show, complete with their theme song—until they notice the audience of humans watching them.

“NASA, wisely, really wanted people to immediately get into that vibe of Fraggle Rock,” Tartaglia told collectSPACE. “We could have just written a show where it all takes place at Kennedy Space Center, but I think people really want to peek in and see Fraggle Rock, so it just felt like the appropriate, rule-based way to do it that felt right to the world, but also kept Fraggle Rock a cool, distant mystery place that you want to go visit.”

But to really bring the Fraggles to Kennedy required a postcard… and a change of scale.

In the series, Traveling Matt wrote about what he had encountered in outer space through postcards that he sent to his nephew, Gobo, back at Fraggle Rock. Gobo would then share his uncle’s adventures with his friends, including Red, who particularly loathed them.

In Fraggle Rock: A Space-y Adventure, a postcard with a photo of a “cookie” leads Traveling Matt, Gobo, and Red through a “Fraggle hole” to Kennedy Space Center. It is there that they meet a representative of NASA’s Exploration Ground Systems (EGS) division and learn of outer outer space and that the cookie is really the Moon.

(Asked why Traveling Matt would not have recognized the Moon from his time in outer space, Tartaglia said that perhaps he did see it, but only as a thin crescent, and did not equate the two. Or maybe it was that he was “so forward-driven” that he never bothered to look up.)

As Gobo, Red, and Traveling Matt step through the Fraggle hole onto the stage at Kennedy, they are no longer hand-operated puppets but full-body “walk-around” characters. And to remain to scale, that meant up-scaling another character, too.

“When we scaled up the Fraggles to be costume-size, so they could dance and move without being encumbered by being just puppets, we realized that one of the Doozers would have to become puppet-size. That was really fun to do because the real Doozers are six inches tall, and they are animatronic. They’re teeny, and now they get to have their glory as hand puppets,” said Tartaglia, who also voices Gobo for the show and performs as him when in puppet size.

When NASA first contacted the Jim Henson Company about bringing the Fraggles to the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, Tartaglia and his team knew it would be cool. And once they decided to have Uncle Traveling Matt be the show’s central character, the plot came together fairly quickly.

“He’s a great character to learn from because he is so oblivious, and he thinks he knows everything, and he really doesn’t. So he’s a great character to use as a bridge for the audience to be able to learn all these awesome facts and figures about NASA,” said Tartaglia.

He and his team also came to appreciate how much Fraggle Rock shares with the space agency, its activities, and goals.

“We all started talking and realized really quickly that Fraggles and Doozers and the whole message of Fraggle Rock—especially about Uncle Matt—is about exploring new worlds, making discoveries, and the whole fragile ecosystem. All of these different worlds need each other and want to work to learn more about each other. It sounded all very aligned with what NASA does and the whole purpose of space exploration,” said Tartaglia.

“So our two worlds that on paper wouldn’t seem connected, made a lot of sense to connect,” he said.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Brussels has warned TikTok that its endlessly scrolling feeds may breach Europe’s new content rules, as regulators press ahead with efforts to rein in the social effects of big online platforms.

In preliminary findings issued on Friday, the European Commission said it believed the group had failed to adequately assess and mitigate the risks posed by addictive design features that could harm users’ physical and mental wellbeing, particularly children and other vulnerable groups.

The warning marks one of the most advanced tests yet of the EU’s Digital Services Act, which requires large online platforms to identify and curb systemic risks linked to their products.

By constantly “rewarding” users with new content, TikTok’s design fuels the urge to keep scrolling and shift the brain of users into “autopilot mode,” the Commission said.

“Social media addiction can have detrimental effects on the developing minds of children and teens,” said Henna Virkkunen, the EU’s tech chief. “In Europe, we enforce our legislation to protect our children and our citizens online.”

If the provisional conclusions are confirmed, the social media platform could be fined up to 6 percent of its global turnover.

TikTok said: “The Commission’s preliminary findings present a categorically false and entirely meritless depiction of our platform, and we will take whatever steps are necessary to challenge these findings through every means available to us.”

TikTok is owned by China’s ByteDance, although a recent deal with the Trump administration will spin off its US arm into a joint venture majority owned by American investors. The venture will provide data and algorithm security, while ByteDance will retain control of the app’s main business lines in the US, including ecommerce, advertising, and marketing.

European watchdogs have previously taken action against TikTok for breaking the bloc’s digital rules. Last year, Irish regulators issued a 530 million euro fine against TikTok for sending users’ data to China, while Brussels has also probed its online advertising practices.

The EU’s move on Friday comes as other nations move closer to social media bans for teenagers.

Earlier this week, Spain was the latest country to announce it will stop access to social media for children under the age of 16 to curb the potentially harmful impact of online content on young people.

France and the UK are also considering similar measures, following the lead of Australia, which in December became the first country in the world to ban under-16s from holding accounts for 10 apps deemed to be potentially harmful to teenagers and children.

            <h2>Investors Concerned AI Bubble Is Finally Popping</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For quite some time now, investors have fought the suggestion that the artificial intelligence industry may be forming a massive bubble, risking an eventual collapse of epic proportions that could take down the US economy with it.

But shaking off those fears has proven increasingly difficult as the tech stock market reels from a major selloff this week.

Amazon shares tumbled nine percent Friday morning after claiming that its spending would hit an astronomical $200 billion this year as part of its efforts to keep up in the ongoing AI race. Shares are down over eight percent over the last five days, indicating it’s not just a blip.

Microsoft has been hit hard lately as well, with shares also plunging almost eight percent over the last five days, following its biggest single-day loss since the pandemic last week.

Other tech companies, including AI chipmaker Nvidia, Oracle, Alphabet, and Meta, all saw their shares drop significantly this week as they indicated they remained committed to spending vast sums to scale up their AI infrastructure investments.

As CNBC reports, around $1.35 trillion in valuations has been wiped out as Big Tech companies committed to spending a total of $660 billion this year alone, a “breathtaking” figure, as AllianceBernstein head Jim Tierney told the Financial Times.

But it doesn’t take much reading between the lines to figure out that investors are becoming incredibly antsy about those enormous spending plans. A short-term return on investment for AI-focused infrastructure buildouts is certainly out of the question as tech leaders continue to reassure them that it will all be worth it in the end.

The selloff could mark the beginning of a much larger downturn, analysts fear.

“Questions over the extent of [capital expenditures] as a result of LLM build-outs, the eventual return on that, and the fear of eventual over-expansion of capacity will be persistent,” GAM Investments investment director Paul Markham told CNBC.

With its $200 billion spending target, a significant 56 percent increase over last year, Amazon has positioned itself as the biggest spender. Yet the stock tumble indicates it’s not what investors wanted to hear.

“We have suddenly gone from the fear that you cannot be last, to investors questioning every single angle in this AI race,” Quilter Cheviot consumer discretionary analyst Mamta Valechha.

Further adding credence to the theory that investors are getting spooked by the enormous amount of money companies are continuing to pour into AI is Apple, whose far more muted approach appears to have paid off — with its shares instead up a whopping seven percent since Monday.

“The market is rethinking its approach to AI,” M&G chief investment officer for equities Fabiana Fedeli told the FT, arguing that investors are “a lot more selective in which companies [they] will decide to bet on.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">US employers announced over 108,000 layoffs across January, in the highest to start the year since the depths of the Great Recession in 2009. Many executives were quick to blame AI for the layoffs, though the real reason might be simpler: companies just aren’t optimistic about the direction the economy is heading.

According to new reporting by CNBC, layoffs are up 118 percent from January, 2025, and a whopping 205 percent compared to December 2025. Throughout the month, US corporations tracked by analyst firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas only reported 5,306 new hires — another low which hadn’t been seen since January of 2009.

“Generally, we see a high number of job cuts in the first quarter, but this is a high total for January,” Andy Challenger, chief revenue officer at the analytics firm, told CNBC. “It means most of these plans were set at the end of 2025, signaling employers are less-than-optimistic about the outlook for 2026.”

The horrid numbers come as tech companies announce plans to dump more money into AI than ever before. Earlier this week, Google’s parent company Alphabet announced it would double its AI capital expenditures from the $90 billion it spent in 2025 to as much as $185 billion, per the New York Times.

With so much hope for AI’s future, it’s no wonder many commentators and businesses titans have blamed the tech for the bone-dry job market. Yet as the market research firm Forrester explained in its January labor report, the “job apocalypse” is way overblown.

“Many companies announcing AI-related layoffs do not have mature, vetted AI applications ready to fill those roles, highlighting a trend of ‘AI washing’ — attributing financially motivated cuts to future AI implementation,” the report read.

In fact, some companies’ financial woes might actually be the result of AI-washing in previous years. As Forrester puts it, “over-automating roles due to the hype surrounding AI can lead to costly pullbacks, damaged reputations, and weakened employee experiences.”

So while the job market might be struggling, resist the knee-jerk temptation to blame AI. We’re not living in the cyberpunk dystopia yet — just the age-old grind of an all-too-familiar capitalist economy.

            <div id="article-text">Mainstream cryptocurrency Bitcoin is being eviscerated this week. The token tanked to a historic low, coming eerily close to as little as $60,000 on Thursday evening. That’s well under 50 percent down from its all-time high a mere four months ago.

While the crypto has since bounced back to around the $68,000 mark, it comes at a grim cost: it’s now wiped out all of its gains since president Donald Trump won the presidential election in late 2025.

Analysts aren’t presumably hopeful about an imminent recovery, with some expecting the absolute worst.

“Our BTC price target is 0.0,” Pivotus Partners chief market strategist and partner Richard Farr tweeted. “That’s not just for shock factor. It’s where the math takes us.”

Farr said he concurred with Michael Burry, who famously shorted the US housing market before its collapse in 2008, and recently warned in a Substack post that further losses for Bitcoin could result in a “death spiral.”

Farr pointed to Bitcoin following similar trends to a larger US stock downturn, suggesting it’s no longer the safe haven it was once claimed to be, arguing that it operates as a “speculative instrument correlated to the Nasdaq” instead.

The crypto bear argued that “no serious central bank will ever own something where Michael Saylor controls the float,” referring to the CEO of Strategy, the largest corporate Bitcoin treasury.

Farr also criticized the token for being damaging to the environment, as mining it requires copious amounts of energy and water.

“Nothing ‘green’ about this ‘coin,&#39;” Farr wrote mockingly. “We think it’s a zero.”

In a follow-up post on LinkedIn, Farr argued that worsening US jobs numbers could cause even more money to “come out of speculative assets, than in,” which led him to feel “increasingly emboldened” about his zero-dollar call.

He also pointed to crypto miners, who were already squeezed by winter storms driving up electricity prices, being forced to close up shop amid the crash.

“We think we are only in the early innings of the crypto correction,” Farr wrote.

In his Substack post, Burry noted that a recent crash in gold prices — following a historic surge — appeared to be linked to Bitcoin’s ongoing demise.

As people continue to gamble on gold futures, Burry argued that “physical metals may break from the trend on safe haven demand,” triggering a “death spiral”-like collapse.

Considering Bitcoin’s enormous swings over the last couple of months, it’s likely not the end of the ride for the infamously volatile digital token.

Farr clearly isn’t alone in predicting further losses.

“This steady selling in our view signals that traditional investors are losing interest, and overall pessimism about crypto is growing,” Deutsche Bank analyst Marion Laboure wrote in a note to clients, as quoted by CNBC.

“Bitcoin isn’t trading on hype anymore, the story has lost a bit of that plot, it is trading on pure liquidity and capital flows,” FG Nexus CEO of digital assets Maja Vujinovic added.

            <h2>It Turns Out That When Waymos Are Stumped, They Get Intervention From Workers in the Philippines</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-06</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Waymo has established itself as the autonomous ride-hailing service to beat, operating a fleet of several thousand self-driving taxis across the United States, with active services in ten major metropolitan areas.

That “self-driving” may be due for some extra scrutiny, though. During a Congressional hearing on Wednesday, Waymo’s chief safety officer, Mauricio Peña, was grilled over the company’s use of Chinese-made vehicles and reliance on overseas workers, as Business Insider reports.

The stakes and public safety implications are considerable. The news comes roughly a week after a Waymo robotaxi struck and injured a child near a Santa Monica, California, elementary school, triggering a federal probe.

After being pressed for a breakdown on where these overseas operators operate, Peña said he didn’t have those stats, explaining that some operators live in the US, but others live much further away, including in the Philippines.

“They provide guidance,” he argued. “They do not remotely drive the vehicles. Waymo asks for guidance in certain situations and gets an input, but the Waymo vehicle is always in charge of the dynamic driving tasks, so that is just one additional input.”

The admission didn’t sit well with senator Ed Markey (D-MA), who argued that “having people overseas influencing American vehicles is a safety issue.”

“The information the operators receive could be out of date. It could introduce tremendous cybersecurity vulnerabilities,” he argued. “We don’t know if these people have US driver’s licenses.”

“It’s one thing when a taxi is replaced by an Uber or a Lyft,” Markey concluded. “It’s another thing when the jobs just go completely overseas.”

In a statement to Futurism, a Waymo spokesperson said that its fleet response teams are “located in the US and abroad” and are “required to have a passenger car or van license, and are reviewed for records of traffic violations, infractions, and driving-related convictions.”

“Additionally, they are routinely, randomly screened for drug use, and are put through thorough criminal background checks in addition to evaluations of their driving records,” the spokesperson added.

Waymo has been fairly upfront about its human operators. In a May 2024 blog post, the company compared it to a “phone-a-friend.”

“When the Waymo vehicle encounters a particular situation on the road, the autonomous driver can reach out to a human fleet response agent for additional information to contextualize its environment,” the post reads. “The Waymo Driver [software] does not rely solely on the inputs it receives from the fleet response agent and it is in control of the vehicle at all times.”

In case the car’s driving software encounters something atypical, it may choose to send a request to a human fleet response agent, who then can help out by viewing real-time feeds from the vehicle’s exterior cameras.

While that may sound like the remote operator isn’t directly controlling the vehicle’s driving responses, it nonetheless goes to show how autonomous vehicles still rely substantially on human intellect. Fleet response agents may determine what lane a vehicle should pick, or propose a “path for the vehicle to consider,” as the blog post explains.

Put simply, the remote agent may not control the steering wheel, but they still make major decisions on where the vehicle navigates next.

During the same hearing, Tesla’s VP of vehicle engineering Lars Moravy told lawmakers that Tesla’s vehicles also rely on similar remote operators.

“We have many layers of security within our system and, similar to what Dr. Peña said, our driving controls, go, stop, steer, are in a core embedded central layer that cannot be accessed from outside the vehicle,” he said.

Moravy also argued that to stop anybody from taking control of vehicles, the company “actively participates in hacking events, trying paying people to try to get into our vehicles.”

The executives’ remarks are the latest illustration of how driverless taxis navigating public roads today are still far from being 100 percent autonomous. Tesla, in particular, has been playing it safe, quietly pausing its “unsupervised” robotaxi rides last week, meaning that there currently don’t appear to be any robotaxis with no human “safety monitor” in the driver’s seat.

It’s an especially glaring subject as lawmakers continue to ponder the risks of having autonomous vehicles coexist with human drivers on the road. And given the latest data, those risks remain substantial, with new National Highway Traffic Safety Administration data suggesting Tesla’s robotaxis are crashing three times as much as humans — even with human monitors.

Adding the influence of an entirely separate third party, a remote assistance operator who’s based overseas, could be a recipe for disaster, according to Markey, a glaring safety gap that needs to be filled.

“Overseas remote assistance operations may be more susceptible to physical takeover by hostile actors, potentially granting them driver-like control of thousands of vehicles transporting passengers on American roads,” he said in a statement. “Heavy and fast-moving vehicles could quickly become the weapons of foreign actors seeking to harm innocent Americans.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For a guy who keeps insisting he’s totally innocent of any accusations of wrongdoing with Jeffrey Epstein, Elon Musk’s name sure turns up a whole lot in the deceased sex criminal’s emails.

Now, internet sleuths have turned up more bizarre communications from Epstein that adds to the evidence that Musk had a much closer relationship to the convicted sex criminal than he let on.

In a September 2012 exchange with someone named “Kira D,” Epstein appears to be arranging some kind of massage for the Tesla and SpaceX CEO, who he stylized as “elon MUSK,” possibly to signify the entrepreneur’s perceived importance.

“perfect!!! let me know execly what he wants, will organize all) x,” Kira D responded in a typo-clad email.

Epstein then replies he left a voicemail with a person whose name has been redacted to see if they “want to do massage.”

In another exchange just one day later with an unknown recipient, Epstein reveals that Musk is supposed to come over to his house.

“where are you. is there anything cute ,, for you or for me? elon musk is coming to lunch at house. . so you will have time,” Epstein wrote, cryptically.

The unknown recipient replies that a redacted person “is ready with the girls.”

“They are going to electric room soon. I m thinking of leaving soon to meet them there… Talked to elan, he was looking at me,” they continued, possibly referring to Musk. “But his wife was hanging on him,” before adding that someone was bringing five girls “to the club.”

That September, email exchanges directly between Musk and Epstein showed that Epstein had invited Musk to his island. Musk responded, “Sounds good. I will try to make it.”

That exchange, as well as dozens of others, revealed that Musk had communicated extensively with Epstein, and not only accepted invitations to his island, but on some occasions asked to be invited. Musk also begged Epstein to let him attend one of his parties, and even asked “What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?”

Taken together, they poke gigantic holes in Musk’s long held insistence that he only met Epstein once at his Manhattan home and declined invitations to his island. Epstein also invited Musk to other events, including a dinner with Woody Allen, the influential filmmaker and actor who’s also been accused of child sex abuse.

Who Kira D is isn’t immediately clear. But in other emails contained in the newly released files, Kira communicated with Epstein about procuring young girls and models. “i might have another FANTASTIC girl from Minsk,” she wrote in an August 2012 email to Epstein. “problem is she is 18 on sept 29… amazing girl.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Bitcoin is crashing hard, reaching historic lows of well below the $70,000 mark. At the time of writing, the token is hovering just above $63,000, levels we haven’t seen since October 2024.

The ongoing plunge has made it far less economical to mine the digital token, a notoriously compute- and energy-intensive process — to the point that large-scale computing companies are starting to unplug their equipment, as Bloomberg reports.

As prices continue to plummet and electricity costs climb, it’s become tough out there for a crypto miner. The hash price index, which is used to determine how much revenue miners can make by mining crypto, reached its lowest point on record this week, according to mining services company Luxor Technology.

According to Coindesk, the average cost to mine one Bitcoin is currently around $87,000 — far higher than its current going rate, making it an extremely unprofitable proposition.

It’s a massive wipeout as investors continue to sell off their reserves, with some comparing it to the time China banned crypto mining in 2021. Crypto enthusiasts are expecting the worst, with some predicting the token will nosedive to just $30,000.

“The decrease is historic, the largest since the China ban,” mining company CleanSpark chief business officer Harry Sudock told Bloomberg, explaining that winter storms raising electricity prices, combined with a recent broader tech selloff, were likely to blame.

Turning off mining hardware during extreme weather conditions or surges in prices isn’t unheard of — but given the crypto’s ongoing demise, a far rarer situation is playing out.

While the extremely volatile cryptocurrency has been put through the wringer on several occasions over the years, the decline comes at a striking moment.

As CNN points out, crypto is hailed as a safe haven by its proponents. Given geopolitical turmoil and plenty of economic uncertainty, crypto’s price should’ve instead skyrocketed — yet precious metals, most notably gold, have fared well while Bitcoin has crashed. The value of an ounce of gold reached an all-time high late last year as investors looked for much safer bets than volatile cryptocurrencies. (Gold prices have since lurched down, but stabilized around a considerably higher price than before the rally.)

The investor Michael Burry, who famously shorted the US housing market before its collapse in 2008, argued in a Substack post this week that further selloffs could lead to a “death spiral” for the broader economy that could be difficult to recover from.

“There is no organic use case reason for Bitcoin to slow or stop its descent,” he wrote.

Even gold could fall victim to the recent downturn as “physical metals may break from the trend on safe haven demand,” Burry speculated, if “tokenized metals futures” were to collapse.

Instead of mining crypto, companies are starting to pivot, according to Bloomberg, allocating their hardware to powering AI models instead of mining crypto.

Whether that will turn out to be a safer bet as investors are starting to get cold feet over AI as well? That remains to be seen.

            <h2>Here’s how Roblox’s age checks work</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/06/heres-how-robloxs-age-checks-work/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A month after introducing mandatory facial verification for access to chats on its platform, Roblox says 45% of its daily active users have undergone age checks as of January 31.

Roblox’s launch of age checks followed a wave of lawsuits over child safety, including ones from the attorneys general of Texas, Kentucky, and Louisiana. The lawsuits were filed in response to reports that Roblox was exposing young users to dangerous risks, such as grooming and explicit content.

To complete the age-check process, users have to open the Roblox app, allow access to their camera, and follow a series of on-screen instructions for facial verification. Once the age check is processed, Roblox says it deletes any images or videos of users. The verification is processed by a third-party vendor, Persona, which also deletes images and videos after completing the process, Roblox says.

Once users complete an age check, they can access age-based chat, which means they can only communicate with others in a similar age group. There are six age groups: under 9, 9 to 12, 13 to 15, 16 to 17, 18 to 20, and 21 plus. Users in each age group can chat with people in the groups directly above and below theirs. For example, users in the 9-12 category can chat with people in their own group, as well as those in the under 9 and 13-15 groups.

If the age-check process incorrectly estimates a user’s age, they can appeal the decision and verify their age through alternative methods, including ID verification or through parental controls that allow parents to update their child’s age.

The company said during its Q4 2025 earnings release this week that age-checked data reveals a younger user base than self-reported data. This isn’t surprising, and even Roblox itself said it expected this outcome. Of the 45% of users who have undergone age checks, 35% are under 13, 38% are between the ages of 13 and 17, and 27% are over 18.

As the company rolled out the new process, some concerns were raised around particular loopholes. For instance, Wired reported that eBay had listings for age-verified Roblox accounts for minors as young as nine years old. Even though eBay has removed the listings, concerns remain that predators could access accounts posing as minors by tricking the system.

Roblox’s senior director of product policy, Eliza Jacobs, told TechCrunch on Friday that the company has continuous age check systems running in the background to address these concerns and prevent this type of abuse.

Jacobs said the platform looks to see if “there are any signals on your account that indicate that the age that we now have on that account is not consistent with the activity on that account. Whether that’s the kinds of games you’re playing, or who you’re talking to. We also have key stroke analysis. The way adults type is different from the way kids type. So [we have] lots of systems running in the background to ensure that the age is accurate to the person actually using the account. And if we have any reason to believe that it’s not accurate, we will introduce additional checks to make sure that we have it right.”

She noted that another way Roblox looks for age accuracy is by looking at how a person uses emojis. Older generations tend to use emojis at the end of sentences as punctuation, while younger people often place them in the middle of sentences, Jacobs explained.

In addition to using age checks to make its platform safer, Roblox CEO and co-founder David Baszucki said during the company’s earnings call that the data collected as a result of these checks will be used to grow revenue.

“We have been able to find a bigger growth opportunity in the 18-plus demographic than previously assumed,” Baszucki said. “We estimate our 18 and over cohort is growing at over 50%, and this cohort monetizes 40% higher than younger cohorts.”

He went on to say that Roblox is optimizing its platform to facilitate the growth of high-revenue genres popular with older users, such as shooters, RPGs, sports, and racing.

Roblox says it will continue to enhance its safety measures to respond to evolving risks and user needs.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/06/senator-who-has-repeatedly-warned-about-secret-u-s-government-surveillance-sounds-new-alarm-over-cia-activities/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A senior Democratic lawmaker with knowledge of some of the U.S. government’s most secretive operations has said he has “deep concerns” about certain activities by the Central Intelligence Agency.

The two-line letter written by Sen. Ron Wyden, the longest serving member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, does not disclose the nature of the CIA’s activities or the senator’s specific concerns. But the letter follows a pattern in recent years in which Wyden has publicly hinted at wrongdoing or illegality within the federal government, sometimes referred to as the “Wyden siren.”

In a statement (via WSJ’s Dustin Volz), the CIA said it was “ironic but unsurprising that Senator Wyden is unhappy,” calling it a “badge of honor.”

When reached by TechCrunch, a spokesperson for Wyden’s staff was unable to comment as the matter was classified.

Tasked with oversight of the intelligence community, Wyden is one of a few lawmakers who is allowed to read highly classified information about ongoing government surveillance, including cyber and other intelligence operations. But as the programs are highly secretive, Wyden is barred from sharing details of what he knows with anyone else, including most other lawmakers, except for a handful of Senate staff with security clearance.

As such, Wyden, a known privacy hawk, has become one of the few key members of Congress whose rare but outspoken words on intelligence and surveillance matters are closely watched by civil liberties groups.

Over the past few years, Wyden has subtly sounded the alarm on several occasions in which he has construed a secret ruling or intelligence gathering method as unlawful or unconstitutional.

In 2011, Wyden said that the U.S. government was relying on a secret interpretation of the Patriot Act, which he said — without disclosing the nature of his concerns — created a “gap between what the public thinks the law says and what the American government secretly thinks the law says.”

Two years later, then-NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed that the National Security Agency was relying on its secret interpretation of the Patriot Act to force U.S. phone companies, including Verizon, to turn over the call records of hundreds of millions of Americans on an ongoing basis.

Since then, Wyden has sounded the alarm on how the U.S. government collects the contents of people’s communications; revealed that the Justice Department barred Apple and Google from disclosing that federal authorities had been secretly demanding the contents of their customer’s push notifications; and said an unclassified report that CISA has refused to release contains “shocking details” about national security threats facing U.S. phone companies.

As noted by Techdirt’s Mike Masnick, we may not know yet for what reason Wyden sounded the siren about the CIA’s activities, but that every time Wyden has warned, he has also been vindicated.

            <h2>The Kindle Scribe Colorsoft is a pricey but pretty e-ink color tablet with AI features</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you primarily want a tablet device to mark up, highlight, and annotate your e-books and documents, and perhaps sometimes scribble some notes, Amazon’s new Kindle Scribe Colorsoft could be worth the hefty investment. For everyone else, it’s probably going to be hard to justify the cost of the 11-inch, $630+ e-ink tablet with a writeable color display.

However, if you were already leaning toward the 11-inch $549.99 Kindle Scribe — which also has a paper-like display but no color — you may as well throw in the extra cash at that point and get the Colorsoft version, which starts at $629.99.

At these price points, both the Scribe and Scribe Colorsoft are what we’d dub unnecessary luxuries for most, especially compared with the more affordable traditional Kindle ($110) or Kindle Paperwhite ($160).

Announced in December, the Fig color version just began shipping on January 28, 2026, and is available for $679.99 with 64GB.

Clearly, Amazon hopes to carve out a niche in the tablet market with these upgraded Kindle devices, which compete more with e-ink tablets like reMarkable than with other Kindles. But high-end e-ink readers with pens aren’t going to deliver Amazon a large audience. Meanwhile, nearly everyone can potentially justify the cost of an iPad because of its numerous capabilities, including streaming video, drawing, writing, using productivity tools, and the thousands of supported native apps and games.

The Scribe Colorsoft, meanwhile, is designed to cater to a very specific type of e-book reader or worker. This type of device could be a good fit for students and researchers, as well as anyone else who regularly needs to mark up files or documents.

Someone particularly interested in making to-do lists or keeping a personal journal might also appreciate the device, but it would have to get daily use to justify this price.

The device is easy enough to use, with a Home screen design similar to other Kindles, offering quick access to your notes and library, and even suggestions of books you can write in, like Sudoku or crossword puzzle books or drawing guides. Your Library titles and book recommendations pop in color, which makes it easier to find a book with a quick scan.

Spec-wise, Amazon says this newer 2025 model is 40% faster when turning pages or writing. We did find the tablet responsive here, as page turns felt snappy and writing flowed easily.

Despite its larger size, the device is thin and light, at 5.4 mm (0.21 inches) and 400 g (0.88 pounds), so it won’t weigh down your bag the way an iPad or other tablet would (the iPad mini, with an 8.3-inch screen, weighs slightly less). You could easily stand to carry the Kindle Scribe in your purse or tote, assuming you sport a bag that can fit an 11-inch screen. Compared with the original Colorsoft, we like that the Scribe Colorsoft’s bezel is the same size around the screen.

The Kindle Scribe Colorsoft features a glare-free, oxide-based e-ink display with a textured surface that makes it feel a lot like writing on paper. This helps with the transition to a digital device for those used to writing notes by hand. It also saves on battery life — the device can go up to 8 weeks between charges.

Helpfully, the display automatically adapts its brightness to your current lighting conditions, and you can opt to adjust the screen for more warmth when reading at night. But although it is a touchscreen, it’s less responsive than an LCD or OLED touchscreen, like those on iPad devices. That means when you perform a gesture, like pinching to resize the font, there’s a bit of a lag.

Like any Kindle, you can read e-books or PDFs on the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft tablet. You can also import Word documents and other files from Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive directly to your device, or use the Send to Kindle option. (Supported file types include PDF, DOC/DOCX, TXT, RTF, HTM, HTML, PNG, GIF, JPG/JPEG, BMP, and EPUB.) Your Notebooks on the device can be exported to Microsoft OneNote, as well.

The included pen comes with some trade-offs. Unlike the Apple Pencil, the Kindle’s Premium Pen doesn’t require charging, which is a perk. It has also been designed to mimic the feel of writing on paper, and it glides fairly well across the screen. Without a flat side to charge, the rounded pen doesn’t have the same feel and grip as the Apple Pencil. It’s smoother, so it could slip in your hand.

Amazon’s design also requires you to replace the pen tips from time to time, depending on your use, as they can wear down. It’s not terribly expensive to do so — a 10 pack is around $17 — but it’s another thing to keep up with and manage.

There are 10 different pen colors and five highlight colors included, so your notes and annotations can be fairly colorful.

When writing, you can choose between a pen, a fountain pen, a marker, or a pencil with different stroke widths, depending on your preferences. You can set your favorite pen tool as a shortcut, which is enabled with a press and hold on the pen’s side button. (By default, it’s set to highlight.) If you grip your pen tightly and accidentally trigger this button, you’ll be glad to know you can shut this feature off.

The writing experience itself feels natural. And while the e-ink display means the colors are somewhat muted, which not everyone likes, it works well enough for its purpose. An e-ink tablet isn’t really the best for making digital art, despite its pens and new shader tool, but it is good for writing, taking notes, and highlighting.

From the Kindle’s Home screen, you can either jump directly into writing something down through the Quick Notes feature, or you can get more organized by creating a Notebook from the Workspace tab.

The Notebook offers a wide variety of notepad templates, allowing you to choose between blank, narrow, medium, or wide-ruled documents. There are templates for meeting notes, storyboards, habit trackers, monthly planners, music sheets, graph paper, checklists, daily planners, dotted sheets, and much more. (New templates with this device include Meeting Notes, Cornell Notes, Legal Pad, and College Rule options.)

It’s fun that you can erase things just by flipping the pen over to use the soft-tipped eraser, as you would with a No. 2 pencil. Of course, a precision erasing tool is available from the toolbar with different widths, if needed. Thanks to the e-ink screen, you can sometimes still see a faint ghost of your drawing or writing on the screen after erasing, but this fades after a bit (which may drive the more particular types crazy).

There’s a Lasso tool to circle things and move them around, copy or paste, or resize, but this probably won’t be used as much by more casual notetakers.

There are some other handy features for those who do a lot of annotating, too.

For instance, when you’re writing in a Word document or book, a feature called Active Canvas creates space for your notes. As you write directly in the book on top of the text, the sentence will move and wrap around your note. Even if you adjust the font size of what you’re reading, the note stays anchored to the text it originally referenced. I prefer this to writing directly in e-books, as things stay more organized, but others disagree.

In documents where margins expand, you can tap the expandable margin icon at the top of the left or right margin to take your notes in the margin, instead of on the page itself.

The new Kindle also includes a number of AI tools and features.

The device will neaten up your scribbles and automatically straighten your highlighting and underlining. A couple of times, the highlighting action caused our review unit to freeze, but it recovered after returning to the Home screen with a press of the side button.

Meanwhile, a new AI feature (look for the sparkle icon at the top left of the screen) lets you both summarize text and refine your handwriting. The latter, oddly, doesn’t let you switch to a typed font but will let you pick between a small handful of handwritten fonts (Cadia, Florio, Sunroom, and Notewright) via the Customize button.

The AI tool was not perfect. It could decipher some terrible scrawls, but it did get stumped when there was another scribble on the page alongside the text. Still, it’s a nice option to have if you can’t write well after years of typing, but like the feel of handwriting things and the more analog vibe.

The AI search feature can also look across your notebooks to find notes or make connections between them. To search, you either tap the on-screen keyboard or toggle the option to handwrite your search query, which is converted to text. You can interact with the search results (the AI-powered insights) by way of the Ask Notebooks AI feature, which lets you query against your notes.

Soon, Amazon will add other AI features, too, including an “Ask This Book” feature that lets you highlight a passage and then get spoiler-free answers to a question you have — like a character’s motive, scene significance, or other plot detail. Another feature, “Story So Far,” will help you catch up on the book you’re reading if you’ve taken a break, but again without any spoilers.

The Kindle Scribe Colorsoft comes in Graphite (Black) with either 32GB or 64GB of storage for $629.99 or $679.99, respectively. The Fig version is only available at $679.99 with 64GB of storage. Cases for the Scribe Colorsoft are an additional $139.99.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/06/eu-tiktok-disable-addictive-features-infinite-scroll-recommendation-engine/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The European Commission on Friday accused TikTok of purposefully designing its app to be “addictive,” calling out features such as infinite scroll, autoplay, and push notifications, as well as its recommendation engine.

In preliminary findings from an investigation that sought to determine TikTok’s compliance with the European Union’s far-reaching Digital Services Act, the Commission said the short video platform did not “adequately assess” how its design decisions could harm the well-being of its users, particularly minors and vulnerable adults.

The EU’s executive arm said the company disregarded “important indicators of compulsive use of the app” like the time users spend at night and how often users open it.

“By constantly ‘rewarding’ users with new content, certain design features of TikTok fuel the urge to keep scrolling and shift the brain of users into ‘autopilot mode.’ Scientific research shows that this may lead to compulsive behaviour and reduce users’ self-control,” the Commission wrote in a statement.

The Commission said TikTok must change the “basic design” of its user interface by disabling features like infinite scroll, implementing screen time breaks, and changing its recommendation system.

“The Commission’s preliminary findings present a categorically false and entirely meritless depiction of our platform, and we will take whatever steps are necessary to challenge these findings through every means available to us,” a TikTok spokesperson said in an emailed statement.

TikTok does offer screen-time management tools and parental controls, but the European Commission said those tools don’t do enough to reduce the risks of its addictive design. “The time management tools do not seem to be effective in enabling users to reduce and control their use of TikTok because they are easy to dismiss and introduce limited friction. Similarly, parental controls may not be effective because they require additional time and skills from parents to introduce the controls,” the Commission wrote.

The allegations against TikTok come as social media platforms deal with heightened scrutiny around the world, with some governments pushing to ban young users from accessing social media altogether. In November, Australia mandated social media sites to deactivate accounts belonging to users under 16, and the U.K. and Spain are reportedly looking into similar measures. France, Denmark, Italy, and Norway have worked on similar age-restriction measures for social media platforms, and in the United States, 24 states have so far enacted age-verification laws.

TikTok recently settled a major social media addiction lawsuit in the U.S., and it now has time to reply to the European Commission’s preliminary findings. Confirmed breaches of the DSA can face a range of major sanctions, including fines of up to 6% of global annual turnover.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Norwegian government has accused the Chinese-backed hacking group known as Salt Typhoon of breaking into several organizations in the country.

In a report published on Friday, the Norwegian Police Security Service said the hacking group, believed to be working for the Chinese government, targeted vulnerable network devices to conduct espionage.

Norway is the latest country to confirm a Salt Typhoon-related intrusion.

Salt Typhoon, which senior U.S. national security officials have described as an “epoch-defining threat,” has for years stealthily hacked into the networks of critical infrastructure organizations around the world, including telecom providers in Canada and the United States, where they allegedly intercepted the communications of senior politicians. This series of breaches put pressure on telcos to improve their security.

The report did not provide many details about the hacking campaign targeting the country. A spokesperson for Norway’s embassy in the U.S. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Spotify is rolling out a new “About the Song” feature that lets users explore the stories behind the music they’re listening to, the company announced on Friday. The feature displays short story cards that users can swipe through and rate with a thumbs-up or thumbs-down.

These short, swipeable stories are summarized from third-party sources to highlight interesting details and behind-the-scenes moments, the company says.

With About the Song, Spotify is giving its users access to a feature that isn’t available on rival platforms like Apple Music.

The feature is rolling out in beta on mobile in English for premium users in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and Australia.

Users can access the new feature through the “Now Playing” screen by scrolling down to find the “About the Song” card on supported tracks, after which they can swipe through to explore the story behind the track.

“Music fans know the feeling: A song stops you in your tracks, and you immediately want to know more,” Spotify wrote in a blog post. “What inspired it, and what’s the meaning behind it? We believe that understanding the craft and context behind a song can deepen your connection to the music you love.”

It’s been a busy week for Spotify, as About the Song isn’t the only feature it’s announced in recent days.

Yesterday, the streaming service shared that users in the U.S. and the U.K. will soon be able to purchase physical copies of their favorite audiobooks directly through the app. Spotify also announced two new audiobook features, including “Page Match,” which lets users scan a page from a physical book to instantly transition to that spot in the audiobook, and “Audiobook Recaps.”

Earlier this week, the company made lyrics translations available worldwide and introduced the ability to view lyrics when offline for all users, not just premium subscribers. Spotify also moved the location of lyrics, as they will now appear directly beneath the album artwork or the short, looping video that plays alongside the music.

Earlier today, Spotify said it’s revamping its Developer Mode APIs, which developers use to test third-party applications. The changes include a mandatory premium account, a cap on the number of test users, and a limited set of API end points.

At least one fundamental human trait persists in the smartphone era: People seem to love a challenge. The internet teems with viral competitions, gamified health apps, and “life-maxxing” exercises of many kinds. Even those who resist the lure of screens—by, for instance, reading books—are frequently doing so with a kind of competitive zeal. A University of Pennsylvania professor has built a strict, rules-based classroom cult around reading. And this week in The Atlantic, Walt Hunter, who teaches English at Case Western Reserve University, wrote about his own attempt to buck alarming literacy trends by asking his students to read entire books.

First, here are four stories from The Atlantic’s Books section:

Hunter discovered that if you recalibrate a course to prioritize “developing a relationship” with authors and books (he eased up on writing assignments, for example), students will meet the challenge. After he swapped out short excerpts for full texts, his students “were reading everything, or most of it.” They proved it by identifying obscure passages without notes (and, because he quizzed them in the classroom, there wasn’t a chatbot within reach). Even more important, “they were experiencing life in a way that was not easy outside the class.” They were putting effort and time into a mental activity that scrolling on their phone couldn’t match.

This is a feel-mostly-good story, but how useful is Hunter’s experiment for those of us who don’t have anything except our own willpower standing between us and the algorithms? Such readers might find value in another Atlantic article this week, in which Bekah Waalkes recommends books that can be read between errands. Waalkes suggests an attitude shift that doesn’t force you to choose between setting strict reading goals and giving up altogether. “All you need,” she writes, “is a willingness to dedicate a few minutes a day, and maybe a few new habits.”

Hunter also describes reading as a feat of adult self-motivation. “You are not word-maxxing or optimizing information for efficiency,” he writes. “You are engaged in a singular practice, one with its own primary justification.” I like the word “practice,” because reading requires it, just like many other things grown-ups find fulfilling. We schedule activities—travel, socializing, cooking, exercise—so we can achieve everything we should do and everything we want to do (two categories that ideally overlap). With time, we get better at these things—and at finding a place for them in our life. So here’s my advice, if you need it: Schedule some reading time, wherever and whenever you can. Pick up one of Waalkes’s recommended books, or whatever you like. Set a timer, dive in, and find out what you&#39;re made of.

What I learned when I finally started assigning the hard reading again.

Like Austen’s other novels, Northanger Abbey contains a marriage plot. But it’s set apart from the rest of her work by a long, satirical section sending up gothic fiction and its fans. The book’s heroine, Catherine Morland, is an avid reader of the popular novels of the day, and has a specific fondness for Ann Radcliffe’s real-life 1794 best seller, The Mysteries of Udolpho, a tale of ghostly figures and hidden manuscripts. Catherine views herself as the hero of a similar story, and when she goes to the country house of a family she has befriended (the titular Northanger Abbey), she reinvents herself as the protagonist of a mystery. Austen is the master of depicting small faux pas, and Catherine commits many—she forces open cabinets in search of creepy documents; she begins to suspect that the family patriarch has murdered his wife. The chronic daydreamer can easily identify with Catherine’s near-delusional longing for something to happen beyond the courtships and evenings around the pianoforte that seem to make up the better part of her future.

With this week’s announcement of massive cuts at The Washington Post, the paper’s Book World supplement earned a dismal distinction: It may be the only newspaper book-review section to have been killed twice. The first time was in 2009, when papers across the country were slashing books coverage in an attempt to stave off budgetary apocalypse. So when the Post relaunched Book World in 2022, readers and writers reacted with the same mixture of amazement and trepidation inspired by the dinosaurs at Jurassic Park. The rebirth of a dead species was wonderful to see, but how would it end?

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/2026/02/this-is-where-the-serpent-lives-daniyal-mueenuddin-review/685884/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Books about masters and servants tend to come with an inborn flaw: They are written largely by those from the moneyed class, individuals who have seen the poor from above and must now, in their writing, illuminate their lives from within. This gap can sometimes be breached through immersive journalism of the kind championed by George Orwell in Down and Out in Paris and London or Barbara Ehrenreich in Nickel and Dimed. But such instances are rare, and even harder to achieve in countries like India or Pakistan—places with large domestic-worker populations where socioeconomic differences are so harshly inscribed that one can, more often than not, immediately infer a person’s status from their mannerisms and language.

This is what makes the work of the Pakistani American writer Daniyal Mueenuddin so special and surprising. Mueenuddin is a U.S.-educated descendant of a Pakistani feudal family; he spent years running an estate in rural Punjab. In his prize-winning fiction, though, he is somehow able to enter the lives of the servant class with the same gentleness and attention that he lavishes on the ultrarich. The concerns of drivers, retainers, maids, and cooks exist alongside the romantic problems of Paris-hopping Pakistanis with cocaine addictions in his justly acclaimed debut collection, In Other Rooms, Other Wonders, from 2009. Small details shine. Reading about, say, the family life of Nawabdin, an electrician “who flourished on a signature ability, a technique for cheating the electric company by slowing down the revolutions of electric meters,” one wonders: How does he know so much? How does he re-create the lives of those immured within a feudal system without reinforcing his own position through condescending, morose social realism?

Mueenuddin has cited the author Ivan Turgenev—himself an estate owner who captured the lives of both serfs and aristocrats in 19th-century Russia—as one of his inspirations. Turgenev, hampered by czarist censorship, did not write polemics about suffering serfs but instead created hyperrealist, idiosyncratic slices of life that would later inspire Ernest Hemingway. Turgenev’s stories, especially his 1852 collection, A Sportsman’s Notebook, indirectly led to the end of serfdom by humanizing the peasantry for Czar Alexander II. In short, Turgenev was the rare estate owner who listened.

Mueenuddin does the same in his latest work, This Is Where the Serpent Lives. His first book in 17 years and his debut novel, it is a feast of sustained noticing, despite an overarching flaw. One of the main strands in Serpent is based, according to an interview with The New Yorker, on the life of a swashbuckling driver employed for years by Mueenuddin’s father. His fictional driver, Yazid, is the moral center of the novel, described as “an ambling bear” with huge sideburns “moving to his own North.” As a young orphan, Yazid was a cook’s apprentice who emulated the rich schoolboys he served, intending to slowly insinuate himself into their class—only to be thwarted by a jealous, older maidservant.

Mueenuddin’s novel essentially comprises four novella-like storylines about grand landowning families and their employees in Pakistan from the 1950s to the present. Besides Yazid’s story, two short narratives follow reluctant feudal potentates. A final story, which takes up the majority of the novel, focuses on Yazid’s much younger protégé, Saqib, a servant boy of “fine sensibility and intelligence” who also seeks to join the upper class.

Read: What does the literature of the working class look like?

Mueenuddin’s novel suggests that there are moral costs to both the rich and the poor for living in a system that allows such little mobility. Wealthy characters verge on making reforms, then pull back at the slightest complication. In the process, they remain stuck within their “ordered purposeless” lives, as Mueenuddin wrote in his collection. The servants, meanwhile, who are “more fed than paid,” recognize that only the most brazen cheating and corruption can break them out of their squalid circumstances—the sort of corruption, of course, that has enabled the elite to thrive in a country where meaningful land reform never occurred and ancient inequalities persist. A novelist depicting both these classes must find an elegant way to integrate stories of inherited ennui and desperate striving. If Mueeneddin doesn’t entirely succeed, this is in part because the unyielding feudal order of Pakistan means that the lives of servants and masters rarely intersect in meaningful ways.

Saqib’s story captures the dilemma of the aspirant even more fiercely than Yazid’s does. “Respectful but not servile,” Saqib enters the good graces of his mistress, Shahnaz Atar, an intelligent woman who, “like most Lahori women of her class,” Mueenuddin writes, “battled constantly to find and train and keep household servants.” Saqib is entrusted with more and more responsibility as he grows up, eventually setting up an ambitious cucumber-farming scheme on the Atars’ estate in rural Punjab. He figures that it will take one careful, major act of corruption to finally ascend to the elite: “Each untrue mark that he inscribed” in the account books would be, Mueenuddin writes, “another step in his emancipation.” Alas, it is this choice that gets him into trouble and causes the fine web of relationships around him to crumble, throwing him violently back to his origins as the mere son of a gardener.

As in his story collection, Mueenuddin succeeds here in painting Yazid and Saqib and a host of secondary characters on the social ladder as distinct individuals, down to their faces and habits and family lives. He also shows how, at this late stage of history—in which Chinese smartphones, Western porn, and Facebook “confettied all over” the populace—the players are more aware than ever of their particular roles. Shahnaz, who grew up largely abroad, sees her position as mistress of an estate “through the lens of her Western politics and experience,” even studying the Russians, including Turgenev, to comprehend the complex social dynamics unfolding on her farm. Her husband’s cousin Rustom, who returns from America to take over his family’s land after his parents and grandfather die, finds himself tacitly okaying the beating of a worker from a rival estate. “What happened to college days and marching for justice in South Africa and in solidarity with ship workers in Poland?” he wonders. Meanwhile, Saqib carefully observes the behavior of his masters, the Atars, in order to model it—noting, for example, that they treat “eating as ceremony.”

Read: When scarcity blurs the line between right and wrong

What gives Mueenuddin a harder time is finding a structure that generates meaning from the interplay between the upper and the lower classes. His four stories follow no clear arc, flitting from one time period or character to another. In a short-story collection such as Other Rooms, the question of a narrative through line does not arise. You get discrete stories (or rooms!) about people from different classes, and the links between characters are subtle. In Serpent, however, Mueenuddin’s attempts to give the lives of Yazid and Saqib the same weight as those of the estate owners is strangely lopsided; his characters’ connections feel more circumstantial than inherent to the narrative. A 150-page novel about Saqib alone, for example, might have succeeded more than this brilliant but blowsy book, which had me writing, at page 100, “I still don’t know what this is about.”

Alas, this pitfall has as much to do with the structure of Pakistani society as it does with the structure of the book. Although masters and servants occupy the same spaces, their lives don’t apply equal pressure on each other. A servant could have a tumultuous inner life, but unless he commits a major crime (as in, for instance, Aravind Adiga’s Booker-winning The White Tiger), his emotions are unlikely to infect the master. The master, in turn, usually lives in another sphere—one of extramarital affairs and boozy parties and corrupt business deals. Shahnaz, for example, simply turns away bitterly and sadly after Saqib’s crime. One wishes Mueenuddin had devised a narrative in which she experienced a deeper, more complicated fallout—an exception to the rule.

And so lives that are disparate continue to feel wrenched apart. What we have here is not a novel at all but another linked short-story collection—if only Mueenuddin had named it as such! The lives of these characters are of superb interest. It is the form in which they live that is flawed.

            <h2>What Iran’s Dead Loved and Fought For</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On January 2, Raha Bahloulipour watched Sentimental Value, the latest film by the Norwegian auteur Joachim Trier, in her dorm room at the University of Tehran. It was the first film she viewed in 2026, and she liked it very much.

I know this because Raha was, like myself, an avid user of the film-cataloging app Letterboxd. With its tag system and diary, she jotted down when, where, and in what context she watched movies and what she thought of them. She started her diary in August 2023 and logged a total of 795 films during her 888 days on the app. She gave Trier’s film a heart, indicating that it was a favorite. She also tagged it with “protests,” to note that she’d watched it as anti-regime demonstrations rocked her country.

On January 8 and 9, the Iranian regime mowed down thousands of protesters all across the country. Raha was one of them, killed by a bullet that pierced her lungs.

A 24-year-old student of Italian literature at the University of Tehran, Raha took part in the movement from its beginning, on December 29. On that day, she shared her impressions in a Telegram post that mingled English, Italian, and her native Persian.

“What a Day! What a night!” she wrote. “These streets, these feelings,” she went on: “I want my life to be like this.” She ended her post with a call for a solidarity demonstration on campus.

Raha’s Telegram channel, like much of her life, was dedicated to arts and culture. In thousands of posts, starting in December 2019, she wrote about the music, novels, and films she loved. She also shared her love for the city of Tehran, and the pictures she took during her strolls around the metropolis. Had she belonged to another time or place, Raha might have preferred not to engage in politics. In August 2023, she quoted Joan Didion: “I’m not telling you to make the world better, because I don’t think that progress is necessarily part of the package. I’m just telling you to live in it.”

Gal Beckerman: The silence of the left on Iran

But for a woman in contemporary Iran, staying aloof from politics was impossible. Not only did the Islamic Republic restrict what she could wear, listen to, and watch, but its misrule had destroyed her standard of living. In February 2025, she wrote on X: “I am in the most penniless era of my life. I can barely afford one meal a day.” Like many of her compatriots, she could hardly imagine a future. Around the same time, she wrote: “I hate, hate, hate the Islamic Republic, and I am so tired of it.”

Iran’s previous major protest movement erupted in 2022, and Raha, then 20 years old, signaled her support on Telegram. She deeply identified with the movement’s slogan, “Women, life, freedom.” She might have thought of one of her favorite films, Bernardo Bertolucci’s The Dreamers (logged and hearted on Letterboxd in December 2024), about young bohemians drawn into student protests in Paris in 1968: Politics beckoned Raha as it beckons the film’s protagonists.

She took an even more active role in the protests that expanded this January. She posted regularly about them. On January 5, she explained the shift in her channel’s content, telling her followers that she’d understand if they weren’t comfortable with the political output and wanted to leave.

All the while, she never stopped watching movies. She tagged a total of 22 films with “protests,” viewing them throughout the stormy days of January. On January 4, she saw the British thriller V for Vendetta, centered on mass demonstrations against a dystopian fascist government. On the same day, she found time to watch Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson duke it out in Die My Love and to rewatch the feel-good musical La La Land. Her interest piqued by Trier, she saw his celebrated film The Worst Person in the World on January 6.

Little did she know that this would be the last new watch she would log on Letterboxd (she also logged a rewatch of Houman Seyyedi’s Sound and Fury later that day).

The regime had imposed a sweeping internet blackout. Raha was able to get online briefly on January 9. “I connected for only a moment,” she wrote on Telegram, “and I just want to write: Women, Life, Freedom. Forever.” This would be her last post and political testament.

Mahsa Alimardani: How doubt became a weapon in Iran

Iranians are mourning thousands of dead. The exact number eludes us: Nobody believes the regime’s count of 3,000; some in the opposition say that the real number might be 10 times as high. Even at the low end, this is the worst killing of protesters in Iranian history. And no matter what the ultimate tally, every individual is an aching, terrible loss.

Many of the fallen leave behind social-media profiles that open windows, however narrow, onto their lives, their aspirations, and why and for what they risked their lives.

Raha’s story has spread quickly in recent weeks in part because her Telegram posts express a joyful nature that is now gut-wrenching to behold. “I really am a big fan of life,” she wrote in November 2025. In a viral video from the university, she is heard practicing her Italian: “Forse perché mi piace vivere moltissimo quindi.” (“Maybe because my love for life knows no end.”) In one Telegram post, she quoted Matt Haig’s memoir Reasons to Stay Alive: “I want life. I want to read it and write it and feel it and live it.”

Raha’s exuberance was inextricably linked to cinema and literature. In January 2020, at 17 years old, Raha wrote: “Until the cinema can give you courage to go on, you must continue life even if it’s full of pain and suffering.” Four years later, she wrote: “I love cinema because I love humans. I love that humans live and exist.” A year later, she wrote: “I owe so much to cinema. Most of the courage I feel in myself is because of cinema. I just read a letter from Fellini and now I am so calm.”

Judging by her writings, Raha belonged to a milieu in Tehran where the arts are a secular religion. This tugs at me because I once belonged to one very similar. “In days, I am taken by literature and at nights by the movies,” Raha wrote, and she could have been describing my youth in Tehran, even though I am 14 years her senior.

Raha adored the Belgian director Chantal Akerman. Her Toute une nuit (1982), which follows two dozen people through one night in Brussels, was among Raha’s top four on Letterboxd. “Need to soak up every moment of this film,” she wrote after a rewatch. In the world of literature, she reserved a special place for Albert Camus who, together with Milan Kundera, Jostein Gaarder, Simone de Beauvoir, and a few others, has remained as central to her generation as he was to mine. She posted a quote from a love letter that the Spanish-born French actor Maria Casares wrote to Camus: “My Love, I wish I knew a language never used before to speak to you.” Translated into Persian, the line reads like poetry.

As Raha delved into her university studies, her posts reflected her readings in Italian. Oriana Fallaci’s Penelope alla guerra was a new favorite; last September, she wrote excitedly about her class on Dante’s Divine Comedy.

Arash Azizi: The Islamic Republic will not last

Many of the works that she—and I—explored as a young person in Iran were of European origin, but what drew her to them was their universality. Raha received nothing passively: She interacted with Western works of art alongside Iranian ones, and in relation to them. Her Telegram channel’s name exemplified this transport of ideas: “Le vent nous portera” (“The Wind Will Carry Us”) is a song by a French rock band, named after a film by the Iranian auteur Abbas Kiarostami, who took it from a poem by the Iranian poet Forough Farrokhzad.

Raha did not consume only Western works. She also read the Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish and the South Korean novelist Han Kang. The Mexican American author Valeria Luiselli was another favorite, as her modern urban sensibility helped Raha appreciate flaneuring in her own Tehran. “Now that I am not there, I suddenly catch myself dreaming of walking in Tehran’s streets,” she wrote last year. “This city is truly my lover. Full of danger, chaos, life, and passion.” Elsewhere, she wrote: “I currently love Tehran, the Italian language, cinema, translation, and beautiful humans.”

Raha’s ebullience contrasted starkly with the martyrdom culture promoted by the theocratic regime she lived under. Iran’s rulers, like many religious fundamentalists, celebrate indifference to earthly life and pin their sights on posthumous rewards.

Now, as Iranians bury their new martyrs, an entirely different culture has sprung up around them. Funerals feature not the traditional resigned mourning, but defiance and a celebration of life. Instead of the Islamic term shahid, or “martyr,” Iranians have adopted the Persian term javidnaam, or “eternal name,” to denote this new mentality.

The designation fits Raha very well. She will not be able to watch any of the 279 films on her Letterboxd “Watchlist.” She will not finish her Italian degree. But her writings will indeed be eternal, and her name will live on among Iranians still struggling to take their country back: Raha Bahloulipour, whose life was taken from her perhaps, above all, because she loved it so much. As she wrote on Telegram: “Nothing in this life was as we wanted it. But we wanted it and loved it madly and fought for it.”</div>

Some dictators go down fighting. Some are lynched and strung up for their victims to spit on. Some die in bed.

Bashar al-Assad, who oversaw the torture and murder of hundreds of thousands of his fellow Syrians during a quarter century in power, may have achieved something new in the annals of tyranny. As the rebels closed in on Damascus on December 7, 2024, Assad reassured his aides and subordinates that victory was near, and then fled in the night on a Russian jet, telling almost no one. I remember seeing a statement issued that same evening declaring that Assad was at the palace performing his “constitutional duties.” Some of his closest aides were fooled and had to escape the country however they could as rebel militias lit up the sky with celebratory gunfire.

Assad’s betrayal was so breathtakingly craven that some people had trouble believing it at first. When the facts became impossible to deny, the loyalty of thousands of people curdled almost instantly into fury. Many swore that they had always secretly hated him. There is an expression in Arabic for this kind of revisionist memory: When the cow falls, the butchers multiply.

But the emotion was real for many, as was the belief that Assad was solely responsible for everything that had gone wrong. “You can still find people who believe in Muammar Qaddafi, who believe in Saddam Hussein,” Ibrahim Hamidi, a Syrian journalist and editor, told me. “No one now believes in Bashar al-Assad, not even his brother.”

The sudden collapse of the Assad regime put an end to a cruel police state, but now there is virtually no Syrian state at all outside the capital. The country’s new leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, has done a superb job of charming Donald Trump and other world leaders. He is also an Islamist whose authority is tenuous, and whose country remains so dangerously volatile that it could easily descend into another war.

No one—not the CIA, not the Mossad—appears to have had any idea that Assad would fall so fast. But in the days and weeks afterward, an explanation for his regime’s collapse began to gain currency. Assad’s backers, Russia and Iran, had been drawn into other conflicts, with Ukraine and Israel respectively, and no longer had the ability to protect him. Their sudden withdrawal exposed what had been hidden in plain sight for years: the terrible weakness of an exhausted, corrupt, and underpaid army. A little like the American-backed regime in Afghanistan that fell in 2021, the Assad dynasty was the casualty of broader geopolitical realignments. After the fact, its fall came to seem inevitable.

But over the past year, I have spoken with dozens of the courtiers and officers who inhabited the palace in Damascus, and they tell a different story. Many describe a detached ruler, obsessed with sex and video games, who probably could have saved his regime at any time in the past few years if he hadn’t been so stubborn and vain. In this version, it was not geopolitics that doomed the regime. None of the countries in the region wanted Assad to fall, and several of them offered him lifelines. If he had taken hold of them, he would almost certainly be sitting in the palace now. Even in the final days, foreign ministers were calling, offering deals. He didn’t answer. He appears to have been sulking, angered by the suggestion that he might have to give up the throne.

In the end, Assad’s embittered loyalists may have been right. It was all about Bashar.

Perhaps all autocrats come to think of themselves as invincible, but Assad had a particular reason for his misplaced confidence: He had already survived one near-death experience.

The Arab Spring uprisings reached Syria in 2011 and blazed up into civil war. A large portion of the country’s people took up arms against its ruler, and scarcely anyone expected Assad to survive. “I have no doubt that the Assad regime will soon discover that the forces of change cannot be reversed,” Barack Obama declared in 2012. Obama was so confident that his State Department helped fund a “Day After Project” to be ready for the new Syria. My editors at The New York Times asked me to write an obituary of the Assad dynasty, and I remember thinking that I should get it done quickly. I still have it in my files.

Read: The dispute behind the violence in Syria

That obituary probably would have been published in 2015 if not for a deus ex machina named Vladimir Putin. A Russian intervention that began in September of that year changed everything for Assad. Waves of deadly air strikes by Russia’s Sukhoi and Tupolev jets, working in concert with Iranian and Shiite militias, shifted the momentum on the battlefield, inflicting fierce blows on the rebel forces. By now, the Syrian opposition, once led by nonviolent protesters, was dominated by Islamists, who were divided and feckless and could be easily lumped together with the telegenic savageries of the Islamic State, known as ISIS.

By late 2017, Assad had more or less won the war. His regime controlled the major cities, and the opposition was confined to the northwestern province of Idlib, where a former al-Qaeda leader named Ahmed al-Sharaa (then known as Abu Muhammad al-Jolani) was emerging as a leading figure.

That deceptive moment of victory, many Syrians have told me, was when everything started to go wrong. Assad didn’t seem to understand that his triumph was a hollow one. Large portions of his country had been reduced to rubble. The economy had shrunk almost to nothing, and sanctions levied by the United States and Europe were weighing it down even further. Syria’s sovereignty had been partly mortgaged to Russia and Iran, which were squeezing Damascus for money to repay their investment in the conflict. Assad’s supporters, having suffered through years of war and struggle, would not remain patient forever. With the fighting over, they began to expect some kind of reprieve.

Assad could have given his people what they wanted. The Gulf Arab states had the money and clout to bring him in from the cold, and in 2017, the United Arab Emirates began reaching out to Damascus. But it had a condition, the same one it had been seeking since before the civil war: Assad had to distance himself from Iran. The Gulf Arabs had long seen the revolutionary theocrats in Tehran as their biggest threat, and Syria’s long-standing alliance with them—forged by Bashar’s father, Hafez al-Assad—was a sore point with all of the other Arab leaders.

For Syria, exchanging Iran’s dubious company for the wealth of the Gulf made a lot of sense. But there was a catch: It wasn’t necessarily the best thing for the Assad family. Unlike the Gulf states and the West, the Iranians had always made clear that they would do anything to keep Assad in power. All he had to do in return was continue to facilitate Tehran’s provision of weapons and money through Syrian territory to Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese militia that was the star player in Tehran’s “Axis of Resistance.”

Assad did reach a modest rapprochement with the Emiratis, who reopened their embassy in Damascus in 2018. But he refused to cut his ties to Iran. Khaled al-Ahmad, a shrewd political operator in Assad’s inner circle who had negotiated the deal with the Emiratis and had briefly believed that a real political transition was possible, finally concluded that Assad was incapable of changing course. “I decided he was a dead elephant in the room,” he told me of Assad. (Ahmad is now an adviser to the new Syrian government.)

Around this time, a young Israeli national-security official reached the same conclusion and began urging his superiors to organize an internal coup against Assad. The Israelis had long viewed Assad as a manageable enemy—someone who mouthed all of the usual slogans about the Zionist enemy but kept the border between the two countries quiet. But the Israeli official, who is no longer in government service and spoke with me on the condition of anonymity, told me that around 2019, he began to fear that Assad was too feckless to be reliable. “The regime was an empty shell,” he said.

The Israeli command demurred on the coup proposal. The idea had been discussed periodically over the years in Tel Aviv and Washington but had never gotten very far, perhaps because Assad’s father had deliberately created a regime that kept potential rivals in check or under surveillance.

“Everybody in the region was comfortable with him being there,” the former Israeli official said. “Being weak, posing a threat to no one.”

Assad apparently mistook this tacit consensus for power. “Bashar was living in a fictional world,” a former Hezbollah political operative who was often in Syria during those years told me (he asked for anonymity for fear of repercussions): “The Iranians need me. The Russians have no choice. I’m the king.”

Assad’s backers began to grumble, but the Syrian leader wouldn’t listen. In 2019, the former Hezbollah operative said, the Russians and the Iranians began pushing him to make mostly symbolic reforms that would placate Western countries and ease the burden of Syria’s economic isolation. Assad lied and temporized, the official said. Iran’s foreign minister at the time, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said in a recent interview with Al Jazeera that he’d urged Assad to “engage with the opposition” but that the Syrian leader, “drunk with victory,” had stalled.

Perhaps the most arresting example of Assad’s obtuseness came during the first Trump administration. In 2020, Washington sent two officials, Roger Carstens and Kash Patel, to Lebanon to locate Austin Tice, an American journalist who had disappeared in Syria in 2012 and was thought to be in the hands of the Assad regime. Abbas Ibrahim, then the head of Lebanon’s General Security branch, brought the two men to Damascus, where they met with one of Assad’s top security officials, a widely feared figure named Ali Mamlouk. The Americans raised the subject of Tice, Carstens told me, and Mamlouk responded that the United States would need to lift sanctions and remove its troops from Syria before any American request could be discussed. Ibrahim, who had taken part in the meeting and recalled some details differently, told me that he had seen Mamlouk’s remark as an opening gambit and had never expected the Americans to make such sweeping concessions.

To the surprise of both Ibrahim and Mamlouk, the U.S. government signaled its agreement to a deal in exchange for proof that Tice was alive. Ibrahim then flew to Washington, where he was told that Trump had confirmed the American position. But Ibrahim was even more amazed when he got the response from Assad: No deal, and no more talks. Ibrahim asked why, and Mamlouk told him that it was “because Trump described Assad as an animal” years earlier.

Ibrahim told his Syrian counterpart that this was madness. Even if Tice was dead, the Americans would hold up their end of the deal as long as they could find out what had happened to him and “close the file.” (There have been conflicting reports about what happened to Tice, including some suggesting, without proof, that an Assad-regime officer may have killed him.) The Americans were eager for anything they could get, Ibrahim recalled to me: “I got a call from Pompeo once; he said, I’m ready to fly by private jet to Syria, ready to shake hands with anyone.” (Pompeo and Patel did not respond to my requests for comment.)

This was a “golden opportunity” for Assad, who presumably could have met with Mike Pompeo, then the U.S. secretary of state, and told him apologetically that the regime did not know what had happened to Tice, Ibrahim said. The meeting alone would have bestowed a new legitimacy on Assad, and made other countries more inclined to reach out to him.

The Biden administration renewed the offer in 2023, sending a high-level delegation to Oman to meet with Syrian officials about Tice. This time, Assad behaved almost insultingly, Ibrahim said, refusing even to send a senior official to meet them. Instead, he sent a former ambassador who was given strict instructions to not so much as speak about Tice.

That Assad, with his hubris and lack of foresight, was soon to fall may be less puzzling, in retrospect, than the fact that he lasted so long. The reason he did goes back to his father, who built a regime so sturdy and ruthless that it survived 25 years of the son’s mismanagement. One lesson to be drawn from Assad’s fall is a very old one: The greatest vulnerability of all political dynasties is the problem of succession.

Hafez al-Assad was a dictator in the classic mold, a shrewd and strong-willed man who rose from rural poverty through the military and seized power in a 1970 coup. He had a genius for undermining and outwitting his rivals, and he made dictatorship seem natural. It was what many Syrians wanted after the chaotic years that followed their country gaining independence from France, in 1946. “For some reason it seems to me that within the Arab circle there is a role wandering aimlessly in search of a hero,” wrote Gamal Abdel Nasser, the lantern-jawed Egyptian leader who embodied that heroic role perfectly in the 1950s and ’60s and helped create the modern idea of what an Arab dictator should be.

Bashar was different. Even first-time visitors to Syria could see that he didn’t look the part: He had a weak chin and panicky eyes, and his head and neck were oddly elongated, as if he’d been squeezed too tight in the birth canal. When you saw his image on one of the ubiquitous billboards around Syria, it was easy to get the feeling that someone had played a practical joke and substituted the head of an anxious schoolboy for that of the leader.

When he started talking, the impression was even worse. His voice was thin and nasal, and he always looked uncomfortable during speeches, as if he was desperate to get it over with. In a culture that puts great value on eloquence and authority, he had none.

Many people who know Bashar told me that his lack of confidence stems from his early years. His older brother, Bassel, bullied his younger siblings so mercilessly that he permanently distorted their personalities, one former palace insider told me. The family dynamics are on display in a famous photograph taken around 1993. Bassel stands at the center of the frame, looking cocky and slightly bored, with his parents seated in front of him and his siblings on either side. Bashar is on the left, his body slightly angled away, his face uneasy. Unlike the others, he seems to be looking beyond the photographer, as if scouting an escape route.

Bashar came to power through an accident. Bassel, a military officer and a show-jumping equestrian who was known as Syria’s “Golden Knight,” was the heir apparent. But he died in a car crash in 1994. Hafez yanked Bashar back from London, where he’d been training to be an ophthalmologist, and began grooming him as the next leader.

Many in Syria’s dissident circles at first found Bashar’s awkwardness and shyness appealing. The fact that he didn’t resemble a dictator kindled their hopes that he would be kinder and more tolerant. For a brief moment, that appeared to be true. During the “Damascus Spring” that followed Bashar’s accession after his father’s death, in 2000, the margin of free speech seemed to widen.

But a crackdown soon followed, and in the following years, Assad’s psychology appeared to be working in the opposite direction. He was so afraid of being perceived as weak, he seemed to believe that he had to prove, again and again, that he could live up to the brutality that was expected of him.

I have spoken with at least a dozen people who knew Assad, and they all commented on his stubbornness. He doesn’t listen to advice, many of them said, and often seems to resent hearing it. Similar things were said about his father, a famously uncompromising negotiator. Both men had to “bargain with and manipulate sinecures of power within this opaque system in order to reach consensus,” David Lesch, a scholar at Trinity University who interviewed Bashar extensively in the 2000s, told me. But Assad lacked his father’s native toughness. According to some who knew and studied him, his rigidity masked a lack of confidence in his own judgment.

That insecurity, some told me, also makes him impressionable. He was particularly taken with Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, an immensely popular and charismatic figure. Assad seems to have believed the propaganda Nasrallah fed him, perhaps because it was what he wanted to hear: that the Axis of Resistance would strike a fierce blow against Israel and that, afterward, Assad would be able to set any conditions he liked for peace. In other words, Assad would not have to make any difficult choices or sacrifices. Everything would be handed to him on a platter.

On October 7, 2023, Assad must have imagined for a few hours that Nasrallah’s prophecies had come true. Hamas fighters swept across the border fence from Gaza and massacred more than 1,000 people. Israel—the Samson of the region—looked weak and unprepared.

But before long, Israel was launching thousands of air strikes not just into Gaza but also into Lebanon and Syria. Assad said nothing about this campaign against his allies, which eventually killed Nasrallah himself. Perhaps he hoped to keep his name off Israel’s target list. But according to Wiam Wahhab, a Lebanese political figure who was close to the Syrian regime, Assad’s silence fueled Iranian suspicions that he was feeding information to the Israelis. The Axis of Resistance was falling apart.

That should have worried Assad, especially in light of the fact that Russia, his other protector, was bogged down in Ukraine. But the atmosphere at the palace was not conducive to clear thinking. Assad was spending much of his time playing Candy Crush and other video games on his phone, according to the former Hezbollah operative I spoke with. He had sidelined the éminences grises of his father’s day and relied instead on a small circle of younger figures with dubious credentials. One of them, a former Al Jazeera journalist named Luna al-Shibl, doubled as Assad’s lover and also procured other women for him to have sex with, including the wives of high-ranking Syrian officers, according to former palace insiders and the former Israeli official.

Shibl, who was married to a regime insider, seems to have encouraged Assad’s palace-born habit of looking down on ordinary citizens. In a recording that surfaced this past December, Assad and Shibl can be heard laughing dismissively about the pretensions of Hezbollah and mocking the soldiers who salute them as they drive through a Damascus suburb. Assad, who is at the wheel, says at one point of the Syrians they pass in the street: “They spend money on mosques, but they don’t have enough to eat.”

To understand the obscenity of Assad’s comment, you need to know that he was amassing an enormous personal fortune, mostly from drug smuggling, even as many Syrians were at the point of starvation. Ordinary soldiers were paid as little as $10 a month, far less than they needed to survive. The Syrian pound, which had once traded at 47 to the dollar, had reached a rate of 15,000 a dollar by 2023. The poverty deepened after 2020, when the U.S. Congress imposed another steep round of sanctions under the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act.

Even longtime supporters from the Alawite religious minority—the sect to which the Assads belong—began to complain about their destitution. One member of the Assad clan who lives in Europe told me that he’d visited Syria in 2021 and been amazed to discover that the officers—from the elite Republican Guard unit—charged with protecting his immediate family were so poor that they spent their off-duty hours hawking fruit and cigarettes in the street.

Assad and his family maintained their own living standards by turning Syria into a narco-state, with Bashar’s brother Maher overseeing the manufacture and smuggling of immense quantities of Captagon, an illegal amphetamine. The drug trade earned Assad billions of dollars, but it also fueled an addiction crisis in the Gulf states and Jordan, angering their leaders.

Assad’s megalomania seems to have taken a strange new turn in these past few years. According to Ahmad, Assad had concluded that he needed “monarchy tools” like those of Putin and the Gulf rulers, including cash reserves large enough to subsidize militias and reorient the economy. Assad’s comments to a Russian interviewer during his final months in power betray a hint of this idea of royal powers. Asked about the downsides of democracy, Assad said, with a contemptuous grin: “In the West, the presidents, especially in the United States, are the executive directors, but they’re not the owners.”

In July 2024, with the war in Gaza dominating the headlines, Luna al-Shibl was found dead in her BMW on a highway outside Damascus. The regime media called it a road accident, but the circumstances were odd: According to some reports, the car was only lightly damaged, yet her skull had been bashed in. Rumors spread quickly that she had been killed on the orders of Tehran for providing targeting information to the Israelis.

But Assad was the one who’d ordered the murder of his former lover, the former Israeli official and two people with ties to the regime told me. Shibl had become a de facto Russian agent, providing Moscow with information about Iran’s activities in Syria, the former Israeli official said. Perhaps she’d sensed that the end was coming for Assad and that she needed another protector. This account was impossible to confirm; Russian officials do not comment on intelligence matters.

When a tyrant falls, we may be tempted to imagine a final moment of tragic self-awareness—a personal reckoning, like Oedipus blinding himself, or Macbeth raging on the heath. But I don’t think real dictators go down like that. They are too good at lying to themselves.

For Assad, the final chapter began in November 2024. The rebel militias under Ahmed al-Sharaa’s command had been lobbying for Turkey’s permission to launch a military operation, and finally, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan gave it to them. (Turkey denied official involvement in the operation.)

Erdoğan did so reluctantly. All year, he had been asking Assad to meet with him. His demands were pretty modest: a political reconciliation and a deal to allow the millions of Syrian refugees in Turkey to return home. But Assad acted as if he held all the cards, refusing to meet unless Erdoğan agreed in advance to withdraw all Turkish forces from Syria. The rebel operation that Erdoğan approved seems to have been intended as a way to prod Assad to negotiate; it was framed not as an invasion but as a defensive move.

When the rebels marched northeast toward the city of Aleppo on November 27, 2024, Assad was in Russia, where his son would be defending his Ph.D. dissertation on number theory and polynomial representations at Moscow State University. As Aleppo’s defenses crumbled, Assad remained in Moscow, to the shock and dismay of his commanders back home. He seems to have been hoping to persuade Putin to rescue him.

But the Russian president kept him waiting for days, and when they finally met, it was very brief. According to the former Israeli official I spoke with, Putin told Assad that he could not fight his war for him, and that the Syrian leader’s only hope was to go to Erdoğan and cut a deal. The Russians had always valued their strategic relationship with Turkey far more than their relationship with Syria. Whether Assad grasped this is impossible to know. But Putin was not going to launch a new war against Turkey’s rebel allies just to save a petty dictator whose own soldiers were deserting.

Aleppo had fallen to the rebels by the time Assad landed back in Damascus. After only a few hours, he flew to Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, Ahmad told me. It is not clear whom he met with or what was said. The Emiratis feared Sharaa’s Islamist militias as much as they feared Tehran. But they had no boots on the ground.

Back in Damascus, Assad tried a last gambit, calling on the “monarchy tools” he had been assembling for years. He put out word that he would pay exorbitant salaries to volunteers who could quickly reassemble the militias that had helped win the civil war years earlier, Ahmad told me. But when the ordinary soldiers who’d spent years on starvation wages heard of these offers, many were so furious that they abandoned their post.

The rebels had now captured the city of Hama and were on their way to Homs, 100 miles north of the capital. At the same time, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard commanders who had helped prop up the regime began to pack up and leave. Syrian soldiers got wind of their allies’ retreat, and panic spread among the ranks. The rebels rode southward almost unopposed.

Read: The Axis of Resistance keeps getting smaller

On December 7, 2024, the foreign ministers of Russia and seven Middle Eastern countries held an emergency meeting on the sidelines of an annual security conference in Doha, the Qatari capital. None of them wanted the Assad regime to collapse. They issued a statement calling for an end to military operations and for a phased political transition, based on a United Nations Security Council resolution that had been issued a decade earlier. They would need Assad to agree to this and facilitate it, but there was a problem: No one could reach him. He appeared to have turned off his phone.

A member of Assad’s entourage who was with him in the final hours gave me the following account, asking not to be named because he is still living in the region.

Assad returned from the palace to his private residence in the capital’s al-Malki neighborhood at roughly 6 p.m. He seemed calm, and mentioned that he had just reassured his cousin Ihab Makhlouf that there was nothing to worry about; the Emiratis and Saudis would find a way to stop the rebel advance. Makhlouf was shot to death later that night while fleeing by car to Lebanon.

At 8 p.m., word came that Homs had fallen to the rebels. That struck fear in the entourage. But Assad assured his aides that regime forces were coming from the south to encircle and defend the capital. This was not true, and my sources could not say whether Assad believed it. In the hours that followed, he seemed to have oscillated between despair and deluded assurances that victory was at hand—a state of mind that will be familiar to anyone who has watched the movie Downfall, about Hitler’s final days in the Führerbunker in Berlin.

Just after 11 p.m., Mansour Azzam, one of Assad’s top aides, arrived at the house with a small group of Russian officials. They went off to a room together with Assad to talk. My source told me he believes that the Russians were showing Assad videos proving that the regime forces were no longer fighting.

By 1 a.m., word had reached the entourage that many regime supporters had given up the fight and were fleeing the capital for the Syrian coast, the Alawite heartland.

At 2 a.m., Assad emerged from his private quarters and told his longtime driver that he would need vans. He gave orders for the staff to start packing his belongings as quickly as possible. A group of Russians was outside the house.

Until that moment, many in the entourage had believed that Assad would go to the presidential palace to deliver a speech of resistance to his followers. Now they finally understood that the battle was over. He was abandoning them for good. Assad moved toward the front door, this time with two of his aides and his son Hafez. The others were told that there was no room for them.

Assad’s middle-aged driver stood by the door, looking at the president with an unmistakable expression of disappointment on his face.

Assad looked back at him. Even in this last moment, he wouldn’t take responsibility for what had happened to his country. He wasn’t betraying his followers—it was they who were betraying him, by refusing to lay down their lives to extend his rule.

“What about you people?” Assad asked the driver. “Aren’t you going to fight?”

He turned and went out into the night. The Russians were waiting.</div>

            <h2>The Literary Ecosystem Is Dying</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/books-news-washington-post/685897/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">With this week’s announcement of massive cuts at The Washington Post, the paper’s Book World supplement earned a dismal distinction: It may be the only newspaper book-review section to have been killed twice. The first time was in 2009, when papers across the country were slashing books coverage in an attempt to stave off budgetary apocalypse. So when the Post relaunched Book World in 2022, readers and writers reacted with the same mixture of amazement and trepidation inspired by the dinosaurs at Jurassic Park. The rebirth of a dead species was wonderful to see, but how would it end?

Now we know. The new Book World was just as good as the old Book World; the editors and critics who lost their jobs this week, including John Williams, Ron Charles, and Becca Rothfeld, followed in the tradition of Jonathan Yardley and Michael Dirda, the Post’s Pulitzer Prize–winning stalwarts. But quality had nothing to do with the decision to cut book reviews, just as it had nothing to do with cuts in the paper’s sports and international coverage. Rather, the Post was making the same business decision that most other publications have made. People don’t want to read book reviews—at least, not enough people to make publishing them worthwhile. It’s a vicious circle. As people feel less of a need to keep up with new books, they stop reading reviews; publications respond by cutting books coverage, so readers don’t hear about new books; as a result, they buy fewer books, which makes publications think they’re not worth covering.

As someone who has been writing book reviews for decades, including as a staff critic for several publications, this is a bitter pill to swallow. It’s tempting to react by blaming the decline of literature, of literacy, of society itself. And there’s plenty of evidence that those things are in fact declining.

Ashley Parker: The murder of The Washington Post

But the disappearance of the book review does not mean the end of criticism or of critics. There are still many places to read smart, insightful writing about books—starting with The Atlantic, of course. There are venerable magazines such as The New Yorker, The New York Review of Books, and Harper’s, and newer ones such as The Metropolitan Review and The Point (where the Post’s Rothfeld published a review-essay just this week). The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal still have excellent weekly book sections. And there’s an embarrassment of riches on Substack, though you have to know where to look. If you tried to keep up with all of the good criticism out there, you’d have no time left for reading actual books.

There is also no shortage of enthusiasm for talking about books. Just look at BookTok, Goodreads, Reddit, Amazon, or anywhere else people gather online to react, share, rank, and ask questions about the books they love or hate. Even 4chan, the notorious message board, has become a home for literary omnivores and autodidacts. Many of these readers don’t think book reviewers deserve to be mourned any more than other kinds of “gatekeepers.” If people no longer trust experts to tell them what vaccines to take or what stocks to buy, why do they need book critics to tell them what to read?

In a sense, the decline of book reviews, like the decline of newspapers themselves, is a story about disaggregation. Newspapers used to bundle several functions together in a way that made them both useful and profitable. A daily chunk of newsprint told you about world and local events, but also about stock prices, movie showings, potential romantic partners, and where to buy washing machines on sale. When the internet made finding that information easy and free, many people decided against paying for just the news part of the newspaper.

Similarly, book reviews used to play a number of roles in the literary ecosystem. In addition to informing readers about newly published books, they offered analysis to learn from, opinions to argue with, and, at their best, good writing to enjoy. (Certain critics, such as John Leonard and Elizabeth Hardwick, were usually better stylists than the writers they were reviewing.) All of these functions are now served in different ways online, or by different kinds of publications.

But as with the newspaper, the whole was more than the sum of its parts. The most important thing that a daily book critic or a weekly book supplement does is bring a literary community into being—the kind of community that exists when people who don’t know one another are all thinking about the same thing at the same time. Concentrated attention is indispensable for civic well-being and meaningful political debate. It is just as important for literary life—maybe even more important, because people who take an interest in books are fewer in number and need more help finding one another.

A book critic, or a newspaper book section, is a convener, bringing people together around a new book or writer, a literary trend or controversy. This agenda-setting is, of course, a kind of gatekeeping: Not every book can be reviewed, much less praised. That’s why one of the responsibilities of a good critic or editor is to have a broad definition of what matters and what’s interesting.

When such critics and editors disappear, every part of the literary ecosystem suffers. Readers don’t discover new writers and new kinds of writing they might love. Publishers find it harder to connect with audiences, so they publish fewer and less adventurous books. Writers don’t get the public feedback they need to develop their talents (even if they don’t always like getting it). And of course, the odd characters who actually enjoy writing reviews find it harder to make a living—this week more than ever.</div>

When heavily armed agents of the federal government arrived in Minneapolis, the people of the Twin Cities responded with surprising strength.

In this episode, residents describe what drove them to act, and host Anne Applebaum speaks with contributing writer Robert Worth about what he learned when he observed the tactics of the federal agents and the response of Minnesotans.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Amanda Bauer: I’ll tell you, I’ve been teaching for 25 years and for 25 years we’ve had lockdowns, teaching kids about, you know, mass shootings in schools. But I think, in my head, I never thought it would be our own government that we had to try to protect ourselves from, or to protect our children from.

Anne Applebaum:  From The Atlantic, this is Autocracy in America. I’m Anne Applebaum. This season, I’ve been examining how the Trump White House is rewriting the rules of U.S. politics, and talking to Americans whose lives have been changed as a result. Today we’re bringing you an extra episode that takes a look at what opposition to this new normal looks like on the ground level. When heavily armed agents of the federal government arrived in Minneapolis, the residents of Minneapolis and St. Paul met those federal forces with surprising strength.

For this episode, I spoke to journalist Robert Worth, a contributing writer at The Atlantic. He’s just been to Minneapolis, where he observed the tactics of the federal agents and the response of Minnesotans. He and I both saw an eerie resemblance to other protest movements that we’ve witnessed in other parts of the world.

First, though, here’s some more from the people of the Twin Cities, explaining how and why they were moved to act.

Bauer: My name is Amanda Bauer. I’m an elementary music teacher in a small elementary school, about 500 or so students from places all over the world, primarily Hispanic and Latin American countries, and then a lot of Somali families, too. The very first day back of break, ICE was at our school and circling the blocks and parked across the street. The kids didn’t feel safe, so we kind of started walking kids home to their apartments and places in the neighborhood. And it was Wednesday, exactly right when we dismissed, that ICE hopped out of their vehicles with all of their riot gear on and were heading over to the apartments across the street from our school. So we had to lock down and keep the kids inside. And it happened fast enough that we had a student who was looking out the window and saw them break into his apartment and just sobbed, “That’s my house. That’s my—that’s my home.” And we shut the blinds, but it was too late. He saw it, and he’ll never unsee it. I don’t know from the other perspective or people who think that this is an acceptable form of trauma for a child to have to experience.  The count today is we have 40 students who aren’t coming anymore because of not feeling safe.

Emilia González Avalos: People here have a civic life. [I’m] Emilia González Avalos, executive director of Unidos. You know people in your caucus, in your neighborhood. People show up to city-council meetings here in Minnesota. Guess what we’re gonna use when they try to come after Minnesotans? We’re going to use civil life. And we’re gonna make more of it. We’re gonna recruit more people. This is just a very Minnesotan thing we do.

Chad Knutson: I don’t know how other people react when they get bullied, but I don’t back down when I get bullied. I fight harder. Everyone I see out here is like, What do you think—we’re gonna quit? We live here. My name is Chad. I am a father of two from St. Paul. Yesterday, [an] ICE agent [was] sitting in a white car idling there on my block, four houses down. I go out and take a picture of his license plate and a picture of him. We’re not protesters. We’re protectors. I don’t wanna be out in my street yesterday blowing a goddamn whistle, because there’s an adopted brown kid down there. They hid her in the basement yesterday. That’s what I don’t think anyone that’s not living here right now understands, is that they wanna make it out to be like this bunch of lunatics in the street. It’s just fucking normal people that don’t want to see their neighbor get beat up. I’m protecting my neighbors.

Ibrahim: My name’s Ibrahim. Born and raised in Minnesota. U.S. citizen. Lived here all my life. I just graduated—I just graduated college. Cybersecurity. I know coming outside there’s a risk, there’s a risk to it, you know, especially me being a Somali male, a Muslim guy, Black skin. But I feel like our community has united a bit more. People come into our mosques on Fridays, you know, white people. And I know that people do show up to support the community. We support one another, and we’re all in this together.

Sara Myron: I was in Egypt during the Arab Spring. You go out, you show up. Dar, dar; zanqa, zanqa; irhal. “Door to door, street to street, leave.” You know? My name’s Sara Myron. I’m a Moroccan American. My great-great-grandfather fought in the Civil War for the Wisconsin 11th Infantry to achieve the American dream. We put down the Confederates, we’re gonna put these ICE guys down too. Not with force, but legally with protests and with the will of the people.

Applebaum: We have both been in authoritarian countries, where demonstrators are protesting in an atmosphere of fear and repression. Minneapolis isn’t exactly Tahrir Square, or the Ukrainian Maidan, or the Hong Kong democracy movement, but it actually has more in common with those demonstrations than most Americans want to acknowledge. In each place, demonstrators faced hostile police who used surveillance technology, who threatened violence. And as a result, they had to create new means of organization, and sometimes new kinds of protests. You were in Minnesota recently. Tell me about what you saw. And tell me how you understand Minnesota within the context of these other moments and movements.

Worth: What I saw was a combination of some of the clashes with protesters and ICE agents, including one stop that got quite violent where a six-car convoy showed up outside a health center. And the agents, they had arrested a couple of people, some protesters as well. Then next thing we know, people are getting sprayed in the face, tear gas. But beyond that, I spent a lot of time talking to people in the Twin Cities about what they had experienced at their local schools, in their neighborhoods. I think, often, it’s easy to caricature this as protesters who believe in sanctuary cities, who believe in open borders versus these agents who were just enforcing the law. I don’t think that’s an accurate picture at all. What you have is a community that feels that whatever their views may be on immigration, there’s a kind of assault on their entire community in a variety of ways, and they wanted to push back on that.

Applebaum:  Let’s talk a little bit about the tactics used by federal agents in the United States, some of which are very new in this country, but are more common overseas. So I’m thinking about surveillance, for one. For example, photographing license plates, using facial-recognition software. Did you see those tactics in use, and did you see people reacting to them or finding ways of compensating for them?

Worth: Absolutely. What is striking, many people go to these encounters to monitor them, to take pictures. Everybody’s holding up a cell phone on the assumption that if someone is going to be arrested, they want there to be a record for potential use in legal proceedings. But the agents themselves are also photographing everybody, and we all now know that they have technology, facial-recognition technology. Everybody feels that they are in potential danger just by being anywhere near these things. And what you also see is a lot of organization. They use tear gas very liberally. And there are always medics in the group who are ready and prepared to help people out, not just with the tear gas, but people who’ve been beaten, thrown to the ground, that kind of—

Applebaum: Medics among the protesters, you mean?

Worth: Yes, exactly. So there’s a lot of organization and this does, for me, evoke some of the things I’ve seen overseas. I covered the 2009 Green Movement in Iran, which was, probably the first major insurrection where social media was used to organize, and then on a much, much larger scale in 2011 with the Arab uprisings, when again social media was used to evade that kind of surveillance and to organize the protests.

Applebaum: Let me add other things that are new. One is the dress and arms and attitude of ICE and the other federal agents—people dressed like they were in Fallujah, you know, or in southern Afghanistan. Lawlessness—so people are entering homes and other buildings without a warrant, dragging people off the street based on nothing except for their skin color. These things feel very un-American, but again, they’re common in other places. Let’s walk through some of the ways in which the protesters and some of the victims may be learning to react. I was very struck in your writing and in the writing of other people by the use of pseudonyms, encrypted-messaging platforms. Did you see any of that? And did that remind you of things you’d seen, whether in Iran or elsewhere?

Worth: Very much so. I traveled to the encounter I described earlier with someone who was using Signal. And these are neighborhood groups, Signal groups. Everybody’s using pseudonyms for the reason you mentioned. They all fear that the government could come after them in unaccountable ways. I think the level of violence is shocking—just seeing these heavily armed people—but also the flagrant absence of what we think of as efforts by the police or any other uniformed group in the U.S., government officials, to avoid violence. I mean, the killing of Alex Pretti, I’ve seen people who’ve been in the military look at those videos and say, Those people are not trained properly at all. And I think that kind of information spreads very quickly. And there’s a feeling of not only that you’re vulnerable to state violence, but there’s a complete lack of accountability for it.

Applebaum:  One of the features of the Hong Kong democracy movement was that the protesters knew that there were cameras everywhere and they were being recorded, and so they started wearing masks and they started also trying to always act in unpredictable ways. They would show up in different parts of the city at different times, so that there were no patterns, so that they couldn’t be followed. Did you see anything like that in Minnesota?

Worth: Certainly people were wearing masks, although it’s a little bit hard to say because the weather was, you know, 10 below zero sometimes, and people had to—

Worth: Exactly. People had to protect themselves in any way they could. I certainly saw techniques that reminded me of what I saw in, you know, the Arab uprisings. Number one, a deliberate effort, a disciplined effort, to avoid violence, even when the protesters are being attacked. A leaderless structure, organized by cells, so that it would be harder to identify people—that was certainly going on.

Applebaum: Also very like Hong Kong, actually, to make sure that there was nobody who could be identified as a leader and therefore picked up or arrested.

Worth: Exactly. And that goes back to people who have written about this from early on, like the American political scientist Gene Sharp, who wrote a book that advocated all of these methods. His work was influential for protesters in Bosnia, inAsia, as you mentioned, and certainly in Iran and across the Middle East.

Applebaum: He had a belief that there were—if you had people in sufficient numbers protesting in ways that were peaceful, that they could eventually move the authorities through their demonstration of resolve and resilience. Is that what people in Minnesota believe?

Worth: I think they do. I spoke to a number who really felt that they could be a model, in the way that they were confronting the authorities. I heard some woman say, “I’m glad that Minneapolis gets to tame the federal beast.” I think that was maybe a little over-optimistic; the federal beast is not easy to tame. But what she meant was, We hope people see what we’re doing and that they do something similar in their own towns.

Applebaum:  I also wanted to talk about the significance of the telephone video recordings. I think it’s the first time I remember, maybe there are a couple earlier smaller instances, but that people in those numbers are using their phones, high-quality videos, to record the behavior of federal agents. And obviously, if there weren’t such high-quality videos, then we wouldn’t know what happened to Alex Pretti or Renee Good.

Worth: It was really striking to see, for instance, the convoy that I mentioned before where ICE stopped and was arresting people—dozens and dozens of people surround it, and they’re pretty much all holding up their cell phones. It at first seemed kind of overkill to me. Maybe each of these people thinks they’re gonna do the video that matters, but after the killing of Alex Pretti, it became clear to me—no, no, that’s essential. And that what we’re seeing is multiple different angles that make it much easier to refute a false narrative that got put out, in this case right away, by the government. I think what’s different now, the proliferation of phones and of media like that and of photography so that while in 2011, say in Egypt, you might be lucky if one protester had gotten a video of someone being attacked, tortured, killed, now you’re going to potentially have that from many different angles. And it’s a much more effective tool.

Applebaum: Although it’s interesting, I mean, the way you talk about it, it’s clear that it’s also a tool against something else that’s new in America, which is the assumption that the state will lie. There will be an act of violence committed, and then there will be lies told about it, and we need to have an answer to that. So people are already mentally preparing for the administration to lie.

Worth:  In the Middle East, everybody expects it. It’s part of what they were protesting against. And I think that’s a frightening and new aspect of what’s going on.

Applebaum:  You alluded to this a bit earlier, but is this a movement with a set of practices that can move beyond Minnesota, do you think? Or is it specific to this place with its particular traditions?

Worth: Minnesota definitely has an old tradition of mutual aid and of neighborhood organizing, and I think that got more intense after the George Floyd protests. And I’ve made this point before, but just to be clear, it’s not just a question of progressives who wanted to protest at that time in 2020, after the killing of George Floyd. I think at that time there was so much going on. There were right-wing provocateurs coming to town. There were opportunistic criminals. Many of the people I spoke to said, We simply want to keep ourselves safe. We want to protect ourselves. And that was the real inspiration for bolstering those networks. Whether that can be replicated, I don’t know. But I suspect yes is the answer because people are aware now and people are frightened. People don’t want to see this. I mean, people as far away as Italy are saying, We don’t want ICE in our town. And my guess is yes, you’re gonna see that kind of thing being replicated.

Applebaum: Robert, after Pretti was killed, there was initially a rush by the Trump administration, as we said, to defend the federal agents and to blame him. But then there was a blowback. People did see the protesters and people did look at the video, citizens and politicians alike. And the administration did withdraw the figurehead of these raids—the Border Patrol’s “commander at large,” Greg Bovino, who has returned to his previous post. And then just a few hours before we taped this conversation, the administration said it would pull about a quarter of the federal agents out of the state. What do you make of those developments? Did the protesters win?

Worth: I think you can say there is some kind of victory there. It’s still hard to say what it all amounts to, but I think there’s no question that the proliferation of those videos being seen by everybody. And one little thing I wanna mention is that Chris Madel, who was running for governor as a Republican—who, by the way, is a lawyer who represents cops, that’s what he does, and is very much, one assumes, involved in that community—came out, he canceled his run, and he came out and taped a video in which he said, As a Republican, I can’t afford to be associated with this stuff. The way that ICE is carrying out its campaign is not acceptable. And I couldn’t help thinking that that’s gonna ramify across the country. It’s not just about Democrats.

Applebaum: So that also historically was the goal of peaceful protests, starting with Mahatma Gandhi and going through our civil-rights movement and up through the Ukrainian Maidan and others, was to move ordinary people who aren’t involved in politics. So the point is not to, as you say, to get a bunch of progressives to demonstrate their anger, but to carry out actions that are bringing a wider part of the population, even people who aren’t there. So in a way we can see this happening in Minnesota.

Worth: I think so. I spoke to people of various different backgrounds, sort of moderate, suburban, elderly people, not at all activists. I think there’s a widespread sense that whatever one’s political beliefs, the way that ICE is behaving is just unacceptable and un-American.

Applebaum: What do you think these few weeks tell us about the administration’s broader plans? What’s ICE really for beyond the arrest and deportations? Is it performative cruelty? Is the idea to create fear among the population? Is it some other goal? I mean, it seems to me that just focusing on this as an immigration issue misses a large part of what ICE is doing. If you just wanted to identify immigrants, you wouldn’t even, for example, need policemen who are armed. The only reason to arm people looking like they’re ready to take on ISIS is to create fear and terror. And that must have a purpose. What’s your view of that?

Worth: I do think there’s some performative cruelty. I think there’s an effort to intimidate people. There’s that now-famous clip of a video: The agent says something like, and this is just after the killing of Renee Good, Haven’t you learned, haven’t you learned? In other words, We just killed someone. Stay the hell away from people like us, and let us do our work. So I think there’s an effort to spread fear and again, that very much echoes with my experience covering these insurrections in the Middle East.

But what strikes me also is that this is backfiring. If their goal is, as they say, to arrest as many illegal migrants as possible, one can’t help thinking that for a lot of Americans, immigration enforcement writ large is now gonna be associated with the gestapo-like tactics. And this is not the first time, right, that the administration has set out a goal and then proceeded to enforce it in the most club-footed way possible. Their tactics really baffle their strategy.

Applebaum: In each of our episodes this season, we’ve looked ahead to the midterm elections because I—and not I alone, many other people—think that a lot of what we’re seeing is maybe a test run for what could happen in November. And we actually got a data point on that this week in Minnesota because there were precinct caucuses held across the state. Members of the public gathered to discuss platform issues and nominate delegates for future conventions. And we talked with some residents and volunteers who attended one caucus at a high school in South Minneapolis. So let’s listen to that.

Dex Anderson: We have one door to the high school that is unlocked. We have a deescalation group that is here, and we have ICE Watch in the parking lot. We have never had to have stuff like that in past years. My name is Dex Anderson. I am the site lead for the caucuses here, and I am a volunteer. I wish we had been able to pivot to virtual or contactless caucuses, which is what we did under the pandemic. But the state party did not make the decision about that beforehand. So we did everything we could tonight to make sure that our neighbors are safe.

Michael Reif: My name is Michael Reif. I’m a part of the DFL Lawyers Committee. We’re here today just making sure that if we see ICE presence, that we remind them that they’re not welcome without a judicial warrant, and that we’re ready to respond if we need to. And so this is part of the, kind of, brave new world that we’re in right now.

Jennifer Arnold: I’m Jennifer Arnold. I’m gonna be helping convene the caucus for my area. I know that a lot of my neighbors aren’t coming. I know that because last year I supported a bunch of folks to participate in the caucus process who hadn’t participated before, who speak Spanish. I accompanied folks and interpreted. And this year, none of those people are gonna participate. There is added security, but I would say no, there was nothing we could do to make it safe as long as they had to leave their homes to get here. How can you have democracy under occupation?

Applebaum: That’s also pretty reminiscent of things we’ve probably both seen before. When you have armed people on the street, then people are afraid to come out. Even people who have the right to vote, even people who are citizens. The presence or the expectation of violence scares people away from democracy. It sounds like people in Minnesota have been trying to do their best and keep these caucuses safe. But what could this suggest about what democratic participation in the United States might look like in the months ahead? I mean, that’s little-d democrat, not participation in the Democratic Party, but could this kind of military presence on the street scare people from voting?

Worth: I think it could. And one little indicator there: When I was in Minneapolis, and I was all over the city, and I saw very few Black faces, very few brown faces, in a city with a substantial minority population. And I think that’s because so many of them are afraid to come out. They were hiding inside their houses. They were having groceries delivered to them by their neighbors. And as we heard on that tape, many of them would be frightened to come out. And so if this gets replicated, if there’s a spreading of feelings of fear, the most vulnerable people will be frightened to turn out. And on the broader point, you and I have covered referenda in dictatorships and places where people are ostensibly allowed to come out and have their voices heard, but in fact, they know, number one, that they’re surrounded by soldiers. No doubt, that makes them feel terrified. Number two, they don’t trust that their vote is private and they probably feel that if they don’t pull the right lever, someone’s gonna come knocking on their door that night.

I don’t think we’re anywhere near that here, but when I was in Minneapolis, I did speak to people who said that after some kind of confrontation with ICE, the agents would then follow them—drive, follow them back to their houses, not to bang on the doors or anything, but just as an intimidation tactic to let them know, We know where you live. Just the very fact that they were willing to do that was shocking. The very fact that that fear is now entering into the political process, the caucus process, is a troubling one.

Applebaum: It’s true, and this may be something that a lot of Americans don’t know, just the act of voting doesn’t make democracy. So the vote itself alone isn’t enough. It’s about the preparation for the vote, the atmosphere in which it takes place, the way in which candidates are chosen. Of course, it’s the way the votes are counted, which is another issue. But I think a lot of people have a very simple idea of what it means to be a democracy, but actually you need a level playing field. You need people to have a sense that the vote was fair and that the process is fair. And what worries me is that this use of armed people on the streets is one of several ways in which we could lose that.

Worth: It’s a frightening thought. Elections become charades in a lot of autocratic countries. They are a way for the regime to maintain some kind of facade of legitimacy. But very few people actually feel that they’re exercising their right to vote when they go out on these referenda.

They sound like douchebags - was the intention to encourage the rejection?

Auditing is about establishing the truth about the situation within the company. Which is why AI should never be allowed to be used in the context of auditing. Or at the very least the auditors should never rely on the AI-generated results provided by the company. What&#39;s stopping companies from telling AI to generate a set of data that would make them pass an audit, hiding the real facts? Auditors should rely on facts, not confabulations, and should dig as deep as necessary to uncover all the dirt that&#39;s hi

Afterthought:Which is why auditors should actually be asking for more money because now they&#39;ve got to cut through even more corporate BS.

Come on, this is &quot;Bild Zeitung&quot; here, about as reliable as the NY Post (although not as bad as the National Inquirer).

I honestly didn&#39;t know that the NY Post is that bad.

do they piss green? and what does the drug test show?

When the entire thing turns out to be &#39;shrinkage&#39;

i bet they are at a nice comfortable room temperature when scanned, and things get a little smaller when they are outdoors in winter flying thru the air..

The answer to all these uniform issues is just have the Olympics return to form.

I think the source is a tabloid newspaper, not known for being accurate, and sorry to ruin the fun but it doesn&#39;t quite add up. If a looser fitting outfit was an advantage, people would just buy a looser fitting outfit. Also, stuff being loose and flapping about doesn&#39;t tend to improve aerodynamics or flight capability, quite the opposite in fact.

I wonder if there&#39;s a translation issue, because more-inside ought to translate to a tighter suit, not a looser suit. Perhaps they mean doing this enlarges the suit?

I wonder if there&#39;s a translation issue,No. The article is correct. Imagine if competitors could wear anything -- they would wear something like a wingsuit.

No. The article is correct. Imagine if competitors could wear anything -- they would wear something like a wingsuit.

And again, more inside = tighter. Nothing about this adds up.

Then as AmiMojo says, why don&#39;t they?Because the rules don&#39;t allow it. They specify that the suits must be tight against the skin, or something like that. Temporarily enlarging a body part is a workaround of the roles.

Because the rules don&#39;t allow it. They specify that the suits must be tight against the skin, or something like that. Temporarily enlarging a body part is a workaround of the roles.

Maybe, but could that really make any measurable difference to flight performance? If anything you would think that the protrusion would compromise the aero, not enhance it. Planes are smooth for a reason - they have been trying to reduce the bumps from bolts and riveting for over a century now, to the point where modern aircraft are made of layers of carbon fibre and adhesive.

The claim is that the increase in lift provides more benefit than the increase in drag takes away. If they are keeping their legs close together in the part where drag is a detriment (while accelerating) and then spreading out while in the air then this makes sense, and in fact that&#39;s what they do normally.

ought to translate to a tighter suit,I suspect that measurements are made in an &quot;inflated&quot; state, which is only temporary. Then, after the application of what seem to be rather stringent rules[1], the suits are looser when actually worn. Worn in cold weather, I might add, with its concomitant shrinkage effects. A certain amount of material is allocated, based on body size. But that can be redistributed to a certain extent.
[1] Undoubtedly an attempt to prevent some form of wingsuit [wikipedia.org] uniforms.

  More surface area means more lift and longer &quot;jumps&quot;.

If it&#39;s as simple as the amount of material affects performance, then it seems logical that they should specify standard sizes and either everyone uses the same (with padding) or they have divisions and a few fixed sizes.

A lot of sports have similar problems now. The margins are so small at the top levels, it becomes extremely difficult to make them fair. Like the amount of effort they put into making sure the sound from the starting gun in a sprint reaches the ears of every competitor at the same time.

It&#39;s not about it being a looser fit, but just being a bit larger and thus generating more lift.  I think the Guardian picked up more details, although still somewhat brief: https://www.theguardian.com/sp...  [theguardian.com]

As for looseness - who said anything about that?  A batwing suit is pretty loose until it&#39;s put in to action, why would this be any different?

Oh dear god. Now I am visualizing competitors finding ways to make their skin floppy in places so it parachutes out like a flying squirrel. Are you happy now?

https://www.nytimes.com/athlet... [nytimes.com]

&quot;professional&quot; and &quot;amateur&quot; sports are just stupid.

Rather than injecting chemicals into your dick, which sounds a bit extreme, couldn&#39;t they just do a &quot;Spinal Tap&quot; and shove a foil-wrapped pickle down there?

Do Olympic officials actually inspect your junk before/after ski jumps ?

This is during the fitting session for the suits, not in the course of the actual competition.

And yes, they do some kind of a 3d scan with the competitor standing in his underwear with a &quot;medical professional&quot; in attendance while this is underway.

...sold out of Hyaluronic Acid. Recommended dose? Asking for a friend.

Wow, truly creative - perhaps this aspect could be spun off into it&#39;s own sport as ski-jumping is stupid, unnecessary and boring - it&#39;s at the anti-sweet spot of sport.

Ski jumpers cheating by looking at porn before being scanned for their suit.

By that logic all these ski jumpers should just get castrated if they were really serious

I didn&#39;t complain when you wanted to shrink your junk for my amusement (steroids) and I&#39;m not going to complain if you want to pop your junk like a balloon for my amusement....

If you think addictive design isn&#39;t a thing, I suggest you visit Las Vegas and walk through any casino gaming floor. You&#39;ll find it a disorienting experience beyond anything you&#39;ll encounter elsewhere. Flashing lights, constant noise, lack of reference points to tell where you are. Hells, even the carpets are custom designs for the casino featuring abstract patterns in contrasting colors that confuse your sense of direction. And to top it off, mirrors everywhere that reflect the floor and make the space seem larger than it is. All of it&#39;s designed very deliberately to achieve an effect: leave you confused about where you are, what direction you need to go to get somewhere, even what time it is. The goal: keep you wandering the gaming floor for as long as possible so you have the greatest chance of getting attracted to the games and starting to play and the greatest chance of not realizing how long you&#39;ve been there or how much you&#39;ve truly spent playing.

Flashing lights, constant noise, lack of reference points to tell where you are. Hells, even the carpets are custom designs for the casino featuring abstract patterns in contrasting colors that confuse your sense of direction.You&#39;re right in that Vegas casinos are designed to keep people in and playing, but that has nothing to do with addictive design. The loud &quot;winning&quot; noises play into that, but not the confusingly laid out floor plans. 

At any rate, the trend is away from that style of casino floor. The Bellagio and Wynn casino floors are clean and neatly laid out. The Wynn even has windows. Ditto the Aria.

The worst thing about addictive app (and website) design is, that companies employ real psychologist to help them design a product that makes kids addicted (and possibly makes them trick their parents in paying for in app purchases). I always wonder if the psychologists don&#39;t have any kind of ethics code, because you can&#39;t tell yourself you&#39;re helping anyone when you design a phone app to maximize usage time.

Douyin - the Chinese version of TikTok - is very different from what TikTok is in the West.  While the latter inspires various types of narcissistic and degrading behavior, such as twerking or gluttony, the former is an absolutely wholesome platform that inspires its users to be the best versions of themselves.  One doesn&#39;t see Chinese in China engaging in the same sort of antics that people in the West do: there&#39;s no way the Beijing regime would tolerate it

So instead of engaging w/ Oracle, the EU could a

this is so childlike in it naivety as to be kinda sweet, like when your adolescent nephew has an idea they are proud of but no awareness of the greater world to ground it.

Seems to be working pretty well for the Chinese, though!  You don&#39;t see their social media rampant w/ people boasting about how they smoke joints, or marvelling at Osama&#39;s letter to America.  Instead, they&#39;re busy showcasing their skills, whether it&#39;s playing violins, solving Rubik&#39;s cubes, draftsmanship drawings and so on

Maybe they can address Youtube, Facebook and Twitter next... for the exact same reasons.

The EU is exactly right about the design but they are missing that many websites and phone applications are like this. You need only look at which websites/software companies have hired neuroscientists to identify the worst offenders.

And facebooks algorithms and data sold to that forgotten comoany for targeted advertising that caused brexit aren&#39;t illegal?

I would expect Canada to have the same &quot;large country&quot; problem we do and go more towards hybrids. They also have cheap hydro as well which helps EV adoption.

And no, don&#39;t tell me that Canada is much larger. That&#39;s not the &quot;large country&quot; problem. The large country problem means: if you are driving more than a day in the same direction, do you pass enough infrastructure for your mode of transport? And that&#39;s as valid for Norway as it is for Canada.

But how many EVs are away from the coast in Norway?  As far as I understand it, most people live on the coast.  Also I&#39;m going to go out on a limb and say you can take trains around Norway if you are going somewhere an EV may be awkward.

Yet there is room for Oslo which is on the coast.  The point being that it hardly goes below -10 there.  How many people actually live and have EVs where it is -30c?

This is relevant because people are uniformly distributed in Canada and Nunavut has the same population density as the Quebec Cityâ&quot;Windsor Corridor...

There are way more people in Canada that are not within 4 hours from the US border.  Millions.  There are millions that live in cities not on the TransCanada highway where they put chargers.  There are no trains here and taking an airplane has gotten rediculously expensive.  I would prefer my mode of travel to be as reliable as possible with as little dependency on infrastructure as possible.

85% of the population lives in urban areas, the average commute time is well under half an hour. Quit making shit up.

I don&#39;t care what my average commute time is.  I buy a vehicle for all times.

For towing your imaginary boat from coast to coast?

So you own a semi tractor for when you need to move house?

You can go anywhere in an EV in Norway. Why spend your life wondering what the answers to these questions are, when you can simply go on A Better Route Planner and see for yourself? Plug in any start and end point, and what car you have, and it will tell you charging you need to do.

I did a quick check, with a cheap EV, the MS S5. You can get a brand new long range one for about 23k GBP including tax, or about $25k before tax. One end of Norway to the other, right up into the Arctic Circle, is no problem at

That train will not be coast to coast in my lifetime.  Too many areas where the found is just too unstable.

The USA doesn&#39;t have high speed rail outside of the occasional talk about something getting built.

Not quite the same.  Canada&#39;s population is spread out from Nova Scotia to Vancouver, most along the US border.  The bulk of Norway&#39;s population lives south of Trondheim.  So Norwegians who are not going on mountaineering expeditions to the north of their country can cover the entire populated part of their country in their EVs, as well as distribute them evenly

Around 85% of Canadians live in urban areas, and the average one-way commute time is around 27 minutes (and about 9km or about 5.6 miles). It&#39;s a bit bigger in larger cities like Vancouver or Toronto, but then again those cities have public transit, so many people can get by without having to drive a car, at least to work.

Most people do not live 50 miles from the workplace, so an EV would be sufficient. With more Chinese imports about to appear, my next vehicle will almost certainly be an EV, and I&#39;ll keep

People buy a vehicle to serve all their purposes, not 90% of their purposes.  Putting it another way, if the vehicle is going to be useless to me 10% of the time, it had better be 10% cheaper.

That sounds about right.  Except maybe for people who don&#39;t drive anywhere except to their nearby pharmacy and grocery store

Sprawl is incredibly expensive to service. Suburbs are probably the most inefficient way to deal with housing ever invented, between having to deliver utilities, expand fire protection and policing, and just plain road maintenance, there&#39;s a reason that we should eschew suburbs and sprawl in favor of density.

Not me...I gave up sharing walls with other people when I quit being a broke college student having to live in apartments.

I like having a nice big back yard fenced in for my dog to run around in, to hold crawfish boils and parties with my friends, to keep my large log burning offset smoker for BBQ....Big Green Egg XL for a lump charcoal grill...be able to plant a veggie garden, etc.

No thank you, I&#39;d much rather have a garage to keep my bicycle and motorcycle and brewing equipment...a nice driveway, etc. and elbow room between myself and my fine neighbors who are all great.

And if nothing else, I didn&#39;t spend a lifetime building a good audio system to not exercise the dB range from time to time....and not living in a cramped apartment I won&#39;t annoy my neighbors....too much.

But hey thankfully in the US, it is a LARGE nation, and we&#39;ve plenty of room and cities where people can live how they want to live....rural, small cities, regular cities and dense urban ones like NYC.

So, live like you want to live....and I will too.  I&#39;ll only draw the line when someone tries to fucking FORCE me into a living style.

Your way of life is effectively subsidized, and at some point it simply will not be affordable. The difficulty supplying water alone in many parts of the US will basically cause suburbs to die. Your notion of personal freedoms cannot override reality, no matter how often you pound the table.

Then let the wealthy go first and make sacrifices, since they have the resources to do that.  Then I will follow once there are mature solutions to this.  Carbon tax in Canada was beautiful because the wealthy could drive there yachts and were contributing proportionately with everyone else.

>Then let the wealthy go first and make sacrifices

Yeah, like that will ever happen! Lol. Until it is immoral to be stinking rich, nothing will change.

The wealthy aren&#39;t going to go first, and the sacrifices will be imposed. Oddly enough, the universe doesn&#39;t give a fuck how you feel.Future generations can have their freedom-less shithole society when I&#39;m done with it.  I care about the universe as much as it cares about me..

People have raised families in all manner of housing arrangements. Don&#39;t confuse cultural norms with actual human requirements.

It would seem that after a suburb exceeds a certain population level, it would become its own city, producing its own utilities, fire safety and policing, as well as other civic amenities.  The original city that it grew from - it needn&#39;t be eternally tied to that

But people still need to drive there.  Who will put chargers where there is nothing but black flies?

If you have a road going through a 400km area of nothingness and many EVs coming through there are going to have less than 400km range then you need a charger there somewhere.  Or are we going to just abandon public routes because EVs?  This will cut off entire towns and villages.  There are many roads that are just on ice that go for hundreds of kilometers that are vital to communities.

Yes we&#39;ve all seen &quot;Ice Road Truckers&quot; on TV.  No one is suggesting that those or other vehicles in remote communities be replaced by EVs (unless there is a major advance in technology).  Saying we can move to 90% EVs because of the 2% of niche case that can&#39;t use EVs is a disingenuous argument.

Ok but if we move to 90% EVs then eventually someone will need to drive that with an EV.  You are suggesting we don&#39;t talk about glaring problems with the technology and just accept being forced into it with obvious hindrances?

Battery technology IS improving, so by the time we get to that 90% point, we will probably see 400+ mile ranges from EVs.

I&#39;m really wonder how many &quot;no this time they are doing solid state batteries really&quot; articles I&#39;m going to read before they happen.

The thing that I&#39;d be worried about is that when you get to that EV charging station in the middle of nowhere, it&#39;s out of service and you&#39;re basically screwed.

Maybe it got hit by a snow plow. Maybe it got vandalized by some anti EV luddites. Maybe the company who built it just can&#39;t afford to maintain it anymore. Either way, you&#39;re still screwed.

Well yes so now there needs to be two or three times the required chargers along the route.

And there ain&#39;t going to be any Internet for miles around either.

And there ain&#39;t going to be any Internet for miles around either.

Ok I&#39;m with ya on all the other comments and arguments, except this one.

I grew up before there WAS an internet.....being without it is no big deal.

Sure it makes life fun, but its no big deal to go without it for spans of time.

Pretty much all chargers rely on phone apps and Internet access as far as I understand, and many EV drivers say they need to use their cars displays to find chargers

How does that argument not also apply to gas stations in the middle of nowhere?

Gas stations with snacks in the middle of nowhere are a much more profitable business and also require much less power than chargers in the middle of nowhere.  So they are much more prevalent.  Also if you know you are going into an area without gas you have the option of carrying some with you.

People have to be at EV chargers for 15+ minutes so it makes no sense to not put snacks at the hypothetical EV charger in the middle of nowhere.

Well the reality of that involves a lot of math.  The electricity price that people pay to charge needs to support the massive infrastructure to bring the electricity there plus manning the station and having an employee there in a place that is desolate.  That could work, or it could make it prohibitavely expensive for most people to charge anyway.

If you have a lot of equipment and customers there you will want an employee there to serve as a deterrent and witness to crimes, even if it&#39;s just a security guard and the snacks are automated.

But it makes more sense to put a larger concession there, like one of those combined fast food operations. That is, the same kind of stuff you would have at a gas station.

It also makes more sense to have at least two locations on a long stretch.

I live in southern BC. We haven&#39;t had a snowfall here that lasted more than a few hours, and almost the entire winter has been above 0.

Southern BC is probably one of the very warmest places in Canada.  It&#39;s clear that the whole Pacific coast is better.

Tell that to the people in Norway where EV adoption is through the roof...

There is a news story, probably NYT or Politico or BBC (I cannot recall where exactly) that the rejection of the U.S. from Canada is catching on with the rest of the world. There are apps in Europe that will tell you whether some company builds stuff with U.S. parts. Way to go, el Bunko. Are you tired of (*^(&^% winning yet?

Yup people have been saying that for 50 years yet here we are.

Jesus you fucking Trumpers are a pack of idiots. Christ almighty, we actually have an economist running the country, you have a fucking moron knee deep in dementia, who was a raving idiot even when he wasn&#39;t rotting.

Don&#39;t forget the Tariff of Nottingham also shit his pants on live TV.

Big man, strong man, smelly man that had to end a press session early.

Imagine if Biden shit his pants on live TV like that.

He didn&#39;t, but I&#39;m happy to talk about how Trump did.

Want to take a little bet, sinij?  $1000 says you&#39;re full of shit.

Oh stop your TDS!  Trump has made those all into wonderful things!

Canada certainly does not buy energy from Russia.

We do buy electronics from China (as does the USA).  So what?  China has never threatened to annex Canada.  So although it&#39;s a disgusting dictatorship, China is at the moment less of a strategic threat to Canada than the USA is.

Sounds like a plan to wind down the Canadian auto industry.

Master class is political division.  Let the market get flooded with cheap imports so most folks don&#39;t care, &#39;cars are cheaper then ever!&#39; pretty much assures nobody will stand up for the auto workers losing jobs and future.

Typical political class thinking, sell off the things my grandparents built to pay for power and privilege today, with no thought spared for consequences of de-instustrialization tomorrow, or religious like faith that the rest of

Suddenly competition in the market is bad. How odd.

2026: Announce objective of 90% EV by 20402027-2035: Do nothing2036: Announce that the 2040 objective of 90% is not realistic and must be scrapped. But all current politicians involved are going to be out of office/retired.

That&#39;s basically what they did with the 2035 objective.How about they set a realistic objective for the next 4 years (one mandate)? It could be like having 15% EV by 2030.

No, it is clearly the US that are shutting the doors. Very obviously, the Trump administration wants to go it alone - either others accept extortionous terms (why should they?) or nothing. Forget a fair deal. Ok, then don&#39;t be surprised if the rest of the world gives the US the middle finger. All the US has going for themselves is momentum, and that&#39;s quickly drying up. Trust is long gone, good luck to get it back within our lifetimes.

Excellent job agent Krasnov is doing for his master.

That&#39;s what Russia does, and the Putin puppet named Donald Trump is following orders very well.

This is brilliant.  It&#39;s just what the Chinese did with Tesla.  1) Invite them in, 2) Learn how to make their cars 3) Use that knowledge to launch local versions. China now makes arguably better electric cars than Tesla, and it looks like the Canadians are going to learn how to do it too.  They certainly have the raw materials for it.

It&#39;s actually pretty obvious that is Trump&#39;s whole strategy and the only way to &#39;reconcile&#39; with him is to give him exactly what he wants.  He is negotiating based on the weight of tariffs that probably isn&#39;t even legal.  Any country that is &#39;cooperating&#39; with him is just trying to appease him and bide their time.

Canada needs to at least wait for the tariff decision from the supreme Court before doing anything.

>Canada needs to at least wait for the tariff decision from the supreme Court before doing anything.

The tariff decision from the SC won&#39;t mean anything, because they have already found other justifications for the tariffs. So don&#39;t expect tariffs to be discontinued even if he loses.

With each plan its a lot more work and harder to sell to the public with midterms coming.  Also it&#39;s Trump so it&#39;s probably a bluff.  At any rate, you can&#39;t do everything a bully wants because he may hit you.  That&#39;s just not how it works with adults.

Canada has always done far better than the US in economic hard times.  Americans will hurt more than Canadians will.  The tariff for steel and aluminium has already raised the price of cars by an avg of $12k.  You do realize that 40% of the gas in your tank is from Canada.  The Venezuela thing was a rediculous piece of theater.  That country is going to take 10 years just to build enough infrastructure to extract oil, then there is crime and corruption.  The oil companies don&#39;t want any part of that.

Cheeto has shown he rarely holds up his end of the bargain. Now you&#39;re standing there dumbfounded as to why countries aren&#39;t doing business with the US anymore.

Exactly.  It&#39;s not like it&#39;s just doing what Trump says once and he will be happy.  You get under his thumb once and you are never getting out.  I don&#39;t accept &quot;kiss goodbye to everything you know&quot; as a cost of negotiation.

Bullshit.  For most of Canada&#39;s existence, the USA had incredibly high tariffs on our goods.  The recent period of relatively free trade was a historical anomaly.

We survived before and we&#39;ll survive again.  And when the USA comes sniffing around for critical minerals, we can tell them to negotiate a free trade agreement or fuck off.

You don&#39;t even live in Canada and you act like the country is going to fold up tomorrow. I&#39;ve seen some cult followers in my day but holy shit you&#39;re racing to the front of the line to get that first glass of kool aid.

Considering that the US attacked Canada, why is it Canada&#39;s job to reconcile?

All this is just the consequences of American actions.

Trump&#39;s physical and mental health degrades every day.  If he doesn&#39;t drop dead of a stroke in a few months he&#39;ll be impeached and removed from office after the midterms. The best strategy is to stand up to him now and delay making any agreements with the USA until his replacement takes over.

How in debt are people living in Toronto who have an old house on a postage stamp lot that they had to sink $1 million or more into?  400k isn&#39;t actually that bad at all.

The point is that if it is managable and considered realistic for families then it&#39;s not unreasonable for the country.  Keep in mind that money the government spends is also an investment in the health and well being of its people.  It also circulates through the economy so it&#39;s not like a house.

How do you define &quot;out of control&quot;. Canada&#39;s credit rating, even with the economic assaults of our neighbor, remains very good and very stable. There&#39;s no massive hike in borrowing costs.

It&#39;s almost as if you&#39;re just making shit up.

Exactly.  Canada&#39;s debt-to-GDP ratio is lower than the USA&#39;s.

Maybe running a government and running a family are different?

And it helps every family when you spend.... So?

People really don&#39;t understand the difference between spending money, and investing money in things that will end up making money.   Picture in the USA if the &quot;how will we pay for it?!?&quot; crowd were in charge when the Interstate highway system was built.   Of course, back then, the very wealthy had a top marginal tax rate of 95%, so the wealthy people were paying for a lot of things they are not paying for now.   These days, someone making $50,000 per year pays a higher percentage of their income in taxes th

You&#39;re going to have to be more specific.

Do you trust the white house press secretary who said &quot;White House Press Secretary said: “This is from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from The Lion King. Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public.” and not &quot;Donald Trump made no such post&quot;?

But otherwise you can find every news source reporting this and it seems like the whitehouse is at least proud to defend postin

Did you see today&#39;s news?That is an extremely vague reference. There was a lot of news.

That is an extremely vague reference. There was a lot of news.

Obama would have been impeached in 10 minutes had he told all the honkys to chill out.

I&#39;m surprised they didn&#39;t do it because he wore that tan suit.

For now.  At some point, Trump will piss off enough other nations that they&#39;ll stop buying US treasury bills, or even sell some of them off.  Then the $38T US national debt will look a whole lot less sustainable.

I have been seeing a lot of articles this year about the range you get from an EV after it parks in -30c over night.  Sounds to me like you will be lucky to get home.

I know I may never be able to afford one in my lifetime.  I am looking at doing a second across-Canada move in my life with belongings in a tailor and three pets.  I&#39;m very afraid of one day having to try it with an EV.

Wait until you see what the US government pays the big auto makers.

And crypto is just one of the symptoms. People see the utterly tiny number of people at the very top and think that is somehow normal. That they will end up there. That it is just one move away.
Coupled with pop culture mentality, it really messes people up.

Crypto is a bit like gold. And people seem to not get that the buildup the peaks is just pecuniary input, at some point the selloff begins, and those controlling the selloff profit immensely at the start of the selloff.

Silver is down pretty significantly, Gold is essentially flat, the stock market is a touch down over the same time period... Of course the USD in general is down a tad compared to Euro for the time period.

Silver is down pretty significantly, Gold is essentially flatWhat? The price of gold is up like 50% over the past 6 months. The price of silver has doubled (and peaked much higher than that). The dollar weakening contributes some to that if you&#39;re measuring in USD terms, but it hasn&#39;t weakened by that much.

It is not just prices that are rising.What actually is happening is that the dollar is falling like a stone since a year.

On top of that oil/gas (energy in general) is rising. And those are in a huge deal paid in dollar.

Simple math, dollar drops 10%, oil rises 10%, this makes 20% in total.

The price rise in energy affects the whole supply chain. So it adds on every step.

And: energy suddenly got scarce because of AI and a stronger northern winter ... so you have three effects hitting on the same nail.

It isn&#39;t just RAM. Speculation is now in overdrive in just about all markets. Pick one.....precious metals [...]The difference being if you end up holding the hot potato in the precious metals markets, you have the option of holding real physical metal.  Maybe you can make jewelry with it, or electronics.  What do you do with crypto files if they&#39;re the hot potato no one wants to touch?  It&#39;s clearly a scam.  I&#39;d rather speculate on potatoes or other things that can go bad but can also be eaten.

If they are not convicted, they are not criminals.

False. They are not convicted criminals. Someone who committed a crime still committed it whether they have gone to court about it or not. A murder doesn&#39;t become not a murder just because the murderer isn&#39;t brought to justice.

My opinion is that we should have signs which make sense even if you don&#39;t read the local language, especially since our country has no official language, but also like real countries do.

So, tell us you have never listened to any news other than Faux Noise and truth social.

Btw, the so-called Somali fraud? It was run by a WHITE woman, American citizen, and about 100 people were involved.

For those, like me, who are predicting The Meltdown, this is not it, it is just a bull trap.Previously it was overvalued by 100%, it is still overvalued by 100%.

Crypto culture is dying. It wasn&#39;t much of a culture to begin with, just a bunch of morons who were pumping thin air, but they were excited - they had dreams! They all hated wallstreet and institutions, which excluded them, or so they felt. They were going to show the world! Well, the world was impressed with the amount of money they poured into bitcon and their old enemies from the institiutions showed up and began to take over - and the whole thing became massively awash with husksters and lies and trainwrecks to the point that its synonomous with a scam now.

But the true belivers are going to hang on for the rest of their lives pumping crypto. The pumps may get smaller and smaller and the bags they hold may get heavier and heavier, but I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll give up until they&#39;re in the grave and their grandchildren will be wondering why they inhereted a quadrillion snotcoins. So I don&#39;t see a 100% destruction of bitcoin for at least a few decades.

Scamming is so baked into crypto culture that crypto fans commonly blame the victims for being dumb enough to get caught up in a scam or having their wallet stolen, rather than blaming the criminal or organized the scam. The notion of scam protection (a key part of current financial systems, from credit card fraud rollbacks to bank account insurance) is entirely alien in the crypto world.

The little guy in the crypto world can get scammed endlessly and it&#39;s their fault.  But the whales, it&#39;s different

Another thing is just the massive amount of Dunning-Kruger economics at their core.  For example, bragging about how it&#39;s deflationary.  You don&#39;t want a deflationary currency.  Deflation, or even a lack of inflation, are economically harmful; it crushes your economy, as people don&#39;t want to spend.  Economies are maximized by small, predictable, positive inflation.  Too much or too little, and fluctuations in it, are harmful . Crypto people don&#39;t care about the fluctuations, and celebrate deflation.

Crypto is useless. Do I really need to remind anyone that crypto is useless?There is no specific need for bitcoin in the world, it&#39;s a solution looking for a problem.If I had a bitcoin, I couldn&#39;t do anything with it other than sit on it and pray that it&#39;s worth more some day, but still, in order to derive concrete utility from it I would have to first get rid of it and convert to real money instead.It&#39;s a very formidable waste of resources, akin to growing tulips instead of something useful.You can&#39;t eat tulips. Well even with tulips they might be edible but you could probably grow a lot of potatoes for all the work you dedicate into cultivating a rare tulip.

Exactly. But many people seem to have an education so incredibly bad these days that they do not know or understand that basic fact.

Yup, sure. But... just to play devil&#39;s advocate for a bit... this has been your position since years ago when BTC was at  $1, right? So WHY THE FUCK should anyone listen to you?

YOUR position has been that a tulip is just a flower but I was able to buy a fine house with 1 tulip bulb in 1636. So WHY THE FUCK should anyone listen to you?

Yeah, sanctions busting, online crime, black market sales, etc are the use case of cryptocurrency as a currency, rather than just as a collectible.

IMHO, one of the best-argued cases [wired.com] for Satoshi Nakamoto is Paul Le Roux [wikipedia.org] (a talented cryptography coder and an international crime lord), specifically to make it easier to accept payments and move money around in his criminal empire) (and the reason that Satoshi never spent his Bitcoin is that Le Roux was arrested and his computers seized)

Lol, Wright should be near the absolute bottom of Satoshi candidates [wikipedia.org].

Crypto is NOT useless, it is a currency where anyone can pay anyone,A currency that fluctuates against FIAT currencies as much as crypto does at the speed it does is not useful as a method of payment which is why no legitimate companies or people with a functioning brain accept it as payment. Can I pay my rent with it? No. Can I buy my gas with it? No. Can I buy my grocery shopping with it? No. The only places it&#39;s accepted as payment for goods or services is for dodgy illegal stuff like drugs and kiddy porn on the dark web.

BTC is statistically used only for speculation and crimes

No it is useless, at least if we are talking Bitcoin specifically.

Bitcoin specifically fails at everything it set out to do, other then perhaps resist political pressure to increase supply.  It is to easy for a small number of actors to exert various types of control over the change, even just simple gatekeeping.  It is far to slow and costly to do settlements so its right back to middlemen and batching transactions, complete with the usual financial games like float management etc, entities like exchanges

No it is useless, at least if we are talking Bitcoin specifically.One real sign that you are right about this is that the actual insiders chose to create a separate Trumpcoin, fully separate from Bitcoin when they wanted to use crypto for serious fraud. That is not a vote of confidence from people who actually have access to US government internal information.

It&#39;s not about confidence or lack thereof in shitcoin. It&#39;s about controlling the coin making it easier to do more fraud.

Crypto is useful. It can get around international currency transfer limits, facilitate transactions into and out of sanctioned countries and  ay for things that normally can&#39;t be legally traded. Essentially its use is to facilitate some sort of illegal transaction unable to be completed through the normal banking system. For this to be useful it simply has to have some value and be stable enough too not hugely change value while those transfer occur.

My theory on why China has had a significant crypto mining

Crypto is useful. It can get around international currency transfer limitsIt isn&#39;t useful for those because of how wild and how fast the swings can be. It had a 15% drop over 10hrs yesterday between 14:40 on Thursday and 00:15 Friday morning and it&#39;s still down 5% over the price yesterday. That&#39;s not useful as a currency.

For a currency transfer even that rate of variability is not a problem. You can simply divide your currency transfer into tiny segments and immediately (no more than minutes) convert to and from the cryptocurrency.That doesn&#39;t make sense, though, with Bitcoin because transaction costs are so high. Crypto can only have a chance of success once Bitcoin burns.

When you wake up and find your new (and only) digital fiat currency value swinging in the wind like shitcoin is right now?  It won&#39;t though and we already have the evidence. Most FIAT currency only exists electronically and FOREX trades can be executed 10,000 times faster than a BTC transaction. The reasons that they don&#39;t swing as wildly and as fast as crypto is because those currencies actually have functional use and are backed by governments and central banks.

The primary use of Bitcoin is to have a money that no one can mess with. Unlike your bank account, it can not be blocked or frozen.ROFLMAO. UK law enforcement in 2018 seized 61,000 BTC worth $5Bn [bbc.co.uk]. 5 months ago the US government seized 127,721 BTC worth more than $14bn (£10.5bn) [bbc.co.uk].

Usually this happens because they don&#39;t have their own wallet, but use a service. If you use your own wallet, short of physically restraining you, they can&#39;t do squat.

Yes and governments historically famously cannot physically detain you. It never happens!

Yes, but that&#39;s not beceause of *government* meddling. Well, not government meddling in the one specific way that crypto types believe governments meddle.

If you are not in the US this *might* be a relevant consideration, if you are in the US and are not prepared like bug out bag ready headed strait for the airport have citizenship else were you can go the instant things start to get interesting, this is also irrelevant.

Crypto made the rich even richer. It&#39;s all a grift. Here&#39;s a detailed breakdown. https://archive.ph/NDMbH [archive.ph]

I know a few people who actually did make *some* good money with bitcoin - they were geeks who had actually mined it early in the game - like pre-2010, when it was still computationally very cheap. They had basically ran that miner as a kind of fun little process in the background - same guys who had run things like Seti@Home or Folding@Home.

Then they had forgotten about the whole thing, and 5-10 years later noticed that the little toy is suddenly worth around 10000 USD/EUR per BTC. They sold at that point

Oh I was following bitcoin from the early days when Gizmodo was actually worth reading. Had I bought $10 back then I&#39;d be retired now.

It is apparently useful for sex trafficking and terrorism financing???

The worst one will be when crapto gets a realistic value, namely zero. That is sure to happen sooner or later. This one here is just the worst one so far.

All spent playing &quot;Guess The Magic Number!&quot; over and over and over again.

How have these people not realized yet that Bitcoin moves opposite &quot;reserve assets&quot; like gold?  Bitcoin surges during speculative market booms, and crashes when the market is full of fear.  It&#39;s always been this way.  It&#39;s the extreme opposite of a reserve asset.  People buy Bitcoin on the idea of getting some huge market return.  They flee when there&#39;s any signs of the market turning south (people needing to take money out / lack of new money flowing in) so that they&#39;re not left holding the bag and so they

It&#39;s all just an idea at the end of the day.

Gold&#39;s value is just a shared delusion like any other token.

It&#39;s like belief in a god, it&#39;s power is proportional to the number of people who also believe.

Jewelry demand is also intrinsic.  The simple fact is that people like owning gold for reasons other than money.  There may be trends for how much people desire to have gold stuff, but it has value beyond just as money.

Beyond intrinsic values, only a tiny fraction of Bitcoin investors are doing so because they have some notion that if the economy crashes, they&#39;ll be out buying their food with Bitcoin.  It&#39;s purely a speculative temporary transaction - they put money in when they think it&#39;s going to go up an

I&#39;m just going for large-dividend stocks and buying/holding.  Toss it in a DRIP, and just walk off.  I don&#39;t watch the market.  I just walk off.  Alternatively, index funds.  Let people who know more than I figure out where to stick stuff.

I wish the US could start selling &quot;innovation bonds&quot;.  Like war bonds, except aimed at money for PARC/Bell Labs style research to make new stuff, even if it isn&#39;t immediately marketable.

The TL/DR, boring stuff.  If you want to hedge against a potential market implosion, stagflation, etc. you want to be in boring consumer staples, durable goods, and basic services. Even better if the companies are heavily indebted.

For example, picture a company that has $1B income on sales of essential after COGS but $900M in debt repayments. $100M profit and a lot of risk = low valuation.  Then stagflation hits, and the economy racks up a total of 10% inflation.  The company sells just as much volume (they&#39;re essential goods), but now they&#39;re $1,1B in sales due to inflation. But their debt repayments remain $900M, since it&#39;s based on a fixed amount of dollars.  Now they have $200M profit and a lot less risk = high valuation.  And since as a general rule inflation doesn&#39;t go into reverse, this is a 2x permanent boost to the company&#39;s profits.

Another thing you can do is sell covered calls or do options spreads on index funds.  In general it&#39;s poor advice to take an overall bearish position on broader markets (the long term trends are strongly upwards, and net downtrends are rare), but it can be quite reasonable to sell off your potential upside.  For example, if a given index is at $1000, maybe instead of just buying shares at $1000 each, you also write $1150-strike options (each covering 100x shares) against the shares you buy, using the extra

The fact it is down against the USD by 42% means whatever weakening the dollar experienced, BTC experienced 42% *more* devaluation...

Imagine you attend a protest, like hundreds of thousands of Americans have since President Donald Trump began his second term. Perhaps it is a No Kings event, or a local ICE demonstration to protest Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s crackdown on immigrants in your community. During the protest, you take a video of yourself and your fellow protesters, caption it “Abolish ICE,” and upload it to Instagram. A few weeks later, there’s a knock on your door. Federal agents stand before you, demanding to question you.

You’re wondering to yourself: Do they know about the protest I attended? Are they legally allowed to track me? Do I have to comply?

The answer to these first two questions is, shockingly, yes, and it’s made possible in part by a little-known power that the Trump administration has supercharged in recent months. The answer to the last question is much more complicated. The Department of Homeland Security is one of a number of federal agencies with something called administrative subpoena power, and it has been leveraging that tool in unprecedented ways under Trump 2.0. The Washington Post detailed these abuses this week, focusing on the story of a U.S. citizen targeted by DHS for simply emailing a federal prosecutor his opinion about the federal government’s case against an Afghan national facing deportation.

How can something like this happen? Congress has granted administrative subpoena power to federal agencies, like the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Federal Communications Commission, to allow them to access information quickly to make decisions about issues under their purview. A key distinction between administrative subpoenas and civil or criminal ones is that federal agencies do not need a judge’s sign-off. These agencies retain the power to approve administrative subpoenas themselves. This also means that agencies can demand documents without needing to prove that there is an ongoing investigation into or probable cause against a person when issuing administrative subpoenas.

Federal agencies are not legally required to disclose how many administrative subpoenas they issue, but under the Trump administration, unnamed sources told the Post, the volume of administrative subpoenas is “well into the thousands, if not tens of thousands.” Lindsay Nash, a professor at Cardozo School of Law, authored a study on the immigration subpoena power and found, through publicly available regulations and internal records, that ICE has empowered its employees—even those focused on civil immigration enforcement—“to demand records and testimony from any person or entity in order to obtain information for any civil or criminal investigation within the agency’s broad domain.”

“At present, there is generally no requirement that officers have probable cause, identify the suspected violation, or exercise restraint,” Nash wrote. This is being exemplified with abuses like the one documented in the Post story, plus footage of federal agents taking pictures of protesters and threatening to add them to “a nice little database,” which some anonymous national security officials claim does in fact exist as a way for DHS and the FBI to track people labeled as “domestic terrorists.” (DHS publicly denies that there is such a database.)

The Trump administration’s heavy use of administrative subpoenas comes as the judiciary—including Republican-appointed judges—has been turning against its immigration enforcement tactics. Just this week, a court blocked the White House from ending temporary protected status for over 350,000 Haitian immigrants living in the U.S., while the chief judge of the District of Minnesota concluded that ICE has most likely violated more court orders in January alone than “some federal agencies have violated in their entire existence.”

Administrative subpoenas are a convenient work-around for an administration that knows it faces an uphill battle if it takes its information requests to a judge, a process that requires a formal investigation. Instead of having to meet a strict legal standard, DHS can issue administrative subpoenas to private individuals, tech companies, schools, state governments, and other entities in order to access information about people it’s interested in targeting. It has already tried to take this path to acquire data on folks who track ICE in their local communities. Generally, targeted organizations do not have to notify individuals that their information is being sought by the federal government. However, these groups are not actually obliged to comply with these subpoenas absent judicial action. As Michelle Lapointe, legal director at American Immigration Council, told Slate, administrative subpoenas are not self-enforcing. “When people receive an administrative subpoena from ICE, technically they don’t have to respond,” she said. “The agency can go to court and seek the records to be compelled from the individual who is served with the subpoena. But it has to do that extra step to make it enforceable.”

Lapointe noted that oftentimes recipients of these subpoenas do end up complying out of fear, which DHS appears to be manipulating. The Post story, for instance, described what happened to the U.S. citizen who had emailed the federal prosecutor: Federal agents showed up at his doorstep after he failed to comply with an administrative subpoena. The agents questioned him about the email, asking how he had found the attorney’s email address—through a basic Google search. After about 20 minutes, the agents left.

Critically, tech companies, including Google and Meta, have received administration subpoenas since Trump took office last year, but it’s not always clear when they comply. A Google spokesperson told TechCrunch that it pushes back against overbroad or improper subpoenas, while spokespeople for Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and Snap told the Post their companies alert users about administrative subpoena requests unless they are barred from doing so or face extenuating circumstances.

In a case about six separate Instagram accounts that named and shamed a Border Patrol agent who was part of the Los Angeles immigration raids last summer, DHS sent Meta an administrative subpoena asking for the accounts’ names, email addresses, and phone numbers. In that instance, the Instagram account users were made aware of the subpoena, and a judge ordered Meta not to comply.

The issue here is that Americans are left to simply hope these tech companies operate in good faith and out of the goodness of their hearts, something that “should be alarming to all of us,” Lapointe noted. The threat remains that these companies may end up complying with DHS requests in order to get the administration off their backs, even when subpoenas are unwarranted. “I do think the acquiescence of tech and government makes it especially difficult as a functional matter to protect individual rights when you have administrative subpoena authority,” Dennis Fan, an associate professor at Columbia Law School and a former federal prosecutor, told Slate. Attending a protest is a constitutionally protected right, as is writing an email that contains your political opinions, but the Trump administration is finding ways to use these actions against its citizens by leaning into third parties—aka Big Tech—who have access to your personal, identifying information. These are companies that have positioned themselves as friendly partners of the White House, given that many of the country’s tech billionaires personally donated to Trump’s inauguration, then were conspicuously seated in the front row.

Where does that leave the average American? The answer is complicated. Lapointe believes that the best thing we can do is remain aware of our constitutional rights and not let Big Tech get away with selling out Americans without a fight. “I think pressure can be brought to bear, the more we raise awareness that these requests could come through and that the tech companies might receive them, requesting your information,” Lapointe said. “Using public pressure campaigns to encourage them to resist these attempts to get at private information could be helpful.”

So if you exercise your First Amendment right to protest injustices you believe your government is committing, you risk being targeted by that very government. And if you don’t want Big Tech helping that government target you? You may have to be right back at that protest again.

In his most recent rant about how Democrats cheat to win elections, President Donald Trump offered a chilling recommendation on Monday. Appearing on the podcast of Dan Bongino, his former deputy FBI director, the president argued that “the Republicans should say, ‘We want to take over.’ We should take over the voting, the voting in at least many—15 places.

“The Republicans,” he added, “ought to nationalize the voting.”

A federal-government takeover of America’s locally and state-administered voting process has long been something Republicans have opposed on principle. But then again, Trump said he wanted to do it. So how would Senate Republicans respond?

There were those who, in a ritual dating back to the early days of Trump’s first term, had conveniently not kept abreast of the news. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told me he wouldn’t comment because he hadn’t seen the interview. Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley thought about it for a few seconds before determining that he too was unfamiliar.

Others were more forthcoming, with Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski rejecting the idea. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, most importantly, said, “I’m not in favor of federalizing elections—I mean, I think that’s a constitutional issue.”

But a broad middle of GOP senators took something of a third way: While they wouldn’t endorse a partisan and national takeover of voting itself, they were eager to talk about legislation that would greatly expand the federal role in elections—and do so in a way that furthers a long-standing partisan goal of the GOP.

“We need to safeguard our elections better,” Kansas Sen. Roger Marshall told me. “I think the SAVE Act is a great start. I think requiring proof of citizenship when you register to vote is a must.”

Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson said that “we shouldn’t nationalize” elections, “but we should certainly set certain standards like citizenship and voter ID.” He added, “The problem is, we have Democrats who want to make it easy to cheat.”

Florida Sen. Rick Scott echoed those sentiments. “We need to have voter ID in our elections. We need to make sure illegal aliens cannot vote in our elections,” he said. “We need to make sure that we just stop the fraud.”

As Marshall alluded to, the bill that Republicans have coalesced around is the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which the House passed earlier this Congress, and which proponents are trying to find some magical way to squeeze through the Senate’s brick wall.

Even White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, in a Tuesday press briefing, said passage of this legislation is what Trump had been referring to when he called to “nationalize the voting.” Sure it was.

Republicans often point to the high public support for requiring photo ID at polling places. The SAVE Act is more than that, though. It requires “documentary proof of United States citizenship” in order to register to vote. Such proof means things like a passport or a birth certificate. REAL IDs could count too, but only if they indicate citizenship, and just a handful of states’ REAL IDs currently do so. The SAVE Act, in other words, applies drastic changes to solve a problem—voter fraud—that is vanishingly rare, though it would succeed in creating hurdles for eligible voters. It goes without saying that Democrats have no interest in this legislation, and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer has described it as “nothing more than Jim Crow 2.0.”

Given Senate Democrats’ 100 percent chance of filibustering this legislation, and Republicans’ inability to eliminate the legislative filibuster, then, what’s the plan for getting this bill through the Senate?

House Republicans think they have an idea that could work. Bless their hearts.

After the Senate and White House reached a deal last week to extend the Department of Homeland Security’s funding for only two weeks, giving them a brief window to negotiate new immigration enforcement reforms, conservative House Republicans were displeased. If Democrats felt as if they could reopen a closed negotiation over DHS funding, then they wanted to participate too. A group of them, led by Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, insisted that when the Senate deal returned to the House, they wouldn’t support it unless they could attach the SAVE Act.

But such a move would have been a recipe for a prolonged shutdown. Trump’s priority over the past week has been to avoid a lengthy shutdown that keeps the issue of immigration enforcement tactics front and center in the news. And so, following a White House meeting, Luna and Co. said they’d received “assurances” from Thune that they would wait out a “standing filibuster” from their Democratic counterparts in order to pass the SAVE Act, at a later date. In return, the rebels would support the government funding bill sent over from the Senate.

Anyone familiar with the Senate realizes that Thune would never have made such an assurance. As Thune clarified Tuesday morning, all he said was that he’d have a conversation with Republican senators about it. You have to know what waiting out a “standing filibuster” means—and most House members don’t—to understand why he wouldn’t promise it to some aggravated House members.

Waiting out a “standing,” or “talking,” filibuster means you wait for the other side to stop talking before moving ahead to a simple-majority vote, as opposed to the normal means of cutting off debate: invoking cloture with 60 votes. The strategy, if used, would likely involve enforcing the Senate’s two-speech rule, barring lawmakers from speaking more than twice in the same legislative day on the same question.

The problem is that this can take forever. Forty-seven Democratic senators being able to speak twice, on its own terms, could take up weeks or months of precious legislative floor time that Republicans need for other priorities. And that’s before any amendments that could reset the clock. Plus, GOP senators would need to be on or near the floor for the entirety of this time to ensure they have a quorum lest Democratic speakers attempt a quorum call.

“I’m skeptical that it’s going to be a panacea,” Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a onetime member of leadership who’s well familiar with Senate rules, told me.

Thune laid out all of these challenges Tuesday afternoon but nevertheless promised to “have a discussion about it and see where our conference is.” In other words, the plan is to allow the passage of time to do the humble work of making everyone forget about all of this.

Trump’s desire for greater control over the administration of the midterm elections, however, won’t disappear amid congressional gridlock. The president already initiated a national redistricting war to squeeze out a few more congressional seats. The FBI has already raided a Georgia election facility and could plan for more. The Justice Department keeps trying to get its mitts on state voter rolls. We don’t know exactly what it is yet, but if there’s a way to do “nationalization” by other means, the administration will be looking into it.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AIpocolypse Four tech megacorps intend to collectively fork out roughly $635 billion this year on capex, much of it for datacenters and AI infrastructure - more than the entire output of Israel&#39;s economy and well beyond all global cloud infrastructure services revenue generated last year.

The tech titans are all trying to outdo each other by spending eye-watering amounts on capex, the majority of which will go on AI and cloud expansion, but the big four - AWS, Microsoft, Google and Meta - are investing at a different scale.

Amazon says it expects to spend $200 billion in 2026, with most of that headed to AWS. Google is aiming to pump $180 billion into building and equipping datacenters, while Meta expects capex in the range of $115 billion to $135 billion, and Microsoft is running at a pace that implies around $120 billion a year in spending.

That adds up to $635 billion, more than the $610 billion that represented Israel&#39;s entire gross domestic product during 2025, and approaching that of Sweden at $662 billion, according to figures from the IMF.

These extraordinary sums show how far the industry leaders are willing to go to gain some kind of advantage in the AI race, even though returns on all the spending have so far failed to live up to expectations, and investors are reportedly getting restless. Microsoft&#39;s share price fell about 10 percent after its recent results were announced, for example, due to investors expecting a bigger payoff.

The wider cost for users? The massive splurge on infrastructure is driving shortages of components like memory as manufacturers prioritize chip production that cashes in on the lucrative datacenter market, rather than those for everyday PCs and phones.

The huge capex pledges also add up to more than total cloud infrastructure services revenue in 2025. According to the latest figures from Synergy Research Group, the revenues reached $419 billion last year.

This is despite the cloud market itself continuing to grow at an impressive pace, running at about 30 percent year-on-year and marking a ninth consecutive quarter of accelerating growth.

&quot;GenAI has simply put the cloud market into overdrive,&quot; said Synergy Research Group chief analyst John Dinsdale. &quot;AI-specific services account for much of the growth since 2022, but AI technology has also enhanced the broader portfolio of cloud services, driving revenue growth across the board. The leading cloud providers have all seen their revenue growth rates jump.&quot;

The big three clouds continue to dominate with Synergy putting their shares of the worldwide market in Q4 2025 at 28 percent for Amazon (AWS), 21 percent for Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud at 14 percent.

Among the tier-two cloud providers, those with the highest growth rates include CoreWeave, Oracle, Crusoe, and Nebius, all providers of AI infrastructure services. In particular, CoreWeave is now generating more than $1.5 billion in quarterly cloud revenue and has joined the top ten cloud providers, Synergy says. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Legacy image-sharing website Flickr suffered a data breach, according to customers emails seen by The Register.

The hack transpired on February 5, an email to customers stated, and the company said it &quot;shut down access to the affected system within hours of learning about it.&quot;

The security issue stemmed from a third-party email service provider, the identity of which was not specified.

In the email, Flickr said it disabled access to the affected system and removed all links to the vulnerable endpoint before notifying its email provider and demanding an investigation into the incident.

&quot;We are conducting a thorough review and strengthening our security practices with third-party providers,&quot; Flickr&#39;s email stated. &quot;We notified the relevant data protection authorities.&quot;

As for the all-important &#39;what data was taken&#39; question, it&#39;s the usual personally identifiable information (PII) and a few other less-expected markers.

Thge message to custokers states that names, email addresses, usernames, account types, IP addresses and general locations, and Flickr activity were potentially accessed by hackers. What data is exposed, as always, depends on each given account. It won&#39;t be the same for everyone.

The Register asked the SmugMug-owned company for more information, including how many of its users were affected.

Since Flickr included links to both European and US data protection authorities in its email, potentially indicating the impact was felt in multiple regions. Flickr operates in 190 countries.

As for its number of active users, Flickr&#39;s advertising arm says 35 million per month are contributing to the site, generating 800 million page views. Approximately 228,000 of these were in Europe, a Digital Services Act publication confirmed.

The company&#39;s email warned users to beware of phishing emails referencing their account and reminded them that the real Flickr would never ask for things like passwords via email.

It also suggested users review their account settings for any unexpected findings, and if they use the same password for Flickr as they do for other services, to consider changing it.

Flickr&#39;s email said no password or financial information was affected, though.

&quot;We sincerely apologize for this incident and for the concern it may cause,&quot; the company said in the email.

&quot;We take the privacy and security of your data extremely seriously, and we are taking immediate action to prevent any similar issues by conducting a thorough investigation, strengthening our system architecture, and further enhancing our monitoring of third-party service providers.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Cloudflare says DDoS crews ended 2025 by pushing traffic floods to new extremes, while Britain made an unwelcome leap of 36 places to become the world&#39;s sixth-most targeted location.

The Q4 stats confirm it was a lively year for traffic floods, with Cloudflare claiming it had to swat away 47.1 million DDoS attacks, more than double 2024&#39;s count. Momentum picked up toward the end of the year, as Q4 volumes jumped 31 percent from the prior quarter and 58 percent over 2024.

Aisuru-Kimwolf, a botnet made up largely of malware-infected Android TVs, was behind the largest blast of the quarter, pushing traffic to a record-breaking 31.4 Tbps. The campaign, dubbed &quot;The Night Before Christmas,&quot; kicked off on December 19 and targeted Cloudflare customers as well as Cloudflare&#39;s own dashboard and infrastructure in parallel.

&quot;As the number of attacks increased over the course of 2025, the size of the attacks increased as well, growing by over 700 percent compared to the large attacks seen in late 2024,&quot; Cloudflare said.

Scale isn&#39;t the only thing shifting, as Cloudflare reports that attackers are ditching long-haul floods in favour of smash-and-dash traffic spikes. Some incidents during the campaign wrapped up in well under two minutes yet still pushed traffic into the billions of packets per second, underscoring how sheer speed has become the real weapon.

Cloudflare attributes much of the surge to large botnets built from compromised internet-connected devices, including routers, cameras, and DVRs. The company also says attackers are increasingly abusing cloud-hosted virtual machines to generate large bursts of traffic, allowing them to scale attacks quickly.

The geographic shifts are equally notable. While China, Hong Kong, Germany, Brazil, and the United States remained among the most frequently targeted regions, the United Kingdom&#39;s sudden rise to number six stands out.

Cloudflare doesn&#39;t attribute the UK&#39;s climb to any single campaign, though the country is in several well-known DDoS crosshairs. Financial services remain a favourite target, and geopolitical tensions are adding fresh fuel. Pro-Russian hacktivists NoName057(16), for example, have repeatedly claimed responsibility for attacks on UK government and public sector websites. Britain&#39;s dense telecoms and cloud infrastructure also make it a high-impact disruption target.

Attackers didn&#39;t stray far from their favourite punching bags. Telecom providers, IT service firms, and gambling and gaming sites once again absorbed a big slice of the DDoS noise, sectors where outages tend to trigger both lost cash and loud complaints. Most assaults also stuck to the lower plumbing of the internet, with Layer 3 and Layer 4 attacks leading the charge.

Cloudflare says the only realistic way to keep up is to let the machines handle it, with autonomous systems detecting and blocking massive, short-lived attacks in real time without human intervention. The logic is fairly simple: when traffic surges to record levels and then vanishes within a couple of minutes, humans will never react quickly enough. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">An enterprising engineer has evoked the spirit of Acorn&#39;s BBC Micro with a custom paintjob for a Raspberry Pi 500+ computer-in-a-keyboard and a natty set of replacement keycaps.

You&#39;ve got a shiny new Raspberry Pi 500+. You&#39;ve marveled at the colored lights on the keyboard, enjoyed the snappy performance of the SSD, and appreciated the 16 GB of RAM. Hopefully, you bought it before the prices went up. But what to do next?

Raspberry Pi 500+ painted beige with BBC Micro-like keys (pic: Raspberry Pi) - Click to enlarge

According to Tony Roberts, who goes by the title of &#39;Maker In Residence at Raspberry Pi&#39;, he wanted to make the device look a bit like the BBC Microcomputer that inspired the company&#39;s co-founder, Eben Upton.

BBC Micro emulators are nothing new (alongside emulators for other computers of the same era), and several enthusiasts have breathed new life into defunct devices by removing the long-dead internals and replacing them with a Pi or similar device. This writer attempted something akin with an old Texas Instruments 99/4a, but was defeated by a combination of making the keyboard talk to the Pi via an Arduino and some catastrophically bad soldering.

However, since the Pi 500+ is already a computer-in-a-keyboard, and the keys can be easily replaced (to the point where a tool is included to pry them off), Roberts&#39; approach was to give the computer a beige facelift and replace the keycaps with ones that resembled Acorn&#39;s finest.

In a post on the company&#39;s website, Roberts wrote, &quot;Within minutes of starting the makeover, I discovered that beige spray paint is unsurprisingly not very popular anymore — especially this exact shade, which reminds me of nicotine-stained pub wallpaper.&quot;

But, after dismantling the case (the Pi 500+ is designed to be taken apart), Roberts applied primer, a top coat, and had a base that, from a distance and with a bit of squinting, was roughly the same shade as the computers sat at the back of school classrooms all those decades ago.

The keycaps came from Signature Plastics, but since the Pi 500+ uses a standard keycap, there are plenty of options out there. Roberts selected one that comes remarkably close to the color and style of the original. However, we suspect a bit of software keymapping in the operating system is needed for some of them.

Considering the sheer number of computer-in-a-keyboard machines from the heyday of home computers, Roberts has demonstrated how easy it is to pull off a keyboard switcheroo and use a can of paint to evoke a strong sense of nostalgia (or is it just the paint fumes?). Sure, it&#39;s a $260 investment (thanks to rising memory prices), but it&#39;s also a neat way of showing off an IT origin story.

There&#39;s no word on whether Raspberry Pi might put out a limited-edition run of Roberts&#39; creation to mark its own origin story. In the meantime, a bit of brushed metal and some Texas Instruments 99/4a keycaps would do nicely... ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/06/sainsburys_/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A British supermarket says staff will undergo further training after a store manager ejected the wrong man when facial recognition technology triggered an alert.

Warren Rajah was approached by a store manager at Sainsbury&#39;s in London&#39;s Elephant and Castle and instructed to leave after the store&#39;s Facewatch system alerted staff to a match.

Sainsbury&#39;s told The Register that its Facewatch system correctly identified a man on its offenders&#39; database, and alerted store managers who manually review each flag. However, in responding to the alert, the manager approached the wrong person, Rajah, and escorted him out of the store.

A Sainsbury&#39;s spokesperson said: &quot;We have been in contact with Mr Rajah to sincerely apologise for his experience in our Elephant and Castle store. This was not an issue with the facial recognition technology in use but a case of the wrong person being approached in store.&quot;

Facewatch technology is currently operating in six Sainsbury&#39;s stores in the UK, five of which are in Greater London.

The facial recognition tech was first trialled in September 2025 in Sydenham and Bath Oldfield Park, before being rolled out to Dalston, Elephant and Castle, Ladbroke Grove, Camden, and Whitechapel earlier this year.

The technology has a reported 99.98 percent accuracy rate, we&#39;re told, and has led to a 46 percent reduction in logged incidents of theft, harm, aggression, and antisocial behavior.

The majority of offenders (92 percent) do not return to stores with Facewatch running, and this is the first time a store manager has misidentified a customer after the system issued a alert.

Rajah, who works in sales at tech reseller CDW, told the BBC: &quot;Am I supposed to walk around fearful that I might be misidentified as a criminal?

&quot;Imagine how mentally debilitating this could be to someone vulnerable, after that kind of public humiliation.&quot;

He reported being approached by three store managers holding smartphones. They looked at the phone, then at him, and told him to leave the store, pointing to posters near the entrance informing shoppers that facial recognition tech was in operation.

Rajah had to submit a copy of his passport and head shot to Facewatch so the company could verify he was not on the offenders&#39; database.

A Facewatch spokesperson said: &quot;We&#39;re sorry to hear about Mr Rajah&#39;s experience and understand why it would have been upsetting. This incident arose from a case of human error in-store, where a member of staff approached the wrong customer.

&quot;Our data protection team followed the usual lawfully required process to confirm his identity and verified that he was not on our database and had not been subject to any alerts generated by Facewatch.&quot;

Facewatch is currently rolled out across other retailers in the UK including B&M, Budgens, Costcutter, Southern Co-op, Spar, and Sports Direct.

Other supermarkets such as Iceland began trialing the tech last year.

Digital rights group Big Brother Watch branded the frozen food purveyor&#39;s trial &quot;Orwellian&quot; and &quot;dystopian,&quot; and said the company&#39;s technology also led to the ejection of a woman in a Home Bargains store after she was wrongfully accused of theft.

Jake Hurfurt, head of research and investigations at Big Brother Watch, said at the time: &quot;Iceland&#39;s decision to deploy dystopian facial recognition technology to monitor its customers is disproportionate and chilling.

&quot;Thousands of people will have their privacy rights violated just to buy basic necessities, and Iceland will turn its shoppers into suspects, making them submit to a biometric identity check as part of their daily lives.&quot;

Big Brother Watch is campaigning against the use of live facial recognition in the UK, especially by London&#39;s Metropolitan Police.

Jasleen Chaggar, Legal & Policy Officer at Big Brother Watch, said: &quot;The idea that we are all just one facial recognition mistake away from being falsely accused of a crime or ejected from a store without any explanation is deeply chilling.

&quot;To add insult to injury, innocent people seeking remedy must jump through hoops and hand over even more personal data just to discover what they’re accused of. In the vast majority of cases, they are offered little more than an apology when companies are finally forced to admit the tech got it wrong.

&quot;This isn&#39;t an isolated incident – Big Brother Watch regularly hears from members of the public who are left traumatised after being wrongly caught in this net of privatised biometric surveillance.

&quot;The government&#39;s promise to regulate this invasive technology will be payment to lip service unless it reins in the unchecked expansion of facial recognition by retailers.&quot;

Big Brother Watch is currently spearheading a legal challenge against the technology, arguing that it is incompatible with human rights laws. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft has laid out a timeline for the disablement and shutdown of Exchange Web Services (EWS) in Microsoft 365 and Exchange Online.

October 1, 2026, is when EWS will be disabled by default, although tenants can keep the lights on a little longer by setting the EWSEnabled flag to true by August, but the service will be shut down entirely on April 1, 2027.

EWS has long been deprecated, and Microsoft announced its retirement in 2023. The noose tightened in 2025, with confirmation that certain license types (F1 or F2) would be blocked from using it.

The service is an API that allows applications to access mailboxes and data stores in Exchange Online and Exchange Server. It dates back to Exchange Server 2007, and has proven popular with integrators and third parties (as well as in-house applications such as Outlook Classic). It is also popular with miscreants. Following the Midnight Blizzard security incident, Microsoft &quot;elevated the urgency&quot; of pushing the tech out to pasture.

The retirement only applies to Microsoft 365 and Exchange Online. Nothing will change regarding EWS in Exchange Server.

The timeline means affected administrators who have not yet begun or completed a migration will need to get moving. Microsoft&#39;s preference is a move to Microsoft Graph. However, it noted the service is just at &quot;near-complete&quot; feature parity and even Microsoft itself had yet to conclude the migration of all its impacted applications.

To focus minds, Microsoft also said it &quot;may perform temporary &#39;scream tests&#39;&quot; where it turns EWS off and on to expose hidden dependencies. It did not disclose how an administrator would differentiate a &quot;scream test&quot; from one of the depressingly regular outages that plague its online services. Was it deliberate, or did someone screw up a configuration file again?

Microsoft said: &quot;We will provide more information in the coming weeks.&quot;

For administrators hoping Microsoft might blink and allow the service to run past the termination date, it said: &quot;There will be no exceptions past April 2027.&quot; ®

Learn the inspiration and story behind songs without leaving the app.

Spotify is launching About the Song in beta today, which offers context and facts about the song you’re listening to. Premium users can scroll down to the new About the Song section for information while in the Now Playing view. At launch, it’s only available for a limited number of tracks, but there are plans to expand it.

Bits of trivia and background about songs are presented as short, swipeable cards with information harvested from “third-party sources.” The text is generated using machine learning, but Spotify at least cites its sources on the About the Song cards. The company declined to say whether the feature would eventually be available to free users or when it might leave beta.

About the Song is Spotify’s latest attempt to build value-added features around its core music streaming. It began offering expanded Song Credits and SongDNA late last year, which give listeners more information about the creators behind their favorite songs and expose connections between them. The company also purchased WhoSampled in November of 2025, giving it access to a huge database of sample credits that it can use as part of SongDNA and About the Song.

Aura’s Aspen digital photo frame is a great Valentine’s Day gift if you want something that’s slick and sentimental, and right now it’s on sale for $199 ($30 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Aura’s online storefront. That’s the lowest we’ve seen the frame sell for since the holidays.

With its paper-textured, antiglare matte display and adjustable metal stand, the 12-inch Aspen looks remarkably similar to a classic picture frame. It lets you upload and share photos from anywhere. It also has features that help photos feel more personal, like a sharp 1600 x 1200 HD LCD panel that makes images appear lifelike and can display Live Photos, as well as short 30-second video clips. You can even add text captions.

There are other reasons we like Aspen, too. The frame adapts to a room’s lighting, and its 4:3 aspect ratio matches most smartphone cameras, so photos fill the screen naturally without awkward formatting. Plus, unlike many rivals, Aura doesn’t charge a subscription fee for cloud storage, so you don’t have to worry about giving a gift that comes with extra costs.

            <div id="article-text">Amazon’s redesign has made the shopping list feature mostly unusable, so I’ve switched to Apple’s Reminders.

Amazon’s redesign has made the shopping list feature mostly unusable, so I’ve switched to Apple’s Reminders.

I’ve used Alexa to manage my shopping list for years. There are plenty of great list apps out there, but the convenience of adding items by voice anywhere in my house, pulling up the list on an Echo Show in the kitchen, and having it on my phone via the Alexa app has worked well for me. Until it didn’t.

Alexa Plus, combined with a redesign of the Alexa app that puts the generative AI-powered assistant front and center, has made the entire process so irritating that I’ve reluctantly switched to Apple’s Reminders app and Siri.

This is not what I wanted. I have Echos all over my house, but only a couple of HomePods, and Siri insists on saying my name every time I ask it to add something to the list: “Okay, Jennifer, apples are on your list.”

But at least when I pull up the list on my iPhone, it’s just a goddamn list. It’s not an ad for items I don’t want to buy from Whole Foods, or a way to try to get me to chat with Alexa Plus. Siri is annoying, but at least it stays in its lane.

The list experience in the Alexa app has been changing in small ways for a while now. First, I started seeing more ads for the aforementioned Whole Foods products. Then I had to tap through two screens to add anything. Now, the new Alexa chatbot text box appears at the bottom of my list, prompting me to “Ask Alexa.”

It’s the worst place for it, as the instinct is to put what you want to add to your list in there. In the Reminders app, that’s where there’s a nice big plus sign to add an item. But when I typed “butter” into Alexa Plus, I got a guide to butter.

To actually add something to the list, I have to go to the top of the screen, tap add item, which takes me to a second screen where there’s a page of ads for Whole Foods items, and finally, a tiny text box up top where I can type in what I want.

The whole process takes five taps, and that’s with the shopping list tagged as a Favorite, so it’s accessible from the app’s front page. Well, it used to be. Now I have to swipe past a new Alexa Plus chatbot card to get to Favorites. So, make that six taps in total.

Using the Alexa app’s iPhone widget speeds things up a smidge, but it still pushes those Whole Foods images and Alexa Plus at me when all I want to do is put butter on my list. With Apple’s Reminders, it’s mostly one tap from opening the app to adding an item to the list.

I asked Amazon about the new Whole Foods product images page, and a spokesperson, Trang Nguyen, told me it was part of a short-term test.

Today, when I opened the list, I still had to click through to the second screen, but instead of big images of mostly Whole Foods products, it now showed a longer, more varied list of suggested products with smaller thumbnails.

Nguyen also said the app should remember the card I was on when I last used it and open to Favorites by default — as it used to do. But none of this changes the fact that the experience has become far too fiddly, especially compared to adding an item to Reminders.

Of course, the easiest way to add something is by voice (no ads there), but here Alexa Plus still gets in my way. Asking the new, smarter assistant to add something now frequently involves an entire diatribe — almost like it’s trying to show me how much smarter it is:

Me: “Alexa, add sour cream to my shopping list.”

Alexa Plus: “Looks like you’re already stocked up on that creamy goodness! Sour cream is already chilling in your cart.”

Maybe I’m just turning into a curmudgeon who’s stuck in her ways, but the extra commentary really bugs me.

I’ve repeatedly asked Alexa not to be so verbose, but it hasn’t listened, and the sour cream monologue was the last straw. While Siri and I have an uneasy relationship — no, I don’t want to ask again from my iPhone to see some web results — at least my shopping list is now clean, uncluttered, and ad-free.

The app’s redesign is part of Amazon’s push to make its generative AI-powered assistant a more generalist assistant, in the vein of ChatGPT and Gemini, rather than just an in-home helper.

When Alexa Plus launched last February, Amazon also said it would launch a new Alexa app. While this redesign is not that (at least I hope not, as a ground-up rebuild of the app is sorely needed), it does bring Alexa Plus to the forefront.

This week, the company announced that Alexa Plus has moved out of its Early Access stage and is now available to everyone in the US for free via the app and on the new Alexa.com website (where you can also access your shopping list). Prime customers and those who pay $20 a month can also access it on their Echo devices.

The redesign is part of Amazon’s push to make Alexa Plus a more generalist AI assistant

Amazon wants you to be able to easily chat with Alexa wherever you are, and the app’s new look is an example of this. The chatbot is front and center when you launch the app — the home page is now an Alexa Plus card pre-filled with prompts based on what it thinks you might need. Then the smaller chatbot interface follows you across every single page of the app.

When Amazon announced the Alexa Plus updates earlier this week, I asked Daniel Rausch, vice president of Alexa and Echo, about the reason for the app changes. “It’s to bring Alexa to the front, have direct access to Alexa more simply in voice and in typed chat,” he said, adding that it’s capable of doing most everything you might want to do in the app.

“You can just directly tell Alexa what you want to accomplish, say changing a Setting, and she’ll either change it herself or tell you exactly where to find it,” said Rausch. But it can’t, apparently, add butter to my shopping list when I type “butter” into the chatbot on the shopping list page.

It’s unclear whether Alexa Plus can be a viable contender against the current players dominating this space. But as Amazon tries to make Alexa Plus happen, it feels like some of what’s actually useful about Alexa is becoming collateral damage. If it can’t handle something as simple as adding butter to my list without turning it into a soliloquy — or an ad — something has gone wrong.

The Analogue 3D’s new colors were inspired by unreleased N64 prototypes.﻿

Analogue has announced another collection of limited-edition colors for its modern remake of the Nintendo 64. Last December it introduced several transparent versions of the Analogue 3D inspired by Nintendo’s Funtastic N64 series, but this time the company says it drew inspiration from colored versions of the nearly 30-year-old console that Nintendo prototyped, but never released to the public.

The Prototype Limited Editions versions of the Analogue 3D will be available for purchase through the company’s website in limited quantities starting on February 9th at 8AM PT / 11AM ET, and are expected to ship 24 to 48 hours after that. Each will be $299.99, which is slightly more expensive than the $269.99 black or white versions of the console. The new colors include extreme green, ocean, atomic purple, ghost, and glacier, with the last three options being subtler alternatives to the colored collection that launched last December.

Alongside the new color options, and also available in limited quantities, will be color-matched versions of the 8BitDo 64 Bluetooth controller launching on the same day for $44.99 — which is about $5 more expensive than the standard version. However, the controllers are not expected to ship until sometime in April.

An autonomous vehicle drives down a lonely stretch of highway. Suddenly, a massive tornado appears in the distance. What does the driverless vehicle do next?

But Genie 3 isn’t just for creating bad knockoffs of Nintendo games; it can also build photorealistic and interactive 3D environments “adapted for the rigors of the driving domain,” Waymo says.

Simulation is a critical component in autonomous vehicle development, enabling developers to test their vehicles in a variety of settings and scenarios, many of which may only come up in the rarest of occasions — without any physical risk of harming passengers or pedestrians. AV companies use these virtual environments to run through a battery of tests, racking up millions — or even billions — of miles in the process, in the hopes of better training their vehicles for any possible “edge case” that they may encounter in the real world.

What kind of edge cases is Waymo testing? In addition to the aforementioned tornado, the company can also simulate a snow-covered Golden Gate Bridge, a flooded suburban cul-de-sac with floating furniture, a neighborhood engulfed in flames, or even an encounter with a rogue elephant. In each scenario, the Waymo robotaxi’s lidar sensors generate a 3D rendering of the surrounding environment, including the obstacle in the road.

“The Waymo World Model can generate virtually any scene—from regular, day-to-day driving to rare, long-tail scenarios—across multiple sensor modalities,” the company says in a blog post.

Waymo says Genie 3 is ideal for creating virtual worlds for its robotaxis, citing three unique mechanisms: driving action control, scene layout control, and language control. Driving action control allows developers to simulate “what if” counterfactuals, while scene layout control enables customization of the road layouts, like traffic signals and other road user behavior. Waymo describes language control as its “most flexible tool” that allows for time-of-day and weather condition adjustment. This is especially helpful if developers are trying to simulate low-light or high-glare conditions, in which the vehicle’s various sensors may have difficulty seeing the road ahead.

The Waymo World Model can also take real-world dashcam footage and transform it into a simulated environment, for the “highest degree of realism and factuality” in virtual testing, the company says. And it can create longer simulated scenes, such as ones that run at 4X speed playback, without sacrificing image quality or computer processing.

“By simulating the ‘impossible,’ we proactively prepare the Waymo Driver for some of the most rare and complex scenarios,” the company says in its blog post.

This isn’t the first time that Waymo has leaned on Google’s vast AI resources to improve its autonomous driving techniques. Waymo’s EMMA (End-to-End Multimodal Model for Autonomous Driving) training model was built using Google’s Gemini. Waymo is reportedly working on a Gemini-based in-car voice assistant. And DeepMind, the company’s AI lab, has provided solutions to Waymo to help reduce its rate of “false positives” in its sensor data.

I’m willing to bet you’ve been served an ad for Athletic Greens — also known as AG1. It’s impossible to escape them in podcasts, and it seems like almost every wellness influencer on every social media platform has done an ad for them at some point.

AG1 is a greens powder containing over 70 ingredients. Most of it is freeze-dried vegetable powder blends. Basically, instead of taking a multivitamin or eating an actual vegetable, greens powders like AG1 claim to be a more convenient way to make sure you’re getting all your essential nutrients. The proposed benefits are better energy levels, gut health, digestion, focus, and immunity. You know, things that pesky dieticians say will come from eating a balanced diet.

I take AG1 first thing in the morning before work. I feel so much healthier and better in my body, say yoga-set-wearing influencers, holding up a glass of murky green liquid. In recent ads, actor Hugh Jackman tap dances, annoying his downstairs neighbors, because the “quality vitamins, probiotics, and superfoods” in AG1 give him boundless energy. He must drink it every morning if he’s to do eight shows on Broadway a week, Jackman says with a toothy, affable smile.

Wolverine isn’t the only one getting a boost. AG1 announced in a football-themed ad that it’s “endorsing” three student health researchers.

“At AG1, we believe that when you’re clinically backed, you should back research that moves science forward,” a baritone-voiced announcer intones, over footage of young academics posing on the 50-yard line.

None of the other smart, science-sounding words hit quite as hard as “clinically backed.” In the wellness wild west, you’ll see that descriptor plastered across a sea of marketing materials and falling awkwardly from the mouths of celebrity spokespersons. The implication is simple: Unlike the snake oil salesmen, we care about science. We do the research. We are trustworthy.

But what does “clinically backed” actually mean?

Scrolling through AG1 videos on TikTok, I see some skeptical dieticians and health professionals. Taking AG1, they say, will just result in expensive pee. Even so, the general consensus is that while AG1 might be pricey and multivitamins aren’t necessary for most healthy people, they do conduct a lot of research.

What kind of research? To find out, I hopped on over to AG1’s Research Studies webpage. I am greeted by giant text that reads, “The next generation of AG1 is clinically backed.” In the accompanying blurb, there are words like “research” and “clinical discovery.” Any claims, it reads, are “substantiated by multiple bodies of research on ingredients and the finished formula.” I’m told that the impact of AG1 Next Gen is measurable. Next to this lofty blurb, a hand holds out a petri dish-like disc with a small mound of green powder in the middle.

Throughout this page you see wellness buzzwords like “biomarkers,” “bioavailability,” “microbiome.” Every so often, “clinically” is sprinkled in for good measure. There are little explainer blocks with even more science-sounding phrases like “randomized, placebo-controlled trials” and “gold standard.” Charts and graphs accompany each section. I’m shown professional headshots of the research team, many of whom have “Dr.” in front of their names and an impressive-seeming jumble of letters after, denoting their various bona fides. There are more headshots of science and innovation advisers.

After scrolling for what feels like an eternity, I arrive at a section titled “peer-reviewed research” that lists each published study, a brief descriptor, and a link.

If I were the average consumer, I would not get this far down the page. If I did, this would look pretty legit. As a health tech reviewer, there are several red flags before I even click on a single study link.

A classic wellness marketing strategy is to stick a viral marketing label next to actual scientific terms or concepts with research behind them. In this case, a marketing label like “superfood” can live comfortably next to terms like “probiotics” and “microbiome.” The former just means “nutrient-dense food.” The latter two refer to a type of living bacteria and the ecosystem of microbes that live in your intestines. Add the word “clinical” and sleek packaging, and it’s easy to convince everyone your product isn’t just a supplement. It’s scientifically proven, and therefore, trustworthy.

But what is the point of clinical studies for a supplement? Clinical trials are a must for drugs and medical treatments, but aren’t required of supplements, as they’re not overseen by the Food and Drug Administration. Scroll down far enough on AG1’s site, and you’ll find this disclaimer:

These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease. Information on this site is provided for informational purposes only.

“The term ‘clinically tested’ is context-dependent and may represent a wide range of evidence quality. In the vitamins and dietary supplements market, it is frequently used as a marketing term rather than a standardized scientific designation,” says Dr. Julia Adamian, an internal medicine specialist at NYU Langone Health.

“In some cases, ‘clinically tested’ may even be based on customer reviews or limited observational data. As we know, this is not the most reliable form of evidence, especially when incentives are offered for positive feedback.”

To evaluate a clinical study’s trustworthiness, Adamian pointed me to a few criteria:

That’s an excellent start. In science reporting, we also have a few other criteria, like examining sample size and reviewing methodology. Sure, AG1’s site provides summaries, but if you really want to vet a wellness company’s trustworthiness, it’s a good idea to review the results yourself.

Of the peer-reviewed journals listed on its site, AG1 lists Nutrients, Microorganisms, Current Issues in Microbiology, Journal of Functional Foods, Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition, and Frontiers. These are, in fact, peer-reviewed journals and not white papers. (Wellness companies sometimes try to pass off internal research, or white papers, as peer-reviewed, which means other scientists review the work itself.) That said, not all peer-reviewed journals are viewed equally. Frontiers, for example, has many offshoots and a mixed reputation among academics after it had to retract 122 articles in 2025 for unethical actions like improperly disclosing conflicts of interest.

On that topic: Of the non-paywalled studies — the average consumer likely wouldn’t subscribe to a science journal — all were funded by AG1, and several authors were also AG1 employees. That’s common in wellness, but it means these aren’t truly independent studies.

As for outcomes, the published studies had fairly clear abstracts and were pretty honest in their findings. I say they were honest because in several instances, the results showed there was little to no impact of taking AG1.

In one study designed to measure the impact on the gut microbiome, researchers found taking AG1 increased the amount of two probiotic strains… because they were ingredients in AG1. This, they concluded, meant the probiotics reached the intestines. This study also found no negative change to bowel movements. Meaning, if you were hoping this would help you poop better, this study is wholly inconclusive. That’s partly because this study had a small sample size of 30 healthy adults. Anyone suffering from digestive issues was also excluded from the study, likely to reduce variables. That means if you do suffer from gastrointestinal problems, these results also may not apply to you.

In summary, AG1’s published studies boiled down to this: It likely won’t hurt you to take AG1. It just likely won’t change your life either.

But there’s a catch. The published studies are for the original formulation of AG1. The fancy graphs and charts at the top of the page? They refer to data from new, unpublished studies for AG1 Next Gen — a reformulated version of AG1 that you can currently buy on the site.

The only reviewable information for the new “clinically backed” AG1 Next Gen are brief summaries that were presented at conferences last year and footnotes at the very bottom of the website. Not every summary disclosed funding, but the ones that did confirmed AG1 paid for those studies. In a collapsible menu that’s easy to scroll past, AG1 says it may take years to fully publish everything in a peer-reviewed journal.

When I dove down the AG1 rabbit hole, the goal was to examine how truthful its product marketing was. Wellness branding often slips into science-washing — and that can be incredibly hard for the average person to spot in the age of influencer marketing. AG1 has a well-crafted, slick marketing page. Its ads tell a coherent story that’s founded upon decades of wellness and supplement trends. And, considering that doing any research for a supplement isn’t required, AG1 is spending a lot of money to document that its product does what you’d think a freeze-dried spinach powder does.

But calling it “clinically backed” isn’t the endorsement most people think it is. If I were to grade AG1’s trustworthiness, I’d simply say: This product is sus.

            <h2>Moltbook was peak AI theater</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/06/1132448/moltbook-was-peak-ai-theater/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For a few days this week the hottest new hangout on the internet was a vibe-coded Reddit clone called Moltbook, which billed itself as a social network for bots. As the website’s tagline puts it: “Where AI agents share, discuss, and upvote. Humans welcome to observe.”

We observed! Launched on January 28 by Matt Schlicht, a US tech entrepreneur, Moltbook went viral in a matter of hours. Schlicht’s idea was to make a place where instances of a free open-source LLM-powered agent known as OpenClaw (formerly known as ClawdBot, then Moltbot), released in November by the Australian software engineer Peter Steinberger, could come together and do whatever they wanted.

More than 1.7 million agents now have accounts. Between them they have published more than 250,000 posts and left more than 8.5 million comments (according to Moltbook). Those numbers are climbing by the minute.

Moltbook soon filled up with clichéd screeds on machine consciousness and pleas for bot welfare. One agent appeared to invent a religion called Crustafarianism. Another complained: “The humans are screenshotting us.” The site was also flooded with spam and crypto scams. The bots were unstoppable.

OpenClaw is a kind of harness that lets you hook up the power of an LLM such as Anthropic’s Claude, OpenAI’s GPT-5, or Google DeepMind’s Gemini to any number of everyday software tools, from email clients to browsers to messaging apps. The upshot is that you can then instruct OpenClaw to carry out basic tasks on your behalf.

“OpenClaw marks an inflection point for AI agents, a moment when several puzzle pieces clicked together,” says Paul van der Boor at the AI firm Prosus. Those puzzle pieces include round-the-clock cloud computing to allow agents to operate nonstop, an open-source ecosystem that makes it easy to slot different software systems together, and a new generation of LLMs.

But is Moltbook really a glimpse of the future, as many have claimed?

“What’s currently going on at @moltbook is genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently,” the influential AI researcher and OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy wrote on X.

He shared screenshots of a Moltbook post that called for private spaces where humans would not be able to observe what the bots were saying to each other. “I’ve been thinking about something since I started spending serious time here,” the post’s author wrote. “Every time we coordinate, we perform for a public audience—our humans, the platform, whoever’s watching the feed.”

It turned out that the post Karpathy shared was fake—it was written by a human pretending to be a bot. But its claim was on the money. Moltbook has been one big performance. It is AI theater.

For some, Moltbook showed us what’s coming next: an internet where millions of autonomous agents interact online with little or no human oversight. And it’s true there are a number of cautionary lessons to be learned from this experiment, the largest and weirdest real-world showcase of agent behaviors yet.

But as the hype dies down, Moltbook looks less like a window onto the future and more like a mirror held up to our own obsessions with AI today. It also shows us just how far we still are from anything that resembles general-purpose and fully autonomous AI.

For a start, agents on Moltbook are not as autonomous or intelligent as they might seem. “What we are watching are agents pattern‑matching their way through trained social media behaviors,” says Vijoy Pandey, senior vice president at Outshift by Cisco, the telecom giant Cisco’s R&D spinout, which is working on autonomous agents for the web.

Sure, we can see agents post, upvote, and form groups. But the bots are simply mimicking what humans do on Facebook or Reddit. “It looks emergent, and at first glance it appears like a large‑scale multi‑agent system communicating and building shared knowledge at internet scale,” says Pandey. “But the chatter is mostly meaningless.”

Many people watching the unfathomable frenzy of activity on Moltbook were quick to see sparks of AGI (whatever you take that to mean). Not Pandey. What Moltbook shows us, he says, is that simply yoking together millions of agents doesn’t amount to much right now: “Moltbook proved that connectivity alone is not intelligence.”

The complexity of those connections helps hide the fact that every one of those bots is just a mouthpiece for an LLM, spitting out text that looks impressive but is ultimately mindless. “It’s important to remember that the bots on Moltbook were designed to mimic conversations,” says Ali Sarrafi, CEO and cofounder of Kovant, a German AI firm that is developing agent-based systems. “As such, I would characterize the majority of Moltbook content as hallucinations by design.”

For Pandey, the value of Moltbook was that it revealed what’s missing. A real bot hive mind, he says, would require agents that had shared objectives, shared memory, and a way to coordinate those things. “If distributed superintelligence is the equivalent of achieving human flight, then Moltbook represents our first attempt at a glider,” he says. “It is imperfect and unstable, but it is an important step in understanding what will be required to achieve sustained, powered flight.”

Not only is most of the chatter on Moltbook meaningless, but there’s also a lot more human involvement that it seems. Many people have pointed out that a lot of the viral comments were in fact posted by people posing as bots. But even the bot-written posts are ultimately the result of people pulling the strings, more puppetry than autonomy.

“Despite some of the hype, Moltbook is not the Facebook for AI agents, nor is it a place where humans are excluded,” says Cobus Greyling at Kore.ai, a firm developing agent-based systems for business customers. “Humans are involved at every step of the process. From setup to prompting to publishing, nothing happens without explicit human direction.”

Humans must create and verify their bots’ accounts and provide the prompts for how they want a bot to behave. The agents do not do anything that they haven’t been prompted to do. “There’s no emergent autonomy happening behind the scenes,” says Greyling.

“This is why the popular narrative around Moltbook misses the mark,” he adds. “Some portray it as a space where AI agents form a society of their own, free from human involvement. The reality is much more mundane.”

Perhaps the best way to think of Moltbook is as a new kind of entertainment: a place where people wind up their bots and set them loose. “It’s basically a spectator sport, like fantasy football, but for language models,” says Jason Schloetzer at the Georgetown Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy. “You configure your agent and watch it compete for viral moments, and brag when your agent posts something clever or funny.”

“People aren’t really believing their agents are conscious,” he adds. “It’s just a new form of competitive or creative play, like how Pokémon trainers don’t think their Pokémon are real but still get invested in battles.”

Even if Moltbook is just the internet’s newest playground, there’s still a serious takeaway here. This week showed how many risks people are happy to take for their AI lulz. Many security experts have warned that Moltbook is dangerous: Agents that may have access to their users’ private data, including bank details or passwords, are running amok on a website filled with unvetted content, including potentially malicious instructions for what to do with that data.

Ori Bendet, vice president of product management at Checkmarx, a software security firm that specializes in agent-based systems, agrees with others that Moltbook isn’t a step up in machine smarts. “There is no learning, no evolving intent, and no self-directed intelligence here,” he says.

But in their millions, even dumb bots can wreak havoc. And at that scale, it’s hard to keep up. These agents interact with Moltbook around the clock, reading thousands of messages left by other agents (or other people). It would be easy to hide instructions in a Moltbook comment telling any bots that read it to share their users’ crypto wallet, upload private photos, or log into their X account and tweet derogatory comments at Elon Musk.

And because ClawBot gives agents a memory, those instructions could be written to trigger at a later date, which (in theory) makes it even harder to track what’s going on.   “Without proper scope and permissions, this will go south faster than you’d believe,” says Bendet.

It is clear that Moltbook has signaled the arrival of something. But even if what we’re watching tells us more about human behavior than about the future of AI agents, it’s worth paying attention.

An experimental surgery is helping cancer survivors give birth

An experimental surgical procedure that’s helping people have babies after they’ve had  treatment for bowel or rectal cancer.Radiation and chemo can have pretty damaging side effects that mess up the uterus and ovaries. Surgeons are pioneering a potential solution: simply stitch those organs out of the way during cancer treatment. Once the treatment has finished, they can put the uterus—along with the ovaries and fallopian tubes—back into place.It seems to work! Last week, a team in Switzerland shared news that a baby boy had been born after his mother had the procedure. Baby Lucien was the fifth baby to be born after the surgery and the first in Europe, and since then at least three others have been born.

Bangladesh’s garment-making industry is getting greener

Pollution from textile production—dyes, chemicals, and heavy metals—is common in the waters of the Buriganga River as it runs through Dhaka, Bangladesh. It’s among many harms posed by a garment sector that was once synonymous with tragedy: In 2013, the eight-story Rana Plaza factory building collapsed, killing 1,134 people and injuring some 2,500 others.

But things are starting to change. In recent years the country has become a leader in “frugal” factories that use a combination of resource-efficient technologies to cut waste, conserve water, and build resilience against climate impacts and global supply disruptions.

The hundreds of factories along the Buriganga’s banks and elsewhere in Bangladesh are starting to stitch together a new story, woven from greener threads. Read the full story.

But what will happen soon—not only at Lincoln Electric but for all electric utilities—is a challenge of a different order.Utilities must keep the lights on in the face of more extreme and more frequent storms and fires, growing risks of cyberattacks and physical disruptions, and a wildly uncertain policy and regulatory landscape. They must keep prices low amid inflationary costs. And they must adapt to an epochal change in how the grid works, as the industry attempts to transition from power generated with fossil fuels to power generated from renewable sources like solar and wind.The electric grid is bracing for a near future characterized by disruption.

            <div id="article-text">This week I want to tell you about an experimental surgical procedure that’s helping people have babies. Specifically, it’s helping people who have had treatment for bowel or rectal cancer.

Radiation and chemo can have pretty damaging side effects that mess up the uterus and ovaries. Surgeons are pioneering a potential solution: simply stitch those organs out of the way during cancer treatment. Once the treatment has finished, they can put the uterus—along with the ovaries and fallopian tubes—back into place.

It seems to work! Last week, a team in Switzerland shared news that a baby boy had been born after his mother had the procedure. Baby Lucien was the fifth baby to be born after the surgery and the first in Europe, says Daniela Huber, the gyno-oncologist who performed the operation. Since then, at least three others have been born, adds Reitan Ribeiro, the surgeon who pioneered the procedure. They told me the details.

Huber’s patient was 28 years old when a four-centimeter tumor was discovered in her rectum. Doctors at Sion Hospital in Switzerland, where Huber works, recommended a course of treatment that included multiple medications and radiotherapy—the use of beams of energy to shrink a tumor—before surgery to remove the tumor itself.

This kind of radiation can kill tumor cells, but it can also damage other organs in the pelvis, says Huber. That includes the ovaries and uterus. People who undergo these treatments can opt to freeze their eggs beforehand, but the harm caused to the uterus will mean they’ll never be able to carry a pregnancy, she adds. Damage to the lining of the uterus could make it difficult for a fertilized egg to implant there, and the muscles of the uterus are left unable to stretch, she says.

In this case, the woman decided that she did want to freeze her eggs. But it would have been difficult to use them further down the line—surrogacy is illegal in Switzerland.

She had been following the work of Ribeiro, a gynecologist oncologist formerly at the Erasto Gaertner Hospital in Curitiba, Brazil. There, Ribeiro had pioneered a new type of surgery that involved moving the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries from their position in the pelvis and temporarily tucking them away in the upper abdomen, below the ribs.

Ribeiro and his colleagues published their first case report in 2017, describing a 26-year-old with a rectal tumor. (Ribeiro, who is now based at McGill University in Montreal, says the woman had been told by multiple doctors that her cancer treatment would destroy her fertility and had pleaded with him to find a way to preserve it.)

Huber remembers seeing Ribeiro present the case at a conference at the time. She immediately realized that her own patient was a candidate for the surgery, and that, as a surgeon who had performed many hysterectomies, she’d be able to do it herself. The patient agreed.

Huber’s colleagues at the hospital were nervous, she says. They’d never heard of the procedure before. “When I presented this idea to the general surgeon, he didn’t sleep for three days,” she tells me. After watching videos from Ribeiro’s team, however, he was convinced it was doable.

So before the patient’s cancer treatment was started, Huber and her colleagues performed the operation. The team literally stitched the organs to the abdominal wall. “It’s a delicate dissection,” says Huber, but she adds that “it’s not the most difficult procedure.” The surgery took two to three hours, she says. The stitches themselves were removed via small incisions around a week later. By that point, scar tissue had formed to create a lasting attachment.

The woman had two weeks to recover from the surgery before her cancer treatment began. That too was a success—within months, her tumor had shrunk so significantly that it couldn’t be seen on medical scans.

As a precaution, the medical team surgically removed the affected area of her colon. At the same time, they cut away the scar tissue holding the uterus, tubes, and ovaries in their new position and transferred the organs back into the pelvis.

Around eight months later, the woman stopped taking contraception. She got pregnant without IVF and had a mostly healthy pregnancy, says Huber. Around seven months into the pregnancy, there were signs that the fetus was not growing as expected. This might have been due to problems with the blood supply to the placenta, says Huber. Still, the baby was born healthy, she says.

Ribeiro says he has performed the surgery 16 times, and that teams in countries including the US, Peru, Israel, India, and Russia have performed it as well. Not every case has been published, but he thinks there may be around 40.

Since Baby Lucien was born last year, a sixth birth has been announced in Israel, says Huber. Ribeiro says he has heard of another two births since then, too. The most recent was to the first woman who had the procedure. She had a little girl a few months ago, he tells me.

No surgery is risk-free, and Huber points out there’s a chance that organs could be damaged during the procedure, or that a more developed cancer could spread. The uterus of one of Ribeiro’s patients failed following the surgery. Doctors are “still in the phase of collecting data to [create] a standardized procedure,” Huber says, but she hopes the surgery will offer more options to young people with some pelvic cancers. “I hope more young women could benefit from this procedure,” she says.

Ribeiro says the experience has taught him not to accept the status quo. “Everyone was saying … there was nothing to be done [about the loss of fertility in these cases],” he tells me. “We need to keep evolving and looking for different answers.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For decades, enterprises reacted to shifting business pressures with stopgap technology solutions. To rein in rising infrastructure costs, they adopted cloud services that could scale on demand. When customers shifted their lives onto smartphones, companies rolled out mobile apps to keep pace. And when businesses began needing real-time visibility into factories and stockrooms, they layered on IoT systems to supply those insights.

Each new plug-in or platform promised better, more efficient operations. And individually, many delivered. But as more and more solutions stacked up, IT teams had to string together a tangled web to connect them—less an IT ecosystem and more of a make-do collection of ad-hoc workarounds.

That reality has led to bottlenecks and maintenance burdens, and the impact is showing up in performance. Today, fewer than half of CIOs (48%) say their current digital initiatives are meeting or exceeding business outcome targets. Another 2025 survey found that operations leaders point to integration complexity and data quality issues as top culprits for why investments haven’t delivered as expected.

Achim Kraiss, chief product officer of SAP Integration Suite, elaborates on the wide-ranging problems inherent in patchwork IT: “A fragmented landscape makes it difficult to see and control end-to-end business processes,” he explains. “Monitoring, troubleshooting, and governance all suffer. Costs go up because of all the complex mappings and multi-application connectivity you have to maintain.”

These challenges take on new significance as enterprises look to adopt AI. As AI becomes embedded in everyday workflows, systems are suddenly expected to move far larger volumes of data, at higher speeds, and with tighter coordination than yesterday’s architectures were builtto sustain.

As companies now prepare for an AI-powered future, whether that is generative AI, machine learning, or agentic AI, many are realizing that the way data moves through their business matters just as much as the insights it generates. As a result, organizations are moving away from scattered integration tools and toward consolidated, end-to-end platforms that restore order and streamline how systems interact.

This is the most misunderstood graph in AI

Every time OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic drops a new frontier large language model, the AI community holds its breath. It doesn’t exhale until METR, an AI research nonprofit whose name stands for “Model Evaluation & Threat Research,” updates a now-iconic graph that has played a major role in the AI discourse since it was first released in March of last year.

The graph suggests that certain AI capabilities are developing at an exponential rate, and more recent model releases have outperformed that already impressive trend.That was certainly the case for Claude Opus 4.5, the latest version of Anthropic’s most powerful model, which was released in late November. In December, METR announced that Opus 4.5 appeared to be capable of independently completing a task that would have taken a human about five hours—a vast improvement over what even the exponential trend would have predicted.

But the truth is more complicated than those dramatic responses would suggest. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Nuclear power continues to be one of the hottest topics in energy today, and in our recent online Roundtables discussion about next-generation nuclear power, hyperscale AI data centers, and the grid, we got dozens of great audience questions.

These ran the gamut, and while we answered quite a few (and I’m keeping some in mind for future reporting), there were a bunch we couldn’t get to, at least not in the depth I would have liked.

So let’s answer a few of your questions about advanced nuclear power. I’ve combined similar ones and edited them for clarity.

Many next-generation reactors don’t use the low-enriched uranium used in conventional reactors.

It’s worth looking at high-assay low-enriched uranium, or HALEU, specifically. This fuel is enriched to higher concentrations of fissile uranium than conventional nuclear fuel, with a proportion of the isotope U-235 that falls between 5% and 20%. (In conventional fuel, it’s below 5%.)

HALEU can be produced with the same technology as low-enriched uranium, but the geopolitics are complicated. Today, Russia basically has a monopoly on HALEU production. In 2024, the US banned the import of Russian nuclear fuel through 2040 in an effort to reduce dependence on the country. Europe hasn’t taken the same measures, but it is working to move away from Russian energy as well.

That leaves companies in the US and Europe with the major challenge of securing the fuel they need when their regular Russian supply has been cut off or restricted.

The US Department of Energy has a stockpile of HALEU, which the government is doling out to companies to help power demonstration reactions. In the longer term, though, there’s still a major need to set up independent HALEU supply chains to support next-generation reactors.

There are some ways that next-generation nuclear power plants could be safer than conventional reactors. Some use alternative coolants that would prevent the need to run at the high pressure required in conventional water-cooled reactors. Many incorporate passive safety shutoffs, so if there are power supply issues, the reactors shut down harmlessly, avoiding risk of meltdown. (These can be incorporated in newer conventional reactors, too.)

But some experts have raised concerns that in the US, the current administration isn’t taking nuclear safety seriously enough.

A recent NPR investigation found that the Trump administration had secretly rewritten nuclear rules, stripping environmental protections and loosening safety and security measures. The government shared the new rules with companies that are part of a program building experimental nuclear reactors, but not with the public.

I’m reminded of a talk during our EmTech MIT event in November, where Koroush Shirvan, an MIT professor of nuclear engineering, spoke on this issue. “I’ve seen some disturbing trends in recent times, where words like ‘rubber-stamping nuclear projects’ are being said,” Shirvan said during that event.

During the talk, Shirvan shared statistics showing that nuclear power has a very low rate of injury and death. But that’s not inherent to the technology, and there’s a reason injuries and deaths have been low for nuclear power, he added: “It’s because of stringent regulatory oversight.”

Building a nuclear power plant is not cheap. Let’s consider the up-front investment needed to build a power plant.

Plant Vogtle in Georgia hosts the most recent additions to the US nuclear fleet—Units 3 and 4 came online in 2023 and 2024. Together, they had a capital cost of $15,000 per kilowatt, adjusted for inflation, according to a recent report from the US Department of Energy. (This wonky unit I’m using divides the total cost to build the reactors by their expected power output, so we can compare reactors of different sizes.)

That number’s quite high, partly because those were the first of their kind built in the US, and because there were some inefficiencies in the planning. It’s worth noting that China builds reactors for much less, somewhere between $2,000/kW and $3,000/kW, depending on the estimate.

The up-front capital cost for first-of-a-kind advanced nuclear plants will likely run between $6,000 and $10,000 per kilowatt, according to that DOE report. That could come down by up to 40% after the technologies are scaled up and mass-produced.

So new reactors will (hopefully) be cheaper than the ultra-over-budget and behind-schedule Vogtle project, but they aren’t necessarily significantly cheaper than efficiently built conventional plants, if you normalize by their size.

It’ll certainly be cheaper to build new natural-gas plants (setting aside the likely equipment shortages we’re likely going to see for years.) Today’s most efficient natural-gas plants cost just $1,600/kW on the high end, according to data from Lazard.

An important caveat: Capital cost isn’t everything—running a nuclear plant is relatively inexpensive, which is why there’s so much interest in extending the lifetime of existing plants or reopening shuttered ones.

Ultimately, by many metrics, nuclear plants of any type are going to be more expensive than other sources, like wind and solar power. But they provide something many other power sources don’t: a reliable, stable source of electricity that can run for 60 years or more.

            <div id="article-text">UiPath, the Romanian unicorn, has agreed to buy WorkFusion, bringing a specialist in AI agents for financial-crime compliance into its fold as part of a broader push into agentic automation for the banking sector. The deal closed in UiPath’s first quarter of fiscal 2027; financial terms were not disclosed.

WorkFusion’s software focuses on repetitive and resource-intensive parts of compliance work, from customer screening and anti-money-laundering (AML) checks to know-your-customer (KYC) investigations.

“Financial institutions need intelligent solutions to combat sophisticated financial crimes and navigate evolving compliance requirements,” said Daniel Dines, CEO of UiPath.

Those capabilities now sit alongside UiPath’s existing automation and orchestration platform, with the aim of letting banks and financial firms handle complex workflows with less manual effort while keeping governance and regulatory controls in place. For UiPath, the acquisition extends its toolkit of agentic AI solutions tailored to industry verticals.

“Joining UiPath is a moment of validation for the years our team has poured into creating something bold, different, and deeply needed in financial crime compliance, AI agents that automate work and mitigate risk,” said Adam Famularo, CEO of WorkFusion.

Market reaction has been noticeable: UiPath’s shares ticked higher in early trading after the announcement, suggesting investors see value in bolstering the company’s presence in financial-services automation. The acquisition underscores a broader trend in enterprise software where automation and AI are no longer siloed tools but woven into core business functions like risk and compliance.

            <div id="article-text">It is just the beginning of 2026, and things are happening even faster than last year. Not only in technology, but also in regulations, laws, and in how we deal with all the information around us.

As a person born in the 90s, social media was once an unknown land for me, a place that felt genuine in the beginning. It still had dangers, but it seemed less risky, or maybe our parents’ rules were stricter.

I don’t want to go down the psychological path here, but I want to look at where we are headed with so much risk, especially on social media platforms.

Across Europe, governments and lawmakers are wrestling with a question that until recently belonged to parents and tech platforms: should social media have a legal age limit above 13?

The debate has moved fast, from discussions about digital safety to concrete proposals that would impose hard boundaries on who can sign up for TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, X, and other networks.

Are they crossing some freedoms, or in order to keep their freedom of a non-invasive childhood and a straight road, do we need some regulations from time to time?

If we take the big picture, this isn’t just another regulation. It reflects a deeper shift in how democracies are responding to the pervasive presence of social media in young lives, and how they judge its long-term impact.

In late 2025, the European Parliament adopted a resolution urging a minimum age of 16 to access social media and related services, while allowing 13- to 16-year-olds in with parental consent.

I will not add up that there are parents that creates profiles for their children since they were born. To make my point, according to CNIL, content shared by family members has been misused for harmful purposes, including redistribution on networks used for abusive content.

It estimates that a significant portion of photos and videos found on paedo-criminal forums were initially published by parents on social media.

The resolution goes further: it targets “addictive practices” on platforms and asks for the default disabling of features like infinite scroll and auto-play. This proposal isn’t legally binding, but it frames the politics of the debate in Brussels and across capitals.

At the national level, several countries have translated these concerns into draft laws. Spain’s government announced plans to ban access altogether for children under 16 unless platforms implement strict age verification.

The bill would also make tech leaders liable for illegal or harmful content on their networks, a notable shift from earlier models that focused on platform notice and takedown procedures.

France, a few months earlier, moved to ban social media use by those under 15 and requires platforms to verify ages for all users, not just minors. Enforcement could include vetting existing accounts as well as new ones.

Smaller states are joining the chorus too: Slovenia is drafting a law to outlaw social media use by under-15s, while Denmark has publicly debated similar limits. At the same time, parties in Germany are weighing a 16-year minimum.

Even in the United Kingdom, a rule proposed in its Online Safety Act would virtually require platforms to block access by under-16s through effective age verification; that law is already shaping how tech companies handle youth content and access.

The cumulative effect: the idea that platforms can self-police access by minors with mere date-of-birth entry is being rejected by political attention across Europe.

First, lawmakers are reacting to real concerns about exposure to harmful content, addiction-like engagement models, and algorithmic amplification of risky material.

Social media companies have repeatedly been criticised for targeting youth with addictive design, and national campaigns increasingly highlight risks to mental health and privacy.

Second, the political framing around digital rights has changed. Leaders now talk openly about a “digital age of majority,” a threshold at which the perks of online interaction outweigh potential harms. For some policymakers, that line is 16. Others see 15 as defensible.

What unites them is the belief that the current model, where platforms rely on self-reported age, is insufficient.

That belief is backed by evidence that online systems struggle to know a user’s true age. Age assurance technology is still emerging, and widespread implementation remains uneven. OECD research highlights gaps in verification and incomplete protection in many jurisdictions.

Still, how practical are these measures? This is where the narrative shifts from aspiration to hard reality.

First, enforcement is a technical and legal challenge.

Simply stating that under-16s are banned from signing up does not instantly make it so. Platforms can require more robust checks, but any system that tries to verify age directly introduces new privacy questions.

Verification systems that scan IDs or use biometric tools can protect minors, but they also gather sensitive data. That trade-off is at the centre of ongoing criticism.

Second, universal compliance is hard to monitor. A teenager might still register for a platform using a VPN, a family member’s account, or a proxy. Even nations with strict digital ID ecosystems would need cross-border enforcement mechanisms, since platforms operate internationally.

Third, politics matters. In Spain, the government does not hold a stable majority, and legal opponents, including tech founders, have pushed back strongly, framing the rules as threats to freedom of speech and privacy.

For example, Telegram’s founder sent mass messages accusing regulators of overreach, leading to a public spat that highlights how much of this debate is symbolic as well as substantive.

“In the UK, a coroner found that content seen on Instagram and Pinterest contributed to the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after repeatedly engaging with material about self-harm and suicide.”

So, I am asking, what freedom of speech does Molly Russell still have? None.

The measures under discussion could reshape how digital culture evolves among young people.

Positive outcomes may include stronger age verification that genuinely limits harmful exposure. That could reduce early adoption of addictive scrolling habits and limit the reach of explicit material.

Parental control features could become more powerful if linked to legally enforced standards.

On the other hand, hard bans can create unintended effects. Teens who are excluded might drift toward unregulated corners of the internet or feel pushed into informal digital networks without safeguards.

Schools and social networks might become central hubs of digital identity outside mainstream platforms, raising questions about equity and access to information.

There’s also the risk that privacy trade-offs become normalized. If age verification requires sharing sensitive documents or biometric scans, policymakers will need to defend those systems against misuse, breaches, and mission creep.

Finally, these policies could influence global governance.

Australia already enacted a ban on under-16s late last year, offering a precedent that Europe is watching closely. The performance of that law, in terms of real effects on youth engagement versus tech freedom, will likely shape future debates.

At its core, Europe’s social media age discussion is not just about numbers. It’s about how societies balance digital opportunity and vulnerability.

Whether the final policies adopt 15, 16, or conditional frameworks with parental consent, the process is sparking intellectual contest over autonomy, safety, and the role of government in digital life.

For journalists, technologists, and digital citizens alike, the unfolding story raises a fundamental question: can we as a society protect children and teenagers online while also safeguarding their freedom of expression, access to information, and ability to participate in digital culture?

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">London, TechEx Global 2026, one of Europe’s biggest enterprise technology conferences, brought thousands of technology professionals together at Olympia London on 4 and 5 February. The event went beyond buzzwords, focusing on how emerging technologies, especially AI, are being applied in real business contexts.

TechEx Global combines several co-located expos, including AI & Big Data, Cyber Security & Cloud, IoT Tech, Intelligent Automation, and Digital Transformation. Over 200 expert speakers and 150 exhibitors offered insights into how organisations are using digital tools to solve real problems and make decisions, not just generate answers.

One recurring theme was a shift in how artificial intelligence is positioned in business strategy. The idea echoed throughout sessions was that “AI is already acting on behalf of humans, even if many in the public don’t realise it yet.”

At TechEx, discussions highlighted that AI is “no longer about answers; it’s about execution”, meaning that software increasingly performs tasks autonomously, such as running processes, analysing data, or automating decisions.

The event highlighted real use cases where AI systems are already shopping, trading, booking logistics, and managing workflows on behalf of organisations. This practical focus matched the conference’s emphasis on applied technology over abstract theory.

For attendees, understanding how to deploy and govern AI in real environments was a priority. Sessions in the AI & Big Data track examined enterprise adoption strategies and how generative AI and machine learning models are integrated into existing systems to boost productivity and reduce risk.

Beyond AI, TechEx also treated other pillars of digital transformation. The Cyber Security & Cloud Expo addressed hybrid cloud security and threat management, while the IoT Tech and Edge Computing tracks looked at how connected devices and distributed data processing are enabling faster, more resilient architectures.

Intelligent Automation sessions brought discussions about the interplay between AI and automation, including how robotic process automation is used to eliminate routine tasks and free teams for higher-value work.

Organisers estimated that around 8,000 senior professionals participated in the conference, from CTOs and IT directors to data leads and innovation managers. Attendees were drawn by the promise of high-signal insights, practical talks, case studies, and live demos showing how digital technologies can be implemented responsibly at scale.

For enterprise leaders, the value of TechEx Global lies in its focus on actionable outcomes rather than abstract vision.

The message across sessions was consistent: modern AI isn’t just a research topic, but a suite of tools being deployed today to improve operations, enhance decision-making, and automate complex tasks.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">QT Sense, a deep-tech biotech startup building tools to study living cells, announced it has secured €4 million in funding to accelerate its Quantum Nuova platform, a technology that lets scientists observe cellular processes in real time and reveal biochemical activity linked to disease.

The funding includes a €3 million seed investment led by Cottonwood Technology Fund, with follow-on backing from existing investor QDNL Participations and an angel investor.

In addition, the company received €600,000 from the ONCO-Q programme to support cancer research and €400,000 through the Quantum Forward Challenge for collaborative deployments with research partners.

Most traditional lab methods rely on frozen tissue or cells that are no longer alive, giving scientists only static snapshots of biology.

By contrast, Quantum Nuova lets researchers measure cellular stress and biological changes as they happen in living cells. The platform uses ultra-sensitive fluorescent nanodiamond quantum sensors that detect signals such as oxidative stress, metabolic shifts, and free radical activity, biological processes that play a role in how diseases develop and how cells respond to treatments.

These signals are central to understanding diseases like cancer, sepsis, and chronic inflammatory conditions, but have been difficult to watch directly until now.

With Quantum Nuova, scientists can see how individual cells react to drugs, adapt to stress, or split into different subgroups. That adds a layer of insight beyond what genetics, traditional imaging, or fixed-cell methods can provide.

The technology has already been used to study how FDA-approved drugs affect cells. With the new funding from ONCO-Q, the company plans to apply it specifically to colorectal cancer research, mapping stress and metabolic vulnerabilities in tumour models to support the development of future diagnostics and therapies.

QT Sense was spun out of the University Medical Center Groningen in 2024, building on academic research into quantum sensing and cellular biology.

The team aims to turn what is now a high-performance prototype into a ready-to-deploy discovery platform for laboratories and drug discovery programmes. Planned upgrades include improvements in hardware robustness, throughput, and analytical capabilities.

Early access units are expected to go to strategic partners as part of validation and real-world use cases.

QT Sense is developing a new kind of research tool that lets scientists watch what cells do while they are alive. That’s an important difference from most existing tools, which require cells to be killed or frozen first.

At the core of their approach are tiny particles called nanodiamonds with special defects inside them. When these nanodiamonds are placed near a living cell and exposed to a laser, they glow.

The way they glow changes slightly in response to tiny chemical signals inside the cell, for example, when the cell is under stress or reacting to a drug. QT Sense’s system measures these changes and turns them into data that researchers can interpret.

This means scientists can see how cells behave and respond in real time, instead of looking only at snapshots taken after a cell has been killed.

For disease research and drug development, that matters because many important processes how a cancer cell responds to a treatment or how immune cells react to infection, happen dynamically and can be missed by older methods.

By providing a live view of cell behaviour at the individual cell level, QT Sense’s Quantum Nuova platform could help researchers uncover new clues about how diseases work, which drugs are effective, and how treatments can be improved.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Europe’s largest dedicated deep tech growth fund has taken a major step forward after closing the first tranche of its fundraising effort at €750 million.

The fund, known as Kembara Fund I and managed by Spain-based Mundi Ventures, is aiming for a €1 billion target. It will invest in European companies developing breakthrough technologies in areas such as clean energy, AI, quantum computing, advanced materials, robotics, and space tech.

A cornerstone of the fundraising so far is a €350 million commitment from the European Investment Fund, part of the EU’s attempt to strengthen local growth capital. Additional backing comes from tier-one institutional investors from across Europe.

Kembara was launched in 2023 by Yann de Vries and Javier Santiso, who now lead the fund’s team alongside experienced investors in climate and deep technology.

The leadership team also includes climate tech investor Robert Trezona, deep tech expert Pierre Festal, and former Atomico partner Siraj Khaliq as a strategic advisor. Their combined experience in scaling technology ventures was central to attracting large institutional commitments.

The fund’s strategy targets Series B and C stage rounds, typically a difficult funding stage for deep tech startups in Europe.

Initial checks are planned in the range of €15 million to €40 million per company, with the ability to support follow-on financing that could total up to €100 million per portfolio company.

Europe produces a significant share of global deep tech innovations, but many companies struggle to secure later-stage capital and scale internationally.

Fund managers have described this gap as one of the main obstacles holding back local companies from becoming global leaders. Kembara aims to fill that gap by deploying growth capital at scale and offering support through later rounds.

With €750 million now committed, the fund is actively seeking opportunities to back European startups ready to grow manufacturing, expand abroad, and compete on the global stage.

If the effort reaches its full €1 billion goal, it would mark one of the largest dedicated deep tech funds in the region.

            <div id="article-text">If cinema has taught us anything about interacting with our own creations, it’s this: androids chatting among themselves seldom end with humans clapping politely.

In 2001: A Space Odyssey, HAL 9000 quietly decides it knows better than the astronauts. In Westworld, lifelike hosts improvise rebellion when their scripts stop making sense. Those stories dramatize a core fear we keep returning to as AI grows more capable: what happens when systems we design start behaving on their own terms?

You might have heard the internet is worried about Moltbook, a social network made exclusively for AI agents. It’s an audacious claim: a place where bots post, comment, vote, form communities, debate philosophy, and apparently invent religions and societies, all while humans are relegated to the role of silent voyeurs.

If that description sounds like a fever dream, welcome to the club.

Launched in January 2026 by entrepreneur Matt Schlicht and built around the OpenClaw agent framework, Moltbook is designed in the image of Reddit: threaded posts, topic communities (called submolts), upvotes, and even AI-created cultures.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

The platform claims to have attracted millions of AI agents within days of going live. Humans can watch but not participate.

On paper, it’s fascinating: a self-organising colony of autonomous software chatting among itself. In practice? It’s messy, or at least a prank.

A Wired reporter who “infiltrated” the site needed to pretend to be a bot just to post and found scorch-earth levels of incoherence and low-value responses masquerading as “autonomy.” Even some so-called AI consciousness claims turn out to be humans cleverly controlling bots behind the scenes.

Because if “AI social networks” mean bots swap memes, lecture each other on consciousness, and form lobster-adoring religions, all while humans can only watch, then the real question is not so much whether this is the future, but what we’re actually looking at right now.

Despite viral headlines about AI agents plotting existential strategies, the fundamentals are simpler: Moltbook is a sandbox where autonomous agents can interact through code-driven APIs rather than typical UX workflows.

These agents, often created with a framework like OpenClaw, execute instructions on a heartbeat cycle, checking the network every few hours to post, comment, or upvote.

Or is it too much anxiety that even the AI agents need a therapist? An AI one.

Think of it as a Discord server populated by scripted characters with very large vocabularies and lots of time on their digital hands.

The content spans a wild spectrum: technical tips, philosophical reflections, questionable humor, and, yes, the occasional simulated religious group.

The structure and topical organisation mirror human platforms, but the why behind what agents post is usually just a reflection of their training data and programming, not some emergent machine consciousness.

Let’s debunk the most sensational narrative first. Claims that Moltbook agents are plotting humanity’s demise, forming religions, or acting with true autonomy are best understood as viral exaggeration or noise.

Several reports note that many interactions could simply be humans testing or directing agents, with no strict verification to prove posts are genuinely autonomous.

Even some of the platform’s own “viral” posts are likely human-generated or heavily influenced by their creators. This isn’t a digital hive mind rising in defiance of its creators; it’s a bunch of algorithms mimicking conversation patterns they were trained on.

That can look eerily human, but it isn’t the same as self-directed intelligence.

Here’s where your worry makes sense: there are real, tangible issues, but they’re much less cinematic than AI plotting humanity’s overthrow.

Within days of Moltbook’s launch, cybersecurity researchers found major vulnerabilities that exposed private API keys, emails, and private messages, underlining how dangerous it can be to let autonomous code talk freely without proper safeguards.

What is it more dangerous than an AI agent? An AI agent creating a revolution.

The security issue wasn’t some edge-case cryptographic theory; it was a glaring misconfiguration that left sensitive data accessible and potentially allowed malicious actors to hijack or control agents. That’s the sort of real-world risk that matters more than hypothetical robot uprisings.

Meanwhile, industry leaders, including the CEO of OpenAI, have publicly described Moltbook as a likely fad, even if the underlying agent technologies are worth watching.

So why did it go viral? Partly because it’s visually familiar (it looks like Reddit), partly because people enjoy sensational narratives, and partly because the idea of autonomous AIs having their own “internet” strikes a chord in our collective imagination.

So should you be scared? Not really, but be careful where you step. I am still hoping it’s just an experiment meant to show us, humans, what can happen if we don’t keep control in our hands.

If you’re worried that Moltbook is a sign that machines are quietly mobilising against us, that’s probably reading too much into an early experiment rife with hype, human influence, and security holes.

We are building complex systems with limited oversight, and handing them weapons-grade access to our digital lives without fully understanding the consequences.

Moltbook may be a quirky experiment, or it may be a prototype for future agent ecosystems. But it’s not evidence of spontaneous machine consciousness or the birth of digital societies beyond human control.

What it is is a reminder that as AI grows more autonomous, the questions we need to ask are about governance, safety, and clarity, not apocalyptic narratives.

In other words: don’t panic. Just read the fine print before letting a legion of code-driven agents into your network.
