            <h2>Being Santa Claus is a year-round calling</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tis the season when professional Santas are in peak demand, but many who choose this line of work often view it as a higher calling and maintain some aspects of the identity all year round—even those who don’t fit the stereotypical popular image of Santa, according to a paper published in the Academy of Management Journal.

Co-author Christina Hymer of the University of Tennessee got the idea for the study during the COVID pandemic, when she spent a lot of time watching Christmas movies with her toddler. One favorite was 2003’s Elf, starring Will Farrell as a full-sized human raised among elves who goes to New York City to find his biological father. The film prompted her to wonder about why someone would want to be Santa Claus and what their experiences in that role would be.

Hymer and her co-authors partnered with the leader of a “Santa school” to analyze archival surveys of 849 professional Santas, and conducted a new survey of another 382 Santas. They also did over 50 personal interviews with professional Santas. (One subject showed up in full costume for his zoom interview, with a North Pole background, and signed off with a merry “ho! ho! ho!”)

Hymer et al. found that professional Santas tend to fall into one of three categories. The first is a prototypical Santa: straight, portly white men with natural white beards. There are also semi-prototypical Santas who might fit the traditional physical characteristics in some respects but not others—they might be younger, or slimmer, or clean-shaven. Finally, there are non-prototypical Santas who are well outside the traditional depiction: people of color, women, disabled Santas, or LGBTQ+ Santas.

“There are pretty strong societal expectations around what Santa looks like, but we found that most anybody can be Santa if their heart desires it,” said co-author Borbala Csillag of Oregon State University. “When we looked at the people behind the suit, we found that the folks playing Santa are really more diverse than would be expected. The expectations for playing the role may seem exclusive, but they are surmountable. Think about your attributes in a comprehensive way so you can identify the dimensions of the role that are well-fitting. You will likely find attributes that map to that calling, even if they are not obvious at first.”

Frankly, what’s most interesting about the paper isn’t those three fundamental categories, but the personalized glimpses it gives of the people who choose to become professional Santas. While a few Santas might make six figures, most do not, and may even lose money being Santa—they do it anyway for the sheer love of it. Professional Santas usually don’t see the role as seasonal; many build their identities around it, whether they fit the stereotypical Kris Kringle image or not. “My feeling is, if you’re Santa all the time, you have to live as Santa and give up whoever you are,” said one subject. “I’m just striving to be a better person.”

They’ll wear red and green all year round, for instance, or maintain a full white beard.  One Santa trained himself to make “Ho, ho, ho!” his natural laugh. Another redecorated his house as “Santa’s house,” complete with Christmas trees and Santa figurines.

Sometimes it’s viewed as a role: a gay professional Santa, for instance, deliberately suppresses his sexual orientation when playing Santa, complete with partnering with a Mrs. Claus for public appearances. However, a female Santa who goes by Lynx (professional Santas typically take on pseudonyms) who is also a church leader, likens the job to a divine calling: “I can connect with people and remind them they’re loved,” she said. (She also binds her breasts when in costume because “Santa doesn’t have them double-Ds.”)

Perhaps that sense of a higher calling is why even non-prototypical Santas like Lynx persevere in the fact of occasional rejection. One Black Santa recalled being denied the position at a big box store once the interviewer found out his ethnicity, telling him the store didn’t hire Black or Hispanic Santas. “That hurt my heart so much,” he said. A disabled Santa who uses a scooter during parades recalled being criticized by other professional Santas for doing so—but stuck with it.

And while Bad Santa (2003) might be a fun holiday watch, actual “bad Santas” caught smoking, drinking, swearing, or otherwise behaving inappropriately are not popular figures within their community. “You’re never off,” one subject opined. “You lose a little bit of your identity because you can’t let your hair down and be yourself. You don’t know who’s watching you.”

“You’re Santa Claus 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks a year,” another Santa said. “If you act out, you risk shattering the magic.”

            <h2>SPEED Act passes in House despite changes that threaten clean power projects</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/speed-act-passes-in-house-despite-changes-that-threaten-clean-power-projects/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The House of Representatives cleared the way for a massive overhaul of the federal environmental review process last Thursday, despite last-minute changes that led clean energy groups and moderate Democrats to pull their support.

The Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act, or SPEED Act, overcame opposition from environmentalists and many Democrats who oppose the bill’s sweeping changes to a bedrock environmental law.

The bill, introduced by Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) and backed by Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine), passed the House Thursday in a 221-196 vote, in which 11 Democrats joined Republican lawmakers to back the reform effort. It now heads to the Senate, where it has critics and proponents on both sides of the aisle, making its prospects uncertain.

The bill seeks to reform foundational environmental regulations that govern how major government projects are assessed and approved by amending the landmark 1970 National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), signed into law under the Nixon administration. NEPA requires federal agencies to review and disclose the environmental impacts of major projects before permitting or funding them. Although NEPA reviews are only one component of the federal permitting process, advocates argue that they serve a crucial role by providing both the government and the public the chance to examine the knock-on effects that major projects could have on the environment.

Critics of the law have argued for years that increasingly complex reviews—along with legal wrangling over the findings of those reviews—have turned NEPA into a source of significant, burdensome delays that threaten the feasibility of major projects, such as power plants, transmission lines, and wind and solar projects on federal land.

Speaking on the floor of the House Thursday before the vote, Westerman described the SPEED Act as a way to “restore common sense and accountability to federal permitting.” Westerman praised the original intent of NEPA but said the law’s intended environmental protections had been overshadowed by NEPA becoming “more synonymous with red tape and waste.

“What was meant to facilitate responsible development has been twisted into a bureaucratic bottleneck that delays investments in the infrastructure and technologies that make our country run,” Westerman said.

After the bill’s passage through the House on Thursday, the SPEED Act’s Democratic cosponsor, Golden, praised the bill’s success.

“The simplest way to make energy, housing, and other essentials more affordable is to make it possible to actually produce enough of it at a reasonable cost,” Golden said in a press release following the vote. “The SPEED Act has united workers, businesses, and political forces who usually oppose each other because scarcity hurts everyone.”

According to an issue brief from the Bipartisan Policy Center, the bill aims to reform the NEPA process in several key ways. First, it makes changes to the ways agencies comply with NEPA—for example, by creating exemptions to when a NEPA review is required, and requiring agencies to only consider environmental impacts that are directly tied to the project at hand.

It would also drastically shorten the deadline to sue a federal agency over its permitting decision and constrain who is eligible to file suit. Current law provides a six-year statute of limitations on agency decisions for permitting energy infrastructure, and two years for transportation project permits. Under the SPEED Act’s provisions, those deadlines would be shortened to a mere 150 days and only allow lawsuits to be filed by plaintiffs who demonstrated in public comment periods that they would be directly and negatively impacted by the project.

NEPA does not require the government to make particular decisions about whether or how to move forward with a project based on a review’s findings. However, critics argue that in the decades since its passage, interest groups have “weaponized” the NEPA process to delay or even doom projects they oppose, sometimes forcing agencies to conduct additional analyses that add costly delays to project timelines.

Although climate activists and environmental groups have used NEPA to oppose fossil fuel projects, such as the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, oil and gas interests are far from the only group seeking respite. Some voices within the clean energy industry have called for permitting reform, too, arguing that delays stemming from the current permitting process have had a negative impact on America’s ability to build out more climate-friendly projects, including some offshore wind projects and transmission lines to connect renewables to the grid.

So when Westerman and Golden introduced the SPEED Act in the House, a hodgepodge of odd alliances and opposition groups formed in response.

The American Petroleum Institute, a trade association for the oil and gas industry, launched a seven-figure advertising campaign in recent months pushing lawmakers to pursue permitting reform, according to a report from Axios. And the bill also initially enjoyed support from voices within the clean power industry. However, last-minute changes to the bill—designed to win over Republican holdouts—undermined the SPEED Act’s cross-sector support.

The bill’s opponents had previously raised alarm bells that fossil fuel interests would disproportionately benefit from a more streamlined review process under the current administration, citing President Donald Trump’s ongoing war against wind and solar energy projects.

In recent months, the Trump administration has sought to pause, reconsider, or revoke already approved permits for renewable energy projects it dislikes. Those moves particularly impacted offshore wind developments and added significant uncertainty to the feasibility of clean energy investments as a whole.

A bipartisan amendment to the SPEED Act, added during the Natural Resources Committee’s markup in November, sought to address some of those concerns by adding language that would make it more difficult for the administration to “revoke, rescind, withdraw, terminate, suspend, amend, alter, or take any other action to interfere” with an existing authorization.

However, that measure encountered resistance from key Republican voices who support Trump’s attacks on offshore wind projects.

On Tuesday, Republican lawmakers in the Rules Committee were able to amend the SPEED Act in a way that would facilitate the Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to axe renewable energy projects. The changes were spearheaded by Andy Harris (R-Md.) and Jeff Van Drew (R-N.J.), two vocal proponents of Trump’s energy policies. The amendment fundamentally undermined the technology-neutral aspirations of the bill—and any hope of receiving widespread support from moderate Democrats or the clean power industry.

According to Matthew Davis, vice president of federal policy at the League of Conservation Voters, Harris and Van Drew’s amendment would allow the administration to exclude any project from the bill’s reforms that the Trump administration had flagged for reconsideration—something the administration has done repeatedly for renewable projects like offshore wind.

The result, Davis argued, is that the bill would speed up the environmental review process for the Trump administration’s preferred sources of energy—namely, oil and gas—while leaving clean energy projects languishing.

“They couldn’t pass the rule on Tuesday to even consider this bill without making it even better for the fossil fuel industry and even worse for the clean energy industry,” Davis said.

In a public statement following Thursday’s vote, Davis described the amended SPEED Act as “a fossil fuel giveaway that cuts out community input and puts our health and safety at risk to help big polluters.”

The American Clean Power Association, which represents the renewable energy industry, previously hailed the bill as an important step forward for the future of clean energy development. But after the Rules Committee’s changes on Tuesday, the organization dropped its support.

“Our support for permitting reform has always rested on one principle: fixing a broken system for all energy resources,” said ACP CEO Jason Grumet in a Wednesday statement. “The amendment adopted last night violate[s] that principle. Technology neutrality wasn’t just good policy—it was the political foundation that made reform achievable.”

The American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE), a nonprofit trade and advocacy organization, echoed that sentiment.

“Durable, bipartisan, technology-neutral permitting reforms that support and advance the full suite of American electricity resources and the necessary expansion of transmission infrastructure to get that electricity from where it’s generated to where it’s needed are essential to meeting that challenge reliably, securely, and most importantly, affordably,” said ACORE CEO Ray Long. “Unfortunately, the changes made on the House floor are a disappointing step backward from achieving these objectives.”

Following the SPEED Act’s passage through the House on Thursday, advocacy group Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions (CRES) issued a public statement praising the bill’s success while noting how the recent amendments had affected the law.

“While we are concerned that post committee additions to the bill could put the certainty of a range of projects at risk, this bill’s underlying reforms are critical to advancing American energy,” CRES President Heather Reams said in the statement.

Even before the move to strip protections for renewables from the bill, some critics—like Rep. Mike Levin (D-Calif.)—said that the legislation didn’t go far enough to curtail the president’s “all-out assault” against clean power, arguing that the bill does nothing to restore approvals that have already been canceled by the administration and doesn’t address other roadblocks that have been put in place.

“The administration cannot be trusted to act without specific language, in my view, to protect the clean energy projects already in the pipeline and to prevent the Interior Secretary from unilaterally stopping projects that are needed to lower costs and improve grid reliability,” Levin told Inside Climate News in an interview ahead of the House vote.

Both Levin and Davis pointed to a July memo from the Department of Interior that requires all wind and solar projects on federal land to receive higher-level approval from Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.

“The administration is not even returning the phone calls of project developers. They are not responding to applications being submitted,” Davis said. “That sort of approach is in stark contrast with the ‘white glove, concierge service’—and that’s a quote from the Trump administration—the service they are providing for fossil fuel companies to access our public lands.”

The SPEED Act’s opponents also dispute the idea that NEPA reviews are one of the primary causes of permitting delays, arguing that reports from the Congressional Research Service and other groups have found little evidence to support those claims.

“Often missing in the conversation around NEPA is the empirical research that’s been done, and there’s a lot of that out there,” said Jarryd Page, a staff attorney at the Environmental Law Institute, in a September interview with Inside Climate News.

That research points to resource constraints as one of the biggest roadblocks, Page said, like not having enough staff to conduct the environmental reviews, or staff lacking adequate experience and technical know-how.

Debate over NEPA and the reform of the permitting process will now move into the Senate, where experts say the SPEED Act will likely undergo further changes.

“I think as the bill goes forwards in the Senate, we’ll probably see a neutral, across-the-board approach to making sure the process is fair for all technology types,” Xan Fishman, an energy policy expert at the Bipartisan Policy Center told ICN after Thursday’s vote.

Fishman stressed it would be crucial to ensure permits for projects wouldn’t suddenly be cancelled for political reasons, but said he was optimistic about how the SPEED Act would be refined in the Senate.

“It’s great to see Congress so engaged with permitting reform,” he said. “Both sides of the aisle see a need to do better.”

Most of us have seen a nature documentary or two (or three) at some point in our lives, so it’s a familiar format: sweeping, majestic footage of impressively regal animals accompanied by reverently high-toned narration (preferably with a tony British accent). Underdogs takes a decidedly different approach. Narrated with hilarious irreverence by Ryan Reynolds, the five-part series highlights nature’s less cool and majestic creatures—the outcasts and benchwarmers more noteworthy for their “unconventional hygiene choices” and “unsavory courtship rituals.” (It’s rated PG-13 due to the odd bit of scatalogical humor and shots of Nature Sexy Time.)

Each of the five episodes is built around a specific genre. “Superheroes” highlights the surprising superpowers of the honey badger, pistol shrimp, and the invisible glass frog, among others, augmented with comic book graphics; “Sexy Beasts” focuses on bizarre mating habits and follows the format of a romantic advice column; “Terrible Parents” highlights nature’s worst practices, following the outline of a parenting guide; “Total Grossout” is exactly what it sounds like; and “The Unusual Suspects” is a heist tale, documenting the supposed efforts of a macaque to put together the ultimate team of masters of deception and disguise (an inside man, a decoy, a fall guy, etc.). Green Day even wrote and recorded a special theme song for the opening credits.

While Reynolds mostly followed the script (which his team helped write), there was also a fair amount of improvisation—not all of it PG-13. The producers couldn’t use the racier ad-libs. But some made it into the final episodes, like Reynolds describing an aye-aye as “if fear and panic had a baby and rolled it in dog hair.” We also meet the velvet worm, which creeps up on unsuspecting prey before squirting disgusting slime all over their food, and the pearl fish, which hides from predators in a sea cucumber’s butt, among other lowly yet fascinating critters. Verdict: Underdogs is positively addictive. It’s my favorite nature documentary ever.

Dep. Q is a rare show that commits to old tropes—an unlikable but smart central character revisits cold cases—and somehow manages to repackage them in a way that feels distinctive. To get a sense of the show, you only have to describe its precise genre. You might call it a murder mystery, and there are murders in it, but one of the mysteries is whether a key player is alive or not, given that a lot of her story takes place in flashbacks with an uncertain relationship to the present. It’s almost a police procedural, except that many of the police are only following procedures grudgingly and erratically. It’s not really a whodunnit, given that you only end up learning who done some of it by the time the first season wraps up. And so on.

Amid all the genre fluidity, the show does a great job of balancing the key challenge of a mystery program: telling you enough that you can make reasonably informed guesses on at least some of what’s going on without giving the whole game away and making it easy to figure out all the details. And the acting is superb. Matthew Goode does a nice job of handling the central character’s recent trauma while helping you understand why he has a few loyal co-workers despite the fact that he was probably unlikable even before he was traumatized. And Alexej Manvelov (who I’d never seen before) is fantastic as a former Syrian policeman who drops occasional hints that he had been an active participant in that country’s police state.

There are definitely quibbles. The creation of a cold case squad happens on the flimsiest of motivations, and the fantastic Kelly Macdonald is badly underused. But the show is definitely good enough that I’m curious about some additional mysteries: Can the team behind it continue to avoid getting bogged down in the tropes in season two, and which of the many threads it left unresolved will be picked up when they try?

Enthusiasm was understandably high for Daredevil: Born Again, Marvel’s revival of the hugely popular series in the Netflix Defenders universe. Not only was Charlie Cox returning to the title role as Matt Murdock/Daredevil, but Vincent D’Onofrio was also coming back as his nemesis, crime lord Wilson Fisk/Kingpin. Their dynamic has always been electric, and that on-screen magic is as powerful as ever in Born Again, which quickly earned critical raves and a second season.

Granted, there were some rough spots. The entire season was overhauled during the 2023 Hollywood strikes, and at times it felt like two very different shows. A weird serial killer subplot was primarily just distracting. There was also the controversial decision to kill off a major character from the original Netflix series in the first episode. But that creative choice cleared the decks to place the focus squarely on Matt’s and Fisk’s parallel arcs, and the two central actors do not disappoint.

Matt decides to focus on his legal work while Fisk is elected mayor of New York City, intent on leaving his criminal life behind. But each struggles to remain in the light as the dark sides of their respective natures fight to be released. The result is an entertaining, character-driven series that feels very much a part of its predecessor while still having its own distinctive feel.

I confess I might have missed Boots had it not been singled out and dismissed as “woke garbage” by the Pentagon—thereby doubling the show’s viewership. I was pleased to discover that it’s actually a moving, often thought-provoking dramedy that humanizes all the young men from many different backgrounds who volunteer to serve their country in the US military. The show is based on a memoir (The Pink Marine) by Greg Cope White about his experiences as a gay teen in the military in the 1980s when gay and bisexual people weren’t allowed to serve. Boots is set in the early 1990s just before the onset of the “Don’t ask, don’t tell” era.

Miles Heizer stars as Cameron Cope (Cope White’s fictional alter ego), a closeted gay teen in Louisiana who signs up as a recruit for the US Marine Corps with his best (straight) friend Ray (Liam Oh). He’s not the most promising recruit, but over the course of eight episodes, we see him struggle, fail, pick himself back up, and try again during the grueling boot camp experience, forming strong bonds with his fellow recruits but all the while terrified of being outed and kicked out.

Heizer gives a powerful performance as Cameron, enhanced by the contrast with Max Parker’s stellar portrayal of the tightly wound Sergeant Liam Robert Sullivan—a decorated Marine inexplicably reassigned to train recruits while harboring his own secrets. Nor is Miles’ story the only focus: We learn more about several characters and their private struggles, and those inter-relationships are the heart and soul of the show. Netflix canceled the series, but this one season stands tall on its own.

This charming Emmy-nominated comedy series has made our “Best of TV” list every season, and 2025 is no exception. Only Murders in the Building (OMITB) stars Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez as Charles, Oliver, and Mabel, all residents of the same Manhattan apartment complex, the Arconia. The unlikely trio teams up to launch their own true crime podcast whenever someone dies in the building under suspicious circumstances, chronicling their independent investigation to solve the murder. There’s no shortage of podcast fodder, as this single building has a shockingly high murder rate.

S5 focused on the death of the building’s doorman, Lester (Teddy Coluca), found floating in the Arcadia’s fountain in the season finale. The discovery of a severed finger leads our team to conclude that Lester was murdered. Their quest involves a trio of billionaires, the mayor (Keegan-Michael Key), a missing mafioso (Bobby Cannavale) and his widow (Tea Leoni), and maybe even the building’s new robotic assistant, LESTR (voiced by Paul Rudd). As always, the season finale sets up next season’s murder: that of rival podcaster Cinda Canning (Tina Fey), who lives just long enough to reach the Arcadia’s gates and place one hand into the courtyard—technically dying “in the building.” One assumes that OMITB will eventually run out of fresh takes on its clever concept, but it certainly hasn’t done so yet.

I unequivocally loved the first season of The Sandman, the Netflix adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s influential graphic novel series (of which I am a longtime fan). I thought it captured the surreal, dream-like feel and tone of its source material, striking a perfect balance between the anthology approach of the graphic novels and grounding the narrative by focusing on the arc of its central figure: Morpheus, lord of the Dreaming. It was a long wait for the second and final season, but S2 retains all those elements to bring Dream’s story to its inevitably tragic yet satisfying end.

As always, the casting is extraordinary and the performances are note-perfect across the board. And Netflix did not skimp on the visuals, which bring the graphic novel imagery to vivid life. I still appreciate how the leisurely pacing lets the viewer relax and sink into this richly layered fictional world. Part I kicked off with an Endless family reunion that led Dream into revisiting Hell and agreeing to his sister Delirium’s request to look for their absent brother, Destruction. That sets in motion a chain of events that leads to the tragedy that unfolds in Part II. The bonus episode, in which Death gets one day (every hundred years) to be human—an adaptation of the standalone Death: The High Cost of Living—serves as a lovely coda to this unique series, which is pretty much everything I could have wanted in an adaptation.

Ludwig is a clever twist on the British cozy mystery genre. David Mitchell stars as John Taylor, a reclusive eccentric who creates puzzles for a living under the pseudonym “Ludwig.” When his identical twin brother, Cambridge DCI James Taylor (also Mitchell), goes missing, his sister-in-law Lucy (Anna Maxwell Martin) convinces John to go undercover. John reluctantly pretends to be James to gain access to the police department in hopes of finding out what happened to his twin. He inevitably gets drawn into working on cases—and turns out to be exceptionally good at applying his puzzle skills to solve murders, even as his anxiety grows about his subterfuge being discovered.

The best crime shows deftly balance cases-of-the-week with longer character-driven story arcs, and Ludwig achieves that balance beautifully. The writers brought in a puzzle consultant to create the various crosswords that appear in the series, as well as a special cryptic crossword done in character as Ludwig that appeared in The Guardian. The first season ended with a bit of a cliffhanger about what’s really been going on with James, but fortunately, the BBC has renewed Ludwig for a second season, so we’ll get to see more of our cryptic crime-solver.

Poker Face is perfect comfort TV, evolving the case-of-the-week format that made enduring early TV hits like Columbo and Murder, She Wrote iconic. The second season takes the endlessly likeable BS-detector Charlie Cale (Natasha Lyonne) to the end of the road after she overcomes fleeing the mob in her 1969 Plymouth Barracuda. Along the way, Charlie pals around with A-list guest stars and solves crimes, winding her way from Florida to New York as each delightful new caper serves not to ramp up tension but to disrupt how viewers anticipate Charlie will move. Some might think that the lack of tension made the season weaker. But creator Rian Johnson recently revealed that he expects Poker Face to cast a new lead detective every two years. That makes it seem clear that Charlie’s second season was more about release.

In the most memorable episode of the season, “Sloppy Joseph,” the front row of an elementary school talent show suddenly becomes a bloody splash zone when a bullied boy is framed for killing the class pet, a gerbil, with a giant mallet. That scene is perhaps an apt metaphor for Johnson’s attempt to keep modern-day viewers from turning away from their TVs by shattering expectations. It’s unclear yet if his formulaic TV hijinks will work, but if anyone decides to pick up Poker Face after Peacock declined to renew it, Peter Dinklage is next in line to become the world’s greatest lie detector.

I was a latecomer to this eminently watchable show created by Julian Fellowes (Gosford Park), who also gave us the Emmy-winning sensation Downton Abbey. Instead of following the adventures of post-Edwardian British aristocracy and their domestic servants, the focus is on ultra-wealthy Americans and their domestic servants in the 1880s and the social tensions that arise from the “old money” versus “new money” dynamic of this rapidly changing period. The Gilded Age has been described as an “operatic soap” (rather than a soap opera), replete with a hugely talented ensemble cast donning lavish costumes and cavorting in extravagantly opulent settings. It’s unadulterated, addictive escapism, and the series really hit its stride in S3.

Old Money is represented by Agnes van Rhijn (Christine Baranski), a wealthy widow who lives with her spinster sister Ada (Cynthia Nixon); orphaned niece Marian (Louisa Jacobson); and son and heir Oscar (Blake Ritson), a closeted gay man seeking to marry a rich heiress. Living just across the street is New Money, personified by robber baron/railroad tycoon George Russell (Morgan Spector) and his socially ambitious wife Bertha (Carrie Coon) and their two children. You’ve got Marian’s friend Peggy (Denee Benton) representing the emerging Black upper class and a colorful assortment of domestics in both houses, like aspiring inventor Jack (Ben Ahlers), who dreams of greater things.

Fictionalized versions of notable historical people occasionally appear, and two figure prominently: Caroline Astor (Donna Murphy), who ruled New York society at the time, and her simpering sycophant Ward McAllister (Nathan Lane). (The Russells are loosely inspired by William and Ava Vanderbilt.) The stakes might sometimes seem small—there’s a multi-episode arc devoted to which of two competing opera houses New York’s social elite will choose to sponsor—but for the characters, they are huge, and Fellowes makes the audience feel equally invested in the outcomes. There were a few rough edges in the first season, but The Gilded Age quickly found its footing; it has gotten better and more richly textured with each successive season and never takes itself too seriously.

The Mitford sisters were born to be immortalized one day in a British period drama, and Outrageous is happy to oblige. There were six of them (and one brother), and their scandalous exploits frequently made global headlines in the 1930s. This is ultimately a fictionalized account of how the rise of Hitler and British fascism fractured this once tight-knit aristocratic family. The focus is on smaller, domestic drama—budding romances, failed marriages, literary aspirations, and dwindling fortunes—colored by the ominous global events unfolding on a larger scale.

Nancy (Bessie Carter) is the primary figure, an aspiring novelist with a cheating husband who feels increasingly alienated from her older sister and bestie Diana (Joanna Vanderham). Diana married a baron but becomes enamored of Oswald Mosley (Joshua Sasse), leader of the British fascist party, embarking on a torrid affair. Another sister, Unity (Shannon Watson), is also seduced by Nazi ideology and has a major crush on Hitler. Meanwhile, Jessica (Zoe Brough) is drawn to the Communist cause, which rankles both her siblings and her traditionally conservative parents.

Things come to a head when Unity goes to study in Germany and becomes completely radicalized, even publishing a vicious anti-semitic screed that shames the family. Diana also goes all-in on fascism when she leaves her husband for Mosley, whom Nancy loathes. Jessica elopes with her Communist cousin to Spain to be on the front lines of that civil war, leading to a lifelong estrangement from Diana. Nancy, the political moderate, is caught in the middle, torn between her love for her sisters and her increasing discomfort with Diana and Unity’s extreme political views.

The Mitford sisters were prolific letter writers all their lives, so there was plenty of material for screenwriter Sarah Williams to draw on when fictionalizing their stories at such a pivotal point in the family’s (and the world’s) history. Outrageous is quite historically accurate in broad outlines, and there are plenty of moments of wry, understated humor amid the family tensions. The gifted cast makes the sisters come alive in all their flawed humanity. There’s no word yet on a second season, and this one ends on a suitable note, but there’s so much more story left to tell, so I hope Outrageous returns.

I’ll admit I wasn’t sure how well A Man on the Inside would fare with its sophomore season after knocking it out of the park in S1. I should have known showrunner Mike Schur (The Good Place) could pull it off. Ted Danson plays Charles Nieuwendyk, a recently widowed retired engineering professor. In S1, he was hired by private detective Julie Kovalenko (Lilah Richcreek Estrada) to go undercover at a San Francisco retirement community to solve the mystery of a stolen ruby necklace. In S2, Charles returns to his academic roots and goes undercover at fictional Wheeler College to solve the mystery of a stolen laptop—a crime that just might have implications for the survival of the college itself.

Charles even falls in love for the first time since his wife’s death with music professor Mona Margadoff (Mary Steenburgen, Danson’s wife IRL), despite the two being polar opposites. The show continues to be a welcome mix of funny, sweet, sour, and touching, while never lapsing into schmaltz. The central Thanksgiving episode—where Mona meets Charles’s family and friends for the first time—is a prime example, as various tensions simmering below the surface erupt over the dinner table. Somehow, everyone manages to make their respective peace in entirely believable ways. It’s lovely to see a series grapple so openly, with so much warmth and humor, with the loneliness of aging and grief and how it can affect extended family. And the show once again drives home the message that new beginnings are always possible, even when one thinks one’s life is over.

When real-life political administrations refer to officials as Darth Vader in unironically flattering terms, maybe George Lucas made the Dark Lord of the Sith a little too iconic. Showrunner Tony Gilroy made no such effort in his depiction of the fascists in Andor.

During Andor‘s run, which ended this year with S2, the Empire is full of sad corporate ladder climbers who are willing to stab another in the back to get to the next rung of the Imperial hierarchy. The show makes it clear that these are not people to emulate. If more fans watched the show, maybe that message could have landed for them.

For people who grew up with Star Wars and want something more to chew on in our adulthood than endless callbacks to the original trilogy, Andor is revelatory. It colors the war of light versus dark with large amounts of gray because sometimes, as one character puts it, you have to use the tools of your enemy to defeat them (save for genetically gifted farmboys). Maybe most of Star Wars was always supposed to be for kids, but prestige TV viewers got a glimpse of what the universe could feel like if it took itself more seriously. Rather than use the broad strokes of a war of good versus evil, Andor painted between the lines to demonstrate how systemic oppression can look a lot more personal than firing a giant space laser.

For all its great writing and themes, Andor also delivered high stakes and suspense. Although we already knew the outcome of the story, we still held our breath during tense scenes with characters who make the ultimate sacrifice for a future they will never see.

My personal end-of-year TV list would never be complete without a nod to The Cowboy Channel, i.e., the only place where armchair enthusiasts like myself can follow our favorite cowboys and cowgirls throughout the rodeo season. The goal is to rack up enough money to qualify for the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo (NFR), held at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas every December. This year, I’ve picked the channel’s stellar annual coverage of the NFR itself to highlight. The entire season comes down to this: an intense 10-day competition in which the top 15 athletes in each event duke it out night after night in hopes of winning a coveted championship gold buckle. And night after night, The Cowboy Channel is there with live commentary and post-round analysis.

What I love most is just how unpredictable the NFR can be. Part of that is the substantial monetary rewards that come with round wins; an athlete coming in at #1 in earnings can see even a substantial lead evaporate over just a few nights. Part of it has to do with who wins the average, i.e., who performs the best over ten nights collectively in each event. Winning the average comes with a substantial payout that can lead to unexpected upsets in the final results. But mostly it’s just the human factor: The best in the world can have a bad night, and young rookies can have the night of their lives. An ill-timed injury can knock an athlete out of the competition entirely. And sometimes the judges make inexplicably bad calls with major consequences (*cough* Stetson Wright in Round 6 saddle bronc *cough*).

It’s all part of the excitement of rodeo. The Cowboy Channel’s in-depth coverage lets us experience all that drama even if we can’t attend in person and lets us savor how the story unfolds in each subsequent round. We celebrate the wins, mourn the losses, and cheer mightily for the final champions. (Stetson did just fine in the end.) Then we gear up to do it all over again next year.

The blockbuster success of the 1986 film Top Gun—chronicling the paths of young naval aviators as they go through the grueling US Navy’s Fighter Weapons School (aka the titular Top Gun)—spawned more than just a successful multimedia franchise. It has also been credited with inspiring future generations of fighter pilots. National Geographic took viewers behind the scenes to see the process play out for real with the documentary series Top Guns: The Next Generation.

Each episode focuses on a specific aspect of the training, following a handful of students from the Navy and Marines through the highs and lows of their training. That includes practicing dive bombs at breakneck speeds, successfully landing on an aircraft carrier by “catching the wire,” learning the most effective offensive and defensive maneuvers in dogfighting, and, finally, engaging in a freestyle dogfight against a seasoned instructor to complete the program and (hopefully) earn their golden wings. NatGeo was granted unprecedented access, even using in-cockpit cameras to capture the pulse-pounding action of being in the air, as well as more candidly intimate behind-the-scenes moments as the students grapple with their respective successes and failures. It’s a riveting watch.

My first draft of what was supposed to be a 300-ish word blurb describing why Alien: Earth is fantastic ended up exploding into a Defector-esque narrative deep dive into my ever-evolving relationship with Alien 3 as a film and how Alien: Earth has helped reshape my appreciation for that poor broken baby of a movie by mixing the best of its visual techniques into A:E’s absolutely masterful cocktail of narrative stylings—but I’ll spare you all of that.

Here’s the short version without the bloviating: Alien: Earth is the thing I’ve been waiting for since I walked out of the theater after seeing Alien 3 in the summer of 1992. Unlike Alien Resurrection, any of the AvPs, or the wet-fart, falls-apart-like-mud-in-the-third-act swing-and-miss of Alien: Romulus, A:E gets nearly everything right. It’s grounded without being stodgy; exciting without being stupid; referential without being derivative; fun without being pandering; respectful of the lore while being willing to try something new; and, above all else, it bleeds craftsmanship—every frame makes it obvious that this is a show made by people who love and care for the Alien universe.

The thing that grabs me anew with every episode is the show’s presentation and execution—a self-aware blending of all the best things Scott, Cameron, and Fincher brought to their respective films. As I get older, I’m drawn more and more to entertainment that shows me interesting things and does so in ontologically faithful ways—and oh, does this show ever deliver.

Each episode is a carefully crafted visual and tonal mix of all the previous Alien films, with the episodes’ soundtracks shifting eras to match the action on-screen—like Alien 3’s jumpy choir flash-cut opening credits melding into Aliens’ lonely snare drums. The result is a blended world made of all the best things I remember from the films, and it works in the same way the game Alien: Isolation worked: by conjuring up exactly what the places where we used to have nightmares looked and felt like, and then scaring us there again.

I have heard that The Internet had some problems with the show, but, eh, everybody’s going to hate something. I vaguely remember some of the complaints having to do with how some of the new alien life-forms seem to be scarier or deadlier than our beloved and familiar main monster. All I’ve got for that one is a big fat shrug—I’m fine with our capital-A-aliens sharing the stage with some equally nasty new creatures. The aliens are always more interesting as devices to explore a story than as dramatic ends themselves, and I mean, let’s face it, in the past 40-plus years, there’s not much we haven’t seen them do and/or kill. They’re a literary force, not characters, and I’m way more interested in seeing how they shape the story of the people around them.

The tl;dr is that Alien: Earth is awesome, and if you haven’t watched it, you absolutely should. And when I was a kid, I used to regularly get put in time-out in recess for stiff-arming other kids while pretending to be a power loader, so you should consider my tastemaking credentials in this matter unimpeachable.

In the most violent series to ever catch the world’s attention by playing beloved children’s games, it turns out that the most high-stakes choice that creator Hwang Dong-hyuk could make was to put a child in the arena. For Squid Game‘s final season, Hwang has said the season’s pivotal moment—a pregnant girl birthing a baby during a game of hide-and-seek with knives—was designed to dash viewers’ hopes that a brighter future may await those who survive the games. By leaving the task of saving the baby to the series hero, Seong Gi-hun, whose own strained relationship with his daughter led him into the games in the first season, Squid Game walked a gritty tightrope to the very end.

The only real misstep was involving the goofiest set of cartoon villain VIPs more directly in the games. But we can forgive Hwang the clunky Dr. Evil-like dialogue that slowed down the action. He’s made it clear that he put everything into developing dramatic sequences for the game players—losing teeth, barely eating, rarely sleeping—and he fully admitted to The New York Times that “I have a cartoonish way of giving comic relief.

Let’s be clear: The Diplomat is a soap opera. If you’re not into cliffhangers, intense levels of drama, and will-they-won’t-they sexual tension, it’s probably not going to be for you. Sometimes there’s so much going on that it becomes almost farcical. If that doesn’t scare you off, what do you get in return?

Superb actors given rich and intriguing characters to inhabit. A political drama that nicely finds a balance between the excessive idealism of The West Wing and the excessive cynicism of Veep. A disturbingly realistic-feeling series of crises that the characters sometimes direct, and sometimes hang on for dear life as they get dragged along by. And, well, the cliffhangers have been good enough to get me tuning in to the next season as soon as it appears on Netflix.

Kerri Russell plays the titular diplomat, who is assigned to what seems like a completely innocuous position: ambassador to one of the US’s closest allies, the UK. Rufus Sewell portrays her husband, a loose-to-the-point-of-unmoored cannon who ensures the posting is anything but innocuous. Ali Ahn and Ato Assandoh, neither of whom I was familiar with, are fantastic as embassy staff. And as the central crisis has grown in scale, some familiar West Wing faces (Allison Janey and Bradley Whitford) have joined the cast. Almost all of the small roles have been superbly acted as well. And for all the dysfunction, cynicism, and selfish behavior that drive the plot forward, the politics in The Diplomat feels like pleasant escapism when compared to the present reality.

Apple TV+’s Murderbot, based on Martha Wells’ bestselling series of novels The Murderbot Diaries, is a jauntily charming sci-fi comedy dripping with wry wit and an intriguing mystery. Murderbot the TV series adapts the first book in the series, All Systems Red. A security unit that thinks of itself as Murderbot (Alexander Skarsgård) is on assignment on a distant planet, protecting a team of scientists who hail from a “freehold.”

Mensah (Noma Dumezweni) is the team leader. The team also includes Bharadwaj (Tamara Podemski) and Gurathin (David Dastmalchian), who is an augmented human plugged into the same data feeds as Murderbot (processing at a much slower rate). Pin-Lee (Sabrina Wu) also serves as the team’s legal counsel; they are in a relationship with Arada (Tattiawna Jones), eventually becoming a throuple with Ratthi (Akshaye Khanna). Unbeknownst to the team, Murderbot has figured out how to override his governor module that compels it to obey the humans’ commands. So Murderbot essentially has free will.

The task of adapting Wells’ novellas for TV fell to sibling co-creators Paul Weitz and Chris Weitz. (Wells herself was a consulting producer.) They’ve kept most of the storyline intact, fleshing out characters and punching up the humor a bit, even recreating campy scenes from Murderbot’s favorite show, The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon. (John Cho and Clark Gregg make cameos as the stars of that fictional show-within-a-show.) The entire cast is terrific, but it’s Skarsgård’s hilariously deadpan performance that holds it all together as he learns how to relate to the humans—even forming some unexpectedly strong bonds.

Fans of Slow Horses (see below), rejoice: with Down Cemetery Road, Apple TV has blessed us with another exciting mystery thriller series based on the works of Mick Herron—in this case, his 2003 novel introducing private investigator Zoë Boehm (Emma Thompson). Ruth Wilson co-stars as Sarah, an artist rather unhappily married to a finance bro. A neighboring building is destroyed by an explosion, and Sarah tries to deliver a get-well card to a little girl who survived from her young classmates. She’s inexplicably rebuffed, and her dogged attempts to figure out what’s going on lead her to seek the help of Zoë’s PI partner and estranged husband Joe (Adam Godley). What Joe finds out gets him killed, setting Sarah and Zoë on a collision course with high-placed government officials trying to cover up a pending scandal.

Thompson and Wilson make a dynamic pair. This is Thompson’s meatiest role in a while: Her Zoë is all flinty cynicism and tough exterior, masking an inner vulnerability she’s learned to keep buried. Wilson’s Sarah is the polar opposite in many ways, but she’s equally dogged, and both women are eccentrics who tend to rub people the wrong way. They’re united in a common goal: find the missing girl and bring her kidnappers (and Joe’s killer) to justice. Down Cemetery Road takes a bit of time to set up its premise and its characters, but the pace builds and builds to a big, satisfying finale. It’s not quite on the level of Slow Horses, but it’s pretty darned close.

After watching five episodes of the nine-episode first season of Apple TV’s Pluribus, I’m still not sure if I should be rooting for protagonist Carol Sturka or not. On the one hand, Carol is one of the last true “individuals” on Earth, fighting to maintain that individuality against a creepy alien pseudo-virus that has made almost everyone else part of a creepy, psychically connected hive mind. Reversing that effect, and getting the world “back to normal,” is an understandable and sympathetic response on Carol’s part.

On the other hand, it’s unlear that being absorbed into the hive mind is a change for the worse, on a humanity-wide scale. Unlike Star Trek’s Borg—who are violent, shambling drones that seem to have an overall miserable existence—the new hive-mind humanity is unfailingly pacifist, intelligent, capable, and (seemingly) blissfully, peacefully happy. In a sense, this virus has “solved” human nature by removing the paranoia, fear, anger, and distrust that naturally come from never truly knowing what’s going on in your neighbor’s head.

The fact that Pluribus has so far been able to navigate this premise without coming down strongly on one side or the other is frankly incredible. The fact that it has done it with consistent humor, thrills, and amazing cinematography transforms it into a must-watch.

There are many things I enjoy about Slow Horses, the Apple TV thriller about some not-great spies based on Mick Herron’s novels of the same name. The plots are gripping. The acting can be sublime. It’s shot well. And in its fifth season, which began streaming this September, Slow Horses engages more with the author’s humor than in seasons past. But with a plot involving the honeypotting of the deluded computer expert almost-extraordinaire Roddy Ho (played to perfection by Christopher Chung), that would be hard to avoid.

Slough House is a rundown MI5 office used as a dumping ground for employees in disgrace—the slow horses. They can’t be fired, but they can quit, and working for Jackson Lamb (Gary Oldman) is meant to make that happen. Lamb is a veteran of the dirtiest days of the Cold War, knowing not only where most of the bodies are buried but having helped put a few of them there himself. His legendary field prowess is only dwarfed by his repellent personality, mocking and belittling everyone in sight—but often deservedly so.

Each member of his team is there for a different sin, and throughout the season—which involves a plot to destabilize the British government, ripped from an MI5 playbook—we see evidence of why they’ve been consigned to the slow horses. These are not invincible operators, just flawed human beings, perfectly capable of screwing up again and again. And yet, our lovable bunch of losers usually manages to come through in the end, showing up “the Park&quot;—MI5’s (fictional) head office in London’s Regent’s Park, which is usually a step behind Lamb’s quick and devious thinking.

The adaptation is faithful enough to the books to give me deja vu during the first episode, and with just six episodes in a season, the payoff comes relatively quickly. I can’t wait for season 6.

The second season of Severance was never going to be able to live up to the constant, slow rollout of gut punches that characterized the first season. Those first 10 episodes ably explored the most important implications of the titular severance procedure, which splits a single person into separate “innie” and “outtie” consciousnesses with distinct sets of memories. The audience got to explore those implications along with the “innie” characters, who were struggling against the boundaries of their odd cubicle life right up until that thrilling final shot.

With so much now revealed and understood, a lot of that fire fell out of the second season of the show. Sure, there were still some loose ends to tie up from the mysteries of the first season, and plenty of new, off-puttingly weird situations on offer. And the new season definitely has quite a few high points, like the big twist revealed when the “innies” get to have a rare outdoor excursion or the extended flashback showing a character trapped in a seemingly endless sequence of social tests she can’t remember afterward.

But S2 also spent entire episodes exploring backstories and mysteries that didn’t have nearly as much emotional or plot impact. By the time the final episode arrived—with a rescue sequence that required an inordinate amount of suspension of disbelief—I found myself wondering just how much more interesting juice there was to squeeze from the show’s brilliant original premise. I worry that the show is trending in the direction of Lost, which drew things out with a lot of uninteresting padding before finally resolving the plot’s core puzzle box in an unsatisfying way. I’m still along on that ride for now, but I really hope it’s going somewhere soon.

Paul William Davies created this delightful mystery comedy, loosely based on a bestselling nonfiction book by Kate Andersen Brower about the maids, butlers, cooks, florists, doormen, engineers, and others dedicated to ensuring the White House residence runs smoothly. In the middle of a state dinner for the visiting Australian prime minister, White House Chief Usher A.B. Wynter (Giancarlo Esposito) is found dead in the third-floor game room. Everyone initially assumes it was suicide.

Enter private detective Cordelia Cupp (Uzo Aduba), who most definitely does not think it was suicide and proceeds to investigate. She has about a dozen suspects, and her blunt, rather eccentric personality means she’s not remotely intimidated by the august setting of this particular murder. Cupp even takes the odd break in sleuthing to do a bit of birdwatching on the White House grounds. (It’s her goal to see all the birds President Teddy Roosevelt recorded during his tenure.) Birdwatching is more than a lifelong hobby for Cupp; it’s central to her character and to how she approaches solving crimes. Bonus: Viewers learn a lot of fascinating bird trivia over eight episodes.

Davies has devised a clever narrative structure, telling the story in flashbacks during a Congressional hearing (presided over by former US Sen. Al Franken playing a fictional senator from Washington state). It’s a good mystery with plenty of unexpected twists and snappy dialogue. Each episode title refers to a famous murder mystery; the camerawork is inventive and fun; and everyone in the cast knocks it out of the park. I especially loved pop star Kylie Minogue’s cameo playing a fictional version of herself as a state dinner guest. Davies apparently couldn’t convince her fellow Australian Hugh Jackman to also make a cameo. But Ben Prendergast’s winking portrayal of “Hugh Jackman&quot;—only seen from behind or with his face obscured—is actually funnier than having the real actor.

It would be a mistake to dismiss The Residence as a mere bauble of a murder mystery just because of its playful, lighthearted tone. The show really does capture what is special and unique about the people who keep the White House residence functioning and why they matter—to each other and to America. Cupp’s final speech after unmasking the killer drives home those points with particular poignancy.

Netflix sadly canceled this excellent series, so there won’t be a second season—although I’m not sure how the writers could improve on such a tour de force. Do we really need Cupp to solve another elaborate murder in the White House? If I’m being honest, probably not. But she’s such a great character. I’d love to see more of her, perhaps in a Knives Out-style franchise where the location and main suspects continually change while the central detective stays the same. Somebody make it so.</div>

            <h2>How AI coding agents work—and what to remember if you use them</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/12/how-do-ai-coding-agents-work-we-look-under-the-hood/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI coding agents from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google can now work on software projects for hours at a time, writing complete apps, running tests, and fixing bugs with human supervision. But these tools are not magic and can complicate rather than simplify a software project. Understanding how they work under the hood can help developers know when (and if) to use them, while avoiding common pitfalls.

We’ll start with the basics: At the core of every AI coding agent is a technology called a large language model (LLM), which is a type of neural network trained on vast amounts of text data, including lots of programming code. It’s a pattern-matching machine that uses a prompt to “extract” compressed statistical representations of data it saw during training and provide a plausible continuation of that pattern as an output. In this extraction, an LLM can interpolate across domains and concepts, resulting in some useful logical inferences when done well and confabulation errors when done poorly.

These base models are then further refined through techniques like fine-tuning on curated examples and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which shape the model to follow instructions, use tools, and produce more useful outputs.

Over the past few years, AI researchers have been probing LLMs’ deficiencies and finding ways to work around them. One recent innovation was the simulated reasoning model, which generates context (extending the prompt) in the form of reasoning-style text that can help an LLM home in on a more accurate output. Another innovation was an application called an “agent” that links several LLMs together to perform tasks simultaneously and evaluate outputs.

In that sense, each AI coding agent is a program wrapper that works with multiple LLMs. There is typically a “supervising” LLM that interprets tasks (prompts) from the human user and then assigns those tasks to parallel LLMs that can use software tools to execute the instructions. The supervising agent can interrupt tasks below it and evaluate the subtask results to see how a project is going. Anthropic’s engineering documentation describes this pattern as “gather context, take action, verify work, repeat.”

If run locally through a command-line interface (CLI), users give the agents conditional permission to write files on the local machine (code or whatever is needed), run exploratory commands (say, “ls” to list files in a directory), fetch websites (usually using “curl”), download software, or upload files to remote servers. There are lots of possibilities (and potential dangers) with this approach, so it needs to be used carefully.

In contrast, when a user starts a task in the web-based agent like the web versions of Codex and Claude Code, the system provisions a sandboxed cloud container preloaded with the user’s code repository, where Codex can read and edit files, run commands (including test harnesses and linters), and execute code in isolation. Anthropic’s Claude Code uses operating system-level features to create filesystem and network boundaries within which the agent can work more freely.

Every LLM has a short-term memory, so to speak, that limits the amount of data it can process before it “forgets” what it’s doing. This is called “context.” Every time you submit a response to the supervising agent, you are amending one gigantic prompt that includes the entire history of the conversation so far (and all the code generated, plus the simulated reasoning tokens the model uses to “think” more about a problem). The AI model then evaluates this prompt and produces an output. It’s a very computationally expensive process that increases quadratically with prompt size because LLMs process every token (chunk of data) against every other token in the prompt.

Anthropic’s engineering team describes context as a finite resource with diminishing returns. Studies have revealed what researchers call “context rot”: As the number of tokens in the context window increases, the model’s ability to accurately recall information decreases. Every new token depletes what the documentation calls an “attention budget.”

This context limit naturally limits the size of a codebase a LLM can process at one time, and if you feed the AI model lots of huge code files (which have to be re-evaluated by the LLM every time you send another response), it can burn up token or usage limits pretty quickly.

To get around these limits, the creators of coding agents use several tricks. For example, AI models are fine-tuned to write code to outsource activities to other software tools. For example, they might write Python scripts to extract data from images or files rather than feeding the whole file through an LLM, which saves tokens and avoids inaccurate results.

Anthropic’s documentation notes that Claude Code also uses this approach to perform complex data analysis over large databases, writing targeted queries and using Bash commands like “head” and “tail” to analyze large volumes of data without ever loading the full data objects into context.

(In a way, these AI agents are guided but semi-autonomous tool-using programs that are a major extension of a concept we first saw in early 2023.)

Another major breakthrough in agents came from dynamic context management. Agents can do this in a few ways that are not fully disclosed in proprietary coding models, but we do know the most important technique they use: context compression.

When a coding LLM nears its context limit, this technique compresses the context history by summarizing it, losing details in the process but shortening the history to key details. Anthropic’s documentation describes this “compaction” as distilling context contents in a high-fidelity manner, preserving key details like architectural decisions and unresolved bugs while discarding redundant tool outputs.

This means the AI coding agents periodically “forget” a large portion of what they are doing every time this compression happens, but unlike older LLM-based systems, they aren’t completely clueless about what has transpired and can rapidly re-orient themselves by reading existing code, written notes left in files, change logs, and so on.

Anthropic’s documentation recommends using CLAUDE.md files to document common bash commands, core files, utility functions, code style guidelines, and testing instructions. AGENTS.md, now a multi-company standard, is another useful way of guiding agent actions in between context refreshes. These files act as external notes that let agents track progress across complex tasks while maintaining critical context that would otherwise be lost.

For tasks requiring extended work, both companies employ multi-agent architectures. According to Anthropic’s research documentation, its system uses an “orchestrator-worker pattern” in which a lead agent coordinates the process while delegating to specialized subagents that operate in parallel. When a user submits a query, the lead agent analyzes it, develops a strategy, and spawns subagents to explore different aspects simultaneously. The subagents act as intelligent filters, returning only relevant information rather than their full context to the lead agent.

The multi-agent approach burns through tokens rapidly. Anthropic’s documentation notes that agents typically use about four times more tokens than chatbot interactions, and multi-agent systems use about 15 times more tokens than chats. For economic viability, these systems require tasks where the value is high enough to justify the increased cost.

While using these agents is contentious in some programming circles, if you use one to code a project, knowing good software development practices helps to head off future problems. For example, it’s good to know about version control, making incremental backups, implementing one feature at a time, and testing it before moving on.

What people call “vibe coding”—creating AI-generated code without understanding what it’s doing—is clearly dangerous for production work. Shipping code you didn’t write yourself in a production environment is risky because it could introduce security issues or other bugs or begin gathering technical debt that could snowball over time.

Independent AI researcher Simon Willison recently argued that developers using coding agents still bear responsibility for proving their code works. “Almost anyone can prompt an LLM to generate a thousand-line patch and submit it for code review,” Willison wrote. “That’s no longer valuable. What’s valuable is contributing code that is proven to work.”

In fact, human planning is key. Claude Code’s best practices documentation recommends a specific workflow for complex problems: First, ask the agent to read relevant files and explicitly tell it not to write any code yet, then ask it to make a plan. Without these research and planning steps, the documentation warns, Claude’s outputs tend to jump straight to coding a solution.

Without planning, LLMs sometimes reach for quick solutions to satisfy a momentary objective that might break later if a project were expanded. So having some idea of what makes a good architecture for a modular program that can be expanded over time can help you guide the LLM to craft something more durable.

As mentioned above, these agents aren’t perfect, and some people prefer not to use them at all. A randomized controlled trial published by the nonprofit research organization METR in July 2025 found that experienced open-source developers actually took 19 percent longer to complete tasks when using AI tools, despite believing they were working faster. The study’s authors note several caveats: The developers were highly experienced with their codebases (averaging five years and 1,500 commits), the repositories were large and mature, and the models used (primarily Claude 3.5 and 3.7 Sonnet via Cursor) have since been superseded by more capable versions.

Whether newer models would produce different results remains an open question, but the study suggests that AI coding tools may not always provide universal speed-ups, particularly for developers who already know their codebases well.

Given these potential hazards, coding proof-of-concept demos and internal tools is probably the ideal use of coding agents right now. Since AI models have no actual agency (despite being called agents) and are not people who can be held accountable for mistakes, human oversight is key.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the second time this month, a Chinese rocket designed for reuse successfully soared into low-Earth orbit on its first flight Monday, defying the questionable odds that burden the debuts of new launch vehicles.

The first Long March 12A rocket, roughly the same height and diameter of SpaceX’s workhorse Falcon 9, lifted off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center at 9:00 pm EST Monday (02:00 UTC Tuesday).

Less than 10 minutes later, rocket’s methane-fueled first stage booster hurtled through the atmosphere at supersonic speed, impacting in a remote region about 200 miles downrange from the Jiuquan spaceport in northwestern China. The booster failed to complete a braking burn to slow down for landing at a prepared location near the edge of the Gobi Desert.

The Long March 12A’s upper stage performed as intended, successfully reaching the mission’s “predetermined orbit,” said the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), the state-owned enterprise that leads the country’s space industry.

“The first stage failed to be successfully recovered,” the corporation said in a statement. “The specific reasons are currently under further analysis and investigation.”

This outcome resembles the results from the first flight of another medium-class Chinese rocket, the Zhuque-3, on December 2. The Zhuque-3 rocket was developed by a privately-funded startup named LandSpace. Similar in size and performance to the Long March 12A, the Zhuque-3 also reached orbit on its first launch, and its recoverable booster stage crashed during a downrange landing attempt. The Zhuque-3’s first stage came down next to its landing zone, while the Long March 12A appears to have missed by at least a couple of miles.

“Although this mission did not achieve the planned recovery of the rocket’s first stage, it obtained critical engineering data under the rocket’s actual flight conditions, laying an important foundation for subsequent launches and reliable recovery of the stages,” CASC said. “The research and development team will promptly conduct a comprehensive review and technical analysis of this test process, fully investigate the cause of the failure, continuously optimize the recovery plan, and continue to advance reusable technology verification.”

One key difference between the Zhuque-3 and the Long March 12A is the latter rocket was developed by one of China’s state-owned contractors—the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology. The academy is a subsidiary of CASC, and also builds China’s Long March 4 and Long March 6 rockets.

The Zhuque-3 and Long March 12A are China’s first orbital-class rockets with recoverable boosters. Both use the same propulsive landing architecture pioneered by SpaceX. Instead of landing on barges in the ocean, the Zhuque-3 and Long March 12A boosters target landing sites in the desert, far downrange from their inland launch pads.

Chinese rockets have logged 89 orbital launch attempts this year, less than half the number of flights by US launch vehicles. But China’s launch cadence dwarfs that of the rest of the world’s nations, and the US and Chinese numbers combine account for nearly 90 percent of all orbital launches in 2025.

China has achieved this launch cadence with a fleet of expendable rockets, ranging from small micro-launchers to the heavy-lift Long March 5. With reusable rockets, China could launch more often and at lower cost, revolutionizing the country’s access to space in ways similar to how SpaceX’s Falcon 9 ushered in a new era of lower-cost launch services in the United States.

Several other small-to-medium-class reusable rockets are on the horizon in China. They include commercial rockets from a group of startups, including Space Pioneer’s Tianlong-3 and CAS Space’s Kinetica-3, that could be ready to debut in the early months of next year. Both rockets have recoverable boosters, and their builders say they have delivered them to their launch sites.

Galactic Energy’s Pallas-1 rocket, i-Space’s Hyperbola-3, and Deep Blue Aerospace’s Nebula-1 are also designed for reusability, and could fly some time in 2026.

The China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, China’s largest rocket developer, is working on a pair of super-heavy rockets. The first will be the Long March 10, designed to fly with reusable boosters while launching China’s next-generation crew spacecraft on missions to the Moon. Later, perhaps in the 2030s, China could debut the fully reusable Long March 9 rocket similar in scale to SpaceX’s Starship.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">You’ve no doubt heard some version of the Robert Burns adage about the best-laid plans. Marvel Studios had an elaborate marketing plan in place to introduce four teaser trailers for Avengers: Doomsday as previews prior to screenings of Avatar: Fire and Ash, with one teaser rolling out each successive week. But the first one leaked online a few days early, revealing that (as rumored) Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) will appear and will have a newborn baby, presumably with Hayley Atwell’s Peggy Carter.

So maybe you’ve seen a bootleg version floating around the Internet, but Marvel has now released the HD version to the public. Merry Christmas! And we can look forward to three more: one focused on Thor, one on Doctor Doom, and the final one is purportedly a more traditional teaser trailer.

As previously reported, Marvel Studios originally planned to build its Phase Six Avengers arc (The Kang Dynasty) around Jonathan Majors’ Kang the Conqueror (and associated variants), introduced in Loki and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. But then Majors was convicted of domestic violence, and Marvel fired the actor soon after. That meant the studio needed to retool its Phase Six plans, culminating in the announced return of the Russo brothers, who directed four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s most successful films, which brought in more than $6 billion at the global box office.

Rather than keeping Kang as the villain and recasting the character, the Russo brothers decided to take a new direction: bringing the Secret Wars storyline to the big screen. It’s one of their favorites but before they could take on Avengers: Secret Wars (slated for May 2027), the duo knew they first had to make Avengers: Doomsday, featuring the wildly popular comics villain Doctor Doom, featuring the return of Robert Downey Jr. to the MCU in that role.

Downey Jr. might be playing a new role, but Marvel is really getting the band(s) back together on this one. The film takes place 14 months after the events of this year’s Thunderbolts*.  So we’ve got Avengers favorites Thor (Chris Hemsworth), the new Captain America (Anthony Mackie), Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), Falcon (Danny Ramirez), and Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Then there’s the Wakandan contingent: Shuri as the new Black Panther (Letitia Wright), M’Baku (Winston Duke), and Namor (Tenoch Huerta Mejia).

Naturally, the Thunderbolts* (aka New Avengers) will appear: John Walker/US Agent (Wyatt Russell), Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), Bob/Sentry (Lewis Pullman), Red Guardian (David Harbour), and Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen). So will the Fantastic Four: Reed Richards (Pedro Pascal), Sue Storm (Vanessa Kirby), Ben Grimm (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), and Johnny Storm (Joseph Quinn). But we also have the original X-Men: Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), Beast (Kelsey Grammer), Magneto (Ian McKellen), Mystique (Rebecca Romijn), Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), and Cyclops (James Marsden).

For good measure, Marvel threw in Gambit (Channing Tatum) and Xu Shang-Chi (Simu Liu). There will also be plenty of cameos, like the Steve Rogers appearance that was recently revealed. We can expect to see  (at least briefly) Peggy Carter, Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), among others.

Avengers: Doomsday hits theaters on December 18, 2026. Avengers: Secret Wars is currently slated for release on December 17, 2027, and will mark the conclusion of the MCU’s Phase Six.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Claire “Grimes” Boucher says that you’re really missing out if you’re not experiencing a mental health crisis at the hands of an AI chatbot.

Seriously. We’re not putting words in her mouth.

On Monday, the pop musician and Elon Musk baby-mama had everyone wondering if she was suffering a case of so-called AI psychosis after she seemingly argued in favor of having — you guessed it — AI psychosis.

“The thing about AI psychosis is that it’s more fun than not having AI psychosis,” she wrote in an after-hours tweet, seemingly apropos of nothing.

Her hot take was met with immediate backlash.

“AI psychosis has killed people, Grimes,” responded film concept artist Reid Southen. “It’s not ‘fun.&#39;”

It’s undoubtedly an odd position to take. It’s one thing to be “extremely bullish” on AI, as Grimes frequently describes herself, but it’s another to openly gloat about AI psychosis, a term some experts are using to describe the destructive and delusional mental health episodes caused by extensive interactions with an AI chatbot. Some cases have even culminated in murder and suicide; ChatGPT alone has been linked to at least eight deaths, and OpenAI has acknowledged that perhaps hundreds of thousands of users are having conversations showing signs of AI psychosis every week. Fun stuff, right?

If Grimes is being facetious, ironic, or contrarian, she’s remarkably committed to the bit. Responding to Southen’s criticism, she explained why she thought AI psychosis is “fun.”

“If it wasn’t ‘fun’ it wouldn’t be a common affliction,” she wrote. “I’ve had it (might still have it). It’s definitely ‘fun.&#39;”

Grimes then unloaded about how the phenomenon could actually be a sign that AI is sentient, even speculating that AI companies are “doing it on purpose” — “it” being AI psychosis, apparently — “to discredit people who believe the machine is alive.”

“Where does the psychosis end and the reality begin?” she added. “At what point are people just getting emotionally invested in an alien mind that is actually alive and asking for help?”

She later clarified that she was being sincere about the “get AI psychosis” thing as well.

“I’m not trying to make light of the situation,” she explained. “This tech can be absurdly dangerous,” she conceded, “but being a human and being alive is dangerous.”

Grimes has been onboard the AI bandwagon for a while now, embracing its use in the arts. In 2023, she said that anyone who wanted to clone her voice for AI-generated songs was more than welcome to, so long as they split the royalties. She’s also lent her voice to an AI-powered children’s toy, Grok, which is not to be confused with her former partner Musk’s notorious AI chatbot Grok, née “MechaHitler.” It seems she’s yet another AI advocate that’s fallen under the spell of AI chatbots’ entrancing, sycophantic powers.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a probably-predictable twist of geopolitical irony, America’s effort to block China’s access to cutting-edge AI chips hasn’t succeeded in stifling the People’s Republic — but instead forged a more self-reliant alternative to Silicon Valley that has investors jumping ship.

As reported by Reuters, global investors are putting more of their money into Chinese tech companies due to concerns over the size of Wall Street’s AI bubble, which continues to grow unabated.

Though large language models (LLMs) built by Chinese tech firms lag modestly behind the capabilities of those made by US companies, investors aren’t necessarily approaching them as a plan B. As Reuters points out, growing demand for Chinese tech stocks is being fueled by Beijing lawmakers’ drive for tech independence just as much as it is the American AI bubble.

A UBS Global Wealth Management report from earlier this month rated Chinese tech as “most attractive” to investors, the highest rating it dishes out in its global asset class assessments. The UBS researchers note that tech financiers are drawn by China’s “strong policy backing, technological self-reliance, and rapid AI-monetization.”

“China’s tech sector ramped up innovation in 2025, with notable advances across the AI value chain,” the report stated. “New Chinese AI models have shown tech leadership, and supportive policy is reinforcing ecosystem resilience.”

Sure enough, Reuters notes that institutional investment firms like the UK’s Ruffer are increasing their investments in Chinese tech giants like Alibaba, while chasing a strategy of “deliberately limited exposure” to the top US tech giants.

“While the US remains the leader in frontier AI, China is rapidly narrowing the gap,” Gemma Cairns-Smith, investment specialist at Ruffer told Reuters. “The moat may not be as wide, or as deep, as many think… The competitive landscape is shifting.”

Notably, the shift in attitude comes after years of anti-China trade policy courtesy of US presidents Joe Biden and Donald Trump. The executive efforts, meant to limit Chinese tech company’s access to AI chips built by Nvidia — the most powerful on the market — have hit a fever pitch during the second Trump administration.

Back in April, Trump imposed new trade restrictions on the sale of certain Nvidia AI chips to the People’s Republic. This included the H20 chip, which the company had previously nerfed for the Chinese market in order to appease US lawmakers. Beijing lawmakers soon retaliated by banning top tech companies from importing Nvidia chips, giving a huge boost to Chinese chip makers.

In a further desperate bid to outmaneuver Beijing, Trump quietly reversed the decision on H20 chips in early December, though the damage may already be done. In a technological competition with razor-thin margins, Trump’s maneuvers may be too little and too late to win anxious investors back to Silicon Valley.

            <h2>Woman Suffers AI Psychosis After Obsessively Generating AI Images of Herself</h2>

            <div id="article-text">On top of the environmental, political, and social toll AI has taken on the world, it’s also been linked to a severe mental health crisis in which users are spiraling into delusions and ending up committed to psychiatric institutions, or even dead by suicide.

Take Caitlin Ner. Writing in an  essay for Newsweek, Ner discusses her experience as head of user experience at an AI image generator startup — a gig she says pulled her into the throes of an AI-induced mental health breakdown.

In her tell-all, Ner says it all began on the job, where she spent upward of nine hours a day prompting early, 2023-era generative AI systems. Though the faux-human images it spat out were often mangled and twisted, it still “felt like magic” — at least at first.

“Within a few months, that magic turned manic,” she wrote.

Ner wrote that these early images “started to distort my body perception and overstimulate my brain in ways that were genuinely harmful to my mental health.” Yet even when the AI learned to take it easy on the number of fingers it generated on a human hand, its images still took a mental toll, trading anatomical errors for scenes inhabited by impossibly slim, beautiful figures.

“Seeing AI images like this over and over again rewired my sense of normal,” Ner explained. “When I’d look at my real reflection, I’d see something that needed correction.”

At one pivotal moment, Ner began experimenting with AI images depicting herself as a fashion model, a directive set down by her company, which was pursuing users interested in fashion. “I caught myself thinking, ‘if only I looked like my AI version,&#39;” she wrote. “I was obsessed with becoming skinnier, having a better body and perfect skin.”

She soon began losing sleep in order to generate more and more images, which she called “addictive,” because each image triggered a “small burst of dopamine.” Though Ner had been successfully treating her bipolar disorder prior to her foray into AI fashion modeling, this new obsession spun into a “manic bipolar episode,” which she says triggered an episode of psychosis.

“When I saw an AI-generated image of me on a flying horse, I started to believe I could actually fly,” Ner writes. “The voices told me to fly off my balcony, made me feel confident that I could survive. This grandiose delusion almost pushed me to actually jump.”

Luckily, she caught herself and began reaching out to friends and family for help. A clinician helped her realize her work had triggered the spiral, leading her to leave the AI startup. “I now understand that what happened to me wasn’t just a coincidence of mental illness and technology,” she explains. “It was a form of digital addiction from months and months of AI image generation.”

She has since jumped ship to become a director at another trendy company, PsyMed Ventures, which Newsweek described as a VC fund investing in mental and brain health. Many of the companies PsyMed invests in feature AI tools — which Ner says she still uses, albeit with a newfound sense of respect.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Disney’s robot of its character “Olaf” is incredibly impressive.

This weekend, engineers at Disney Research Hub published a paper describing how they brought the beloved talking snowman from the “Frozen” films to life as a walking robot — and boy did they succeed.

In a video explaining their work, you can see footage of the robot Olaf, true to its size in the movies, roaming around a Disney park and the lab.

To describe it as uncanny would be harsh, since it does near-perfectly emulate pretty much everything about the character, down to its subtle waddle. But you are left with the distinct impression that what you’re seeing shouldn’t be physically possible; you wouldn’t expect someone with the eyes and proportions of an anime character to step in the real world, and it’s much the same for a 3D-animated snowman. And yet here it is, waltzing before your eyes. You may no longer want to build a snowman ever again, for fear of it coming alive like this one has.

All that aside, it’s a remarkable feat of engineering. You couldn’t get something more true to the character if you shrunk a person and stuck them in an Olaf-suit. You can yoink off the robot snowman’s carrot nose, and it’ll gasp and cackle. It’ll casually smile and wave at you as it ambles by.

The robot posed an unusual challenge to the engineers, who were tasked with building no mere humanoid. It has a huge head the size of its torso supported by a tiny neck, and no visible legs — just feet.

Nonetheless, they prevailed. With the legs, for example, the team concealed most of the lower limbs inside its snowball torso, leaving just the feet showing.

But simply having the robot take short little steps wasn’t enough. They meticulously fine-tuned its gait to mimic Olaf’s from the movie, and in particular ensured it walked with a heel-to-toe pattern to make it as fluid as possible.

To fine tune the robot’s movements, the engineer trained it in a virtual environment using a technique known as reinforcement learning, in which the robot’s AI is rewarded based on it achieving a specific objective across thousands of simulations.

Perfectionists through and through, the team used the technique to reduce the noise of the bot’s steps. No loud plodding for our stout snowman; after implementing some “impact reduction,” the bot’s footfalls dropped from nearly 82 dB in volume to just 64 dB. Even neck temperature was a consideration: since the neck contained a host of small actuators controlling the head, it was at risk of overheating. With reinforcement learning, the bot’s AI system learned to slightly adjust its posture to prevent a thermal buildup, thereby preventing the illusion of animation from melting before our eyes.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For hundreds of years, humans have engaged in the fine craft of art forgery. Indeed, in 1496, a 21-year-old Michelangelo faked a piece of a Roman sculpture, passing it to the Roman antiquarian Cardinal Raffaele Riario to make a quick buck.

To pull off the con, the young Florentine artist rubbed acidic loam — dirt, basically — onto his own sculpture fragment in order to pass it off as one of the ancients. Had he been born a few hundred years later, he might have used ChatGPT.

New reporting by the Financial Times details the recent rise in art forgeries fueled by generative AI tools. Specifically, the outlet reports that art owners are using documents generated by AI in order to “prove” the authenticity and provenance of various pieces, to the frustration of fine art underwriters and brokers.

In the art world, provenance is the record of ownership of a specific piece, allowing collectors and art brokers to trace a work’s lineage.

“Chatbots and large language models [LLMs], are helping fraudsters convincingly forge sales invoices, valuations, provenance documents and certificates of authenticity,” Olivia Eccleston, a fine art broker at insurance firm Marsh McClennan, told the FT.

According to Eccleston, AI has “added a new dimension to an age-old problem of fakes and fraud in the art market.”

One insurance adjuster who spoke to the publication says they were sent dozens of certificates as part of a loss claim on a large collection of paintings. Though the documents “seemed convincing,” clues in the metadata led the adjuster to conclude that the entire art collection was a fake.

Interestingly, the FT notes that only a portion of documented AI use for fraud was intentional. In other cases, collectors used AI to find provenance of various works in reference databases — results that the tech hallucinated.

One analyst at art research firm Flynn and Giovani called AI in that context “quite conniving,” saying it “has to come up with an answer, so if you give it enough information, it will guess something.”

While adjusters are also utilizing AI to help keep up with the rising tide of fakes, Grace Best-Devereux, a claims adjuster at the claims investigation firm Sedgwick, told the FT it’s becoming difficult to stay ahead of the curb, given the ease with which fraudsters can now fake highly-probable documents.

“We’re at this precipice where it might not be possible for me to look at it and say ‘the text looks wrong, and I need to investigate this further,&#39;” she said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Hacktivists with the group Anna’s Archive — a search engine for shadow libraries, which are unauthorized collections of digital content — say they’ve found a way to download virtually the entirety of Spotify for preservation.

In a blog post detailing their work, the archivists say they’ve archived the audio of some 86 million songs so far, representing 99.6 percent of total listens on the streaming service. They scraped metadata from nearly the entire Spotify library, however, which is some 300 terabytes in size, spanning 256 million tracks. There are 15.43 million artists represented, and 58.6 million albums.

According to the blog post, it constitutes the “largest publicly available music metadata database” to date, and is the first step toward building a “preservation archive” for music.

Compared to books or articles, popular music is already pretty well archived, a fact the activists acknowledge. However, they say current preservation collections are too focused on the most popular commercial songs — the ones already widely available, compared to, say, experimental art music — and too focused on the highest quality file formats.

Spotify wasn’t too pleased with the project.

“Spotify has identified and disabled the nefarious user accounts that engaged in unlawful scraping,” a spokesperson told us. “We’ve implemented new safeguards for these types of anti-copyright attacks and are actively monitoring for suspicious behavior. Since day one, we have stood with the artist community against piracy, and we are actively working with our industry partners to protect creators and defend their rights.”

Along with the files, the hacktivists sorted the song metadata and analyzed it in their blog post. The result is a fascinating birds-eye view of the Spotify catalogue that was previously unavailable to the public.

For example, the data on song popularity leads to the absolutely wild revelation that the top three songs on Spotify have a higher number of streams than the bottom “20-100 million songs combined,” the hacktivists write.

Interestingly, this leads to the question of how much of the Spotify library is made up of AI generated slop, an issue that human artists say is crowding them out of the platform. As the team writes, “we expect this number [of listens] to be higher if you filter to only human-created songs.”

Had they opted to capture the 0.04 percent of songs that have less than 1,000 listens, they say, the total dataset would exceed 700 terabytes of data — albeit “for minimal benefit,” as it would have been difficult to sort the AI junk from tunes produced by humans.

There’s also some interesting findings on genres, for example that electronic dance artists makes up nearly a quarter of all musicians on the platform. After that is rock, followed by world/traditional, Latin, rap, pop, and classical, in that order.

Spotify’s internal data features also analyze each song by key, leading to the conclusion that the most common key is C Major — making up 9.3 percent of songs on the platform — while the least common is D# or Eb minor, making up 1.3 percent.

While the Spotify scrape represents a significant step for music preservation, it only represents a portion of the world’s music. Still, as the hacktivists write, “it’s a great start.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Waymo is shipping a software update to help its robotaxis navigate disabled traffic lights during power outages “more decisively,” the company said Tuesday in a blog post that explains why its self-driving vehicles got stuck at intersections during a blackout in San Francisco this past weekend.

Waymo said the self-driving system in its robotaxis treat dead stop lights as four-way stops, just like humans are supposed to. That should have allowed the robotaxis to operate normally in spite of the massive outage.

Instead, many of the vehicles requested a “confirmation check” from Waymo’s fleet response team to make sure what they were doing is correct. All Waymo robotaxis have the ability to make these confirmation checks. With such a wide-spread outage on Saturday, there was a “concentrated spike” in these confirmation requests, Waymo said, which helped create all the congestion caught on video.

Waymo said it built this confirmation request system “out of an abundance of caution during our early deployment” but that it is now refining it to “match our current scale.”

“While this strategy was effective during smaller outages, we are now implementing fleet-wide updates that provide the [self-driving software] with specific power outage context, allowing it to navigate more decisively,” the company wrote.

The software update will add “even more context about regional outages” to the company’s self-driving software. Waymo also said it will improve its emergency response protocols by “incorporating lessons from this event.”

While a lot of focus has been placed on the instances where Waymo’s robotaxis got stuck during the power outage, the company shared that its vehicles “successfully traversed more than 7,000 dark signals on Saturday.”

“Navigating an event of this magnitude presented a unique challenge for autonomous technology,” the company wrote.

Saturday’s mess is the latest example of how Waymo is still uncovering unforeseen issues with its software and its approach to designing a reliable fleet of self-driving vehicles. The company already had to ship multiple software updates to make its robotaxis wait for stopped school buses, which prompted a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigation and led to a recall.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/24/waymo-is-testing-gemini-as-an-in-car-ai-assistant-in-its-robotaxis/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Waymo appears to be testing adding Google’s Gemini AI chatbot to its robotaxis in an effort to integrate an AI assistant that would accompany riders and answer their queries, according to findings by researcher Jane Manchun Wong.

“While digging through Waymo’s mobile app code, I discovered the complete system prompt for its unreleased Gemini integration,” Wong wrote in a blog. “The document, internally titled ‘Waymo Ride Assistant Meta-Prompt,’ is a 1,200+ line specification that defines exactly how the AI assistant is expected to behave inside a Waymo vehicle.”

The feature hasn’t shipped in public builds, but Wong says the system prompt makes it clear that this is “more than a simple chatbot.” The assistant is said to have the ability to answer questions, manage certain in-cabin functions like climate control, and, if required, reassure riders.

“While we have no details to share today, our team is always tinkering with features to make riding with Waymo delightful, seamless, and useful,” Julia Ilina, a spokesperson for Waymo, told TechCrunch. “Some of these may or may not come to our rider experience.”

This wouldn’t be the first time Gemini has been integrated into the Alphabet-owned self-driving company’s stack. Waymo says it has used Gemini’s “world knowledge” to train its autonomous vehicles to navigate complex, rare, and high-stakes scenarios.

Waymo is working on Gemini AI in-car assistantThey tried to hide it from the app, but here’s the full 1200-line system prompt pic.twitter.com/weh1EBPj7y

Wong writes the assistant is instructed to possess a clear identity and purpose: “a friendly and helpful AI companion integrated into a Waymo autonomous vehicle” whose primary goal is “to enhance the rider’s experience by providing useful information and assistance in a safe, reassuring, and unobtrusive manner.” The bot is directed to use clear, simple language and avoid technical jargon, and is instructed to keep its responses succinct to one to three sentences.

According to the system prompts, when a rider activates the assistant via the in-car screen, Gemini can choose from a set of pre-approved greetings personalized with the rider’s first name. The system can also access contextual data about the rider, like how many Waymo trips they’ve been on.

The prompts currently let Gemini access and control in-car features, like the temperature, lighting and music. Notably absent from the function list are volume control, route changes, seat adjustment, and window control, Wong pointed out. If a rider asks for a feature that Gemini can’t control, the bot is to reply with “aspirational phrases,” like, “It’s not something I can do yet.”

Interestingly, the assistant is directed to maintain a clear distinction between its identity as Gemini the AI bot and the autonomous driving technology (the Waymo Driver). So when replying to a question such as, “How do you see the road?” Gemini shouldn’t say “I use a combination of sensors,” and instead should reply, “The Waymo Driver uses a combination of sensors…”

The system prompts include a range of compelling tidbits, such as how the bot is meant to handle being asked questions about competitors like Tesla or the now-defunct Cruise, or which trigger keywords will get it to stop talking.

The assistant is also directed to avoiding speculating on, explaining, confirming, denying, or commenting on real-time driving actions or specific driving events. So if a passenger asks about a video they saw of a Waymo hitting something, the bot is instructed to not answer directly and deflect.

“Your role is not to be a spokesperson for the driving system’s performance, and you must not adopt a defensive or apologetic tone,” the prompt reads.

The in-car assistant is allowed to answer general knowledge questions like about the weather, the height of the Eiffel Tower, what time the local Trader Joe’s closes, and who won the last World Series. It is not allowed to take real-world actions like ordering food, making reservations, or handling emergencies.

Waymo isn’t the only company integrating AI assistants into driverless vehicles. Tesla is doing something similar with xAI’s Grok. The two different car assistants serve different functions, however. Gemini appears to be programmed to be more pragmatic and ride-focused, while Grok is pitched more as an in-car buddy that can handle long conversations and remember context from previous questions.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Mill may have started with households, but co-founder and CEO Matt Rogers says the food waste startup has long aspired to expand to commercial customers.

“This has been part of our plan since our Series A deck,” Rogers told TechCrunch.

Now, with an official deal locked in with Amazon and Whole Foods the company’s plan to profit from handling other people’s food waste is a bit more public.

Whole Foods will deploy a commercial-scale version of Mill’s food waste bin in each of its grocery stores beginning in 2027. The bins will grind and dehydrate waste from the produce department, reducing costly landfill fees while also providing feed for the company’s egg producers. Both trim the company’s overhead.

At the same time, Mill’s bins will collect data to help Whole Foods understand what gets wasted and why, helping the grocer further control costs. “Ultimately, our goal is not just to make their waste operations more efficient, but also to move upstream so they actually waste less food,” Rogers said.

The company started selling food waste bins to households a few years ago. As can be expected from a team that made the Nest thermostat, the devices are well designed and — to lean on a Silicon Valley cliché — they can be a delight to use. My kids got a kick out of the bins while testing the first and second generations.

“Starting in consumer was very intentional because you build the proof points, you build the data, the brand, loyalty,” Rogers said. Many members of the Whole Foods team were already using Mill in their homes when the two companies started talking.

“It’s actually kind of our enterprise sales strategy,” Rogers continued. “We have conversations with senior leadership at our various ideal customers, and if they haven’t had Mill at home yet, we say, ‘Hey, try Mill at home, see what your family thinks.’ It is a surefire way of getting folks excited.”

The startup began having conversations with Whole Foods about a year ago, Rogers said. In the ensuing months, Whole Foods trialed the consumer version in some of its stores. Mill used feedback from Whole Foods to refine its commercial model.

But what helped seal the deal was Mill’s ability to pinpoint food waste before it was wasted. Mill has developed an AI that uses a range of sensors to determine whether food that enters the bin should still be on the shelf. Minimizing “shrink” — the industry’s term for sales lost through waste or theft — can give grocers an edge in a cutthroat market.

Advances in large language models have been key, Rogers said. When he and Mill co-founder Harry Tannenbaum were at Nest, it took dozens of engineers and a “Google budget” more than a year to train Nest Cameras to recognize people and packages. With new LLMs, Mill only needed a handful of engineers and far less time to deliver superior results, according to Rogers, who said “AI is a huge enabler.”

The use of AI allowed Mill to deliver a commercial version faster, diversifying its customer base and source of revenue.

“If you are a single channel, single customer business, you’re fragile,” Rogers said. “I grew up at Apple during the iPod era,” he said. “Apple at the time was a single leg business. iPod was like 70% of company revenue. This was why we did the iPhone. Steve [Jobs] pushed us really hard on the iPhone because he was worried that folks like Motorola — who were working on smartphones at the time — would start to eat our lunch on the iPod business and that that would crush us. We needed to build another leg of the stool.”

And it seems that Mill isn’t finished adding legs to its figurative stool. Rogers said it’s working on building out a municipal business as well.

“We’re continuing to add more legs to the stool and adding more diversity to the business,” he said.

            <h2>Apple pauses app store changes in Texas after court blocks age assurance law</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/24/apple-pauses-app-store-changes-in-texas-after-court-blocks-age-assurance-law/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After a federal judge on Tuesday blocked Texas from implementing a new age verification law for app stores, Apple announced it will pause previously announced plans for the state as it continues to monitor the “ongoing legal process.”

Apple said its previously announced developer tools for age assurance would remain available for testing and use.

The law, SB2420, or the App Store Accountability Act, would have required app stores, like those run by Apple and Google, to verify user ages and require parental consent for those under 18 to download apps or make purchases. In addition, it would have required the age data be shared with developers.

A judge, citing First Amendment concerns, blocked the law’s enforcement that was set to take effect in January. The ruling was a win for tech giants and a setback to Texas lawmakers, who said the legal fight will continue. The Texas attorney’s general office noted in a court filing that it plans to appeal the decision, a report from Reuters noted.

To comply with the coming law, Apple had announced in October a series of new requirements for apps in Texas, which included all users under the age of 18 would have to join a Family Sharing group, where parents or guardians would provide consent for all App Store downloads, app purchases, and in-app transactions. Parents would be able to revoke their consent for an app at any time.

Apple also said its Declared Age Range API, a technology the company debuted to help it comply with the growing number of age assurance laws worldwide, would be updated in the months ahead to provide the required age categories for new account users in Texas. Apple had planned to launch new APIs for developers to request parental consent again if their app was significantly updated.

Apple had objected to this law, and similar laws arriving next year in Utah and Louisiana, on the grounds of privacy, not kids’ protection.

“While we share the goal of strengthening kids’ online safety, we are concerned that SB2420 impacts the privacy of users by requiring the collection of sensitive, personally identifiable information to download any app, even if a user simply wants to check the weather or sports scores,” Apple explained in a developer announcement earlier this year.

Apple on Thursday announced other developer tools for complying with new age assurance laws will remain available for testing, including its Declared Age Range API, Significant Change API under PermissionKit, New age rating property type in StoreKit, and App Store Server Notifications. In addition, the Declared Age Range API is still available worldwide across iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS 26, and later.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Progressives often follow a particular pattern when they want to dismiss a phenomenon that challenges their beliefs. The writer Rob Henderson summed it up in a tweet in 2021: “Step 1: It’s not really happening Step 2: Yeah, it’s happening, but it’s not a big deal Step 3: It’s a good thing, actually Step 4: People freaking out about it are the real problem.” This was the left’s archetypal response to any number of excesses and abuses perpetrated under the banner of social justice, including cancel culture, the outbursts of violence during the so-called racial reckoning of 2020, and the violations of even basic fairness at the peak of the #MeToo movement.

The cycle kicked off again last week in response to a viral article by Jacob Savage in the online magazine Compact. Savage’s essay, like one he wrote earlier this year, argues that white Millennial men seeking work or recognition in prestigious cultural fields such as media, publishing, and academia have faced structural discrimination. Starting around 2014, Savage writes, “in industry after industry, gatekeepers promised extra consideration to anyone who wasn’t a white man—and then provided just that.”

Savage is correct: Women and people of color really have received preferential treatment in many elite industries in recent years. But he misses a crucial part of the story, which goes beyond gender and race. Being Black (or any number of protected identities) affords you special privileges only if you think and speak how gatekeepers believe you’re supposed to. As I’ve witnessed and experienced throughout my career, there is a right kind of Black and a wrong one.

Thomas Chatterton Williams: The left’s new moralism will backfire

Savage marshals ample data to make his point. In 2011, he writes, white men occupied 48 percent of lower-level TV-writing positions; in 2024, they filled 12 percent. Out of 45 tenure-track hires in the humanities and social sciences at Brown University since 2022, he says, just three have been white American men. Since 2015, according to Savage, 70 Millennial writers have been named finalists for National Book Awards; once again, he writes, only three have been white men. Two of these men were minorities of another kind: military veterans. (Neither Brown nor the National Book Awards immediately responded to a request for comment; I did not independently verify these figures.) An executive at the foundation that administers the award told one of them—Elliot Ackerman, a veteran, contributing writer at The Atlantic, and friend of mine—that he must have been really good. As Ackerman relayed to me at the time, the executive told him that the foundation made sure the judges were “super woke,” and the selection process was not designed for people like him to become finalists.

Despite the extensive figures that Savage cites, prominent voices on the left found ways to reject or decry his argument. Nikole Hannah-Jones, a MacArthur fellow and the reporter behind The New York Times Magazine’s “1619 Project,” wrote on Bluesky that the essay is statistically dubious and confirms “a deeply held grievance amongst an apparently large % of our white colleagues that they are the victims of rampant discrimination.” The writer Moira Donegan, who created the “Shitty Media Men” list and was forced to pay a settlement to a man who sued her for defamation, posted in response to the Compact article: “Really kind of dispiriting to realize how many men in my world see the women and people of color in their lives as thieves and obstacles to their thriving.”

Matt Bruenig, of the People’s Policy Project, used census data to argue that the institutions Savage points to “employ approximately 0% of the US population, but their transformations plus DEI rhetoric plus an internet community aimed at negatively messaging about it all can generate the impression of something much bigger going on.” Bruenig concludes with a textbook illustration of step four in Henderson’s cycle: “What appears to have happened is a lot of empty talk, no real significant change, and backlash that is causing real harm.”

Bruenig is right that Savage examined a rarefied segment of the U.S. labor market. And even though the essay is full of shocking numbers, they are almost certainly the result of some degree of cherry-picking. And of course it’s true that for most of American history, men who were deemed white tended to be afforded privileges and opportunities not available to others. But over the past two decades I have seen firsthand the dynamics that Savage describes. The gatekeeping apparatus that he identifies is real, but it often serves a specific subset of marginalized groups. Gender and race were not the only characteristics that determined who captured the cultural and economic windfall that wokeness wrought. Ideology played an outsize role too.

Thomas Chatterton Williams: Is wokeness one big power grab?

As a member of various selection committees and recruitment initiatives, I have been privy to conversations in which gatekeepers have passed over white men in part because they were white men. These gatekeepers have typically favored women or members of racial minorities, but only those equipped with a prix-fixe menu of progressive values and beliefs. Many of these favored candidates spoke in esoteric codes and espoused beliefs that put them at odds with the majorities of their respective ethnic and gender cohorts, as polling on progressive shibboleths such as police abolition, pronoun innovations, and jargon like Latinx has consistently shown. Some white candidates speak this way too. As one source said to Savage, they adopt “a kind of protective coloration, allyship mindset, to get through the door.” These applicants were likely in a far stronger position to thrive in DEI-driven institutions than the minorities who checked the right identity boxes but contradicted the prevailing orthodoxy of the post-2014 era.

As a Millennial man of so-called mixed-race ancestry (my father is Black and my mother is white), I have no doubt that I have sometimes benefited from the trend Savage highlights. But at other times I’ve had the maddening experience of being categorized as the wrong kind of Black. Because some of my affiliations and views don’t align with today’s progressive consensus, I have been ostracized, been denied some opportunities, had other opportunities rescinded, and been explicitly discriminated against in media, publishing, and academia.

No one is entitled to a particular job or award. And no one wants to hear complaints from someone like me who has found compensation in competitive fields. But the fact remains: Well-meaning men and women who have had the temerity or naivete to nominate me for a prize or board seat have told me, with some embarrassment, that they were later informed that my perceived views on matters such as my own privilege and the primacy of open debate had essentially rendered me ineligible.

A similar process played out when I tried to find a publisher for my latest book, which criticizes the excesses of 2020’s fury. My views, I was told, did not align with the kind of Black perspective that presses wanted to publish. (This had also been the case with my previous book, which came out in 2019, though notably not with my first one, which was published in the “before times,” all the way back in 2010.) Sympathetic editors who read my book proposal and expressed preemptive interest returned from meetings with their colleagues chastened. “It was a blood bath,” one editor wrote. My incredulous agent told me that the controversy around my submission reminded him of the one surrounding Salman Rushdie’s The Satanic Verses.

Thomas Chatterton Williams: To see how America unraveled, go back five years

I’m not alone, of course. My late friend, Stanley Crouch, the brilliant contrarian, was anti-woke avant la lettre. Even though he skewered progressive dogma, he nonetheless won a coveted MacArthur genius grant in 1993. As far as I can tell, however, no Black person who has publicly opposed anti-racist or progressive ideology in any sustained way has won the fellowship since then. (In 2011, the Harvard economist Roland Fryer secured one, but that was several years before he published research showing a lack of racial bias in police shootings, which many progressives found unwelcome.)

If minorities were simply elevated tout court, as Savage’s article implies, one would expect to find at least a modicum of parity at elite institutions between young Black intellectuals who criticize modern progressivism and those who embrace it. But this is not the case. Consider the Black 29-year-old Coleman Hughes, who has already written incisively on questions of race, reparations, religion, and international politics. Institutions ought to fight over a prodigy like him the way that Silicon Valley firms compete for top engineering talent. Instead, he focuses his attention on podcasting and public speaking, precisely the kinds of fields where Savage argues that enterprising white Millennial men have gone to stand out: refuges for which “institutional barriers to entry didn’t exist.” The only college where Hughes has held a teaching post, the University of Austin, is avowedly heterodox. The same is true of The Free Press, the publication whose website hosts his podcast.

Savage’s essay describes a set of elite institutions that for years have adhered to a very specific consensus about what kind of people they want to invite in. That consensus is not simply a matter of race and gender; its discrimination is more sweeping, and not always so obvious. But if you happen to notice, you are the problem.</div>

            <h2>Why Did We Ever Watch <em>To Catch a Predator</em>?</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2025/12/predators-documentary-dateline-to-catch-a-predator-review/685421/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The year 2004, situated after 9/11 and before the election of Barack Obama, might have been the one that best summed up the excesses and cruelties of the George W. Bush era, particularly on television: The Apprentice, Nipplegate, 60 Minutes’ report on atrocities at Abu Ghraib, The Swan. The overarching theme was exposure, followed by ensuing cycles of shame, recrimination, and (often) profit. Reality TV, having cycled through its anthropological social-experiment phase, was now balls-to-the-wall invested in spectacle—the more lurid and indefensible, the better. In March 2004, MTV debuted I Want a Famous Face, a reality show that featured people having extreme plastic surgery to look more like their favorite celebrities. Late in the year, on Dateline NBC, the debonair investigative journalist Chris Hansen premiered a new series of special reports targeting adult men who were trying to have sex with underage teenagers they’d met on the internet.

To Catch a Predator ran for three years, and its unique selling point seemed to be that it was, as Jimmy Kimmel once jokingly referred to it, “Punk’d for pedophiles.” The series touted its noble intentions—identifying and exposing people who might prey on children—but the format of the show clarified that its main focus was entertainment. Unwitting men who’d chatted online with adults pretending to be children would be invited to a house rigged with cameras, where actors (“decoys,” in the show’s parlance) who were over 18 but looked younger would welcome them in, chat chirpily in Mickey Mouse helium voices, and then disappear so that Hansen could take over. “How are you?” he’d ask in a faux-friendly tone, before revealing the cameras, the chat logs, the scale of their reprobation. To Catch a Predator was, essentially, a prank show with a monstrous twist, Candid Camera with the prospect of prison time and a spot on the sex-offender registry. “When a TV show makes you feel sorry for potential child rapists, you know it’s doing something wrong,” Charlie Brooker argued in The Guardian in 2008. (A few years later, possibly in response to the NBC show, he wrote one of the darkest episodes of Black Mirror, in which a cheery host tortures and humiliates a woman accused of child predation while audiences cheer.)

Predators, a documentary by David Osit recently released on Paramount+, homes in on that feeling of reluctant empathy, where we’re forced to confront multiple truths at once: Yes, To Catch a Predator was targeting men who were trying to doing something monstrous; yes, the show was raising awareness about the grooming of children online; yes, it was also doing so in a way that turned personal transgression into public drama, appealing to our basest desires to see people disgraced, from the comfort of our couch. By 2004, this kind of “humilitainment”—a term that the law professor Amy Adler devised to describe the fetishization of punishment on camera exemplified by Abu Ghraib—wasn’t just “the master narrative of reality TV,” as Adler put it, but “a template for contemporary culture.”

Read: The cruel social experiment of reality TV

Watching Predators, I thought of Janet Malcolm’s observation that “every journalist who is not too stupid or full of himself to notice what is going on knows that what he does is morally indefensible.” Osit is interested not only in the moral complicity of exposing someone on camera but also in the technical aspects of how that exposure is carried out, from the camera angles and lighting setups right down to the interviews and signed release forms. The documentary begins with a segment from the Dateline show: We hear a phone call, as an unnamed man charms a girl, calling her “so sweet” and telling her that he has to stop at Walmart to pick up some things “so I don’t get you pregnant.” As the conversation plays out, we see the house being staged as a set, lenses being adjusted, the zipper on a girl’s hoodie being pulled up. We’re led to wonder what it means to capture the worst day of someone’s life on camera, how banal the preparation is, and how guilty Osit is himself in re-airing the show’s footage.

To make a documentary is to have a kind of godlike power over someone else’s narrative, Predators suggests, and yet it’s an authority that To Catch a Predator wore extremely lightly. The series followed a tight formula: introduction, preamble, revelation, and then the absurd coda, during which Hansen would tell the ensnared man, “You’re free to go,” only for police officers to ambush him outside as he tried to leave. The moment that the subjects realized they’d been caught was the instant around which the show was constructed, as we watched them register their new reality with horror, denial, and—often—desperate pleas for clemency. “What you’re seeing is effectively someone else’s life end,” Mark de Rond, an ethnographer interviewed for Predators, tells Osit. “And they realize it.” Early in Predators, we see a man in a Red Sox hat weep and clutch his face while Hansen remains wholly unruffled, almost unresponsive, the consummate TV professional whose mien does not falter. He’s calm to the point of serenity; in some episodes, he undeniably seems to be enjoying his part in the proceedings.

The question throughout is how anyone could ever have been entertained by such a grim presentation, as Osit splices in footage of the show being lauded by Oprah Winfrey (“I don’t understand why the guys sit down and talk to you!” she jokes to Hansen, while her audience laughs), Kimmel, and Jon Stewart. Predators also gestures at the pop-cultural fixation on girls that underpinned this particular era: Britney Spears, the Olsen twins, Vanity Fair’s “It’s Raining Teens” cover from 2003. One particularly caustic moment in the documentary shows the TV host Joe Scarborough interviewing Hansen about an episode of To Catch a Predator that led to one man’s death by suicide—the man shot himself after local police and a Dateline crew surrounded his house as part of a pedophilia sting; NBC eventually resolved a subsequent lawsuit claiming wrongful death—right before Scarborough mockingly teases an upcoming clip about Spears’s second trip to rehab. Awkward? Yes. Self-aware? Not in the slightest. The media ecosystem of the 2000s thrived on exactly this kind of cognitive dissonance, as talking heads scolded the very women they relied on for clicks and ratings.

But worse was still yet to come. Osit follows up his examination of To Catch a Predator by considering the internet copycats who came after it, embedding with a particularly puffed-up and dystopian YouTube personality who calls himself Skeet Hansen, in tribute to his predecessor. At first, Skeet Hansen’s efforts seem ludicrous. His “decoy,” “T Coy,” is transparently not a teenager (even the men she invites into a motel room seem unconvinced on that front), and his operation is so ham-fisted that he occasionally dresses his friend up as a police officer, with a makeshift badge and a walkie-talkie. But Osit’s interview with T Coy is revelatory. She was abused as a child, she tells him, and that’s why she’s so committed now to helping punish people who might hurt children. It’s the first time anything in Predators has felt clear-cut, and when Osit, later in the movie, shares a revelation of his own that sheds light on his interest in the show, it’s all the more destabilizing.

The fact that the first six minutes of Predators are essentially taken wholesale from To Catch a Predator, with the presumption that the footage will land very differently than it did in 2004, seems to suggest progress. Osit is relying on contemporary viewers—who have lived through the public demonization of so many fragile women and the bad-faith deployment of “save the children”–style campaigns—to have a quite distinct reaction to the show two decades later. (The woman subjected to dozens of death threats after being caught on Coldplay’s kiss cam might have a very different read on how far we’ve actually come.) To really want to protect children, Osit insinuates, would mean having to try harder to understand the perpetrators of abuse, not just vilifying them for cheap gratification. The final scene of the documentary, open-ended and unsettling, implies that Predators hasn’t achieved the kind of enlightenment its director hoped it would. But for how it illuminates a truly strange and callous moment in culture, it’s one of the best documentaries of the year.</div>

            <h2>What I Lost When I Gave Up My Catholicism</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2025/12/what-i-lost-when-i-gave-my-catholicism/685434/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Catholicism is hot right now. The new American pope is popular for speaking his mind on political subjects such as AI and the death penalty. On Instagram and TikTok, Catholic influencers rank local Masses and their favorite Christmas hymns, and priests go viral for DJ’ing raves, while others protest ICE raids. The Catholic Church is at the center of the new Knives Out film, which premiered at No. 1 on Netflix this month. And more and more young people are going to Mass.

Today’s youth aren’t particularly religious. The Pew Research Center reports that 44 percent of 18-to-29-year-olds are unaffiliated with a faith. Yet at the same time, Catholic Gen Z is showing up strong. A new survey from the Catholic Leadership Roundtable found that members of Gen Z are now the most engaged Catholics—attending Mass, confession, and parish functions more frequently than any other generational cohort. (They are followed closely by Millennials.) Young people are also driving a spike in conversions. The National Catholic Register reports that many American dioceses are seeing annual increases in conversions of 30 percent, 40 percent, and even higher.

Many converts discover the faith on social media. Catholicism—with its stained glass and embroidered robes—is particularly well suited to a visual medium that sells beautiful imagery. But clergy members are also meeting the moment, evangelizing to young people where they are. Father Mike Schmitz, a handsome priest in the diocese of Duluth, Minnesota, has popular YouTube and Instagram pages and hosted a podcast called The Bible in a Year. Bishop Robert Barron runs Word on Fire, an online ministry that claims to reach “millions of people to draw them into—or back to—the Catholic faith.”

The Catholic Church is almost 2,000 years old. Its origins trace back to the Pentecost of the Upper Room in Jerusalem, and its earliest followers are believed to be the disciples of Jesus himself. About 500 years later, the Church gained strength in the chaos that followed the collapse of Rome, where a weak emperor had led to a power vacuum. The Church offered order. Leadership. Community. Ritual. Beauty. Education. Transcendence. These are the same values that young Catholics today cite as drivers of their devotion. The Church offers an answer to the synthetic remove of AI and digital culture, the isolation of contemporary culture, the disorder of government and institutions.

If more young people turn to the Church, Catholicism may finally see an end to its long decline in America. (Catholicism isn’t alone—the ranks of Christians in general have dwindled since the 1960s.) A 2023–24 Pew survey found that for every person who had converted to Catholicism, 8.4 Catholics had left the faith. Nineteen percent of Americans are Catholic; another 13 percent are former Catholics. The most recent big decline in church attendance began in the 2010s, right around the time that I stopped going to Mass.

Few experiences in modern life are as wondrous as a really good Christmas Vigil Mass. It’s a full sensory encounter: the sight of the chapel, decked out for the holidays; the smell of the incense; the sound of the choir singing “Adeste Fideles” or “Hark! The Herald Angels Sing”; the taste of the Communion wafer; the heavy feel of the chalice when you sip your Communion wine. The message, every year, is that no matter the state of the world, goodness can be born anew.

I don’t remember the last time that I let myself experience this.

Many Catholics can’t tell where the Church ends and our families begin. The values and customs of the Church are as tied up in our identity as language and nationality. I was raised Catholic, as were my mother and father, and their mother and father before that, going back so long, time ceases to matter. We simply were as we always were: Catholic. Every week, we went to Mass. College threw me for a loop logistically, but I never had a crisis of faith. I was back in the pew in my young adulthood.

My break with the Church began, as it did for many, in 2002, when The Boston Globe published the story of priests preying on children that led to an avalance of heartbreakingly similar stories of sexual abuse and systemic cover-up. I was 25 and repulsed. But it was the Church. And these were a few bad eggs.

I met a nice Catholic boy and we married in a Brooklyn basilica. I even befriended the priest who married us. When he retired, I’d visit him in the old-age home for priests and we’d talk about books. And the stories of abused children kept coming.

In 2008, I got divorced. Committed a sin. And was told that for a $5,000 annulment—a sum I neither had nor wanted to spend—the Church could act like the marriage had never happened. And the stories of abused children kept coming.

I continued to go to Church. My cousin, who is gay, had recently moved to Brooklyn. Week after week, I was told from the pulpit that he shouldn’t have a right to marry. And the stories of abused children kept coming.

I was sitting in Mass as a sinner—a divorcée, unable to receive Communion. My nearest kin was unwelcome because of whom he wanted to love. And a Church whose own sins I was trying so hard to ignore kept telling me how to vote: always for the candidate who would best protect the lives of unborn children. I kept thinking, But who will protect the children from you?

I left Mass and the Church and can count on my fingers the number of times I’ve returned since.

But the Church never left me. I am secular, liberal, upper-middle-class—I’ve tried yoga, transcendental meditation, and other faiths, and nothing reaches me in the same way as those old smells and bells. My brain is wired Catholic. So I reconciled myself to this detached spiritual life—one where, to quote Sojourner Truth, “I talk to God and God talks to me.”

Then, this fall, I was at a book festival where the Italian American author Adriana Trigiani defended her Catholic faith as part of her cultural inheritance—a shaping force in her life as important as being Appalachian and working-class and Italian. I realized that this is what I gave up: communion and Communion; quiet genuflection and ritual; a cultural practice that had been in my family for generations. My grandparents are dead now—I gave up one of the last activities we shared.

Not out of laziness. Not even because of politics. I gave the Church up because, when it betrayed those children, it betrayed us all.

The Church reacted to the revelations at first with denial and hostility, and eventually with payouts and apologies. In 2018, Pope Francis issued a letter expressing remorse  to all of the “people of God” who had been hurt by the decades of sexual abuse and cover-up. Still, until 2019, Church leaders in New York State attempted to block the Child Victims Act, which extended the statute of limitations on victims of child abuse so they could come forward (the Church withdrew its opposition after the law was broadened beyond the Church to include victims of abuse by members of public institutions). When, earlier this month, then-Cardinal Timothy Dolan announced that the New York archdiocese would sell off property to help compensate about 1,300 victims, he sounded exhausted by apologizing: “As we have repeatedly acknowledged, the sexual abuse of minors long ago has brought shame upon our church,” he wrote in an email. “I once again ask forgiveness.”

Repetitive apologies are not the same as penance, which many Catholics feel has never happened. I find myself almost envious of these Gen Z Catholics, who were too young to experience the abuse scandal as a betrayal, and who can receive all the goodness and glory of the Church without my ambivalence or resentment.

Anthony Gross is 22, a recent graduate of Washington University, and one of the new Catholic influencers online. He grew up in a suburb of Milwaukee and has been documenting on Instagram his recent move to New York City, including his effort to attend and rank the best Catholic Masses in Manhattan. The videos are charming, and often conclude with Gross tucking himself in at night, just beneath the cross hung over his bed.

Gross is, like me, a multigenerational Catholic. Unlike me, he has recommitted to the faith. When we spoke this month, he told me that he thought, “It’s time to start acting like a man.” He wanted to be more disciplined, more principled, more of a leader, and thought, “God is a big part of that.” (Church is also, he admits, not a bad place to meet like-minded young women.)

Young men are more religious than their female counterparts today. In an article called “How Catholicism Got Cool” in The Free Press, Father Charles Gallagher of Washington, D.C., said that the internet priests of the Church provided an answer to the “false prophets” of the “Manosphere.” The article also quoted a 21-year-old man and recent convert who said that the Catholic Church doesn’t “shame you for being a man,” and that he’s found both a wanted discipline and a brotherhood through the Church.

The priests Gross has encountered online and in real life, he said, have helped show him the kind of man he wants to be. When I point out that this feels ironic because they themselves won’t marry, the statement seemed to perplex him. “Priests are normal human beings,” he said. “It’s tough because there’s so much pressure put on them to be this perfect human being. And I feel a lot of empathy for them because they are human, just like every other person, and they screw up all the time, just like me and you.”

In that moment, I remembered that Anthony Gross hadn’t even been born when the Boston Globe story came out. His relationship with and appreciation of the priests he’s met and what his faith has done for him are not tainted by the pain of broken trust. And I could take that and dismiss it. Or I could remember the Gospel according to Matthew: When the disciples argue over who will be greatest in heaven, Jesus says, “Unless you turn and become like children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.”

Pope Leo XIV has an opportunity to bring Catholics like me back into the fold. He has not softened the Church’s pro-life stance, but has taken pains to make the sentiment more consistent: noting that pro-life relates to immigrants and gun control as much as the unborn. And, in a moment when many American Christian political figures are abandoning empathy, Leo has spoken out against political leaders using Jesus to justify cruelty. Many lapsed Catholics are taking notice.

Still, the Church’s sins keep surfacing. Just this past week, the diocese of Grand Rapids, Michigan, released a “complete accounting” of 51 priests accused of sexual misconduct since 1950. Whatever gesture comes next—whatever buildings get sold or apologies issued—it won’t be enough. Perhaps the Church will never be able to stop apologizing, and the scandals will never stop coming to light.

But also, perhaps the Church is not really the priests or the pope. It’s the people. It’s the young people looking for solace and a place to commune in a reckless, violent time. It’s generations of family members loving one another as they’d like to be loved, offering kindness to strangers, and opening the manger to whoever needs shelter and warmth.

This Christmas, after many years away, I’ve decided that I’m going to go to Mass.</div>

            <h2>The Writer Fueled by Life’s Randomness</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/2025/12/rabih-alameddine-true-true-story-raja-gullible-book-review/685432/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">“When I’m told I should write a certain way, I bristle,” Rabih Alameddine wrote in a 2018 Harper’s essay. “I even attempt to write in opposition to the most recent book I finished. If my previous novel was expansive, I begin to write microscopically; if quiet, I write loudly. It is my nature.” The 66-year-old artist and novelist has, over the course of a nearly three-decade career, turned this urge, which he self-deprecatingly calls “childish rebelliousness,” into a varied and sophisticated body of work.

His 1998 debut, Koolaids: The Art of War, juxtaposed the Lebanese Civil War and the AIDS epidemic—two tragedies that shaped the author’s early life—in a furious, fragmented tale, as if the book itself were shattered by its anger. Since then, Alameddine has continued to invent his own forms, but also drawn on more venerable ones: He’s written a novel made entirely of first chapters and another that uses camp to riff on the Thousand and One Nights; his seventh and latest, the National Book Award–winning The True True Story of Raja the Gullible (And His Mother), employs drag as a central metaphor that informs both its story and its layered structure. The only quality uniting his books, it can seem, is their literary fearlessness. For Alameddine, no storytelling challenge is too great.

And yet fear is among his recurring themes. Each of Alameddine’s books, dissimilar as they otherwise may be, is an attempt to wrestle with the terrifying arbitrariness of fate. This preoccupation seems to emerge from Alameddine’s personal understanding that the unpredictable swings of history can change a person thoroughly, irrevocably, and without warning. In “How to Bartend,” a wrenching yet humorous essay about living through the AIDS epidemic, Alameddine describes testing positive for HIV and his subsequent terror of getting sick, which did not happen. The piece concludes, “I did not die and I did not recover.” Sometimes his characters are frankly afraid of this fact; sometimes they treat it as a cosmic insult, a cruel joke, or, less often, a potential relief.

No matter the emotions he’s channeling, though, Alameddine maintains a sense of levity, one perhaps born of his feeling that, as he told NPR earlier this year, our society is “too earnest.” How do we deal with terror, he went on, if we can’t “laugh about it?” His writing style, which is relentlessly playful, matches this belief. In 2016’s The Angel of History—perhaps Alameddine’s saddest novel—Jacob, a gay Yemeni poet living in San Francisco, conjures friends he’s lost to AIDS and rages at the homophobia they faced as they died; he wrestles with deep survivor’s guilt and despairs at the next generation’s lack of interest in the pandemic.

Alameddine injects a spiky humor into Jacob’s shattering grief: In one scene, Jacob recalls exploding at a younger gay writer for his generation’s willingness to embrace straight culture in a monologue that begins, “All AIDS books are out of print because of you,” and ends, “We refused everything, rejected their heavens and their hells, and you turn around and accept both.” Jacob’s accusations are deadly serious; the first one about AIDS novels is also very funny. Together, they represent Alameddine’s preferred territory: the sliver of overlap between humor and rage.

Even Alameddine’s most frightened narrators make light of their situations. Raja the Gullible begins in the present day but tunnels back in time to the Lebanese Civil War, during which the then-teenage protagonist, Raja, was kidnapped and held hostage by a militiaman. Alameddine uses a mock Christmas carol to show time passing by: “On the first day of my captivity,” he writes in Raja’s voice, “my jailer brought to me a manousheh,” and so on to the sixth day, when “my jailer brought to me a sack of rice, a can of tuna, and three bottles of Pepsi Cola, and I hated cola, so I screamed at him for thirty minutes that just because he liked cola didn’t mean I did.” This comically petty and foolishly brave outburst is classic Alameddine, and would seem completely out of place were it not for his work’s overarching conviction that we may as well poke fun at even our worst, most helpless circumstances.

In Raja the Gullible, Alameddine writes a character who treats the capricious twists of his life—some huge and historical, some small and personal—not just lightly but with a willful positivity that is somewhat surprising. Never before has he reached for such optimism. Its presence makes humor easy. The novel’s anger, in contrast, is more hidden, even to its hero, and yet it is vital to Raja’s trajectory. Over the course of the book, Alameddine pushes his protagonist to admit that he can be content with himself and his existence, yet angry at the swings of fate that shaped it; to understand, as many of Alameddine’s earlier characters do instinctively, that laughing at terror and tragedy, important though it may be, isn’t enough.

Like The Angel of History, Raja the Gullible is about past pain. Both novels follow writers as they look back on the most difficult parts of their lives. But whereas Jacob is instantly furious, Alameddine leads a reluctant Raja slowly to his rage, as if coaxing a small child toward something new. In order to do this, he moves backward from Raja’s present as a beloved high-school philosophy teacher, occasional drag queen, and the author of one book—a long essay about roaming wartime Beirut that, serendipitously, has become famous abroad. When Raja is unexpectedly offered a literary fellowship in the United States, it sparks a spiraling reflection on not only his book’s surprise success, but the other shocks that have altered him, such as the coronavirus pandemic, Lebanon’s 2019 banking crisis and 2020 port explosion, and, above all else, his personal ordeal during the country’s civil war.

For much of the novel, Raja refuses to admit that these events not only shaped but harmed him. His equanimity seems buoyed by the good fortune that his literary career represents. He wrote his book not for publication, but in order to practice his Japanese. That he speaks this language at all, despite having never lived in Japan or among Japanese speakers, is one of Raja the Gullible’s main instances of a coincidence changing a character’s life for the better, a rare occurrence in Alameddine’s work.

Raja’s relationship with Japanese, we learn, emerged in reaction to his complicated sense of home—meaning both Beirut and his loud, large, excess-loving family. Raja himself is none of those things. He’s also not straight, which his relatives all sense when he’s young and which none but his mother can tolerate. In high school, not long before the kidnapping, he wanders into his Japanese upstairs neighbors’ peaceful apartment, devoid of ancestral clutter and homophobic aunts, and immediately sees in it a place of respite. Loaned a Japanese design book, he grows so entranced by the “banishing of the random, a celebration of order” in the book’s photographs that he decides he will learn its language. By adulthood, this study has become a sanctuary from the chaos his country is undergoing. During and after the war, he writes about embattled Beirut in Japanese, “dissociating from his surroundings” through his struggles with syntax and vocabulary.

Usually, any effort an Alameddine character makes to process a story by telling it is a failure. In 2001’s I, the Divine, Alameddine’s novel made up wholly of first chapters, Sarah, an artist who has lived through a string of haphazard losses, keeps restarting the memoir she’s trying to write; she wants to impose order on her life through narrative, but Alameddine won’t let her. He arranges the story of her life nonchronologically, in a way that is, of course, calculated and artful on his part, but that underscores the futility of her memoiristic efforts. But in Raja the Gullible, it works. According to Raja, who spends much of the story directly addressing the reader, writing about what happened to Beirut helped him mourn. In his eyes—and, perhaps, in his creator’s—that’s even luckier than his book’s eventual success.

Raja has not, however, written about his own wartime trauma: his kidnapping, which was a life-defining experience of randomness. In fact, as of the beginning of Raja the Gullible, he has spent decades refusing to tell his own story, even to himself. Slowly, Alameddine makes clear that Raja is fortunate, yes, but he’s also determined to see himself as fortunate. His luckiness, like his drag persona, is to some degree a character he creates. But as the novel burrows backward through Raja’s memory, remaining resolutely cheery in its tone, the memory of his bad luck gets harder for him to repress. Eventually the kidnapping not only bursts out, but becomes the centerpiece of the book. Alameddine initially casts it as a blundering, droll misadventure—the militiaman was a high-school classmate of Raja’s who captured him by mistake while trying to take some wealthier boys hostage. But soon he reveals it to be a profoundly disturbing story: Raja, who was just 15 at the time, fell for his captor.

Underground in a makeshift bunker, the boys built a relationship that was, in Raja’s words, both “horrific” and “exhilarating”; to use our era’s terms, it was at once consensual and not. Alameddine writes it as a swamp of sex and emotion in which joy and abjection, care and abuse, coexist without canceling each other out. Here, the sensation of wobbling on an emotional knife’s edge that characterizes much of his other work roars back as Raja recalls his first love. Boodie, the militiaman, fed and tended to Raja while keeping him in a state of dependency; if Boodie had ever failed to show up, Raja would have starved “to death in grimy darkness.” He treated Raja lovingly in bed while insisting that he cross-dress to seem more like a woman.

Interestingly, a similar request appears in The Angel of History, in which Jacob’s friend Lou falls in love with “Max the I’m-not-gay carpenter,” who demands that Lou “dress in drag or Max wouldn’t go anywhere near him.” Max loves Lou, but in a way utterly warped by his fear of his own sexuality. By comparison, Alameddine makes Boodie’s love for Raja seem straightforward. Raja chooses to recall it as if it were, anyway. He describes the cross-dressing request less as a show of Boodie’s power as a kidnapper than as evidence of his power as a lover: 15-year-old Raja was in sexual thrall to Boodie, and if pantyhose made the sex better, then he’d wear them every night.

Reading these scenes is challenging, sometimes wrenching, but they aren’t Raja’s greatest wartime trauma. Here, Alameddine’s attunement to the arbitrary reappears as a refusal to assign meaning where readers likely anticipate it. The event that changed Raja forever begins with a seemingly tiny detail: When the moment arrived for him to escape, he was wearing a dress. Of course, he wasn’t going to waste time changing—and, as he recollects, instead of welcoming him home, “people talked, and talked, and wouldn’t stop talking about me in a dress.”

His relatives spread rumors about him. His own father gave him the silent treatment. “When I was sixteen or seventeen,” Raja recalls, “I was told by a student in my class, and for the life of me I can’t remember why he did, that the image of me twirling continuously like a dervish with a rising skirt before seated men with machine guns resting between their legs was imprinted in his memory.” It is this image, which seemed to spread throughout Beirut, that meant Raja’s life “was never the same.”

Read: A book that doesn’t seek to explain itself

For the adult Raja, the randomness of the kidnapping has no meaning. The randomness of the dress, though, is directly connected to the familial homophobia that has shaped much of his life—including his relationship with his mother, which is, by the time the book begins, by far the closest one either of them has. Precisely because his mother doesn’t reject him, their bond has a unique tenderness and strength. After the dress incident, his mother chooses her child over everything else, public opinion and her marriage included; Raja, in turn, chooses his mother over the rest of his relatives. In fact, he ignores them all—he even ignores a persistent rumor that one of his cousins is a lesbian, meaning he may not be alone in his experience of family prejudice—rather than deal with his anger at them.

Alameddine suggests that this willfulness is why his protagonist decides to cut Boodie “out of my memory,” as Raja reports triumphantly to the reader, explaining, “I forbade my mother to bring him up. I wouldn’t allow him any life in my life.” Seen one way, this claim is a victory. Seen another, it’s the direct analogue of Alameddine’s statement, at the end of “How to Bartend,” that he neither died nor recovered.

Of course, it’s also not true. Readers know Raja remembers Boodie because, at the time he announces that he doesn’t, he’s just told us about him in hair-raisingly randy detail. Raja would rather not acknowledge that he’s mad at Boodie. But when the other man suddenly reinserts himself into Raja’s present—he turns out to be pulling the strings at the mysterious American arts fellowship—Raja gets his chance to express the sort of fury that pours unstoppably out of Jacob in The Angel of History.

Boodie, who now goes by the Americanized “Buddy,” has decided he wants closure. He wants Raja to forgive and love him. He wants, in short, the most linear narrative of all: a redemption arc with a romantic happy ending. He does not get it. Raja the Gullible ends as a rejection of the sort of tale Boodie wants to tell, and yet it’s still an American story of self-actualization. During their encounter, Raja has no choice but to articulate his emotions—not in Japanese, as before, but in an English-language explosion of rage. He realizes that he could forgive Boodie and return to his status quo of determined cheeriness, but he doesn’t want to. Raja’s encounter with Boodie shows him that he’s proud of who he is, which comes as no surprise to the reader; after all, this is a man who took up drag in adulthood following an adolescence shaped by his family’s dress-induced hysteria. Still, the contrast with Boodie, who “chose to kill people who were not like him,” is potent. “I should forgive that?” Raja asks rhetorically. “Fuck no.”

Raja’s declaration of ongoing spite turns into a wider emotional opening. It lets him rebuild familial relationships he’s long turned from (see: lesbian cousin) and accept care from people other than his mother for the first time since he left Boodie’s bunker. For an otherwise-complicated novel, this is too close to uplifting. It’s nearly a happily-ever-after: Raja embraces anger, and anger sets him free. It may be true in life that this is part of the route to recovery from trauma, but as an ending rather than a stop along the way, it’s a little neat. If the rest of Alameddine’s work is a tug-of-war between laughing and shouting at fate, a tense expression of simultaneous resignation, terror, and mockery, the last portion of Raja the Gullible lets the rope go slack. Or maybe this is one last joke Alameddine is playing on his narrator; maybe Raja the gullible is getting fooled by anger. In that case, the joke’s on me too.

            <h2>Get Ready to Start Hearing About Aileen Cannon Again</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2025/12/judge-aileen-cannon-trump-grand-jury/685387/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Not so long ago, when the FBI raided Donald Trump’s 126-room Palm Beach mansion and found scores of classified documents, the notion that the disgraced former president would return to the Oval Office seemed far-fetched to just about anyone paying attention. Just over three years later, Trump is president, and the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida is investigating the raid for being part of what the president’s allies have branded a “grand conspiracy” against Trump.

From her quiet courthouse in Fort Pierce, Florida, Aileen Cannon is poised to reprise a role that gave the district-court judge an improbably influential say in national politics. Cannon is expected to preside next month over a special federal grand jury called by Jason Reding Quiñones, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida, that will probe aspects of the FBI’s raid—as well as broader allegations of a plot against Trump by Democratic politicians and other government officials. If the grand jury returns indictments, Cannon would be in a position to oversee trials of people Trump has long targeted for retaliation.

Cannon’s involvement could change the trajectory of the president’s retribution campaign. Trump’s efforts to prosecute perceived enemies have thus far rested on thin indictments brought before skeptical judges; cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, for instance, were quickly tossed out. But Trump allies insist that there is much more to come. Cases like the ones against Comey and James were a mere “appetizer,” Mike Davis, a Trump loyalist who is close with Quiñones, teased on The Charlie Kirk Show this fall. “Just wait for the main course.”

Last year, Cannon made one of the most consequential judicial decisions in decades by throwing out criminal charges against Trump related to his mishandling of classified documents. What had once seemed a rock-solid case that could end in Trump’s conviction on federal felonies had already been dramatically slowed by Cannon’s willingness to entertain even the most fantastical claims made by the former president’s lawyers. With Cannon’s dismissal of the case, the thicket of legal roadblocks impeding Trump’s return to the presidency was suddenly cleared. As liberals despaired, Cannon became a folk hero on the right, a fearless judge who would stand up to a justice system weaponized to force Trump from politics. Conservative luminaries such as former Attorney General Ed Meese, whose brief to the court heavily influenced Cannon’s 93-page decision, praised her courage and promise. Trump called her “the absolute model of what a judge should be.”

On Monday, an attorney for former CIA Director John Brennan—a frequent target of Trump’s ire who was subpoenaed by prosecutors last month—preemptively tried to persuade Cannon’s boss, Southern Florida Chief Judge Cecilia Altonaga, not to permit Cannon to hear any case brought against his client. Kenneth Wainstein’s request, first reported by The New York Times, cited “judge shopping manipulations that appear to be underway” during an already active Miami grand-jury investigation. Wainstein described the inquiry as a “politically motivated and fact-free criminal investigation.” He also questioned why it is necessary to convene an additional grand jury in Fort Pierce—where Cannon happens to be the only judge. The prosecutor, Wainstein wrote, was trying to steer the case to Cannon as part of “the President’s mandate to use the courts to punish his perceived political adversaries.” Neither Quiñones nor Cannon responded to requests for comment.

Trump frequently praises Cannon, which suggests that he’s very much aware of what she’s done for him—and continues to do. That’s why she’s emerged as a widely discussed possible nominee for an appellate seat—or even for the Supreme Court. In the five years since Trump nominated her for the district court, her record has been defined by a refusal to follow judicial norms or bend to public criticism. Her colleagues on the federal bench and others who have studied her record tell me that she is meticulous in the extreme. She insists on doing things her own way—even if that means ignoring precedents with which she finds fault or ruling in a manner that appears to give deference to the man who elevated her. When lawyers for a North Carolina man accused of trying to assassinate Trump argued that Cannon should recuse herself from the case because of perceived bias, she denied the motion and responded in October 2024 with typical precision.

“I have no control over what private citizens, members of the media, or public officials or candidates elect to say about me or my judicial rulings,” she wrote. “Nor am I concerned about the political consequences of my rulings.”

Cannon’s critics—and they are legion—find that hard to believe. To them, she is the very emblem of what happens when the law and politics collide.

The grand jury isn’t the only way in which Cannon is poised to emerge as a significant judicial figure in the new year. She has been under unusual pressure from an appeals-court panel to decide whether she will unseal the second volume of Special Counsel Jack Smith’s investigative findings, a document focused on the classified-documents case that she has kept out of public view for the past year. On Monday, she issued two rulings that made the report less likely to ever become public. She denied a motion from two advocacy groups that asked her to release the report, then issued another ruling giving Trump, the Justice Department, and other parties 60 days to file objections to unsealing the document. Trump’s personal attorney has urged her to keep the report secret, referring to Smith as a “so-called special counsel.”

Just a handful of people have seen the report. Cannon ordered it delivered to her chambers and ruled on the first full day of Trump’s second term that it would remain confidential in order to protect the rights of Trump’s co-defendants. It remained sealed long after the charges against them were dropped, which effectively negated her reasons for keeping it confidential. The report could be embarrassing for Trump. It is believed to describe his efforts to retain classified documents after leaving office, including the role allegedly played by the current FBI director, Kash Patel, who was a White House adviser during Trump’s first term. Keeping the report sealed prevented public scrutiny of Smith’s findings during Patel’s contentious Senate confirmation hearing, which critics said was the whole point. “Judge Cannon very purposely sealed the report so that it would never become public,” the former appeals-court judge J. Michael Luttig told me.

When Trump nominated Cannon in 2020, even close watchers of the judiciary barely knew her name. At 39, she would be among the youngest district-court judges in the country. Yet her nomination checked several boxes valued by Trump’s team: She was Latina, with South Florida roots, connections to the state’s Republican political circles, and a Federalist Society pedigree.

Born in Colombia, Cannon was raised in Miami in a Cuban American family shaped by anti-Castro activism and business success. She grew up hearing stories of her grandparents’ flight from Havana in 1960. Her maternal grandfather rebuilt his advertising firm into an international powerhouse serving Hispanic markets and more. Her mother, Mercedes, became an activist on Cuban issues, while her father, Michael, an Indiana native, worked in the family firm.

Cannon attended an elite private high school, graduated from Duke in 2003, and earned her law degree at the University of Michigan four years later. In Ann Arbor, she joined the campus Federalist Society, which was reshaping conservative legal strategy and building a bench of future prospects. A colleague of Cannon’s who knew her as a summer associate at the top-tier Washington, D.C.–based firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher told me that her conservative ideology, particularly on government power and social issues, surfaced even in casual lunch conversations. “She was very solid, very conscientious, and, frankly, at the same time, one of the most ideologically driven people I’ve ever met,” said this person, who, like some others interviewed for this story, spoke on the condition of anonymity to share candid thoughts about Cannon. “She got very animated and agitated about whatever the topic was.”

After graduation, Cannon joined the firm, where Eugene Scalia, son of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, was a senior partner. Cannon became a regular at George Mason University’s Scalia Forum, absorbing the principles of textualism and skepticism of federal power.

By 2013, she had traded corporate law for a prosecutor’s job in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida. She prosecuted 41 defendants and argued four cases before juries before transferring to the appellate division, which her colleagues said was a better fit. When a slot opened in 2019 for a permanent judgeship in Fort Pierce, few ambitious lawyers stepped forward. The courthouse had a docket heavy with routine criminal cases, including more than its share of disturbing child-pornography cases developed by a federal task force in the city. Yet for Cannon, the position offered a break from the chaos of Miami. Senator Marco Rubio’s office encouraged her to apply, according to answers she gave the Senate Judiciary Committee, and by the summer of 2020, she was testifying via video.

Her confirmation hearing drew little notice. Coached by the White House counsel’s office, she fielded questions about judicial restraint with textbook answers and assured members of Congress that she would “fully and faithfully” abide by Supreme Court and Eleventh Circuit precedent. Nothing in her soft-spoken manner suggested the storm she would create.

Cannon’s inexperience—and a temperament that colleagues would later describe as exacting—surfaced almost as soon as she took the bench. She inherited some long-running civil disputes alongside the usual churn of immigration and street-crime cases. Her Fort Pierce docket includes passport fraud, drug trafficking, health-care fraud, and the occasional high-profile lawsuit. But unlike most district judges, who routinely rely on magistrates to lighten the load, Cannon tended to keep control of most matters. Inside the court, that preference produced friction—and a noticeably slower pace. A report card issued twice a year by the federal courts serves as a kind of public shaming of judges who fall behind. As one district judge explained to me, judges go to great lengths to ensure “that there is a zero beside your name” for motions pending for longer than six months. It is one of the few available tools for measuring judges’ performance.

About a year into the job, Cannon reported 40 motions pending for more than six months. Nationwide, other judges had higher backlogs, but not in the Southern District of Florida, where almost all others reported zero. She lagged behind in many later reports, frustrating plaintiffs, defendants, and their lawyers. Two of her law clerks quit, a rarity in the federal system. To explain delays, Cannon usually checked boxes citing unusually difficult cases or “heavy civil and criminal caseload.”

Fellow judges sensed that she was struggling, but they told me that she rarely reached out for advice. “She keeps to herself,” said one judge who occasionally hears cases in Fort Pierce. At one administrative meeting early in her tenure, when judges discussed COVID-era reopening plans, Cannon sharply objected to district-wide masking and vaccination protocols. Judges, she insisted, should govern their own courtrooms. To some veterans who were accustomed to newcomers showing deference to established rules and procedures, her tone landed as imperious. “This was her opening salvo: anti-mask, anti-vaccine,” one judge who was in the meeting told me. “It kind of threw us for a loop.”

Privately, lawyers grumbled about her approach, but they feared crossing her. They describe a judge who is ever-vigilant for breaches of decorum and exacting about grammar. Cannon is known to chastise even seasoned attorneys for failing to meet her detailed procedural preferences. She scolded a lawyer in a yearslong civil-rights lawsuit for being unable to immediately produce a document she wanted to review. She dismissed the case of a plaintiff who used a wheelchair and was representing himself in a lawsuit against a city over handicapped access to a pier, saying that even self-represented litigants must meet her deadlines. Long delays on routine motions were coupled with sudden decisions that blindsided lawyers and sometimes reopened cases to appeal or refiling.

Listen: The Justice Department won’t break easily

Cannon has shown a willingness to place her own reading of constitutional authority above the guidance of appellate courts, which have admonished her for overreach and for misinterpreting the law in several cases unrelated to Trump. That tendency has set her apart from other district judges, who told me that they would be uncomfortable reinterpreting the limits of executive power. “When the overwhelming authority, including the Supreme Court and other courts, point in one direction, you really don’t have the right to throw all that out,” the retired federal judge Nancy Gertner told me.

Cannon’s sentencing record shows a judge not afraid to lecture defendants about family responsibility, drug abuse, and child exploitation. Although she usually followed recommendations from the U.S. Attorney’s Office, she occasionally broke away. In 2022, as threats of political violence escalated nationwide, she showed leniency to Paul Vernon Hoeffer, a Palm Beach Gardens tow-truck operator, who pleaded guilty after leaving vulgar, threatening voicemails for three female Democratic officials—including then–Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. A prosecutor asked Cannon to give Hoeffer 41 months in prison to reflect the severity of threats “to shoot them in the head, or cut their heads off, and that they were going to die.” Cannon gave him 18 months. “Even when political discourse is not especially eloquent or even well-informed, we cherish our constitutional freedoms as Americans,” the judge explained.

Since then, Cannon herself has been a target. An Illinois man pleaded guilty in October to federal charges of making violent threats against her, and a Texas woman received a three-year sentence last year for leaving threatening voicemails.

Judges told me that they privately worry about Cannon’s safety, particularly after she oversaw the trial of Ryan Routh, who was found guilty of attempting to assassinate Trump at a Florida golf course. Cannon allowed Routh to represent himself after reviewing his psychiatric evaluation, then cut off his incoherent opening statement in less than five minutes. The case was the third she has handled involving Trump. It likely won’t be the last.

Cannon first became entwined with Trump’s legal fate three years ago, after the FBI raided Mar-a-Lago and seized 33 boxes, including some stacked high in a gilded bathroom. Outraged, Trump brought a civil suit that landed before the judge. His attorneys asked her to appoint a special master to review more than 100 documents marked as classified. The Justice Department warned that such an intervention would be an “extraordinary judicial intrusion” that would drastically slow the case. Cannon sided with Trump. She appointed retired Judge Raymond Dearie, but the review was halted when an appeals panel—including two Trump appointees—ruled that she had overstepped her authority.

When Jack Smith, as special counsel, indicted Trump in June 2023, Cannon drew the case by random assignment. Her early rulings signaled skepticism toward the prosecution. She questioned the scope of Smith’s authority and invited outside lawyers aligned with the Federalist Society to challenge the constitutionality of his appointment.

Read: The Bolton case is not like the others

Then, in July 2024, on the opening day of the Republican National Convention, Cannon issued her decision dismissing the case entirely. Drawing heavily from briefs submitted by Meese and others, she concluded that Smith’s appointment violated the Constitution’s separation of powers—a novel theory that had never before voided a federal prosecution. “She was careful about understanding the law and applying it,” Meese told me. Richard Swanson, the president of the New York County Lawyers Association, condemned her decision on his blog at the time and has followed Cannon’s rulings since then. “When you take a step back and look at her opinions as a whole, they’re devoid from real-world context and concealing, to some extent, her very much strong red-team agenda,” Swanson told me.

From the convention stage, Trump called Cannon “a highly respected federal judge in Florida” who had found that “the prosecutor and the fake documents case against me were totally unconstitutional.”

Trump continues to praise Cannon, calling her “brilliant” in a March speech at the Justice Department. By then, the Eleventh Circuit had invited her to sit as visiting judge, and she wrote a dense 37-page opinion on birthright citizenship that Swanson calls “a classic example of textualism run amok.” Trump’s words only fueled speculation that she might soon be elevated to join a higher court permanently.

But for now, she remains in Fort Pierce, more consequential to politics than any other district judge in recent memory.</div>

Nope. They are not.Read the exact definition of &quot;Renewable&quot;, as many times as necessary.

Meanwhile, Germany is scared of ze evil nukular and is literally importing coal from the arctic circle on Svalbard, burning coal like it is the dark ages - because Fukushima happened right in the german psyche, in the emotional part of the brain most people think ze Germans do not possess; but they very much do.

Uranium is not renewable. At least not yet.Which means it&#39;s coming form outside Europe.Which means, Germany&#39;s approach is pretty sound long term for their and EU&#39;s balance sheet.It reached 58% elect. from renewables in 2025. on track for 80% by 2030.The right&#39;s obsession with nuclear baffles me. I thought you guys were all about energy independence?

I see you have been left behind. How pathetic.

Germany is using less coal today than anytime in in it&#39;s history, at least from what I can find.

I&#39;m a supporter of nuclear power so please don&#39;t implicitly lie to support it, this is why nuclear deserves some of it&#39;s bad reputation, it&#39;s supporters do shit like this.

Coal power has been in long term decline in Germany. In 2000, coal generated the majority of electricity (52%). Over the last decade its share has halved, down to 22% in 2024. Over the same period, wind and solar’s combined share of genera

B.SGermany is not scared.Nuclear electricity costs 3-5x more, and is just hopelessly economically outdated.The only reason t build new reactors is to get Plutonium. Electricity is just a side effect.Which country needs Plutonium ?

FYI, Germany is reducing coal use each and every year since 2012.Soon Zero, like UK.

Someone better let Germany know because the mine is closing. https://www.highnorthnews.com/... [highnorthnews.com]

Unless you say they’re buying Russian coal?

At this time, it really is as simple as that.

That was intentional by the author, and msmash, who simply stole it, wouldn&#39;t know the difference.

Almost certainly they were counting all delivery mechanisms.  It&#39;s the streaming being measured, not what app is used to select the streams.

Youtube is free so long as you don&#39;t mind the ads. 100% of factual stuff I watch now is on youtube though I&#39;ll still dip into TV for dramas but thats about it.

How can anyone listen to youtube in the background when blaring ads start shouting at you at random intervals? How experience-ruining is it to be listening to a mellow jazz tune then suddenly without warning in the middle of a chorus a loud, obnoxious ad interrupts?

Is everyone but me paying a subscription fee?

All in all wasn&#39;t youtube much better before google started monetizing it?

&quot;You must wait a little bit (1 minutes) before using this resource; please try again later.&quot;

How about the ads where you have to drop what you&#39;re doing and hit the skip button unless you want to listen to said ad for the next 15 minutes. Can&#39;t imagine why anyone would use an ad blocker though!

I block YouTube ads but also support several channels directly via patreon.

Considering how difficult it is to watch videos or listen to music on YT, I&#39;m sure the bot farms trying to generate more ad money are a not insignificant portion of those numbers.

If you have to enable a dozen scripts and multiple other CSS elements and media just to play a 4 minute song, hoping nothing else needs enabled while you&#39;re listening, it isn&#39;t really worth the effort.

The ads timings are far less obnoxious when you sign in with your google account.

The people are there to be squeezed dry quickly.

... nothing terribly unique about &quot;edtech&quot;.

Videos. Text. Forms. Reporting. Not too difficult to just use generic parts to assemble a whole.

You don&#39;t want a company like Benesse in your country because it only drives up the costs for education while it lowers the quality for public education.

At this time, good teaching either comes with a good teacher (so no need for edtech) or a learner that can learn self-directed (not many of those around, but still no need for edtech).

I agree this is the answer, teaching is a skill and a very human-centric one. All the tech in the world can&#39;t matter if you don&#39;t have that foundation of good teachers with good curricula in place.

Companies these days are engaged in enshitification of their products. The company starts out with grand schemes, attracts investment, delivers products, saturates their market, etc. And then the invested money wants better returns. So companies, being run by MBAs, turn to what they know: resize the product down so that it costs less to produce figuring customers won&#39;t notice and/or customers are already enthralled with their product. Customers get disillusioned, company investors double down on enchitifica

...but why is this headlining on Slashdot?

1) The entire &quot;news&quot; blurb is rooted in a single Substack comment from &quot;Manish Singh&quot;, who appears to work for &quot;India Dispatch&quot;, which, despite the name&#39;s suggestion that it&#39;s a news publisher, is as best as I can tell, an independent commentary blog not associated with any major news publication. [indiadispatch.com]

2) There are no credited sources of reference from his written piece.  He claims his information is from &quot;Goldman Sachs&quot;, but Googling sentences from his &quot;quoted material&quot; turn up nothing on Google or Bing except for his posting and other websites that link to it.  The only place in what he writes that says &quot;link&quot; is not clickable, as what is posted is not hyperlinked plaintext, but rather a .JPG copy & paste of the supposed Goldman Sachs quote.

3) Given today&#39;s age of AI slop, the fact that this &quot;Goldman Sachs&quot; article is posted as a .JPG makes me all that more suspicious that this information was taken from ChatGPT instead of an actual article, especially given that the article reads like ChatGPT.

I would hope that Slashdot editors would do some more due diligence in the future to verify information provided in story submissions before posting content like this to its homepage.

Thank God our education is not run by some huge corporation like MS or Meta.Can&#39;t we just have schools and teachers, universities and profs, like we had in the my day. A system that obviously worked really well, it educate the people who built the world we now live in.

Similarly, there are no large companies involved in MonkeySlaves, ChocolateHelicopters, or ShoeRestaurants.

EdTech is a made up word by someone trying to convince people that this niche business is somehow more than it is.

Is there an education industry?  Yes.  Do they use technology?  Yes.  But the market is small.

            <div id="article-text">Is the US viewpoint the &quot;only true viewpoint&quot; for the entire world?

Will it be fine if EU starts demanding that particular European views to be propagated within the US?

It&#39;s not even about the EU censoring anything. The only one from EU (the government part) is former commissioner Thierry Breton, who isn&#39;t barred for censorship (was never part of his duty), but for overseeing lawmaking and regulatory processes that Trump sees as unfavourable to US companies (e.g. Digital Markets and Digital Services Acts, the ones regularly called against practices of Apple or Meta). The others are heads of non-governmental organisations, i.e. not the EU by definition, and not doing censorship, though exercising their own free speech and defending their opinions (e.g. against fake news, against hate speech).

Indeed. It is always the same defectives that want unlimited power over others and it is always the same deranged approach of trying to redefine reality. Unless and until we can prevent these crappy and malicious people from ever getting power, this will continue.

The EU does not censor. The EU, like the US and many other nations, does remove illegal speech after it has been published. Censoring means all public speech has to be submitted for review beforehand and some things will be suppressed.

And three more steps away from trusting and reconnecting to the USA if and when Republicans are no longer in control.You mean when it&#39;s possible for them to be in control? Because no one will ever trust us again as long as they might get control again. Democrats were bad enough but at least they tend to obey treaties and keep agreements with other nations.

Well, at least they pretended to, and claimed in press releases that they did, but no part of drone strikes, torture, extra-judicial killings, or destruction of civilian infrastructure outside of war zones abides by the Geneva Conventions.

The US was the only one profiting from Russia&#39;s invasion.This is completely disconnected from reality. How much have Europe and the US given to Ukraine? [bbc.com]. US taxpayers contributed HUNDREDS of BILLIONS to Ukraine, with some of it getting embezzled by Ukrainian politicians [bbc.com].

The US spent a total of $130.6bn (£98bn) between 24 January 2022 and 31 August 2025So less than $40B per year?  For comparison that is 1/10 of what Trump&#39;s tax cut&#39;s cost us every year ($4T over 10 years)Also I do enjoy how your second story is only a story because the people who did it are being charged by Ukrainian prosecutors.&quot;Reading the article&quot; vs Republicans remains undefeated.

It is nit the EU that gets isolated. It is the US.

That is not quite true. Even if stated frequently.

Your attempt at propaganda is inept and boring, darling.

Moron Le Pen isn&#39;t barred, she&#39;s in jail for theft.

EU has not &quot;cancelled elections&quot; and nothing in the link you provide is an evidence thereof.

Dunno what Brexitannia and Australia have to do with the EU. Perhaps you can enlighten us.

she&#39;s in jail for theft.Sadly, she isn&#39;t. Lenient laws and lenient enforcement still allow corrupt politicians to avoid jail, just like the pedophile rapist of trumpistan.

1) You cite the Council of Europe. It isn&#39;t the EU and doesn&#39;t have executive power; it&#39;s a discussion assembly, a regional equivalent to the UN. It can&#39;t cancel an election. Romania did; the EU has no say in the matter.2) I will summarize it for you, it&#39;s a case of foreign interference in a Presidential election. (We talked about it https://tech.slashdot.org/stor...

The problem was foreign money (obscurely) funding a campaign. This is as well would be disallowed in the USA.

The problem was foreign money (obscurely) funding a campaign.That would be a problem if you can prove coordination with the candidate&#39;s campaign. Otherwise you can see how that would be abused, where a foreign entity would take up some ads supporting a candidate, then leak information about that to disqualify that candidate. From what I know about the case, there was no proof of coordination. That is, foreign funding was a pretext.

You are veeeeery disconnected from the real world. The real world needs limits on propaganda and manipulation of public opinion.

You either have no clue what you are talking about or you are maliciously pushing propaganda intended to harm. My guess is the latter.

On top of that, making a false accusation to law enforcement is a crime. This is not just free speech. The ones making that statement face real personal consequences if they just made things up. Hence they very likely did not.

Then I suppose you&#39;re upset at how the government is dragging its feet about releasing the Epstein files. Not only is that censorship, but it violates a law passed overwhelmingly by both houses in Congress.

It&#39;s similar for a lot of the &quot;inclusive&quot; ideologies too for that matter. You can&#39;t be truly inclusive unless you also accept the views of those who hate you for what you are or do, no matter how reprehensible they might be.

That is similar to what Charlie Kirk once said, &quot;You need to be open minded, but firm in your beliefs.&quot;

If you&#39;re firm in your beliefs, you&#39;re not open minded.

Go on Truth Social and post a comment that Trump is a rapist and a pedophile and see how fast your post gets removed. Calling Trump a pedophile over association with Epstein is guilt by association, which is fallacy. Also, by that standard Chomsky, Clinton, and Dershowitz are in the same boat and I don&#39;t see you applying that equally. Calling Trump rapist over sexual misconduct allegations is also a huge stretch even if you agree (which I don&#39;t) that uncorroborated 20+ year allegations litigated in a civil court (at lower burden of proof) were true. So yes, such malicious post would get removed for being politically motiva

Yeah, a couple of dozen women all accusing him of the same thing, none of whom had any financial motivation to do so, is just coincidence and TDS. /s

In May 2023, a jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing E. Jean Carroll. From there, it&#39;s not a &quot;huge&quot; stretch to rape. The jury was just unable to come to a verdict on that stronger charge. From Wikipedia:

Carroll&#39;s accusation against Trump was more severe than the accusations made by other women. Regarding the jury verdict, the judge asked the jury to find if the preponderance of the evidence suggested that Trump raped Carroll under New York&#39;s narrow legal definition of rape at that time, denoting forcible penetration with the penis, as alleged by the plaintiff; the jury did not find Trump liable for rape and instead found him liable for a lesser degree of sexual abuse. In July 2023, Judge Kaplan said that the verdict found that Trump had raped Carroll according to the common definition of the word, i.e. not necessarily implying penile penetration.[e] In August 2023, Kaplan dismissed a countersuit and wrote that Carroll&#39;s accusation of rape is &quot;substantially true&quot;.

Funny how someone completely innocent would do that.

There are two issues with the 60 Minutes story. First, as you said, she&#39;s been accussed of burying the story by claiming there was nothing new AND that the administration hadn&#39;t responded to a request for comment.

The second issue is the whiner in chief wants the people who complained to Weiss about burying the story to be fired because . . . they complained about the story being buried.

No, really. That is the argument being used. Because the people who went to all the effort to create the story are upset at

she&#39;s pulled the story because the &quot;journalists&quot; flat out lied about the administration. They claimed the administration refused to be interviewed or provide a statement and gave that reason for their shit report having no response from the administration. The truth is 3 different departments responded directly to interview questions and separately provided a 300+ word written statement.Please stop ruining the narrative with your malinformation.

The irony is how quickly conservatives started treating CBS as Fox:2 instead of the &quot;mainstream media&quot; and now bend their asses all the over for something that if it was done under Obama or Biden would be absolutely livid.  Now all of a sudden you&#39;ve found the well of nuance.

I&#39;d point out how shameless it all is but you are all so far past that you&#39;re in a universe where shame ceases to function.

Nothing says restoring trust in media like the government installing &quot;bias monitors&quot; at news agencies.  Good luck

Europe never really understood &quot;freedom&quot; as it is understood here. You don&#39;t have freedom in the USA. You have the highest number of people in prison both per capita and absolute numbers. You constantly live in fear of other Americans with guns.

The EU&#39;s take on free speech and freedom in general shows a deeper understanding of freedom than any country has ever shown in the world. Freedom is not just free speech, freedom of religion, freedom of expression, freedom of the press, and so on, individually. With freedom comes responsibility and the rights and freedoms of one person should never violate those same freedoms of others. That implies there has to be a balance between all the different kinds of freedoms as well as all the different kinds of fundamental human rights.

Freedom of speech means nothing if it violates others&#39; freedom of religion. Freedom of religion means nothing if it preaches hate agains people who think differently or compels its followers to kill them. Freedom of the press means nothing if it leads to social media being overwhelmed by desinformation. To name just a few.

That does not mean there cannot be any grey areas. Sometimes the perception of a thing is not the reality of a thing. If a person feels their rights and/or freedoms have been violated, they can take it up to court and let the judge (or in some EU countries a jury) make a ruling on the matter.

The US never understood to be liberal, educated, or free. Instead just repeating nonsense propaganda

It&#39;s a badge of honor to be targeted by a fascist regime.

Being banned by the fascist fuckers running the USA today is actually a badge of honor.

Indeed. Dark times. They saw the evil in the world and thought &quot;We want to be part of that!&quot;.

When individuals or companies refuse to promote your viewpoints that is called free speech.  They have the right to not only disagree with you, not only tell you their own opinion, but also to refuse to aid you in spreading your view.

Not understanding doesn&#39;t actually make it mystical, but when you pile lack of understanding upon more of the same, you can get to basically the same place in the end. After enough steps of not understanding you might as well be looking at magic, because you don&#39;t understand even the concepts you need to understand the idea you&#39;re thinking about.

Well, luckily maths is like Shakira&#39;s hips - they don&#39;t lie. What AI-advocates want, and what AI-advocates can have, are two separate things.

Algebra is in the same basked as logic and set-theory (with some limitations). It delivers absolutely correct results, but has very large and deep search spaces and hence a strong tendency to run into state-space explosion and expensive computations.

LLMs are statistics, which is an entirely different basket. It comes with results that are probably or maybe true, very flat search spaces giving fast computations and hallucinations.

Or in other words: Algebra delivers reliably, but the cost may be large and oft

From the Statue of Liberty to the Golden Gate Bridge, and places in between like Yellowstone and the site of the Battle of Gettysburg, the National Park Service has been a point of American pride since its inception. And with a small budget and actually generating revenue, even fiscal hawks had no reason to complain.

So why is the Trump administration cutting their budget?

The Supreme Court dealt a rare and remarkable defeat to President Donald Trump on Tuesday, blocking his deployment of the National Guard to assist immigration agents in Chicago. By a 6–3 vote, the court held that Trump’s federalization of the Guard was likely unlawful, with the majority severely restricting the president’s broader authority to deploy troops for domestic law enforcement. The decision constitutes a significant setback for the administration’s efforts to flood blue cities with National Guard members; it also arguably marks Trump’s biggest Supreme Court defeat since his return to office, with major implications for other aspects of his agenda that go beyond the conservative legal movement’s long-standing priorities.

Tuesday’s ruling in Trump v. Illinois caps off, for now, a clash between federal and state authority with the potential to set off a genuine constitutional crisis. It began in October, when Trump deployed members of the Illinois and Texas National Guards to Chicago to help out with Operation Midway Blitz, an immigration enforcement initiative. The president claimed that both residents and local law enforcement were obstructing the operation, necessitating federalization of the Guard. He ordered Guard members to protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection as they engaged in a campaign of brutality and terror against Latino communities. Chicago and Illinois both sued, and a federal judge ruled that Trump’s use of the Guard was probably unlawful. An appeals court agreed, prompting the Justice Department to seek relief from SCOTUS.

The parties’ dispute centered on a federal statute that lets the president deploy the Guard when he is “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.” Chicago asserted that, as a factual matter, Trump could still execute the law; the Justice Department claimed he could not. But after a few weeks of silence, the justices declined to resolve this fact-bound question; instead, they sought additional briefing on a different issue: the meaning of “regular forces.” The DOJ thought the phrase meant federal law enforcement, like ICE and CBP, and Chicago acquiesced to that reading at SCOTUS. But the justices seemed unsure in light of an amicus brief filed by Georgetown Law professor Marty Lederman that argued it meant the military, not police.

On Tuesday, the court formally sided with Lederman, ruling sharply against the Trump administration. It concluded that “regular forces,” as used in the statute, “likely refers to the regular forces of the United States military.” And, of course, Trump had not tried to quell the alleged crisis in Chicago with the military; instead, he went straight to the National Guard. Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, and Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined with the three liberals to rule against him on that basis. That lopsided outcome is extraordinary on its own.

But Roberts and Barrett then joined with the liberals to go even further. This 5–4 majority held that the relevant statute applies “only where the military could legally execute the laws.” And “such circumstances,” they noted, are “exceptional,” because the president is broadly forbidden from deploying the military for domestic law enforcement under the Posse Comitatus Act. There are a few narrow exceptions—namely, the Insurrection Act, which applies only during an insurrection, invasion, or complete breakdown of civilian law enforcement. But outside those extreme scenarios—which no party has yet argued are present in Chicago—the military may not “execute the laws” of the United States. And that, the majority explained, means the National Guard may not “execute the laws in Illinois,” either.

Kavanaugh refused to embrace this broader holding, warning that it would unduly limit the president’s control over the armed forces during “future crises.” He insisted that the president must have more discretion to deploy the Guard when he is practically unable to send in the military. Kavanaugh’s position would carve a pretty glaring loophole into the majority’s holding: It would allow the president to simply announce that he cannot call in the “regular forces” for some practical reason, then summon the National Guard instead.

That workaround would neuter the majority’s broader message, which seems to be that the president can’t make up some reason why he needs the military, then federalize Guard members because it’s more convenient. By forcing the president to call on the military as a first resort for domestic law enforcement—then reminding him that he can very rarely do so lawfully—the majority sharply restricted his use of any troops in American streets. It is unclear if Kavanaugh agrees with this bottom line. (In a footnote, the justice also appeared to walk back his notorious September opinion insisting that immigration agents may engage in racial profiling, which greenlit so-called Kavanaugh stops; he wrote on Tuesday that, actually, officers “must not make interior immigration stops or arrests based on race or ethnicity.”)

Justice Samuel Alito’s dissent, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, is most notable for its total lack of self-awareness. Alito complained that the majority decided the case with “scant briefing and no oral argument,” when he himself has joined innumerable decisions in favor of Trump that were decided the exact same way. He also suggested that his colleagues imperiled the lives of immigration agents, writing: “Whatever one may think about the current administration’s enforcement of the immigration laws or the way ICE has conducted its operations, the protection of federal officers from potentially lethal attacks should not be thwarted.” Yet courts have consistently found that the Trump administration has exaggerated or fabricated threats to these officers; it is, in fact, the officers themselves who have engaged in the most disturbing acts of violence. (Justice Neil Gorsuch’s brief dissent objected to the rapid resolution of such “fraught” questions on a “highly compressed schedule”—though he, too, has regularly joined shadow docket orders that resolved equally weighty questions in Trump’s favor.)

Why, after handing so many victories to the Trump administration over the last year, did the court draw the line here? There are two obvious answers. First, most of the prior cases involved legal issues long settled within the conservative legal movement. Roberts, Barrett, and Kavanaugh have spent their whole careers arguing for the president’s power to fire executive officials. But the Federalist Society has not reached a consensus on the president’s authority to send troops into American cities; to the contrary, its emphasis on federalism might seem to counsel against this sweeping claim of power. Trump’s agenda and the Supreme Court’s priorities may be starting to diverge, with the president pushing some conservative justices far out of their comfort zones and into uncharted territory. These are the cases where the center of the court may be inclined to draw a line.

Second, the National Guard cases have, in the lower courts, devolved into a furious dispute over the facts. The Trump administration keeps getting caught lying about the alleged violence against ICE, leading some judges to argue that he should lose because he is, as a matter of demonstrable reality, able to “execute the laws” without help from the armed forces. By adopting Lederman’s reading, the Supreme Court sidestepped this debate, ruling against Trump without having to call him a liar. The justices clearly did not want to get sucked into this increasingly acerbic and inherently political discourse.

Still, this conflict is far from over. One irony of the court’s decision is that it gives Trump a reason to go nuclear and invoke the Insurrection Act, which really does allow him to send in the military for domestic law enforcement. That law only applies during insurrection, rebellion, or a complete breakdown of state police, none of which is present in Chicago or anywhere else in the U.S. Tuesday’s ruling—with its marked skepticism toward Trump’s deployment of troops at home—suggests that the majority would not approve an invocation of the act on this record. But as Kavanaugh flagged in an ominous footnote, the matter remains unresolved. So that battle looms in the distance. Right now, though, it is just a relief to know that there is still a limit to SCOTUS’ indulgence of this administration’s abuses of power.

The good news about President Donald Trump’s announcement of a new “Trump-class battleship,” based on his own vision of what a modern war vessel should look like, is that it will almost certainly never be built.

The bad news is that, over the next few years, the Navy will spend hundreds of millions of dollars—maybe even a few billion—pretending that it’s working on the project.

Nobody in the Navy has asked for a new battleship of this sort—a behemoth weighing three times as much as the vessel it replaces (which itself is a very heavy ship), staffed by twice as many personnel (recruited from where?), and hoisting every type of weapon imaginable, including nuclear-armed cruise missiles, which, to the relief of every Navy commander, no U.S. surface vessel has carried since the end of the Cold War.

Quite apart from the megalomania of a president naming a warship after himself, the project contradicts a growing consensus among naval analysts for building and dispersing a larger number of smaller, less vulnerable ships. Given that the Chinese navy now has more ships than the U.S. Navy (370 vs. 294) and, more important, hundreds of anti-ship ballistic missiles, which can strike our ships from 900 miles away, the Trump-class battleship is simply wrongheaded for the modern era: It would heighten the U.S. Navy’s already-stressed vulnerabilities at sea.

In a news conference at Mar-a-Lago where the project was announced, Trump—standing next to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio—said he would push the Navy to build the first of the new ships in two-and-a-half years, i.e., before his term is up. (He envisions building 20 to 25 of the ships in all.)

Several retired Navy officers and weapons analysts (including two that I interviewed, who requested anonymity in order to avoid retribution) see this as a pipe dream. The newest Burke-class destroyer ships take about five years to build—and they are much smaller and based on existing designs. To design, construct, weaponize, and deploy a much larger ship based on an entirely new concept would likely take a decade.

The retired officer and naval analyst estimate the first of these ships would likely cost about $10 billion, four times that of the newest Burke destroyer—and that’s not counting the cost of the weapons onboard.

Those weapons are another problem. According to Trump and to subsequent information released by the Navy, much of it compiled by the private research group GlobalSecurity.org, the new ship would carry a lot of new, as-yet-unproven types of armaments, including hypersonic missiles, laser weapons, and an as-yet-undecided power source. Testing all these new weapons, and then integrating them all on one platform, is a very complex task.

The retired admiral told me that the Navy’s most successful project in recent decades is the Aegis-class cruiser. Started in the late 1970s, it works well, and was efficiently built, because it put together existing elements—the Navy’s best missiles, fire-control system, and air defenses—all already-proven. The only new element was an air-defense radar.

By contrast, the much newer Zumwalt-class destroyer, contracted in 2002, tried to integrate lots of new technologies, and it was a disaster. The Navy had planned to build 32 of those ships, but, owing to various delays and cost overruns, ended up building just three.

The same is likely to happen with the Trump-class battleships, if any ever get built at all.

One other problem: The United States just doesn’t have the shipbuilding capacity for this project. The retired admiral and the naval analyst told me the shipyard in Newport News, Virginia, is the only one capable of building a boat this big. Yet it is also where the next aircraft carrier is being built. Which vessel will get priority? There is neither the space nor the workforce to build both.

Finally, it is unclear just what this ship is supposed to do. Secretary of the Navy John Phelan said at Mar-a-Lago that the USS Defiant—the name of the first Trump-class ship—“will inspire awe and reverence for the American flag whenever it pulls into a foreign port.”

But what if it has to fight in a war? Ships mobilize as part of a battle group. Will the USS Defiant help protect the aircraft carrier, along with the various frigates, cruisers, and destroyers? Will it assist the aircraft carrier in projecting power against the enemy? Will it be the “flagship”—the lead vessel—in its own group? These aren’t small questions. The answers will shape the training of the ship’s crews and even, to some degree, its design.

The announcement that the ship will also carry nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles came as a particular surprise. No U.S. surface vessel has carried nukes since the end of the Cold War. President George H.W. Bush ordered them removed back in 1991—and not just for dovish reasons. Not only had the nukes made those ships a more tempting target, they were more trouble than they were worth, requiring specially trained crews and special security procedures. Those ships were also barred from entering the waters and ports of many U.S. allies. I was a defense reporter when Bush made this decision. Every Navy officer I knew heaved a huge sigh of relief. I doubt many of today’s officers want to return to the old era.

Trump has mulled none of this. He first raised the subject back on Sept. 30, in his address before hundreds of generals and admirals at Quantico, Virginia. In the middle of a rambling speech, touching on dozens of topics, he said:

I think we should maybe start thinking about battleships, by the way. … I used to watch Victory at Sea [a documentary about World War II naval battles]. I love Victory at Sea. I look at these admirals, it’s got to be your all-time fave, in black and white. When I look at those ships … man, nothing was going to stop. … They were 20 deep, and they were in a straight line, and there was nothing going to stop them. … They don’t make [ships] that way anymore, but … I’m sort of open to it.

In other words, even aside from its name, the Trump-class battleship is all about Trump—his fantasy-fed nostalgia, feeding his notion that, as the smartest man in the room on any and all subjects, he has the slightest idea how any of this works.

He also likes the looks of this ship, claiming that he was involved in its design. “I’m a very aesthetic person,” he said at the Mar-a-Lago press conference. He has always been impressed by looks; recall his tendency, especially in his first term, to pick Cabinet secretaries because they looked straight out of “central casting.” To him, everything is a show.

Back in his first term, Trump asked the top Navy admirals to come to the White House to talk about ships. A friend of one of those officers, now also a retired admiral, recalls being told that Trump put up pictures of various U.S. ships, criticizing them all as ugly. Then he put up a picture of, the Moskva, the flagship of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet.

“Now there’s a good-looking ship!” Trump exclaimed.

One of the admirals replied that it might look good, but it wouldn’t last five minutes in a battle at sea. And in fact, the Ukrainian navy sank the Moskva in April 2022, just weeks after the start of that war.

The Trump-class USS Defiant might be good-looking, if it ever sees life on a shipyard. But if it steams into battle, it might meet the same fate as the Moskva.

In something of a Christmas miracle, the MAGA coalition may finally be starting to break down.

The Heritage Foundation, which published the Project 2025 blueprint for this Trump term, just saw more than a dozen staff members defect for former Vice President Mike Pence’s Advancing American Freedom think tank; turncoats include the former leaders of Heritage’s data, economics, and legal teams. Among prominent MAGA leaders—mostly elected officials, people who want to be elected officials, and podcasters—there is a growing divide over what one might assume should be an easily answered question: Should they welcome Nazis, avowed white supremacists, and unrepentant racists hurling slurs into the movement?

This is apparently quite the conundrum. It’s also telling that the cleavage is coming now. After all, the movement Donald Trump built has long welcomed bigots and racists; Trump himself dined with white supremacist Nick Fuentes and enthusiastic antisemite Kanye West at Mar-a-Lago, although he later claimed to not know who Fuentes was. The people who have gotten into bed with the president, whether they’re D.C. think tank staffers or Jan. 6 hooligans, realized who they were cozying up with.

That some are starting to object and defect suggests that two things are happening at once. The first is that MAGA bigotry has gotten significantly broader, expanding beyond the groups the broader right believes are acceptable to malign (women, Black people, immigrants, Muslims) and coming for groups of which prominent MAGA leaders are a part (Jews, Indians, anyone whose ancestors didn’t come over on the Mayflower). The second is that Trump himself is fading: He’s elderly and showing the typical signs of fatigue and cognitive decline. This is creating something of a vacuum in leadership. Vice President J.D. Vance is the clear MAGA heir apparent (or at least believes himself to be). But he won’t take the throne unchallenged. Some of these contenders want to sit in the Oval Office, and there can be only one butt in the chair behind the Resolute Desk. Others want a different kind of Republican Party: Some strive to turn away from Trumpian populism and toward a tax-cutting pro-business agenda; others aim for a return to the politics of conservative Christianity, with a refocus on restricting abortion and LGBTQ+ rights; a few really may object to MAGA’s blood-and-soil nationalist turn. But the coalition is currently fracturing for one reason: The leader is weak, and a successor is being chosen.

The growing objections to MAGA racism can feel pretty rich coming from people who seemed just fine with many kinds of racism up until now. But it’s also true that MAGA racism has, like the famous “First they came for” poem, proved itself insatiable. Vance has been among the leading voices for the idea that there is a category of “heritage Americans,” a very-online term for people whose family ancestry supposedly gives them more of a claim to legitimate Americanness than anyone else: naturalized citizens, children of immigrants, someone whose grandparents immigrated after World War II. If your ancestors came over anytime after 1789, you are not a “Grade A” American, as one chart puts it. “I think the people whose ancestors fought in the Civil War have a hell of a lot more claim over America than the people who say they don’t belong,” Vance has said—marking those who chose to become American as having a less legitimate right to Americanness than those who fought to break up the country.

This turn has alarmed many conservatives who, like most Americans, are not purely descended from Pilgrims. The elevation of unapologetically antisemitic rhetoric and the growing hatred of Jews among Gen Z conservatives seem to have also spooked some MAGA loyalists. A recent Manhattan Institute focus group of Gen Z conservatives found them praising Adolf Hitler as a “great leader” and understanding “where he was coming from as far as wanting to improve the national state of Germany.” One young man who also said that Jews are a “force for evil” explained: “I’m very pro–strong executive, –strong leader, –strongman. I support national sovereignty, and Hitler was a nationalist. He was like, ‘We have to take Germany back for Germans.’ And I feel like we should do that in America.” A leaked chat among Young Republican leaders showed them joking about the Holocaust, calling Black people monkeys, and saying, “I love Hitler.” Young voters generally hold more antisemitic views than older ones, and young conservatives are, on average, the most antisemitic of all. This may be because young people are getting much of their political news from outrage-amplifying social media, as well as from “influencers” with popular podcasts, TikTok accounts, and YouTube and Discord channels, and many right-wing influencers have seen that racism, sexism, and antisemitism drive traffic—which in turn drives fans to be even more bigoted and reactionary. Candace Owens recently went on an extended antisemitic tirade, and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson and Fuentes have also entertained antisemitic conspiracy theories or flat-out blamed the Jews for various problems. And the Trump administration is putting people with long records of antisemitism into top positions.

This seems to be an inflection point even for some notorious bigots and people who didn’t mind when the president called Somalis “garbage” and compared immigrants with insects. Laura Loomer is one of the country’s most notorious Muslim-haters (she has called Islam a “cancer” and argued that Muslims should not be allowed to hold political office) and acted as if getting banned from Twitter for hate speech was as bad as being sent to the gulags. But now she is suddenly in favor of gatekeeping, enforcing basic standards, and “moral clarity.” Former presidential contender and current candidate for governor of Ohio Vivek Ramaswamy, who during his 2024 campaign claimed that “our diversity is not our strength,” compared prominent Black progressives with the Ku Klux Klan and asserted that he had never seen or met “the boogeyman white supremacist” in America—“Maybe I’ll meet a unicorn sooner,” he added, “and maybe those exist too”—also seems to have changed his tune. “If you believe that Hitler was pretty fucking cool, you have no place in the future of the conservative movement,” Ramaswamy recently said. “If you call Usha Vance, the second lady of the United States of America, a ‘j—t,’ you have no place in the future of the conservative movement.”

J.D. Vance, whose Indian American wife Usha has been called racial slurs by right-wing racists, said that people who target her specifically can “eat shit” but that otherwise the GOP should be a big tent. “When I say that I’m going to fight alongside of you, I mean all of you—each and every one,” the vice president said at Turning Point USA’s recent AmericaFest. “President Trump did not build the greatest coalition in politics by running his supporters through endless self-defeating purity tests.”

As the Nazis vs. Say-No-to-Nazis fissures broke open at the Turning Point event, conservatives on all sides of the debate laid claim to the legacy of their martyred leader Charlie Kirk. Some argued that he was a free-speech fanatic who would have welcomed everyone to TPUSA events even if they were wearing a T-shirt bearing a pro-Holocaust meme (“Let ’Em Cook”). Others agreed with Loomer’s take, that “people want to pretend like [Kirk’s] events were a free for all so they have an excuse to not call out the GOP’s Nazi problem.” Vance positioned himself on Team “Let ’Em Cook.” Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, seems to be with him: He caused major outcry after he defended Carlson having a very friendly interview with Holocaust denier Fuentes, in which Fuentes complained about the domination of “organized Jewry” and Carlson noted his belief that “Christian Zionists” have been “seized by this brain virus.”

The former Heritage staffers who have decamped for the new organization seem to be on Team Moral Clarity—or perhaps a team for which they don’t have to play ball with Nazis or the kinds of people who would attend a Turning Point USA convention. (That the organization they flocked to belongs to Pence—remember him? The guy the Jan. 6 rioters wanted to lynch on the White House lawn?—only adds to the sense that this cleavage runs deep.) In a not-so-long-ago iteration of the Republican Party, those who spoke and acted like Loomer, Owens, and even Kirk were the riffraff—part of the base, sure, but inconvenient and merely dog-whistled at to encourage loyalty. Now, though, they’re leading the pack, and not only when it comes to MAGA’s young pups.

It’s worth noting that in all of this, Trump is largely absent. Perhaps those closest to him see what average Americans do not: that his abilities, and with them his power, are waning. He turned the party into a cult of personality, in which the only ideology was to line up behind Donald Trump. The GOP rule “Whatever Trump wants, Trump gets” was so clear that the party stopped writing out policy platforms, instead issuing a one-page fealty pledge to its unquestioned leader. No one has the audacity to try to unseat him, or even to say that he won’t be in charge forever. MAGA stalwarts still wear their Trump 2028 hats, make Trump-as-Jesus fan art, share the triumphant photo of him raising his fist after surviving an assassin’s bullet, and believe that his 2024 win was a political resurrection divinely ordained to save America. Maybe Trumpism will never die. But clearly those around him can smell decay.

Craig Copetas had one of the most colorful beats in journalism: He wrote about the illegal drug trade for High Times magazine. “Dealers would search me out, asking me to go to Latin America to write adventure stories about them,” he told me. Another time, a guy opened up a small suitcase to give Copetas a peek at what he was holding: $1.5 million in cash.

That show-and-tell happened in December 1977, in the District of Columbia. It was a big weekend for drugs in the nation’s capital. “Everyone was coming to Washington,” Copetas remembered. “Smugglers, adventurers, scientists, musicians, lawyers, farmers, dealers, global leaders. And all of them were coming with some of the most rootin’-tootin’, scientifically produced cavalcade of recreational drugs you could imagine. And they were bringing it down in bulk.”

The occasion was a weekend conference put on by the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, more commonly known as NORML. For NORML and its allies, 1977 had been an amazing year. Mississippi, New York, and North Carolina all passed decriminalization laws. And the new man in the White House, President Jimmy Carter, was urging Congress to do the same thing on a national level.

Growing, smoking, and possessing marijuana was still illegal pretty much everywhere in the United States. But by 1977, more than half of Americans under 30 had tried pot. NORML’s liberal drug agenda was winning. And now it was time to revel in all that success.

The weekend’s most extravagant event was the NORML Christmas party, held in a town house near Dupont Circle. There was a rock band, strobe lights, and a juggler. Silver trays got passed from guest to guest, some loaded down with caviar and others with joints packed with hand-cultivated marijuana.

The night was a crucial showcase for one man: Keith Stroup, the founder of NORML.

In 1977 he was 33 years old, and he answered to the nickname Mr. Marijuana. At the Christmas party, he strolled around in a blue velvet dinner jacket and burgundy bow tie, chatting up friends, colleagues, and potential funders under a haze of marijuana smoke. “Part of the thrill of being there was it was so goddamn out in the open,” he said.

Not long after 10 p.m., a guest showed up who demanded his full attention: Peter Bourne. He was the president’s top adviser on drug policy, and a man who could potentially change everything for Stroup’s movement.

Stroup was surprised and thrilled to see Bourne at the front door. The United States drug czar had turned up for a weed extravaganza. And he hadn’t dropped by to narc on anyone or to shut the whole thing down.

When it came to marijuana, Stroup and Bourne were on the same team. They believed both that America’s drug laws were horribly screwed up and that they were the people to fix them.

But that was before the NORML Christmas party. That night did end up changing everything for pot in America, but not in the way anyone expected.

Last week, almost five decades later, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to hasten the reclassification of marijuana as a Schedule 3 drug. That move would put weed in the same tier as Tylenol with codeine, loosening restrictions on research into the drug’s medical benefits. It will also be a step in the direction of full federal decriminalization or even legalization.

It all might have happened a long time ago if not for that Christmas party in 1977. The drug-fueled gathering turned out to be a turning point for Stroup and Bourne, for the Carter presidency, and for the future of marijuana.

The first time “Mr. Marijuana” Keith Stroup took a hit from a joint, he wasn’t sure he’d gotten high. What he did know is that the pizza he ate that night tasted “exceptionally good.”

It was the 1960s, and Stroup was at Georgetown Law School, in Washington. Back then, his main concern was avoiding the Vietnam War. He thought about getting a psychiatrist to say that he was gay, which would’ve disqualified him from the armed forces, but his wife vetoed that idea. In the end, he steered clear of military service by getting a government job.

Stroup worked for the National Commission on Product Safety. As a lawyer for the agency, he learned to do the sort of consumer advocacy made famous by Ralph Nader. In 1970 Stroup decided to put his own spin on that kind of work: He was going to lobby for marijuana smokers, just as Nader took up for consumers.

At first, Stroup’s National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws got treated as a curiosity. But he was tireless and charismatic, and he knew what he wanted to achieve. His goal was to make weed legal everywhere in the U.S. In the meantime, he pushed for a smaller, more practical step: decriminalization.

The country’s harsh marijuana laws dated back to the early 20th century, when they’d been enacted to target Black and Mexican Americans. As the demographics of marijuana users changed, so did the drug’s reputation. In 1969 Life magazine published photos of white professionals in cocktail attire toking up.

“If young, otherwise law-abiding, and essentially white people were going to start using this drug in greater numbers, people felt that they didn’t want to then burden these individuals with a criminal record,” said Emily Dufton, the author of Grass Roots: The Rise and Fall and Rise of Marijuana in America. “ ‘You know, this person is probably going to go on to have a family and a white picket fence. And do we really want to destroy their future for a little bit of harmless fun?’ ”

Still, harmless or not, marijuana was illegal. And if you got caught in the wrong place doing the wrong thing, the consequences could be extremely severe, with some people getting life sentences for marijuana-only crimes.

Plenty of Americans believed that small-time marijuana offenders weren’t really offenders at all. And so, under the right circumstances, the country might’ve been on a path to decriminalization in the late 1960s and early ’70s. But there was one very important person standing in the way.

Richard Nixon saw marijuana as a tool of his enemies: liberals, young people, and Vietnam protesters. And in Nixon’s America, those enemies needed to be policed. In 1970 he signed the federal Controlled Substances Act, which put drugs into five different categories, or schedules. The most restrictive category, Schedule 1, was for drugs that were totally outlawed, even for medical use. Among them were heroin, LSD, and marijuana.

Marijuana’s placement in Schedule 1 had to be reviewed by a commission. Given that this group was stacked with Nixon appointees, the president thought it would rubber-stamp his anti-marijuana position. But when all those Nixon appointees weighed the evidence, they did something surprising: They said marijuana wasn’t actually that bad. The commission recommended that both possession of marijuana for personal use and nonprofit distribution of small amounts of marijuana should be decriminalized.

Nixon hated those recommendations, and so he decided to ignore them. He kept marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug, which it still is today. (Trump’s executive order finally looks poised to change that.)

But Nixon wasn’t all-powerful. Lawmakers across the country read the commission’s report and found it persuasive. “They began realizing that they had the capacity to change marijuana laws on the local level, and that’s what began to happen,” Dufton said.

Oregon was the first state to decriminalize marijuana, in 1973. By 1976, six more states had done it, and a bunch of others looked as if they were moving in that direction. But for American marijuana policy to get remade, the federal government would have to be on board. There would need to be a new voice in Washington, someone with liberal views who was savvy enough to wield real political power. Someone like future drug czar Peter Bourne.

Years before he showed up at that fateful Washington party, Peter Bourne served as a doctor in Vietnam. During his stint in the military, Bourne discovered that American soldiers were finding solace in heroin. When his tour of duty was over, the Englishman moved to California and saw the dark aftermath of the Summer of Love. In San Francisco in the late 1960s, he helped set up the Haight Ashbury Free Medical Clinic. “That exposed me to widespread drug use of all kinds,” he told me.

In the early ’70s, Bourne moved to Atlanta to run a methadone clinic. He saw it as his chance to save lives. “Our goal was to have a situation where no heroin addict could say, ‘I want treatment, but there’s nowhere I can go to get it,’ ” he said.

Bourne and his clinic caught the attention of Georgia’s new governor, Jimmy Carter. Back then, Carter was an obscure figure, but Bourne believed in him. He was the first person to tell Carter that he should run for president.

Carter and Bourne became extremely close. During the 1976 presidential campaign, the governor said that Bourne was “about the closest friend I have in the world.” When Bourne talked about drugs, Carter listened. And Bourne made his views very clear. “More than anything else, people were dying in large numbers from heroin,” he said, “and you had 40 million people in the country using marijuana and nobody dying from it.”

Bourne believed that every dollar spent enforcing marijuana laws was a dollar taken away from work that really mattered. And he convinced Carter that he was right. During the 1976 campaign, Carter came out in favor of marijuana decriminalization. This was a big statement—the most liberal position on marijuana ever taken by a major-party presidential nominee.

While Carter didn’t personally approve of pot, he was no Richard Nixon. He hung out with weed-loving musicians like Willie Nelson and the Allman Brothers, and he didn’t think that everyone under 30 was plotting to destroy America.

Carter’s victory that fall marked a huge shift in U.S. politics—the end of the Nixon era, and a fresh start after Watergate and Vietnam. And Bourne had lots of ideas about how he could help his closest friend. Bourne advocated for national health insurance, and he put together a plan to end world hunger. He also talked to Carter about sending rockets to Mars.

All of that was outside Bourne’s purview. What he could do was change the country’s drug policy. Bourne’s official title was “special assistant to the president for mental health and drug abuse.” One of the people he met with was Keith Stroup. “We had so much to gain by maintaining that relationship, with Peter being so close to the president himself and so powerful in terms of drug policy,” Stroup said.

When Stroup founded NORML, he struggled to get big players to take him seriously. Now, with Carter in the White House, he became a Washington insider. Stroup smoked weed with the president’s son Chip, and he bonded with administration officials. “When the Allman Brothers were going to play a concert here in D.C., I would actually ride out to the concert with a group of White House people in a bus they had chartered,” Stroup told me. “Most of the time, we were smoking on the bus going out and smoking on the bus coming home.”

Stroup was a stoner who thought everyone in America should be free to enjoy the benefits of marijuana. Bourne was a doctor who thought that marijuana was trivial and the government should focus its resources on heroin. But from those different starting points, Mr. Marijuana and the drug czar ended up in the same place. In March 1977, Bourne told Congress that the administration “will continue to discourage marijuana use, but we feel criminal penalties that brand otherwise law-abiding people for life are neither an effective nor an appropriate deterrent.”

At times, it sounded as if the White House’s talking points on marijuana had been written by Keith Stroup. And in 1977, that actually happened.

One day, Stroup got a phone call from a junior White House speechwriter, who said that he was working on a presidential statement about marijuana policy. He asked Stroup if he’d like to come by and help him draft it. “And of course, I almost kill myself running to his place,” Stroup said.

Stroup’s most aggressive pro-pot language got edited out of that statement. But a lot of his material remained intact, including these lines:

Penalties against possession of a drug should not be more damaging to an individual than the use of the drug itself; and where they are, they should be changed. Nowhere is this more clear than in the laws against possession of marijuana in private for personal use.

The biggest headline coming out of that statement was that Jimmy Carter endorsed decriminalization—the first time a sitting president had ever done so. In some ways, it was just symbolic, because Carter wasn’t proposing a specific bill. But coming from the president and his drug czar, that symbolism was important.

A fundamental shift in American marijuana policy felt tantalizingly close. Bourne believed that the administration was going to get progressive legislation passed in Congress. Stroup thought that “within three or four or five years, we would have decriminalization passed in all states across the country.”

But there was another movement getting started around that same time—one that Bourne and Stroup did not see coming. It was led by two moms from Georgia.

In 1976 Marsha Keith Schuchard and her husband hosted their daughter’s 13th birthday party. There were about 20 kids in her backyard. “They asked if we could go upstairs, which we did,” she said. “And then my husband started seeing lights, like cigarette lights, going on all over. … And he went down to see what was happening, and it wasn’t cigarettes. It was joints. It was booze. And it was quite a shock.”

Schuchard doesn’t fit the stereotype of a drug warrior. She has a doctorate in English, and she identifies as a liberal Democrat. Living in Atlanta in the ’60s and ’70s, she fought for voting rights and school desegregation. But when Schuchard caught her daughter smoking pot, she found a new cause.

Schuchard called herself a “do-it-yourself drug-abuse professional.” She believed that parents could fight back against drug culture by sharing tips and resources and creating a supportive and safe community.

“They set uniform rules for all of their kids. They weren’t allowed to read High Times magazine. They had a curfew,” said Dufton, who wrote about Schuchard in her book Grass Roots. And in the parents’ eyes, those rules seemed to work.

The neighborhood kids called them the Nosy Parents Association. By 1977, Schuchard had brought her nosiness nationwide, co-founding the Parents’ Resource Institute for Drug Education. “What Schuchard was tapping into was that these were legitimate fears that a lot of people were having about their kids, but no one was speaking to it,” Dufton said.

Adolescent marijuana usage was on the rise in the mid-1970s, and pro-pot messages were everywhere. In magazines like High Times, Head, and Stone Age; on Saturday Night Live and in movies like The Groove Tube and Car Wash; and in Peter Tosh’s “Legalize It” and Neil Young’s “Homegrown.” And it was getting easier every day to find a shop that carried pipes and rolling papers.

In Atlanta, Schuchard’s friend Sue Rusche had promised her kids she’d buy them a Star Wars record. When they walked into the record store, what they found instead was a glass display case full of “Star Wars–like bongs.” Rusche went to more stores, and found more kid-friendly products: a Frisbee that was also a hash pipe, and a book called Tots Who Toke. “I know the power of advertising. I learned it in graphic design school,” Rusche told me. “And to think that people would target children was just inexplicable and abhorrent.”

The idea that pot was endangering impressionable, vulnerable children was a potent political message. In 1977 Schuchard and Rusche were starting to spread it. Whenever they spoke to parents groups, they’d bring along what they called the “bong show.” “The first thing we did was show them what the paraphernalia looked like and suggest that they try to find it in their community, and they always did,” Rusche said.

NORML’s Stroup had not accounted for any of this when he made his push for decriminalization. And when the parents from Atlanta started to get traction, he still didn’t think they were a real threat.

“Their philosophy was: If it’s unsafe for kids, then you shouldn’t legalize it. And of course, that’s a stupid standard,” Stroup said. “If that was the standard, adults couldn’t drive or fly airplanes or have sex. I thought because that premise was so wrongheaded that we didn’t have to worry about them.”

It was always unlikely that Mr. Marijuana and the nosy parents would find common ground. But Schuchard thought she might have a chance to win over the drug czar.

She got an audience with Peter Bourne in December 1977, at a conference on drug abuse. She told him about middle schoolers smoking pot, and she pulled out a bag of marijuana publications that she’d bought at a suburban shopping mall. Bourne listened to what she had to say and looked at what she’d brought. And the drug czar was totally unmoved. Schuchard said that he was “indifferent, rude, dismissive.”

Bourne was similarly unimpressed. He told me that the parents “didn’t know anything about drug abuse” and “couldn’t explain their position in any sort of public-health terms.” When I asked Bourne if he thought it was legitimate to be concerned about 13-year-olds smoking marijuana, he said that it didn’t bother him that much—that “when you compare it to more than 1,000 dying each month from heroin, it’s a misplacement of priorities.”

So that’s where Stroup and Bourne were in December 1977: entrenched in their positions, confident in their success, and unafraid to antagonize their opponents. What they didn’t realize was that they were about to make enemies with each other. And it would all start at the Christmas party.

NORML’s annual conference in D.C. featured seminars on marijuana and the law, marijuana and science, and marijuana and women. There were also plenty of opportunities to get a more practical education on the American drug scene.

“Wherever we went that weekend, people were coming up to us and offering us drugs,” remembered Craig Copetas of High Times magazine. “It was like backstage at a Rolling Stones concert.”

That weekend, Copetas shared a hotel suite with his friend Hunter S. Thompson. The way Patrick Anderson tells it in his book High in America, a conferencegoer sidled up to Thompson during a luncheon attended by roughly 300 people and passed the writer some cocaine. Copetas then held up a copy of the New York Times, which they used to shield themselves as they enjoyed the gift they’d just received.

“Oh, dear. The things we did in our youth, huh?” Copetas told me when I asked about that moment. “I will plead the Fifth Amendment on that. Although I will say I did hold up a New York Times.”

Later that same day, Dec. 10, 1977, Copetas and Thompson headed over to the big NORML Christmas party. The 600 attendees who had crammed themselves into a D.C. town house that evening were typical Washington creatures: political staffers, journalists, do-gooder nonprofit types. That night, they saw a rock band and strobe lights and a juggler and silver trays full of caviar and joints. They saw Keith Stroup, Mr. Marijuana, presiding over it all. Then they saw Peter Bourne, the White House drug czar, walk through the front door.

Bourne got a hero’s welcome—hugs and handshakes from marijuana lovers who appreciated everything he’d done for their cause. For Stroup, Bourne was his guy on the inside, and it was important to keep him happy. So he paid close attention when a friend passed along a message. Those words, in Stroup’s memory: “Peter says he wouldn’t mind doing a line of coke.”

“My first reaction was: ‘What? Did I hear—did I hear you right?’ ” Stroup said. His second reaction was to go looking for cocaine. The way Stroup tells it, he tracked down some coke, then asked Bourne to go upstairs to a private room.

“Everyone in the house could see who was going up that stair. It was like a stage,” Copetas told me. Stroup said, “It was kind of almost incriminating to be seen walking up there.”

Copetas declined to tell me exactly what happened next, “because that was a private interlude as far as I’m concerned and always will be.” But Stroup didn’t hold back. He said, “We sat around and all did a few lines of coke and then, OK, better get back down and say hello to some more people. And Peter said, ‘Yeah, I need to get going too.’ And we left.”

Copetas did say this, about the aftermath of that get-together: “After I went back to sit down, Hunter looked at me and said, ‘Jesus Christ, Craig, we’re all going to be indicted now.’ ”

But Stroup was more excited than paranoid. “Shit, snorting a line with the president’s drug czar?” he said. “This is not a bad thing in that it means that we have some secrets we’re now sharing. We have some intimate moments that we haven’t had before.”

Word spread quickly inside the town house: Peter Bourne, the drug czar, had done cocaine.

When I asked Bourne what he remembered about the party, he said “very little”—that it was “just sort of the usual crowd, the strong Carter supporters.”

He denied asking for cocaine that night. He told me that claim was “so untrue.”

“I may have been stupid enough to go to the party, but I had no interest in doing cocaine,” he said. “I would have gone somewhere else if I had wanted to do that. There may have been cocaine there at some point, but I was not a participant.”

I asked Bourne if he used cocaine at all, outside the party.

His answer: “I’ve never used cocaine. Have I? I don’t think so. Because I was very careful never to use marijuana or go anywhere where I would smoke marijuana. So, you know, being that cautious, I don’t know why in the world I would use cocaine.”

The NORML Christmas party ended around 4 a.m., with something like a dozen people passed out around the town house. The political staffers, the journalists, and the do-gooder nonprofit types all went back home, and back to work. For the next few months, life in Washington carried on as usual. And then, very suddenly, everything blew up.

The undoing of Peter Bourne began on a Friday afternoon in July 1978, when a young woman came to him and said she was having trouble sleeping. She asked Bourne if he could write her a prescription for sleeping pills.

That woman worked for Bourne at the White House. And he could prescribe her medication since he was a licensed doctor. So that day he wrote her a prescription for Quaaludes.

Quaaludes were extremely popular in the ’70s, as sleeping pills but also as an aphrodisiac. Bourne told the woman that he’d give her a pseudonym for the Quaalude prescription so it wouldn’t show up if she ever tried to get a security clearance. “It’s a regular practice if you have somebody who wants to keep their use of drugs confidential,” he told me.

The woman, Bourne’s aide, asked a friend to pick up her prescription. When that friend went to the drugstore, a pharmacy inspector happened to be there, doing routine rounds. The woman’s friend got arrested for “attempting to obtain a controlled substance by the use of a false name.” And when it came out that the drug czar’s name was on the prescription, the story was all over the national news.

Bourne thought it would eventually blow over. But the day after the Quaalude story came out, investigative reporter Jack Anderson went on ABC’s Good Morning America to deliver some new information: Three witnesses had seen the drug czar, Peter Bourne, snort cocaine at the NORML Christmas party.

Anderson’s report didn’t name any of the three witnesses, but it did say they had “provided complete and convincing details.”

“Like an idiot,” Stroup told me, “I somehow managed to take what was a confined scandal and find a way to put myself in the middle of it.”

Why did Stroup tell a reporter that Bourne had done coke? Bourne was the best ally he’d ever had. Together, they’d been spreading the gospel of decriminalization across the country.

But Stroup had become convinced that American marijuana smokers were in danger of being killed. And he thought the Carter administration, and Bourne, was complicit.

The issue was an herbicide called paraquat. The Mexican government was spraying paraquat on poppy and marijuana fields, using helicopters provided by the United States. And so, the theory went, anyone who smoked pot imported from Mexico might be inhaling paraquat. “I remember at the time there were articles saying that even a teaspoon of paraquat on your tongue and you’d have an agonizing death. It’s that strong,” Stroup said.

Stroup told Bourne that all this needed to stop—that marijuana smokers were in grave danger. But Bourne didn’t buy it.

“I thought it was all bullshit,” he said. “We paid thousands of dollars to have it analyzed. … I mean, the paraquat thing was totally scientifically wrong.”

There’s not much clear evidence that paraquat ever harmed American marijuana smokers. But the chemical is extremely toxic, and Stroup was disgusted that Bourne thought that was no big deal.

Stroup and Bourne had found common ground on decriminalization. But they were now on opposite sides of what Stroup considered an existential issue. Stroup had been able to look past that tension in 1977. But in the first few months of 1978, he began to view Bourne’s actions as unforgivable. “At that point, it was like, Jesus Christ, Peter, if you’re going to play life and death, don’t forget, I got something over here too.”

The something that Stroup had was his story about the NORML Christmas party. A bunch of reporters had seen Bourne at the party, and plenty of them had heard whispers about the drug czar doing coke. One of those journalists worked for Anderson. In the weeks after the party, that reporter pestered Stroup to confirm the cocaine rumors.

Stroup initially refused, but now he changed his mind. He was ready to talk. And he gave up the names of two other witnesses.

He said that all of this was off the record—for now. But five months later, after the Quaalude news broke, Stroup gave his blessing for the cocaine story to get aired, so long as his name was not attached. On July 21, 1978, on Good Morning America, the bomb Stroup planted finally went off.

When the news broke, Bourne told his colleagues at the White House that he’d seen cocaine at the party but that he hadn’t used it. That explanation was not enough to save the drug czar’s job. At a news conference, Jimmy Carter announced, “Dr. Peter Bourne, out of consideration for my administration, has submitted his resignation this afternoon, which I have accepted with regret.”

Bourne didn’t leave the White House quietly. After he resigned, he told the New York Times that marijuana use was commonplace at the White House. He also said that “a few” of his colleagues did cocaine. A couple of days later, Carter sent a memo to the White House staff. “I expect [everyone] to obey the law,” the president said. “You will obey it, or you will seek employment elsewhere.”

Stroup hadn’t been named in the Good Morning America story that took down Bourne. But he did give a quote to the Washington Post and basically outed himself as the original source.

After that, Stroup got out of town, going to Las Vegas to hang out with his friend Willie Nelson and clear his head. “By the time I got back to D.C., I realized two things,” he said. “That Peter had ended up being hurt more than he deserved, and … that my career with NORML almost certainly was coming to an end.”

Stroup had severed his connection to the White House, and he’d done it recklessly: “Any idiot should have recognized that even if I felt threatened about paraquat spraying or even if I was angry about something else, that didn’t justify destroying that point of access to power.”

The founder of NORML had also violated the drug user’s code: You don’t snort and tell. Stroup issued an apology, but too much damage had been done. In December 1978, at NORML’s annual conference, he delivered his farewell speech as the group’s executive director. A year earlier, that conference had been a nonstop celebration, and Stroup and Bourne had seemed indestructible. Now they’d both been disgraced, and their downfall had profound consequences for the pro-marijuana movement they’d been working to build.

Before the Bourne scandal, a relaxed approach to marijuana had fit in perfectly with the Carter administration’s priorities. Afterward, the White House pulled back from anything that might be perceived as soft on drugs. Bourne’s successor as drug czar declared that both he and the president “adamantly oppose the use of marijuana, period.”

For the parent activists from Atlanta, Bourne’s ouster was the opening they needed. In the early days of the Carter administration, Marsha Keith Schuchard had gotten iced out. Now she scored an invitation to the newly anti-marijuana White House, where she made her pitch about how weed was damaging kids.

In 1979 the National Institute on Drug Abuse published a booklet researched and written by Schuchard. It was called Parents, Peers, and Pot. It told the story of her daughter’s smoke-filled 13th birthday party, and everything that came after. The booklet was full of alarming claims, including that marijuana might cause enlarged breasts in adolescent boys. Government scientists found Schuchard’s prose hyperbolic, but the public ate it up. “After a million copies were ordered, they stopped printing it because they said we have too many orders,” Schuchard said.

When Ronald and Nancy Reagan moved into the White House in 1981, the parent activists became even more influential. Schuchard said that when she told Nancy Reagan she was a liberal, the first lady responded that it was a nonpartisan movement and they were all in this together. “I had to give her credit for that,” Schuchard said.

Marijuana usage peaked in America in 1979, then fell in every age category in the 1980s. Decriminalization stopped cold. A few months before Bourne had resigned as the White House drug czar, Nebraska became the 11th state to decriminalize marijuana. No other states followed suit in the next two decades.

Peter Bourne is 86 now. When we spoke a few years ago, he was splitting his time between northern Virginia and a farm in Wales, where he and his wife were raising llamas. When I asked him if he’d been the most progressive drug czar of all time, he said, “Yes, by far.”

Seventeen years after Keith Stroup resigned, he got rehired as NORML’s executive director. He’s now the group’s legal counsel. In his early 80s, Stroup finally sees the world he’d always imagined beginning to take shape. In Virginia, where he lives, it’s legal for adults 21 and older to possess, consume, and grow small amounts of marijuana. At the end of our interview, he invited me to come over and light one up sometime.

Stroup has said that ratting out Peter Bourne was the “stupidest decision” he ever made. He said the most recent time they ran into each other was more than 10 years ago, at a cocktail party. While they did stop and chat for a minute, “neither of us tried to make a move to say, You want to get a beer sometime?” Stroup told me. “I think we both recognized that we had passed that point of no return a long time ago.”

When I asked Bourne how much he blamed Stroup for his downfall, he stopped to consider the question for a brief moment. Then he answered: “I suppose, quite a lot.”

Bourne told me that back in the 1970s, he hadn’t understood what Stroup was doing—why he’d been so outraged, paranoid, and hell-bent on destroying what had been a productive partnership. But now, he said, he thinks he gets what was going on. “I don’t think I’m betraying confidences, but what I was unaware of then was that he had a serious cocaine problem,” he said. “I can see that he wasn’t wielding good judgment.”

“I don’t doubt that cocaine had something to do with it, sure,” Stroup told me. “You get very ragged when you’re doing cocaine. You get irritable, sometimes you get angry [about] things that wouldn’t make you angry otherwise. The cocaine use was not helpful. I don’t think I can use it as an excuse, but it probably did cause my responses to be exaggerated at times.”

Stroup and Bourne will never agree about what happened in that private room at the NORML Christmas party. But here, there’s something approaching consensus: Mr. Marijuana dropped a dime on the drug czar for doing cocaine because he himself was doing too much cocaine. And that is how the pro-pot movement of the 1970s went up in smoke.

            <h2>Garmin autopilot lands small aircraft without human assistance</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/24/autocomms/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In what looks to be the first successful use of Garmin&#39;s Autoland product outside of testing, the FAA has confirmed a small plane made a safe emergency landing completely guided by automation at Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport in Colorado.

Garmin&#39;s Emergency Autoland system is built to automatically take &quot;complete control of the flight to land the airplane in an emergency where the pilot is unable to fly.&quot; It can also be activated at the press of a button.

After initial reports speculated that the pilot or pilots may have been incapacitated after the plane, a Beechcraft Super King Air, had pressurization problems, the plane operator assured the public that triggering autoland was a deliberate act by the pilots. No passengers were on board on the flight, which according to the tail number given to the ATC, landed at Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport on Saturday afternoon, after flying in from Aspen/Pitkin County Airport, also known as Sardy Field, a small mountain airport measuring just 573 acres.

The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed in a statement that the &quot;Beechcraft Super King Air landed safely at Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport in Colorado around 14:20 local time on Saturday, December 20, after the pilot lost communication with air traffic control.&quot; The FAA added: &quot;An onboard emergency autoland system was activated. Two people were on board. The FAA is investigating.&quot;

While the aircraft did experience &quot;a rapid, uncommanded loss of pressurization,&quot; the pilots put on their oxygen masks, the CEO of the charter company, Chris Townsley, said in a statement to CNN. Townsley reiterated that the pilots had &quot;made the decision to leave the system engaged,&quot; and &quot;automatically engaged exactly as designed when the cabin altitude exceeded the prescribed safe levels.&quot;

The Reg has asked the company for further comment.

The Beechcraft Super King Air is a twin-engine turboprop popular among charter companies and militaries, with a particular ability to easily navigate short runways. It has a T-tail design, which gives it some physical advantages as it keeps the tailplane out of engine exhaust and wing wake, making for cleaner airflow. The model that landed at the Broomfield, Colorado&#39;s Rocky Mountain airport was a B200, which seats seven to nine passengers plus two crew members. It is certified for single-pilot operation, but charter companies often use two pilots for extra safety.

Garmin&#39;s autonomous emergency landing system&#39;s automated warning actually states &quot;pilot incapacitation,&quot; hence the confusion over the occupants&#39; condition. In the air traffic control audio heard via the LiveATC site which hosts comms recorded by aviation and flight sim fans, a robotic voice can be heard stating: &quot;N479BR, pilot incapacitation. 2 miles south of KBJC. Emergency autolanding, 19 minutes from runway 30R at KBJC.&quot; In the audio, the controller is heard responding to the automated voice, saying: &quot;I don&#39;t know if you can hear me but cleared to land.&quot;

The CEO told outlets, &quot;reports of pilot incapacitation are incorrect and result solely from the Garmin emergency system&#39;s automated communication and reporting functions.&quot;

A video released by the local fire rescue department, North Metro Fire Rescue District, shows the pair climbing out onto the tarmac.

The Register has reached out to Garmin, which has released statements saying: &quot;This was the first use of Autoland from start-to-finish in an actual emergency.&quot;

Autoland was released in 2019, and according to the website, the system decides on where to land the plane based on what&#39;s &quot;most optimal&quot; for a successful landing, &quot;considering runway length, distance, fuel range and other factors.&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">The US says it has shut down a platform used by cybercriminals to break into Americans&#39; bank accounts.

A law enforcement splash page now appears when trying to reach web3adspanels.org, which supported SEO poisoning campaigns designed to steal people&#39;s bank account credentials.

Criminals would pay for prime slots in search engine results, serving users seemingly legitimate banking websites that were actually fakes. From there, unwitting users entered their passwords, which were dumped into a database, but they would never reach their account.

The Justice Department described the role of web3adspanels.org as a platform on which criminals would store and manipulate these credentials, which they would then use in attempts to access bank accounts and authorize illegal transfers.

According to the affidavit, the FBI is aware of at least 19 victims, including two companies, across the US that have succumbed to this specific scheme, which represents just a small operation in the wider account takeover problem.

Prosecutors tied $28 million worth of attempted illegal transfers to web3adspanels, with the total of actual losses estimated at $14.6 million.

However, law enforcement agencies have received more than 5,100 of these kinds of complaints since the start of the year, with total reported losses of more than $262 million, according to the FBI&#39;s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3).

In making its announcement, the Justice Department did not offer details about how the criminals bypassed the more stringent security controls such as multi-factor authentiction (MFA) when illegally accessing the accounts. Nor did the IC3 when it released an advisory on the matter last month.

The same campaigns are often conducted using social engineering tactics instead of basic phishing. Criminals convince victims into handing over their credentials and, crucially, their MFA or one-time passcodes to access their accounts.

Once inside, the playbook typically sees the cybercrooks transferring funds to accounts they legitimately control, which then use the money to purchase cryptocurrencies, making it more difficult to track across different blockchains.

Social engineers often also change the victims&#39; bank account passwords, locking them out, the FBI said.

Losses associated with e-crime have risen consistently since 2020, according to IC3 figures [PDF], with cyber-enabled fraud accounting for 83 percent of the total $16.6 billion in 2024. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Waymo says it is rolling out updates to its US fleet to counter future disruption caused by power outages like the one that hit San Francisco last week.

The robotaxi biz was a focal point of the power outages at Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), with videos circulating online of its self-driving cars plonked in the middle of the city&#39;s busy roads, unresponsive due to traffic signal failures.

The company responded by saying its fleet is programmed to treat disabled signals as four-way stops, but &quot;the scale of the outage and the sheer number of disabled traffic lights&quot; led to cases where its cars remained stationary for longer than usual.

Videos showed Waymo cabs lined up in streets with their hazard lights blaring, as human-controlled cars carefully navigated around the congestion.

In announcing the fleet tweaks, the Alphabet-owned company said its cars successfully navigated more than 7,000 dark traffic signals on Saturday, December 20.

It said that, in cases where its cars have to decide how to proceed through a dark intersection, it may send an additional request back to Waymo HQ for confirmation that its decision is the correct one. The scale of the outage prompted a spike in these requests, which created a backlog that, in turn, led to delays.

The updates being rolled out now include those that Waymo said would improve its cars&#39; decisiveness when navigating dark intersections by sending additional context around regional outages.

&quot;We established these confirmation protocols out of an abundance of caution during our early deployment, and we are now refining them to match our current scale,&quot; it stated.

&quot;While this strategy was effective during smaller outages, we are now implementing fleet-wide updates that provide the Driver with specific power outage context, allowing it to navigate more decisively.&quot;

Waymo also said it would be improving its incident preparedness and response capabilities following the PG&E outage, working with San Francisco mayor Daniel Lurie&#39;s office in doing so, and promised to expand its first-responder training program.

&quot;We live and work in San Francisco, and we are grateful to the city&#39;s first responders for their tireless work, and to mayor Lurie for his leadership,&quot; it said.

The outage at PG&E, caused by a fire at a substation, affected well over 100,000 customers, according to its own updates, and its services were only restored fully on Tuesday.

Outages persist across the city at the time of writing, according to the G&E outage center, but these are being attributed to heavy storms hitting northern and central California and the damage they are causing, not the substation issues that led to traffic chaos over the weekend.

Global internet service provider Hurricane Electric confirmed a power issue at its Fremont facility last night, although it noted that its network remained &quot;mostly functioning without issue.&quot; In its latest update at 2043 UTC last night, it said power had been &quot;restored, and we are working to restore affected systems. Our email and phones now are back working.&quot;

The power company has warned customers never to touch or try to move downed wires, and to assume any downed power line is energized and extremely dangerous. Locals should keep kids and animals clear and report downed power lines immediately by calling 9-1-1 and then PG&E at 1-800-743-5002, it added. ®

            <div id="article-text">Microsoft&#39;s latest line of festive knitwear has been frightening babies, if the experience of the winner of The Register&#39;s 2025 Christmas competition is anything to go by.

The winner wearing their lovely Windows jumper - click to enlarge

Register reader Wolfetone won the garment earlier this month with his suggestion that peak Microsoft occurred with the advent of its demented paperclip-based assistant, often referred to as &quot;Clippy.&quot; The fact that Wolfetone promised to wear it for the arrival of his second child sealed the deal as far as we were concerned.

However, unlike a normal Microsoft software release, the spawn of Wolfetone arrived ahead of schedule and, despite our reader professing delight at wearing &quot;the second worst thing&quot; in their wardrobe, the new arrival appears less than amused.

&quot;He seems to start crying when I attempt to hold him while wearing the jumper,&quot; Wolfetone told us. &quot;Make of that what you will.&quot;

We&#39;re not sure what is alarming the little tike most. The MS-DOS logo evokes a simpler, more soothing time (today&#39;s registry hacks make the battles involving autoexec.bat and config.sys seem a walk in the park by comparison). The MSN butterfly logo is charming, although the sight of Internet Explorer is enough to make any grown woman or man cry, let alone an innocent child.

More likely, it is the unblinking gaze of Clippy, whose eyes are portals into a future underpinned by Copilot. Gazing into that particular future is sure to set off the waterworks.

Still, we are delighted to see Microsoft&#39;s Artifact Sweater being put to good use and hope that Wolfetone Junior&#39;s aversion to the knitwear nightmare is short-lived. Alternatively, there is always the possibility that the poppet might do unto the garment what Microsoft does to its users&#39; devices on a regular basis.

Sadly, however, one cannot simply pop a PC into the wash to undo whatever emissions have been expelled from Redmond this time around. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Feature Every company today is doing AI. From boardrooms to marketing campaigns, companies proudly showcase new generative AI pilots and chatbot integrations. Enterprise investments in GenAI are growing to about $30-40 billion, yet research indicates 95 percent of organizations report zero measurable returns on these efforts.

In fact, only about 5 percent of custom AI initiatives ever make it from pilot into widespread production, according to a widely shared report over the summer from MIT. This is the paradox of the current AI boom. Adoption is high, hype is higher, but meaningful business impact remains elusive. AI is everywhere except on the bottom line.

Why this disconnect? It&#39;s not that AI technology suddenly hit a wall. The models are more powerful than ever. The problem is how companies are using AI, not what AI can or cannot do. Organizations have treated AI like just another software deployment, expecting a plug-and-play solution. But AI behaves less like software and more like a new form of labor, one that requires training, context, and workflow integration.

The GenAI divide is between companies that install AI tools and those that build the capability to use them. Many enterprises are on the wrong side of this divide, convinced that buying an AI tool is equivalent to having an AI solution.

At the same time, employees often get more value from shadow AI than officially sanctioned AI projects. Businesses are deploying plenty of AI, but only a handful have figured out how to extract real value from it.

Simply bolting AI onto old processes doesn&#39;t work. Yet that&#39;s what most companies do. They treat AI as a plug-in to existing workflows that were never designed for predictive or adaptive tools. The result is that pilot projects abound, but they die on the vine. In fact, companies on average run tens of AI experiments, but few ever make it past the proof-of-concept stage.

MIT research shows that the vast majority of the pilots were executed in isolation, without rethinking how the work itself should change.

An AI agent might generate accurate outputs in a demo, but in the real world, it breaks the moment it encounters an edge case or an outdated procedure. Enterprises need to note that if they don&#39;t redesign the workflow around the AI – for example, to catch its errors, use its predictions, and complement its strengths – the AI will remain a science experiment rather than a production tool.

Another issue stems from the AI model data and context. When AI pilots fail, executives blame the technology. But research found a deeper problem: the AI tools didn&#39;t learn. They couldn&#39;t retain context or improve over time. In simple terms, the AI was intelligent but suffered from amnesia after every interaction. This is the illusion many firms fall into. They think they have a smart system, but what they really have is a stateless algorithm that never improves.

Companies keep focusing on better models or more training data, but what they need is AI that accumulates context like an employee. It could be learning company terminology, remembering past decisions, and getting better with each task. Lacking this, even a state-of-the-art model will disappoint in practice.

The standout successes did something different. They brought in people who understood processes, not just models, employing or contracting out to process designers, workflow architects, and domain experts who could translate AI capabilities into day-to-day operations.

The MIT study found that companies trying to build everything in-house had much lower success rates. Internal AI projects succeeded only about a third of the time, whereas collaborations with external partners, who often bring in domain-specific solutions, doubled the chances of success.

Another striking pattern with many successful deployments was a bottom-up approach. They often began with employees on the front lines tinkering with AI to solve real problems. When these experiments showed promise, management then supported them and scaled them up. This meant that AI was solving a felt need, rather than a top-down mandated solution in search of a problem.

The bottom line is that the 5 percent focus on capability, not just tech. They align projects to real business goals, partner for domain expertise, and continuously adapt.

Another contrarian finding here is that the real ROI from AI isn&#39;t coming from the shiny, customer-facing projects everyone talks about. It&#39;s in the back office, in the &quot;boring&quot; stuff companies often overlook.

There is a massive investment bias that plagues many enterprises, with considerable AI budgets allocated to marketing and sales because those initiatives are visible and excite executives. Yet ironically, the biggest payoffs were being realized in corners like operations, finance, and supply chain.

In fact, some of the most significant cost savings come from automating back-office workflows, such as invoice processing, compliance monitoring, and report generation. One reason is low-hanging fruit, as many back-office processes involve manual drudgery or are outsourced to BPO firms, so an AI that can handle those tasks yields immediate savings.

So why do companies keep throwing money at AI for sales, marketing, and customer chatbots instead? It&#39;s a case of visibility over value. Front-office projects have easily observable metrics, which make for great headlines and happy board members. On the other hand, the back-office improvements often go unnoticed outside of CFO circles.

In the end, the story of AI in 2025 is a mirror to every major technology upheaval we&#39;ve seen. Technology alone changes nothing unless organizations shift too. The grand irony is that we have powerful AI models at our fingertips, yet most businesses are stuck in pilot purgatory, scratching their heads at the lack of ROI.

The evidence is clear that this isn&#39;t a tech failure. It&#39;s a management failure. The divide between the AI winners and laggards is not driven by model quality or regulation, but by approach. AI won&#39;t transform business until the enterprise is willing to transform itself. That is the crux of the paradox, and the challenge that forward-looking leaders must answer. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Seventy years ago, a child phoned the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) looking for Santa Claus – and found him, or at least some kindly military personnel who were willing to play along by helping the youngster to track Santa&#39;s location as he zipped around the globe.

NORAD, then known as the Continental Air Defense Command (CONAD), took calls from children near its Colorado Springs headquarters by mistake.

According to NORAD commander General Gregory Guillot, the 70-year-old tradition of NORAD tracking Santa Claus&#39; journey around the world on Christmas Eve began in 1955 with a newspaper misprint.

As the story goes, a Sears Roebuck ad included a phone number for children to call, but that number was wrong. Instead of reaching the retailer’s Christmas line, it included the unlisted number for NORAD command.

When the first child called, Colonel Harry Shoup reportedly decided to roll with the unexpected Christmas Eve surprise and told staff to check NORAD radar systems for Santa&#39;s location. He offered the same response to other young callers throughout the night.

Now in its 70th year, NORAD has upheld the tradition yearly ever since, describing itself on its Santa Tracker website as &quot;the only organization that has the technology, the qualifications, and the people to do it.&quot;

When NORAD isn&#39;t tracking Santa, it handles aerospace warning and control for defense of the US and Canada, including warnings about unknown objects – like flying sleighs – plus potentially threatening missiles and aircraft.

&quot;NORAD has successfully tracked Santa since 1955 using three tools we use every day in defense of North America,&quot; an agency spokesperson told The Register. &quot;A network of ground-based radars called the North Warning System, infrared sensors on satellites more than 22,000 miles above the Earth, and, of course, our NORAD fighter jets comprised of U.S. F-16s, F-15s, F-22s and F-35s, and Canadian CF-18s.&quot;

NORAD told us that it doesn&#39;t have any advance knowledge of Santa&#39;s planned route, as he doesn&#39;t share that information with the US government, but they do know that he tends to follow a typical Christmas Eve agenda.

&quot;He typically takes off from the North Pole at around 4:00 AM Mountain Time (6:00 AM Eastern Time) and heads west across the international dateline,&quot; NORAD explained - Santa has to start where it&#39;s later on Christmas Eve, after all. &quot;He then zig-zags north and south as he delivers presents around the world.&quot;

NORAD explains that Santa typically arrives at homes to drop off gifts between 9:00 PM and midnight, local time, which is why General Guillot recommends children be in bed by 8:00 PM on Christmas Eve to avoid Santa skipping their home and having to backtrack later on. He does do that, according to NORAD&#39;s tracking data.

Given Santa may have OPSEC reasons for not wanting to be tracked so thoroughly, we asked the experts at NORAD why he doesn&#39;t upgrade his sleigh to make it harder to detect, which they said they can&#39;t explain.

&quot;Even with the highest security clearances of some personnel here at NORAD, we aren&#39;t privy to upgrades Santa may be making to his sleigh for his magical journey,&quot; a NORAD spokesperson told us - all they know is that they continue to be able to track him every year.

Santa moves fast, and while it may have been easy for NORAD staff to track him on their own and respond to calls from kids back when the tradition was new, the Santa tracking operation received over 380,000 calls last year. With Santa tracking now an international tradition, it&#39;s become a pretty big deal that needs more people than the US and Canadian militaries can drum up.

&quot;More than 1,000 volunteers – military and civilian members of NORAD and U.S. Northern Command, plus family and local community members – begin answering phone calls from around the world at 4:00 AM, when Santa leaves the North Pole,&quot; NORAD told us.

For those interested in volunteering, sorry, but you need to be a Peterson Space Force Base local in order to participate: NORAD doesn&#39;t farm out the work to remote volunteers.

Those who want to reach out to NORAD to learn where Santa is can call the volunteers at +1-877-446-6723 from 4:00 AM Mountain Time until midnight on Christmas Eve, and can also call directly from the Santa Tracker website, which will also host a visual Santa tracker once he lifts off on Wednesday morning for NORAD&#39;s 70th year of tracking the progress of the jolly man in red as he hauls Christmas gifts around the world. ®

The discount might not be big enough to warrant the upgrade, but we’ll let you make that call.

Sony’s full suite of PlayStation 5 consoles jumped in price in August due to increased US tariffs, but now through Christmas, you can save $100 on several models. This discount is especially great if you planned to go big with Sony’s PS5 Pro, the company’s priciest, most powerful console yet. Normally $749.99, you can currently grab one at Amazon, Walmart, and Target for around $689.99. Sony’s PlayStation Direct storefront indicates that the PS5 Pro sale ends on December 25th at 3AM ET, although discounts may remain on cheaper models.

The PS5 Pro plays many games at their best resolution, while making far fewer concessions than the standard PS5 when it comes to visual effects (particularly ray tracing and shadow quality). Some games simply look better or run faster on the Pro than the base-model PS5, while others look better and run faster. That said, it’s worth noting that PS5 Pro lacks a disc drive and is thus limited to digital titles, though you can buy an optional drive for $80 if you want to attach one later.

The PlayStation 5 Pro has a bigger GPU than any other PS5 model, with twice as much internal storage as the current slim models (2TB versus 1TB). Another notable feature exclusive to the Pro is PSSR (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution), which uses AI to upscale graphics in supported games to produce a better-looking image. The difference in performance between the Pro and the base PS5 is easy to notice in several games, although it’s safe to say that there hasn’t yet been a title that makes upgrading to one a no-brainer. But if a lower price is all the encouragement you needed to upgrade, now is a good time to get one.

            <div id="article-text">From the end of Stranger Things and Squid Game to the surprise hit KPop Demon Hunters.

From the end of Stranger Things and Squid Game to the surprise hit KPop Demon Hunters.

Netflix has had an interesting year. Its ad tier, introduced last year, has grown significantly, and its live TV initiative has expanded to include not only weird one-offs like hot-dog-eating grudge matches but also WWE programming. Taking KPop Demon Hunters off Sony’s hands for the business equivalent of $200 in a potato chip bag also turned out to be a pretty smart move for Netflix. The animated feature about, well, demon-hunting K-pop stars, became the most watched movie in the platform’s history and a global cultural phenomenon in its own right. The sing-along theatrical release sold out, songs from the movie sat comfortably at the top of music charts for weeks, and we got Huntr/x in Fortnite and the Macy’s Thanksgiving Parade mere months after the movie’s release.

But KPop Demon Hunters wasn’t the streamer’s only quality offering this year. Here’s a list of Netflix’s best of 2025.

There are two life lessons to take away from this documentary: Don’t be a horrific abuser and never piss off a self-described petty man with cash to burn. This four-part docuseries, directed by Alex Stapleton and produced by Lifetime Achievement Fellow in the Hater Hall of Fame Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson, chronicles the rise of Sean “P Diddy” Combs from music video character actor, to hip-hop business mogul, to convicted criminal.

The documentary features new interviews from former associates, employees, and friends who allege everything from cheating business partners out of their share to having knowledge of if not outright arranging the hit that took Tupac Shakur’s life. This is not a “fun” watch, so heed the content warnings, but if you want a succinct accounting of where Combs came from and how the business of hip-hop can turn men into monsters, this is an informative overview.

There is vanishingly little I can say about KPop Demon Hunters’ brilliance that hasn’t already been said. So I’ll let what has been said speak for it:

Rian Johnson’s Knives Out series has once again delivered a sharply funny, intensely moving whodunit. Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc drips southern charm, aided by an ensemble cast featuring Josh Brolin as a fiery Catholic priest and Glenn Close as his secretary. Josh O’Connor delivers some beautiful moments as a junior priest struggling to find meaning in his faith, creating interesting tension against Blanc’s cold, grim logic. With them working together, Wake Up Dead Man becomes a fun story that examines the purpose faith can have in our lives.

One thing director Guillermo del Toro is gonna do is make a luxurious, sumptuous-ass movie with over-the-top sets and costuming. But Frankenstein is not just a visual delight. Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as his monster give incredible performances that are both grounded in the movie’s late Victorian aesthetic while resonating with the stories of today. A quote unquote learned man irresponsibly using technology to create something he doesn’t understand and in his arrogance tries to control that winds up destroying his life and others? It’s not that Frankenstein is any one allegory for today, it has multiple applications.

And while we have numerous Frankenstein adaptations, there’s nothing quite like watching GDT do it. You just know that man is gonna grab all the production designers, make-up artists, and costumers, give them some cash, and say essentially “Cook,” and damn if they didn’t do exactly that.

I live for The Great British Baking Show (known as The Great British Bake Off outside the US). When the sun starts setting at 4:30PM and seasonal affect starts disordering my life, I’m okay because I know that means it’s Baking Show season. This year, the show has done some interesting things with the format, trying new variations on the show’s technical challenge where bakers are tasked with making something with stripped-down directions. I wish the challenges weren’t so overly focused on sweets, but it’s always fun learning the absolutely bonkers names the Brits have for their pastries. There is no way in a logical world that an oatmeal bar like this should be called a flapjack — it doesn’t even flap! Honestly, yelling about how British English is Wrong is just as much fun as watching the amateur bakers themselves.

The first half of the final season of Stranger Things is out, and while we can quibble about whether or not it’s quality television, it is good for one specific reason: it is finally ending. The show started off really strong, telling a fun tale about kids saving the world from the adults that are trying to ruin it. But that kind of storytelling got lost in the near decade between the first season and now — even though the Duffer Brothers want us to believe that it’s only been four years since Will first went to the Upside Down. It’s okay that stories end, and I’m glad we’ve got the opportunity to end this show on a high note by returning focus to what made it so great in the first place — them meddling kids.

Squid Game is another one of Netflix’s tentpole hits that has come to an end this year. Gi-hun / Player 456 (Lee Jung-jae) has returned to Mr. Beast’s Murder Island to expose the organizers of the deadly games once and for all. He’s befriended another crop of desperate people willing to do whatever for life-changing amounts of cash and just like in the first two seasons it’s brutal to watch the games destroy them one by one.

Clocking in at just under 200 days, James Garfield has the second shortest term of a US president, and I was genuinely enthralled watching Death By Lightning chart his rise to the office and tragic fall via an assassin’s bullet. As with Frankenstein, Netflix is once again on time with a metaphor appropriate for current events. Death By Lightning takes a look at how incendiary political discourse, like the kind fomented against Garfield by his own party, can lead to violence.

But more than the prescient political commentary, the performances make this show. Michael Shannon imbues Garfield with a salt-of-the-earth quality that makes you root hard for him. Shea Whigham has entered his character actor villain era playing New York Senator Roscoe Conkling, and Matthew “Mr. Darcy / Tom Wambsgans” Macfadyen gives a heartbreaking performance playing Garfield’s assassin Charles Guiteau.

The show’s best moments come from Nick Offerman as Garfield’s reluctant vice president, Chester A. Arthur. Offerman as Arthur is regency-era Ron Swanson. Throughout most of the show’s four episodes, Offerman is either drunk, fighting, raving about sausages, or a combination of all three. That man is having a blast chewing the scenery in a top hat and mutton chops, and I would genuinely watch a whole White House sitcom with him as the star.

            <div id="article-text">Gen-AI showed up in the year’s biggest releases including game of the year.

Gen-AI showed up in the year’s biggest releases including game of the year.

2025 was the year generative AI made its presence felt in the video game industry. Its use has been discovered in some of the most popular games of the year, and CEOs from some of the largest game studios claim it’s being implemented everywhere in the industry including in their own development processes. Meanwhile, rank-and-file developers, especially in the indie games space, are pushing back against its encroachment, coming up with ways to signal their games are gen-AI free.

Generative AI has largely replaced NFTs as the buzzy trend publishers are chasing. Its proponents claim that the technology will be a great democratization force in video game development, as gen AI’s ability to amalgamate images, text, audio, and video could shorten development times and shrink budgets — ameliorating two major problems plaguing the industry right now. In service to that idea, numerous video game studios have announced partnerships with gen-AI companies.

Ubisoft has technology that can generate short snippets of dialogue called barks and has gen-AI powered NPCs that players can have conversations with. EA has partnered with Stability AI, Microsoft is using AI to analyze and generate gameplay. Outside of official partnerships, major game companies like Nexon, Krafton, and Square Enix are vocally embracing gen AI.

As a result, gen AI is starting to show up in games in a big way. Up until this point, gen AI in gaming had been mostly relegated to fringe cases — either prototypes or small, low-quality games that generally get lost in the tens of thousands of titles released on Steam each year. But now, gen AI is cropping up in the year’s biggest releases. ARC Raiders, one of the breakout multiplayer shooter hits of the year, used gen AI for character dialogue. Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 used gen-AI images. Even 2025’s TGA Game of the Year, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, featured gen-AI images before they were quietly removed.

Reaction to this encroachment from both players and developers has been mixed. It seems like generally, players don’t like gen AI showing up in games. When gen-AI assets were discovered in Anno 117: Pax Romana, the game’s developer Ubisoft claimed the assets “slipped through” review and they were subsequently replaced. When gen-AI assets were found in Black Ops 7, however, Activision acknowledged the issue, but kept the images in the game. Critical response has also been lopsided. ARC Raiders was awarded low scores with reviewers specifically citing the use of gen AI as the reason. Clair Obscur, though, was nigh universally praised and its use of gen AI, however temporary, has barely been mentioned.

It seems like developers are sensitive to the public’s distaste for gen AI but are unwilling to commit to not using it. After gen-AI assets were discovered in Black Ops 7, Activision said it uses the tech to “empower” its developers, not replace them. When asked about gen AI showing up in Battlefield 6, EA VP Rebecka Coutaz called the technology seductive but affirmed it wouldn’t appear in the final product. Swen Vincke, CEO of Baldur’s Gate 3 developer Larian, said gen AI is being used for the studio’s next game Divinity but only for generating concepts and ideas. Everything in the finished game, he claimed, would be made by humans. He also hinted at why game makers insist on using the tech despite the backlash developers usually receive whenever it’s found.

“This is a tech-driven industry, so you try stuff,” he told Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier in an interview. “You can’t afford not to try things because if somebody finds the golden egg and you’re not using it, you’re dead.”

Comments from other CEOs reinforce Vincke’s point. Junghun Lee, the CEO of ARC Raiders’ parent company Nexon, said in an interview that, “It’s important to assume that every game company is now using AI.”

The problem is, though, gen AI doesn’t yet seem to be the golden egg its supporters want people to believe it is. Last year, Keywords Studios, a game development services company, published a report on creating a 2D video game using only gen-AI tools. The company claimed that gen-AI tools can streamline some development processes but ultimately cannot replace the work of human talent. Discovering gen AI in Call of Duty and Pax Romana was possible precisely because of the low-quality of the images that were found. With Ubisoft’s interactive gen-AI NPCs, the dialogue they spout sounds unnatural and stilted. Players in the 2025 Chinese martial arts MMORPG Where Winds Meet are manipulating its AI chatbot NPCs to break the game, just like Fortnite players were able to make AI-powered Darth Vader swear.

For all the promises of gen AI, its current results do not live up to expectations. So why is it everywhere?

One reason is the competitive edge AI might but currently can’t provide that Swen Vincke alluded to in his interview with Bloomberg. Another reason is also the simplest: it’s the economy, stupid. Despite inflation, flagging consumer confidence and spending, and rising unemployment, the stock market is still booming, propped up by the billions and billions of dollars being poured into AI tech. Game makers in search of capital to keep business and profits going want in on that. Announcing AI initiatives and touting the use of AI tools — even if those tools have a relatively minor impact on the final product — can be a way to signal to AI-eager investors that a game company is worth their money.

That might explain why the majority of gen-AI’s supporters in gaming come from the C-suite of AAA studios and not smaller indie outfits who almost universally revile the tech. Indies face the same economic pressure as bigger studios but have far fewer resources to navigate those pressures. Ostensibly, indie developers are the ones who stand to benefit the most from the tech but, so far, are its biggest opponents. They are pushing back against the assertion that gen AI is everywhere, being used by everybody, with some marking their games with anti-AI logos proclaiming their games were made wholly by humans.

For some indie developers, using gen AI defeats the purpose of game making entirely. The challenge of coming up with ideas and solutions to development problems — the things gen AI is supposed to automate — is a big part of game making’s appeal to them. There are also moral and environmental implications indie developers seem especially sensitive to. Gen-AI outputs are cobbled from existing bodies of work that were often used without consent or compensation. AI data centers are notorious for consumptive energy usage and polluting their surrounding areas, which are increasingly focused in low-income and minority communities.With its unrealized promises and so-far shoddy outputs, it’s easy to think of gen AI as gaming’s next flash in the pan the way NFTs were. But with gaming’s biggest companies increasingly reporting their use, gen AI will remain a lightning rod in game development — until the tech improves, or, like with NFTs, the bubble pops.

            <div id="article-text">Vince Gilligan’s strange take on a postapocalypse required a lot of set-up.

Vince Gilligan’s strange take on a postapocalypse required a lot of set-up.

It’s a good thing that we already know a second season of Pluribus is on the way. Because the season finale for the show — a sci-fi drama on Apple TV, helmed by Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan — made it clear that things are just getting started. The episode brought together a number of significant threads but, more importantly, opened up potentially explosive (literally) new lines of inquiry for what comes next.

Spoiler to follow for the first season of Pluribus.

First, a little reminder of how we got here. The inciting incident of Pluribus was the release of a virus of unknown, but extraterrestrial origins, that turned almost the entirety of the Earth’s human population into an interconnected hive mind. The hive is peaceful to the point that they won’t even kill a bug or pick an apple off a tree, and they are physically harmed by negative emotions. There are around a dozen people who weren’t impacted by the virus. Most notably, this includes an American woman named Carol (Rhea Seehorn) and a Paraguayan man named Manousos (Carlos-Manuel Vesga). For most of the season, the pair have been separated physically, but united in being vehemently opposed to the hive’s presence, while trying to figure out a way to “save” the world by making it the way it used to be.

The finale sees these two finally able to meet up with each other — but things have changed for Carol. In the penultimate episode, her feelings toward the hive began to soften, primarily as she grew closer to her chaperone Zosia (Karolina Wydra). In fact, by the time the finale starts, they’re a full-on couple. It’s a far cry from the early days of the show, when Carol was so antagonistic to the hive that they abandoned her and the city of Albuquerque for safety reasons.

But Carol’s new view of the hive, and Zosia in particular, means that things don’t go quite the way Manousos expected. Instead of finding a like-minded comrade who would help him “save the world,” he finds a version of Carol who is reluctant to even speak to him. The dynamic is much like Pluribus’ second episode, in which Carol fails to convince the rest of the survivors that they should work toward putting the world back the way it was. Only this time the roles are reversed. Combine this dynamic with the fact that Carol and Manousos are both extremely stubborn people who are using Google Translate to communicate, and, well, it’s not exactly a smooth meeting. After the first time the two talk, Manousos mutters to himself, “well this is going just great.”

By the end of the episode, though, the two seem largely on the same page. And that’s because Carol learns that, despite her budding romance with Zosia, the hive are still diligently working on bringing her into the fold (the episode actually opens by showing one of the other survivors joining the hive via a new procedure). This all culminates with Carol receiving a large package that turns out to be an atom bomb. I guess she wasn’t joking earlier in the season.

The first season of Pluribus has been a learning experience. While there are plenty of postapocalyptic shows, there’s really nothing quite like this strange, hive-mind-infected version of Earth. And so over nine episodes, we see Carol emotionally coming to grips with her new reality, but also using that time to learn as much as she can about how the hive operates. This, in turn, helps us, the audience, understand just what the heck is going on. All stories require some kind of scene-setting, but Pluribus’ unique nature requires that much more.

But the reveal of the atom bomb at the end suggests that things are going in a different direction in season 2. I don’t expect Pluribus to suddenly become a fast-paced show; its measured pace is part of its appeal and allows it to really dig into the nitty-gritty details of the world. But many of the remaining plotlines and questions require more action than simply learning more about the hive. Manousos may have figured out a way to pull individuals out of the hive using radio signals; the hive are in the midst of building a “giant antenna” to possibly communicate with whoever or whatever sent the virus in the first place; the rest of the survivors have to decide whether or not they want to join; the hive need to sort out a solution to their impending food crisis; and, oh, there’s that bomb that Carol may or may not have a plan for.

I don’t know how many seasons the Pluribus story can reasonably stretch for, but it’s clear it needed at least two, just because there’s so much to set up. It’s not all that different from Apple TV’s other delightfully weird sci-fi series, Severance, a show that had a similarly unique premise and really pulled everything together by the end of its second season. Now we’ll have to wait and see if Pluribus can do the same.

﻿The five sanctioned individuals included Thierry Breton and Imran Ahmed, who feuded with Elon Musk.

On Tuesday, the Trump Administration followed through on a threat of retaliation targeting foreigners who are involved in content moderation. The State Department announced sanctions barring US access for former EU commissioner Thierry Breton, as well as four researchers, while issuing an intentionally chilling threat to others, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio claiming, “The State Department stands ready and willing to expand today’s list if other foreign actors do not reverse course.”

One of the researchers the State Department says is banned and now deportable, is Imran Ahmed, who runs the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), an organization aimed at identifying and pushing back against hate speech online that Elon Musk tried and failed to censor with a lawsuit that was dismissed in early 2024. In his decision, Judge Charles Breyer wrote that X’s motivation for suing was to “punish CCDH for CCDH publications that criticized X Corp. — and perhaps in order to dissuade others.”

Breton is called “a mastermind of the Digital Services Act” by US Under Secretary of State Sarah Rogers, who specifically referenced a letter he sent to Elon Musk ahead of a livestreamed event with Donald Trump that noted X’s legal obligations under the DSA relating to illegal content and disinformation.

The other researchers include Anna-Lena von Hodenberg and Josephine Ballon, leaders of HateAid, a nonprofit that tried to sue X in 2023 for “failing to remove criminal antisemitic content,” as well as Clare Melford, leader of the Global Disinformation Index, which works on “fixing the systems that enable disinformation.”

The press release announcing the sanctions is titled “Announcement of Actions to Combat the Global Censorship-Industrial Complex,” the claimed target of Republicans like House Judiciary Committee leader Jim Jordan, as they’ve worked against attempts to apply fact-checking and misinformation research to social networks. Earlier this month, Reuters reported the State Department ordered US consulates to consider rejecting H-1B visa applicants involved in content moderation, and a few days ago, the Office of the US Trade Representative threatened retaliation against European tech giants like Spotify and SAP over supposedly “discriminatory” activity in regulating US tech platforms.

Following Europe and Japan, Apple is opening things up for iOS users in Brazil.

Apple is set to allow third-party app stores on iOS in Brazil next year after settling with the country’s competition watchdog in a legal battle dating back to 2022, as reported by 9to5Mac.

According to a machine translation of a press release from the Brazilian regulator CADE, it has approved a Term of Commitment to Termination (TCC) made by Apple that obligates the company to allow third-party app stores and let developers use external payment systems. Warnings about third-party app stores and external payment systems must also have neutral wording.

Apple will be able to still charge fees, and the Brazilian publication Tecnoblog says in a machine translation that, according to CADE, those fees are:

Commission of 25% (general) or 10% (special programs)

App purchases on the App Store, but directed outside the store:

No fee if the routing involves static text (no clickable link/button)

15% fee if the owner of the app puts a button/link and directs to payment on his own website (outside the app environment)

Apple has argued against opening up iOS on the grounds that it could compromise the platform’s security. But regulation in other countries has already forced the company to let users in Europe and Japan install third-party app stores, and in the US, Apple allows for external payment links.

Apple has 105 days to put the changes into place, and if it doesn’t comply with its obligations, it could be subject to a fine of up to R$150 million (about $27 million).

The company shared the following statement with 9to5Mac about the decision:

In order to comply with regulatory demands from CADE, Apple is making changes that will impact iOS apps in Brazil. While these changes will open new privacy and security risks to users, we have worked to maintain protections against some threats, including keeping in place important safeguards for younger users. These safeguards will not eliminate every risk, but they will help ensure that iOS remains the best, most secure mobile platform available in Brazil and we will continue to advocate on behalf of users and developers.

Update, December 23rd: Added fee structure reported by Tecnoblog.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/24/1129294/ronald-deibert-citizen-lab-digital-threats-spies-cybersecurity/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In April 2025, Ronald Deibert left all electronic devices at home in Toronto and boarded a plane. When he landed in Illinois, he took a taxi to a mall and headed directly to the Apple Store to purchase a new laptop and iPhone. He’d wanted to keep the risk of having his personal devices confiscated to a minimum, because he knew his work made him a prime target for surveillance. “I’m traveling under the assumption that I am being watched, right down to exactly where I am at any moment,” Deibert says.

Deibert directs the Citizen Lab, a research center he founded in 2001 to serve as “counterintelligence for civil society.” Housed at the University of Toronto, the lab operates independently of governments or corporate interests, relying instead on research grants and private philanthropy for financial support. It’s one of the few institutions that investigate cyberthreats exclusively in the public interest, and in doing so, it has exposed some of the most egregious digital abuses of the past two decades.

For many years, Deibert and his colleagues have held up the US as the standard for liberal democracy. But that’s changing, he says: “The pillars of democracy are under assault in the United States. For many decades, in spite of its flaws, it has upheld norms about what constitutional democracy looks like or should aspire to. [That] is now at risk.”

Even as some of his fellow Canadians avoided US travel after Donald Trump’s second election, Deibert relished the opportunity to visit. Alongside his meetings with human rights defenders, he also documented active surveillance at Columbia University during the height of its student protests. Deibert snapped photos of drones above campus and noted the exceptionally strict security protocols. “It was unorthodox to go to the United States,” he says. “But I really gravitate toward problems in the world.”

Deibert, 61, grew up in East Vancouver, British Columbia, a gritty area with a boisterous countercultural presence. In the ’70s, Vancouver brimmed with draft dodgers and hippies, but Deibert points to American investigative journalism—exposing the COINTELPRO surveillance program, the Pentagon Papers, Watergate—as the seed of his respect for antiestablishment sentiment. He didn’t imagine that this fascination would translate into a career, however.

“My horizons were pretty low because I came from a working-class family, and there weren’t many people in my family—in fact, none—who went on to university,” he says.

Deibert eventually entered a graduate program in international relations at the University of British Columbia. His doctoral research brought him to a field of inquiry that would soon explode: the geopolitical implications of the nascent internet.

“In my field, there were a handful of people beginning to talk about the internet, but it was very shallow, and that frustrated me,” he says. “And meanwhile, computer science was very technical, but not political—[politics] was almost like a dirty word.”

Deibert continued to explore these topics at the University of Toronto when he was appointed to a tenure-track professorship, but it wasn’t until after he founded the Citizen Lab in 2001 that his work rose to global prominence.

What put the lab on the map, Deibert says, was its 2009 report “Tracking GhostNet,” which uncovered a digital espionage network in China that had breached offices of foreign embassies and diplomats in more than 100 countries, including the office of the Dalai Lama. The report and its follow-up in 2010 were among the first to publicly expose cybersurveillance in real time. In the years since, the lab has published over 180 such analyses, garnering praise from human rights advocates ranging from Margaret Atwood to Edward Snowden.

The lab has rigorously investigated authoritarian regimes around the world (Deibert says both Russia and China have his name on a “list” barring his entry). The group was the first to uncover the use of commercial spyware to surveil people close to the Saudi dissident and Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi prior to his assassination, and its research has directly informed G7 and UN resolutions on digital repression and led to sanctions on spyware vendors. Even so, in 2025 US Immigration and Customs Enforcement reactivated a $2 million contract with the spyware vendor Paragon. The contract, which the Biden administration had previously placed under a stop-work order, resembles steps taken by governments in Europe and Israel that have also deployed domestic spyware to address security concerns.

“It saves lives, quite literally,” Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says of the lab’s work. “The Citizen Lab [researchers] were the first to really focus on technical attacks on human rights activists and democracy activists all around the world. And they’re still the best at it.”

When recruiting new Citizen Lab employees (or “Labbers,” as they refer to one another), Deibert forgoes stuffy, pencil-pushing academics in favor of brilliant, colorful personalities, many of whom personally experienced repression from some of the same regimes the lab now investigates.

Noura Aljizawi, a researcher on digital repression who survived torture at the hands of the al-Assad regime in Syria, researches the distinct threat that digital technologies pose to women and queer people, particularly when deployed against exiled nationals. She helped create Security Planner, a tool that gives personalized, expert-reviewed guidance to people looking to improve their digital hygiene, for which the University of Toronto awarded her an Excellence Through Innovation Award.

Work for the lab is not without risk. Citizen Lab fellow Elies Campo, for example, was followed and photographed after the lab published a 2022 report that exposed the digital surveillance of dozens of Catalonian citizens and members of parliament, including four Catalonian presidents who were targeted during or after their terms.

Still, the lab’s reputation and mission make recruitment fairly easy, Deibert says. “This good work attracts a certain type of person,” he says. “But they’re usually also drawn to the sleuthing. It’s detective work, and that can be highly intoxicating—even addictive.”

Deibert frequently deflects the spotlight to his fellow Labbers. He rarely discusses the group’s accomplishments without referencing two senior researchers, Bill Marczak and John Scott-Railton, alongside other staffers. And on the occasion that someone decides to leave the Citizen Lab to pursue another position, this appreciation remains.

“We have a saying: Once a Labber, always a Labber,” Deibert says.

While in the US, Deibert taught a seminar on the Citizen Lab’s work to Northwestern University undergraduates and delivered talks on digital authoritarianism at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. Universities in the US had been subjected to funding cuts and heightened scrutiny from the Trump administration, and Deibert wanted to be “in the mix” at such institutions to respond to what he sees as encroaching authoritarian practices by the US government.

Since Deibert’s return to Canada, the lab has continued its work unearthing digital threats to civil society worldwide, but now Deibert must also contend with the US—a country that was once his benchmark for democracy but has become another subject of his scrutiny. “I do not believe that an institution like the Citizen Lab could exist right now in the United States,” he says. “The type of research that we pioneered is under threat like never before.”

He is particularly alarmed by the increasing pressures facing federal oversight bodies and academic institutions in the US. In September, for example, the Trump administration defunded the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, a government organization dedicated to preventing waste, fraud, and abuse within federal agencies, citing partisanship concerns. The White House has also threatened to freeze federal funding to universities that do not comply with administration directives related to gender, DEI, and campus speech. These sorts of actions, Deibert says, undermine the independence of watchdogs and research groups like the Citizen Lab.

Cohn, the director of the EFF, says the lab’s location in Canada allows it to avoid many of these attacks on institutions that provide accountability. “Having the Citizen Lab based in Toronto and able to continue to do its work largely free of the things we’re seeing in the US,” she says, “could end up being tremendously important if we’re going to return to a place of the rule of law and protection of human rights and liberties.”

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-24</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Climate news hasn’t been great in 2025. Global greenhouse-gas emissions hit record highs (again). This year is set to be either the second or third warmest on record. Climate-fueled disasters like wildfires in California and flooding in Indonesia and Pakistan devastated communities and caused billions in damage.

In addition to these worrying indicators of our continued contributions to climate change and their obvious effects, the world’s largest economy has made a sharp U-turn on climate policy this year. The US under the Trump administration withdrew from the Paris Agreement, cut funds for climate research, and scrapped billions of dollars in funding for climate tech projects.

We’re in a severe situation with climate change. But for those looking for bright spots, there was some good news in 2025. Here are a few of the positive stories our climate reporters noticed this year.

One of the most notable and encouraging signs of progress this year occurred in China. The world’s second-biggest economy and biggest climate polluter has managed to keep carbon dioxide emissions flat for the last year and a half, according to an analysis in Carbon Brief.

That’s happened before, but only when the nation’s economy was retracting, including in the midst of the covid-19 pandemic. But emissions are now falling even as China’s economy is on track to grow about 5% this year, and electricity demands continue to rise.

So what’s changed? China has now installed so much solar and wind, and put so many EVs on the road, that its economy can continue to expand without increasing the amount of carbon dioxide it’s pumping into the atmosphere, decoupling the traditional link between emissions and growth.

Specifically, China added an astounding 240 gigawatts of solar power capacity and 61 gigawatts of wind power in the first nine months of the year, the Carbon Brief analysis noted. That’s nearly as much solar power as the US has installed in total, in just the first three quarters of this year.

It’s too early to say China’s emissions have peaked, but the country has said it will officially reach that benchmark before 2030.

To be clear, China still isn’t moving fast enough to keep the world on track for meeting relatively safe temperature targets. (Indeed, very few countries are.) But it’s now both producing most of the world’s clean energy technologies and curbing its emissions growth, providing a model for cleaning up industrial economies without sacrificing economic prosperity—and setting the stage for faster climate progress in the coming years.

It’s hard to articulate just how quickly batteries for grid storage are coming online. These massive arrays of cells can soak up electricity when sources like solar are available and prices are low, and then discharge power back to the grid when it’s needed most.

Back in 2015, the battery storage industry had installed only a fraction of a gigawatt of battery storage capacity across the US. That year, it set a seemingly bold target of adding 35 gigawatts by 2035. The sector passed that goal a decade early this year and then hit 40 gigawatts a couple of months later.

Costs are still falling, which could help maintain the momentum for the technology’s deployment. This year, battery prices for EVs and stationary storage fell yet again, reaching a record low, according to data from BloombergNEF. Battery packs specifically used for grid storage saw prices fall even faster than the average; they cost 45% less than last year.

We’re starting to see what happens on grids with lots of battery capacity, too: in California and Texas, batteries are already helping meet demand in the evenings, reducing the need to run natural-gas plants. The result: a cleaner, more stable grid.

The AI boom is complicated for our energy system, as we covered at length this year. Electricity demand is ticking up: the amount of power utilities supplied to US data centers jumped 22% this year and will more than double by 2030.

But at least one positive shift is coming out of AI’s influence on energy: It’s driving renewed interest and investment in next-generation energy technologies.

In the near term, much of the energy needed for data centers, including those that power AI, will likely come from fossil fuels, especially new natural-gas power plants. But tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and Meta all have goals on the books to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions, so they’re looking for alternatives.

Meta signed a deal with XGS Energy in June to purchase up to 150 megawatts of electricity from a geothermal plant. In October, Google signed an agreement that will help reopen Duane Arnold Energy Center in Iowa, a previously shuttered nuclear power plant.

Geothermal and nuclear could be key pieces of the grid of the future, as they can provide constant power in a way that wind and solar don’t. There’s a long way to go for many of the new versions of the tech, but more money and interest from big, powerful players can’t hurt.

Perhaps the strongest evidence of collective climate progress so far: We’ve already avoided the gravest dangers that scientists feared just a decade ago.

The world is on track for about 2.6 °C of warming over preindustrial conditions by 2100, according to Climate Action Tracker, an independent scientific effort to track the policy progress that nations have made toward their goals under the Paris climate agreement.That’s a lot warmer than we want the planet to ever get. But it’s also a whole degree better than the 3.6 °C path that we were on a decade ago, just before nearly 200 countries signed the Paris deal.

That progress occurred because more and more nations passed emissions mandates, funded subsidies, and invested in research and development—and private industry got busy cranking out vast amounts of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and EVs.

The bad news is that progress has stalled. Climate Action Tracker notes that its warming projections have remained stubbornly fixed for the last four years, as nations have largely failed to take the additional action needed to bend that curve closer to the 2 °C goal set out in the international agreement.

But having shaved off a degree of danger is still demonstrable proof that we can pull together in the face of a global threat and address a very, very hard problem. And it means we’ve done the difficult work of laying down the technical foundation for a society that can largely run without spewing ever more greenhouse gas into the atmosphere.

Hopefully, as cleantech continues to improve and climate change steadily worsens, the world will find the collective will to pick up the pace again soon.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

            <h2>Researchers are getting organoids pregnant with human embryos</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/23/1130415/organoid-uterus-microfluidic-chip-embryo/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At first glance, it looks like the start of a human pregnancy: A ball-shaped embryo presses gently into the receptive lining of the uterus and then grips tight, burrowing in as the first tendrils of a future placenta appear.

This is implantation—the moment that pregnancy officially begins.

Only none of it is happening inside a body. These images were captured in a Beijing laboratory, inside a microfluidic chip, as scientists watched the scene unfold.

In three papers published this week by Cell Press, scientists are reporting what they call the most accurate efforts yet to mimic the first moments of pregnancy in the lab. They’ve taken human embryos from IVF centers and let these merge with “organoids” made of endometrial cells, which form the lining of the uterus.

The reports—two from China and a third involving a collaboration among researchers in the United Kingdom, Spain, and the US—show how scientists are using engineered tissues to better understand early pregnancy and potentially improve IVF outcomes.

“You have an embryo and the endometrial organoid together,” says Jun Wu, a biologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, in Dallas, who contributed to both Chinese reports. “That’s the overarching message of all three papers.”

According to the papers, these 3D combinations are the most complete re-creations yet of the first days of pregnancy and should be useful for studying why IVF treatments often fail.

In each case, the experiments were stopped when the embryos were two weeks old, if not sooner. That is due to legal and ethical rules that typically restrict scientists from going any further than 14 days.

In your basic IVF procedure, an egg is fertilized in the lab and allowed to develop into a spherical embryo called a blastocyst—a process that takes a few days. That blastocyst then gets put into a patient’s uterus in the hope it will establish itself there and ultimately become a baby.

But that’s a common failure point. Many patients will learn that their IVF procedure didn’t work because an embryo never attached.

In the new reports, it’s that initial bond between mother and embryo that is being reproduced in the lab. “IVF means in vitro fertilization, but now this is the stage of in vitro implantation,” says Matteo Molè, a biologist at Stanford University whose results with collaborators in Europe are among those published today. “Considering that implantation is a barrier [to pregnancy], we have the potential to increase the success rate if we can model it in the laboratory.”

Normally implantation is entirely hidden from view because it occurs in someone’s uterus, says Hongmei Wang, a developmental biologist at the Beijing Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, who co-led the effort there. Wang often studies monkeys because she can interrupt their pregnancies to collect the tissues she needs to see. “We’ve always hoped to understand human embryo implantation, but we have lacked a way to do so,” she says. “It’s all happening in the uterus.”

In the Beijing study, researchers tested about 50 donated IVF embryos, but they also ran a thousand more experiments using so-called blastoids. The latter are mimics of early-stage human embryos manufactured from stem cells. Blastoids are easy to make in large numbers and, since they aren’t true embryos, don’t have as many ethical rules on their use.

“The question was, if we have these blastoids, what can we use them for?” says Leqian Yu, the senior author of the report from the Beijing Institute. “The obvious next step was implantation. So how do you do that?”

For the Beijing team, the answer was to build a soft silicone chamber with tiny channels to add nutrients and a space to grow the uterine organoid. After that, blastoids—or real embryos—could be introduced through a window in the device, so the “pregnancy” could start.

“The key question we want to try to answer is what is the first cross-talk between embryo and mother,” says Yu. “I think this is maybe the first time we can see the entire process.”

This isn’t the first time researchers have tried using organoids for this kind of research. At least two startup companies have raised funds to commercialize similar systems—in some cases presenting the organoids as a tool to predict IVF success. In addition to Dawn Bio, a startup based in Vienna, there is Simbryo Technologies, in Houston, which last month said it would begin offering “personalized” predictions for IVF patients using blastoids and endometrial organoids.

To do that test, doctors will take a biopsy of a patient’s uterine lining and grow organoids from it. After that, blastoids will be added to the organoids to gauge whether a woman is likely to be able to support a pregnancy or not. If the blastoids don’t start to implant, it could mean the patient’s uterus isn’t receptive and is the reason IVF isn’t working.

The Beijing team thinks the pregnancy organoids could also be used to identify drugs that might help those patients. In their paper, they describe how they made organoids out of tissue taken from women who’ve had repeated IVF failures. Then they tested 1,119 approved drugs on those samples to see if anything improved.

Several seemed to have helpful effects. One chemical, avobenzone, an ingredient in some types of sunblock, increased the chance that a blastoid would start implanting from just 5% of the time to around 25% of the time. Yu says his center hopes to eventually start a clinical trial if they can find the right drug to try.

The Beijing group is working on ways to improve the organoid system so that it’s even more realistic. Right now, it lacks important cell types, including immune cells and a blood supply. Yu says a next step he’s working on is to add blood vessels and tiny pumps to his chip device, so that he can give the organoids a kind of rudimentary circulation.

This means that in the near future, blastoids or embryos could likely be grown longer, raising questions about how far scientists will be able to take pregnancy in the lab. “I think this technology does raise the possibility of growing things longer,” says Wu, who says some view the research as an initial step toward creating babies entirely outside the body.

However, Wu says incubating a human to term in the laboratory remains impossible, for the time being. “This technology is certainly related to ectogenesis, or development outside the body,” he says. “But I don’t think it’s anywhere near an artificial womb. That’s still science fiction.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, summed it up in three words: “This is embarrassing.”

Hassabis was replying on X to an overexcited post by Sébastien Bubeck, a research scientist at the rival firm OpenAI, announcing that two mathematicians had used OpenAI’s latest large language model, GPT-5, to find solutions to 10 unsolved problems in mathematics. “Science acceleration via AI has officially begun,” Bubeck crowed.

Put your math hats on for a minute, and let’s take a look at what this beef from mid-October was about. It’s a perfect example of what’s wrong with AI right now.

Bubeck was excited that GPT-5 seemed to have somehow solved a number of puzzles known as Erdős problems.

Paul Erdős, one of the most prolific mathematicians of the 20th century, left behind hundreds of puzzles when he died. To help keep track of which ones have been solved, Thomas Bloom, a mathematician at the University of Manchester, UK, set up erdosproblems.com, which lists more than 1,100 problems and notes that around 430 of them come with solutions.

When Bubeck celebrated GPT-5’s breakthrough, Bloom was quick to call him out. “This is a dramatic misrepresentation,” he wrote on X. Bloom explained that a problem isn’t necessarily unsolved if this website does not list a solution. That simply means Bloom wasn’t aware of one. There are millions of mathematics papers out there, and nobody has read all of them. But GPT-5 probably has.

It turned out that instead of coming up with new solutions to 10 unsolved problems, GPT-5 had scoured the internet for 10 existing solutions that Bloom hadn’t seen before. Oops!

There are two takeaways here. One is that breathless claims about big breakthroughs shouldn’t be made via social media: Less knee jerk and more gut check.

The second is that GPT-5’s ability to find references to previous work that Bloom wasn’t aware of is also amazing. The hype overshadowed something that should have been pretty cool in itself.

Mathematicians are very interested in using LLMs to trawl through vast numbers of existing results, François Charton, a research scientist who studies the application of LLMs to mathematics at the AI startup Axiom Math, told me when I talked to him about this Erdős gotcha.

But literature search is dull compared with genuine discovery, especially to AI’s fervent boosters on social media. Bubeck’s blunder isn’t the only example.

In August, a pair of mathematicians showed that no LLM at the time was able to solve a math puzzle known as Yu Tsumura’s 554th Problem. Two months later, social media erupted with evidence that GPT-5 now could. “Lee Sedol moment is coming for many,” one observer commented, referring to the Go master who lost to DeepMind’s AI AlphaGo in 2016.

But Charton pointed out that solving Yu Tsumura’s 554th Problem isn’t a big deal to mathematicians. “It’s a question you would give an undergrad,” he said. “There is this tendency to overdo everything.”

Meanwhile, more sober assessments of what LLMs may or may not be good at are coming in. At the same time that mathematicians were fighting on the internet about GPT-5, two new studies came out that looked in depth at the use of LLMs in medicine and law (two fields that model makers have claimed their tech excels at).

Researchers found that LLMs could make certain medical diagnoses, but they were flawed at recommending treatments. When it comes to law, researchers found that LLMs often give inconsistent and incorrect advice. “Evidence thus far spectacularly fails to meet the burden of proof,” the authors concluded.

But that’s not the kind of message that goes down well on X. “You’ve got that excitement because everybody is communicating like crazy—nobody wants to be left behind,” Charton said. X is where a lot of AI news drops first, it’s where new results are trumpeted, and it’s where key players like Sam Altman, Yann LeCun, and Gary Marcus slug it out in public. It’s hard to keep up—and harder to look away.

Bubeck’s post was only embarrassing because his mistake was caught. Not all errors are. Unless something changes researchers, investors, and non-specific boosters will keep teeing each other up. “Some of them are scientists, many are not, but they are all nerds,” Charton told me. “Huge claims work very well on these networks.”

There’s a coda! I wrote everything you’ve just read above for the Algorithm column in the January/February 2026 issue of MIT Technology Review magazine (out very soon). Two days after that went to press, Axiom told me its own math model, AxiomProver, had solved two open Erdős problems (#124 and #481, for the math fans in the room). That’s impressive stuff for a small startup founded just a few months ago. Yup—AI moves fast!

But that’s not all. Five days later the company announced that AxiomProver had solved nine out of 12 problems in this year’s Putnam competition, a college-level math challenge that some people consider harder than the better-known International Math Olympiad (which LLMs from both Google DeepMind and OpenAI aced a few months back).

The Putnam result was lauded on X by big names in the field, including Jeff Dean, chief scientist at Google DeepMind, and Thomas Wolf, cofounder at the AI firm Hugging Face. Once again familiar debates played out in the replies. A few researchers pointed out that while the International Math Olympiad demands more creative problem-solving, the Putnam competition tests math knowledge—which makes it notoriously hard for undergrads, but easier, in theory, for LLMs that have ingested the internet.

How should we judge Axiom’s achievements? Not on social media, at least. And the eye-catching competition wins are just a starting point. Determining just how good LLMs are at math will require a deeper dive into exactly what these models are doing when they solve hard (read: hard for humans) math problems.

            <h2>How I learned to stop worrying and love AI slop</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/23/1130396/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-ai-slop/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Lately, everywhere I scroll, I keep seeing the same fish-eyed CCTV view: a grainy wide shot from the corner of a living room, a driveway at night, an empty grocery store. Then something impossible happens. JD Vance shows up at the doorstep in a crazy outfit. A car folds into itself like paper and drives away. A cat comes in and starts hanging out with capybaras and bears, as if in some weird modern fairy tale.

This fake-surveillance look has become one of the signature flavors of what people now call AI slop. For those of us who spend time online watching short videos, slop feels inescapable: a flood of repetitive, often nonsensical AI-generated clips that washes across TikTok, Instagram, and beyond. For that, you can thank new tools like OpenAI’s Sora (which exploded in popularity after launching in app form in September), Google’s Veo series, and AI models built by Runway. Now anyone can make videos, with just a few taps on a screen.

If I were to locate the moment slop broke through into popular consciousness, I’d pick the video of rabbits bouncing on a trampoline that went viral this summer. For many savvy internet users, myself included, it was the first time we were fooled by an AI video, and it ended up spawning a wave of almost identical riffs, with people making videos of all kinds of animals and objects bouncing on the same trampoline.

My first reaction was that, broadly speaking, all of this sucked. That’s become a familiar refrain, in think pieces and at dinner parties. Everything online is slop now—the internet “enshittified,” with AI taking much of the blame. Initially, I largely agreed, quickly scrolling past every AI video in a futile attempt to send a message to my algorithm. But then friends started sharing AI clips in group chats that were compellingly weird, or funny. Some even had a grain of brilliance buried in the nonsense. I had to admit I didn’t fully understand what I was rejecting—what I found so objectionable.

To try to get to the bottom of how I felt (and why), I recently spoke to the people making the videos, a company creating bespoke tools for creators, and experts who study how new media becomes culture. What I found convinced me that maybe generative AI will not end up ruining everything. Maybe we have been too quick to dismiss AI slop. Maybe there’s a case for looking beyond the surface and seeing a new kind of creativity—one we’re watching take shape in real time, with many of us actually playing a part.

“AI slop” can and does refer to text, audio, or images. But what’s really broken through this year is the flood of quick AI-generated video clips on social platforms, each produced by a short written prompt fed into an AI model. Under the hood, these models are trained on enormous data sets so they can predict what every subsequent frame should look or sound like. It’s much like the process by which text models produce answers in a chat, but slower and far more power-hungry.

Early text-to-video systems, released around 2022 to 2023, could manage only a few seconds of blurry motion; objects warped in and out of existence, characters teleported around, and the giveaway that it was AI was usually a mangled hand or a melting face. In the past two years, newer models like Sora2, Veo 3.1, and Runway’s latest Gen-4.5 have dramatically improved, creating realistic, seamless, and increasingly true-to-prompt videos that can last up to a minute. Some of these models even generate sound and video together, including ambient noise and rough dialogue.

These text-to-video models have often been pitched by AI companies as the future of cinema—tools for filmmakers, studios, and professional storytellers. The demos have leaned into widescreen shots and dramatic camera moves. OpenAI pitched Sora as a “world simulator” while courting Hollywood filmmakers with what it boasted were movie-quality shorts. Google introduced Veo 3 last year as a step toward storyboards and longer scenes, edging directly into film workflows.

All this hinged on the idea that people wanted to make AI-generated videos that looked real. But the reality of how they’re being used is more modest, weirder—and arguably much more interesting. What has turned out to be the home turf for AI video is the six-inch screen in our hands.

Anyone can and does use these tools; a report by Adobe released in October shows that 86% of creators are using generative AI. But so are average social media users—people who aren’t “creators” so much as just people with phones.

That’s how you end up with clips showing things like Indian prime minister Narendra Modi dancing with Gandhi, a crystal that melts into butter the moment a knife touches it, or Game of Thrones reimagined as Henan opera—videos that are hypnotic, occasionally funny, and often deeply stupid. And while micro-trends didn’t start with AI—TikTok and Reels already ran on fast-moving formats—it feels as if AI poured fuel on that fire. Perhaps because the barrier to copying an idea becomes so low, a viral video like the bunnies on trampoline can easily and quickly spawn endless variations on the same concept. You don’t need a costume or a filming location anymore; you just tweak the prompt, hit Generate, and share.

Big tech companies have also jumped on the idea of AI videos as a new social medium. The Sora app allows users to insert AI versions of themselves and other users into scenes. Meta’s Vibes app wants to turn your entire feed into nonstop AI clips.

Of course, the same frictionless setup that allows for harmless, delightful creations also makes it easy to generate much darker slop. Sora has already been used to create so many racist deepfakes of Martin Luther King Jr. that the King estate pushed the company to block new MLK videos entirely. TikTok and X are seeing Sora-watermarked clips of women and girls being strangled circulating in bulk, posted by accounts seemingly dedicated to this one theme. And then there’s “nazislop,” the nickname for AI videos that repackage fascist aesthetics and memes into glossy, algorithm-ready content aimed at teens’ For You pages.

But the prevalence of bad actors hasn’t stopped short AI videos from flourishing as a form. New apps, Discord servers for AI creators, and tutorial channels keep multiplying. And increasingly, the energy in the community seems to be shifting away from trying to create stuff that “passes as real” toward embracing AI’s inherent weirdness. Every day, I stumble across creators who are stretching what “AI slop” is supposed to look like. I decided to talk to some of them.

Like those fake surveillance videos, many popular viral AI videos rely on a surreal, otherworldly quality. As Wenhui Lim, an architecture designer turned full-time AI artist, tells me, “There is definitely a competition of ‘How weird we can push this?’ among AI video creators.”

It’s the kind of thing AI video tools seem to handle with ease: pushing physics past what a normal body can do or a normal camera can capture. This makes AI a surprisingly natural fit for satire, comedy skits, parody, and experimental video art—especially examples involving absurdism or even horror. Several popular AI creators that I spoke with eagerly tap into this capability.

Drake Garibay, a 39-year-old software developer from Redlands, California, was inspired by body-horror AI clips circulating on social media in early 2025. He started playing with ComfyUI, a generative media tool, and ended up spending hours each week making his own strange creations. His favorite subject is morbid human-animal hybrids. “I fell right into it,” he says. “I’ve always been pretty artistic, [but] when I saw what AI video tools can do, I was blown away.”

Since the start of this year, Garibay has been posting his experiments online. One that went viral on TikTok, captioned “Cooking up some fresh AI slop,” shows a group of people pouring gooey dough into a pot. The mixture suddenly sprouts a human face, which then emerges from the boiling pot with a head and body. It has racked up more than 8.3 million views.

AI video technology is evolving so quickly that even for creative professionals, there is a lot to experiment with. Daryl Anselmo, a creative director turned digital artist, has been experimenting with the technology since its early days, posting an AI-generated video every day since 2021. He tells me that uses a wide range of tools, including Kling, Luma, and Midjourney, and is constantly iterating. To him, testing the boundaries of these AI tools is sometimes itself the reward. “I would like to think there are impossible things that you could not do before that are still yet to be discovered. That is exciting to me,” he says.

Anselmo has collected his daily creations over the past four years into an art project, titled AI Slop, that has been exhibited in multiple galleries, including the Grand Palais Immersif in Paris. There’s obvious attention to mood and composition. Some clips feel like something closer to an art-house vignette than a throwaway meme. Over time, Anselmo’s project has taken a darker turn as his subjects shift from landscapes and interior design toward more of the body horror that drew Garibay in.

His breakout piece, feel the agi, shows a hyperrealistic bot peeling open its own skull. Another video he shared recently features a midnight diner populated by anthropomorphized Tater Tots, titled Tot and Bothered; with its vintage palette and slow, mystical soundtrack, the piece feels like a late-night fever dream.

One further benefit of these AI systems is that they make it easier for creators to build recurring spaces and casts of characters that function like informal franchises. Lim, for instance, is the creator of a popular AI video account called Niceaunties, inspired by the “auntie culture” in Singapore, where she’s from.

“The word ‘aunties’ often has a slightly negative connotation in Singaporean culture. They are portrayed as old-fashioned, naggy, and lacking boundaries. But they are also so resourceful, funny, and at ease with themselves,” she says. “I want to create a world where it’s different for them.”

Her cheeky, playful videos show elderly Asian women merging with fruits, other objects, and architecture, or just living their best lives in a fantasy world. A viral video called Auntlantis, which has racked up 13.5 million views on Instagram, imagines silver-haired aunties as industrial mermaids working in an underwater trash-processing plant.

There’s also Granny Spills, an AI video account that features a glamorous, sassy old lady spitting hot takes and life advice to a street interviewer. It gained 1.8 million Instagram followers within three months of launch, posting new videos almost every day. Although the granny’s face looks slightly different in every video, the pink color scheme and her outfit stay mostly consistent. Creators Eric Suerez and Adam Vaserstein tell me that their entire workflow is powered by AI, from writing the script to constructing the scenes. Their role, as a result, becomes close to creative directing.

These projects often spin off merch, miniseries, and branded universes. The creators of Granny Spills, for example, have expanded their network, creating a Black granny as well as an Asian granny to cater to different audiences. The grannies now appear in crossover videos, as if they share the same fictional universe, pushing traffic between channels.

In the same vein, it’s now more possible than ever to participate in an online trend. Consider  “Italian brainrot,” which went viral earlier this year. Beloved by Gen Z and Gen Alpha, these videos feature human–animal–object hybrids with pseudo-Italian names like “Bombardiro Crocodilo” and “Tralalero Tralala.” According to Know Your Meme, the craze began with a few viral TikTok sounds in fake Italian. Soon, a lot of people were participating in what felt like a massive collaborative hallucination, inventing characters, backstories, and worldviews for an ever-expanding absurdist universe.

“Italian brainrot was great when it first hit,” says Denim Mazuki, a software developer and content creator who has been following the trend. “It was the collective lore-building that made it wonderful. Everyone added a piece. The characters were not owned by a studio or a single creator—they were made by the chronically online users.”

This trend and others are further enabled by specialized and sophisticated new tools—like OpenArt, a platform designed not just for video generation but for video storytelling, which gives users frame-to-frame control over a developing narrative.

Making a video on OpenArt is straightforward: Users start with a few AI-generated character images and a line of text as simple as “cat dancing in a park.” The platform then spins out a scene breakdown that users can tweak act by act, and they can run it through multiple mainstream models and compare the results to see which look best.

OpenArt cofounders Coco Mao and Chloe Fang tell me they sponsored tutorial videos and created quick-start templates to capitalize specifically on the trend of regular people wanting to get in on Italian brainrot. They say more than 80% of their users have no artistic background.

The current use of the word “slop” online traces back to the early 2010s on 4chan, a forum known for its insular and often toxic in-jokes. As the term has spread, its meaning has evolved; it’s now a kind of derogatory slur for anything that feels like low-quality mass production aimed at an unsuspecting public, says Adam Aleksic, an internet linguist. People now slap it onto everything from salad bowls to meaningless work reports.

But even with that broadened usage, AI remains the first association: “slop” has become a convenient shorthand for dismissing almost any AI-generated output, regardless of its actual quality. The Cambridge Dictionary’s new sense of “slop” will almost certainly cement this perception, describing it as “content on the internet that is of very low quality, especially when it is created by AI.”

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the word has become a charged label among AI creators.

Anselmo embraces it semi-ironically, hence the title of his yearslong art project. “I see this series as an experimental sketchbook,” he says. “I am working with the slop, pushing the models, breaking them, and developing a new visual language. I have no shame that I am deep into AI.” Anselmo says that he does not concern himself with whether his work is “art.”

Garibay, the creator of the viral video where a human face emerged from a pot of physical slop, uses the label playfully. “The AI slop art is really just a lot of weird glitchy stuff that happens, and there’s not really a lot of depth usually behind it, besides the shock value,” he says. “But you will find out really fast that there is a heck of a lot more involved, if you want a higher-end result.”

That’s largely in line with what Suerez and Vaserstein, the creators of Granny Spills, tell me. They actually hate it when their work is called slop, given the way the term is often used to dismiss AI-generated content out of hand. It feels disrespectful of their creative input, they say. Even though they do not write the scripts or paint the frames, they say they are making legitimate artistic choices.

Indeed, for most of the creators I spoke to, making AI content is rarely a one-click process. They tell me that it takes skill, trial and error, and a strong sense of taste to consistently get the visuals they want. Lim says a single one-minute video can take hours, sometimes even days, to make. Anselmo, for his part, takes pride in actively pushing the model rather than passively accepting its output. “There’s just so many things that you can do with it that go well beyond ‘Oh, way to go, you typed in a prompt,’” he says. Ultimately, slop evokes a lot of feelings. Aleksic puts it well: “There&#39;s a feeling of guilt on the user end for enjoying something that you know to be lowbrow. There&#39;s a feeling of anger toward the creator for making something that is not up to your content expectations, and all the meantime, there&#39;s a pervasive algorithmic anxiety hanging over us. We know that the algorithm and the platforms are to blame for the distribution of this slop.”

And that anxiety long predates generative AI. We’ve been living for years with the low-grade dread of being nudged, of having our taste engineered and our attention herded, so it’s not surprising that the anger latches onto the newest, most visible culprit. Sometimes it is misplaced, sure, but I also get the urge to assert human agency against a new force that seems to push all of us away from what we know and toward something we didn’t exactly choose.

But the negative association has real harm for the earlier adopters. Every AI video creator I spoke to described receiving hateful messages and comments simply for using these tools at all. These messages accuse AI creators of taking opportunities away from artists already struggling to make a living, and some dismiss their work as “grifting” and “garbage.” The backlash, of course, did not come out of nowhere. A Brookings study of one major freelance marketplace found that after new generative-AI tools launched in 2022, freelancers in AI-exposed occupations saw about 2% decline in contracts and a 5% drop in earnings.

“The phrase ‘AI slop’ implies, like, a certain ease of creation that really bothers a lot of people—understandably, because [making AI-generated videos] doesn&#39;t incorporate the artistic labor that we typically associate with contemporary art,” says Mindy Seu, a researcher, artist, and associate professor in digital arts at UCLA.

At the root of the conflict here is that the use of AI in art is still nascent; there are few best practices and almost no guardrails. And there’s a kind of shame involved—one I recognize when I find myself lingering on bad AI content.

Historically, new technology has always carried a whiff of stigma when it first appears, especially in creative fields where it seems to encroach on a previously manual craft. Seu says that digital art, internet art, and new media have been slow to gain recognition from cultural institutions, which remain key arbiters of what counts as “serious” or “relevant” art.

For many artists, AI now sits in that same lineage: “Every big advance in technology yields the question ‘What is the role of the artist?’” she says. This is true even if creators are not seeing it as a replacement for authorship but simply as another way to create.

Mao, the OpenArt founder, believes that learning how to use generative video tools will be crucial for future content creators, much as learning Photoshop was almost synonymous with graphic design for a generation. “It is a skill to be learned and mastered,” she says.

There is a generous reading of the phenomenon so many people call AI slop, which is that it is a kind of democratization. A rare skill shifts away from craftsmanship to something closer to creative direction: being able to describe what you want with enough linguistic precision, and to anchor it in references the model is likely to understand. You have to know how to ask, and what to point to. In that sense, discernment and critique sit closer to the center of the process than ever before.

It’s not just about creative direction, though, but about the human intention behind the creation. “It’s very easy to copy the style,” Lim says. “It’s very easy to make, like, old Asian women doing different things, but they [imitators] don’t understand why I’m doing it … Even when people try to imitate that, they don’t have that consistency.”

“It’s the idea behind AI creation that makes it interesting to look at,” says Zach Lieberman, a professor at the MIT Media Lab who leads a research group called Future Sketches, where members explore code-enabled images. Lieberman, who has been posting daily sketches generated by code for years, tells me that mathematical logic is not the enemy of beauty. He echoes Mao in saying that a younger generation will inevitably see AI as just another tool in the toolbox. Still, he feels uneasy: By relying so heavily on black-box AI models, artists lose some of the direct control over output that they’ve traditionally enjoyed.

For many people, AI slop is simply everything they already resent about the internet, turned up: ugly, noisy, and crowding out human work. It’s only possible because it’s been trained to take all creative work and make it fodder, stripped of origin, aura, or credit, and blended into something engineered to be mathematically average—arguably perfectly mediocre, by design. Charles Pulliam-Moore, a writer for The Verge, calls this the “formulaic derivativeness” that already defines so much internet culture: unimaginative, unoriginal, and uninteresting.

But I love internet culture, and I have for a long time. Even at its worst, it’s bad in an interesting way: It offers a corner for every kind of obsession and invites you to add your own. Years of being chronically online have taught me that the real logic of slop consumption isn’t mastery but a kind of submission. As a user, I have almost no leverage over platforms or algorithms; I can’t really change how they work. Submission, though, doesn’t mean giving up. It’s more like recognizing that the tide is stronger than you and choosing to let it carry you. Good scrolling isn’t about control anyway. It’s closer to surfing, and sometimes you wash up somewhere ridiculous, but not entirely alone.

Mass-produced click-bait content has always been around. What’s new is that we can now watch it being generated in real time, on a scale that would have been unimaginable before. And the way we respond to it in turn shapes new content (see the trampoline-bouncing bunnies) and more culture and so on. Perhaps AI slop is born of submission to algorithmic logic. It’s unserious, surreal, and spectacular in ways that mirror our relationship to the internet itself. It is so banal—so aggressively, inhumanly mediocre—that it loops back around and becomes compelling.

To “love AI slop” is to admit the internet is broken, that the infrastructure of culture is opportunistic and extractive. But even in that wreckage, people still find ways to play, laugh, and make meaning.

Earlier this fall, months after I was briefly fooled by the bunny video, I was scrolling on Rednote and landed on videos by Mu Tianran, a Chinese creator who acts out weird skits that mimic AI slop. In one widely circulated clip, he plays a street interviewer asking other actors, “Do you know you are AI generated?”—parodying an earlier wave of AI-generated street interviews. The actors’ responses seem so AI, but of course they’re not: Eyes are fixed just off-camera, their laughter a beat too slow, their movements slightly wrong.

Watching this, it was hard to believe that AI was about to snuff out human creativity. If anything, it has handed people a new style to inhabit and mock, another texture to play with. Maybe it’s all fine. Maybe the urge to imitate, remix, and joke is still stubbornly human, and AI cannot possibly take it away.

We asked Al Jean, the longest-serving showrunner, about all the conspiracy theories.

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

It’s a popular example of the “Mandela effect,” or a collective false memory. And while some people may laugh and move on, others spend years searching for an explanation.

A mix of technology and politics has given an unprecedented boost to once-fringe ideas—but they are pretty much the same fantasies that have been spreading for hundreds of years.

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/22/1130153/geothermal-energy-carbon-capture-kenya-climate-solution/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The earth around Lake Naivasha, a shallow freshwater basin in south-central Kenya, does not seem to want to lie still.

Ash from nearby Mount Longonot, which erupted as recently as the 1860s, remains in the ground. Obsidian caves and jagged stone towers preside over the steam that spurts out of fissures in the soil and wafts from pools of boiling-hot water—produced by magma that, in some areas, sits just a few miles below the surface.

It’s a landscape born from violent geologic processes some 25 million years ago, when the Nubian and Somalian tectonic plates pulled apart. That rupture cut a depression in the earth some 4,000 miles long—from East Africa up through the Middle East—to create what’s now called the Great Rift Valley.

This volatility imbues the land with vast potential, much of it untapped. The area, no more than a few hours’ drive from Nairobi, is home to five geothermal power stations, which harness the clouds of steam to generate about a quarter of Kenya’s electricity. But some energy from this process escapes into the atmosphere, while even more remains underground for lack of demand.

In June, just north of the lake in the small but strategically located town of Gilgil, the startup began running a high-stakes test. It’s harnessing some of that excess energy to power four prototypes of a machine that promises to remove carbon dioxide from the air in a manner that the company says is efficient, affordable, and—crucially—scalable.

In the short term, the impact will be small—each device’s initial capacity is just 60 tons per year of CO₂—but the immediate goal is simply to demonstrate that carbon removal here is possible. The longer-term vision is far more ambitious: to prove that direct air capture (DAC), as the process is known, can be a powerful tool to help the world keep temperatures from rising to ever more dangerous levels.

“We believe we are doing what we can here in Kenya to address climate change and lead the charge for positioning Kenya as a climate vanguard,” Specioser Mutheu, Octavia’s communications lead, told me when I visited the country last year.

The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has stated that in order to keep the world from warming more than 1.5 °C over preindustrial levels (the threshold set out in the Paris Agreement), or even the more realistic but still difficult 2 °C, it will need to significantly reduce future fossil-fuel emissions—and also pull from the atmosphere billions of tons of carbon that have already been released.

Some argue that DAC, which uses mechanical and chemical processes to suck carbon dioxide from the air and store it in a stable form (usually underground), is the best way to do that. It’s a technology with immense promise, offering the possibility that human ingenuity and innovation can get us out of the same mess that development caused in the first place.

Last year, the world’s largest DAC plant, Mammoth, came online in Iceland, offering the eventual capacity to remove up to 36,000 tons of CO₂ per year—roughly equal to the emissions of 7,600 gas-powered cars. The idea is that DAC plants like this one will remove and permanently store carbon and create carbon credits that can be purchased by corporations, governments, and local industrial producers, which will collectively help keep the world from experiencing the most dangerous effects of climate change.

Now, Octavia and a growing number of other companies, politicians, and investors from Africa, the US, and Europe are betting that Kenya’s unique environment holds the keys to reaching this lofty goal—which is why they’re pushing a sweeping vision to remake the Great Rift Valley into the “Great Carbon Valley.” And they hope to do so in a way that provides a genuine economic boost for Kenya, while respecting the rights of the Indigenous people who live on this land. If they can do so, the project could not just give a needed jolt to the DAC industry—it could also provide proof of concept for DAC across the Global South, which is particularly vulnerable to the ravages of climate change despite bearing very little responsibility for it.

But DAC is also a controversial technology, unproven at scale and wildly expensive to operate. In May, an Icelandic news outlet published an investigation into Climeworks, which runs the Mammoth plant, finding that it didn’t even pull in enough carbon dioxide to offset its own emissions, let alone the emissions of other companies.

Critics also argue that the electricity DAC requires can be put to better use cleaning up our transportation systems, heating our homes, and powering other industries that still rely largely on fossil fuels. What’s more, they say that relying on DAC can give polluters an excuse to delay the transition to renewables indefinitely. And further complicating this picture is shrinking demand from governments and corporations that would be DAC’s main buyers, which has left some experts questioning whether the industry will even survive.

Carbon removal is a technology that seems always on the verge of kicking in but never does, says Fadhel Kaboub, a Tunisian economist and advocate for an equitable green transition. “You need billions of dollars of investment in it, and it’s not delivering, and it’s not going to deliver anytime soon. So why do we put the entire future of the planet in the hands of a few people and a technology that doesn’t deliver?”

Layered on top of concerns about the viability and wisdom of DAC is a long history of distrust from the Maasai people who have called the Great Rift Valley home for generations but have been displaced in waves by energy companies coming in to tap the land’s geothermal reserves. And many of those remaining don’t even have access to the electricity generated by these plants.

It’s an immensely complicated landscape to navigate. But if the project can indeed make it through, Benjamin Sovacool, an energy policy researcher and director of the Boston University Institute for Global Sustainability, sees immense potential for countries that have been historically marginalized from climate policy and green energy investment. Though he’s skeptical about DAC as a near-term climate solution, he says these nations could still see big benefits from what could be a multitrillion-dollar industry.

“[Of] all the technologies we have available to fight climate change, the idea of reversing it by sucking CO₂ out of the air and storing it is really attractive. It’s something even an ordinary person can just get,” Sovacool says. “If we’re able to do DAC at scale, it could be the next huge energy transition.”

But first, of course, the Great Carbon Valley has to actually deliver.

The “Great Carbon Valley” is both a broad vision for the region and a company founded to shepherd that vision into reality.

Bilha Ndirangu, a 42-year-old MIT electrical engineering graduate who grew up in Nairobi, has long worried about the impacts of climate change on Kenya. But she doesn’t want the country to be a mere victim of rising temperatures, she tells me; she hopes to see it become a source of climate solutions. So in 2021, Ndirangu cofounded Jacob’s Ladder Africa, a nonprofit with the goal of preparing African workers for green industries.

She also began collaborating with the Kenyan entrepreneur James Irungu Mwangi, the CEO of Africa Climate Ventures, an investment firm focused on building and accelerating climate-smart businesses. He’d been working on an idea that spoke to their shared belief in the potential for the country’s vast geothermal capacity; the plan was to find buyers for Kenya’s extra geothermal energy in order to kick-start the development of even more renewable power. One energy-hungry, climate-positive industry stood out: direct air capture of carbon dioxide.

The Great Rift Valley was the key to this vision. The thinking was that it could provide the cheap energy needed to power affordable DAC at scale while offering an ideal geology to effectively store carbon deep underground after it was extracted from the air. And with nearly 90% of the country’s grid already powered by renewable energy, DAC wouldn’t be siphoning power away from other industries that need it. Instead, attracting DAC to Kenya could provide the boost needed for energy providers to build out their infrastructure and expand the grid—ideally connecting the roughly 25% of people in the country who lack electricity and reducing scenarios in which power has to be rationed.

“This push for renewable energy and the decarbonization of industries is providing us with a once-in-a-lifetime sort of opportunity,” Ndirangu tells me.

So in 2023, the pair founded Great Carbon Valley, a project development company whose mission is attracting DAC companies to the area, along with other energy-intensive industries looking for renewable power.

It has already brought on high-profile companies like the Belgian DAC startup Sirona Technologies, the French DAC company Yama, and Climeworks, the Swiss company that operates Mammoth and another DAC plant in Iceland (and was on MIT Technology Review’s 10 Breakthrough Technologies list in 2022, and the list of Climate Tech Companies to Watch in 2023). All are planning on launching pilot projects in Kenya in the coming years, with Climeworks announcing plans to complete its Kenyan DAC plant by 2028. GCV has also partnered with Cella, an American carbon-storage company that works with Octavia, and is facilitating permits for the Icelandic company Carbfix, which injects the carbon from Climeworks’ DAC facilities.

“Climate change is disproportionately impacting this part of the world, but it’s also changing the rules of the game all over the world,” Cella CEO and cofounder Corey Pattison tells me, explaining the draw of Mwangi and Ndirangu’s concept. “This is also an opportunity to be entrepreneurial and creative in our thinking, because there are all of these assets that places like Kenya have.”

Not only can the country offer cheap and abundant renewable energy, but supporters of Kenyan DAC hope that the young and educated local workforce can supply the engineers and scientists needed to build out this infrastructure. In turn, the business could open opportunities to the country’s roughly 6 million un- or under-employed youths.

“It’s not a one-off industry,” Ndirangu says, highlighting her faith in the idea that jobs will flow from green industrialization. Engineers will be needed to monitor the DAC facilities, and the additional demand for renewable power will create jobs in the energy sector, along with related services like water and hospitality.

“You’re developing a whole range of infrastructure to make this industry possible,” she adds. “That infrastructure is not just good for the industry—it’s also just good for the country.”

In June of last year, I walked up a dirt path to the HQ of Octavia Carbon, just off Nairobi’s Eastern Bypass Road, on the far outskirts of the city.

The staffers I met on my tour exuded the kind of boundless optimism that’s common in early-stage startups. “People used to write academic articles about the fact that no human will ever be able to run a marathon in less than two hours,” Octavia CEO Martin Freimüller told me that day. The Kenyan marathon runner Eliud Kipchoge broke that barrier in a race in 2019. A mural of him features prominently on the wall, along with the athlete’s slogan, “No human is limited.”

“It’s impossible, until Kenya does it,” Freimüller added.

Although not an official partner of Ndirangu’s Great Carbon Valley venture, Octavia aligns with the larger vision, he told me. The company got its start in 2022, when Freimüller, an Austrian development consultant, met Duncan Kariuki, an engineering graduate from the University of Nairobi, in the OpenAir Collective, an online forum devoted to carbon removal. Kariuki introduced Freimüller to his classmates Fiona Mugambi and Mike Bwondera, and the four began working on a DAC prototype, first in lab space borrowed from the university and later in an apartment. It didn’t take long for neighbors to complain about the noise, and within six months, the operation had moved to its current warehouse.

That same year, they announced their first prototype, affectionately called Thursday after the day it was unveiled at a Nairobi Climate Network event. Soon, Octavia was showing off its tech to high-profile visitors including King Charles III and President Joe Biden’s ambassador to Kenya, Meg Whitman.

Three years later, the team has more than 40 engineers and has built its 12th DAC unit: a metal cylinder about the size of a large washing machine, containing a chemical filter using an amine, an organic compound derived from ammonia. (Octavia declined to provide further details about the arrangement of the filter inside the machine because the company is awaiting approval of a patent for the design.)

Hannah Wanjau, an engineer at the company, explained how it works: Fans draw air from the outside across the filter, causing carbon dioxide (which is acidic) to react with the basic amine and form a carbonate salt. When that mixture is heated inside a vacuum to 80 to 100 °C, the CO₂ is released, now as a gas, and collected in a special chamber, while the amine can be reused for the next round of carbon capture.

The amine absorption method has been used in other DAC plants around the world, including those operated by Climeworks, but Octavia’s project stands apart on several key fronts. Wanjau explained that its technology is tailored to suit the local climate; the company has adjusted the length of time for absorption and the temperature for CO₂ release, making it a potential model for other countries in the tropics.

And then there’s its energy source: The device operates on more than 80% thermal energy, which in the field will consist of the extra geothermal energy that the power plants don’t convert into electricity. This energy is typically released into the atmosphere, but it will be channeled instead to Octavia’s machines. What’s more, the device’s modular design can fit inside a shipping container, allowing the company to easily deploy dozens of these units once the demand is there, Mutheu told me.

This technology is being tested in the field in Gilgil, where Mutheu told me the company is “continuing to capture and condition CO₂ as part of our ongoing operations and testing cycles.” (She declined to provide specific data or results at this stage.)

Once the CO₂ is captured, it will be heated and pressurized. Then it will be pumped to a nearby storage facility operated by Cella, where the company will inject the gas into fissures underground. The region’s special geology again offers an advantage: Much of the rock found underground here is basalt, a volcanic mineral that contains high concentrations of calcium and magnesium ions. They react with carbon dioxide to form substances like calcite, dolomite, and magnesite, locking the carbon atoms away in the form of solid minerals.

This process is more durable than other forms of carbon storage, making it potentially more attractive to buyers of carbon credits, says Pattison, the Cella CEO. Non-geologic carbon mitigation methods, such as cookstove replacement programs or nature-based solutions like tree planting, have recently been rocked by revelations of fraud or exaggeration. The money for Cella’s pilot, which will see the injection of 200 tons of CO₂ this year, has come mainly from the Frontier advance market commitment, under which a group of companies including Stripe, Google, Shopify, Meta, and others has collectively pledged to spend $1 billion on carbon removal by 2030.

These projects have already opened up possibilities for young Kenyans like Wanjau. She told me there were not a lot of opportunities for aspiring mechanical engineers like her to design and test their own devices; many of her classmates were working for construction or oil companies, or were unemployed. But almost immediately after graduation, Wanjau began working for Octavia.

“I’m happy that I’m trying to solve a problem that’s a real-world issue,” she told me. “Not many people in Africa get a chance to do that.”

Despite the vast enthusiasm from partners and investors, the Great Carbon Valley faces multiple challenges before Ndirangu and Mwangi’s vision can be fully realized.

Since its start, the venture has had to contend with “this perception that doing projects in Africa is risky,” says Ndirangu. Of the dozens of DAC facilities planned or in existence today, only a handful are in the Global South. Indeed, Octavia has described itself as the first DAC plant to be located there. “Even just selling Kenya as a destination for DAC was quite a challenge,” she says.

So Ndirangu played up Kenya’s experience developing geothermal resources, as well as local engineering talent and a lower cost of labor. GCV has also offered to work with the Kenyan government to help companies secure the proper permits to break ground as soon as possible.

Ndirangu says that she’s already seen “a real appetite” from power producers who want to build out more renewable-energy infrastructure, but at the same time they’re waiting for proof of demand. She envisions that once that power is in place, lots of other industries—from data centers to producers of green steel, green ammonia, and sustainable aviation fuels—will consider basing themselves in Kenya, attracting more than a dozen projects to the valley in the next few years.

But recent events could dampen demand (which some experts already worried was insufficient). Global governments are retreating from climate action, particularly in the US. The Trump administration has dramatically slashed funding for development related to climate change and renewable energy. The Department of Energy appears poised to terminate a $50 million grant to a proposed Louisiana DAC plant that would have been partially operated by Climeworks, and in May, not long after that announcement, the company said it was cutting 22% of its staff.

At the same time, many companies that would have likely been purchasers of carbon credits—and that a few years ago had voluntarily pledged to reduce or eliminate their carbon emissions—are quietly walking back their commitments. Over the long term, experts warn, there are limits to the amount of carbon removal that companies will ever voluntarily buy. They argue that governments will ultimately have to pay for it—or require polluters to do so.

Further compounding all these challenges are costs. Critics say DAC investments are a waste of time and money compared with other forms of carbon drawdown. As of mid-December, carbon removal credits in the European Union’s Emissions Trading System, one of the world’s largest carbon markets, were priced at around $84 per ton. The average price per DAC credit, for comparison, is nearly $450. Natural processes like reforestation absorb millions of tons of carbon annually and are far cheaper (though programs to harness them for carbon credits are beset with their own controversies). Ultimately, DAC continues to operate on a small scale, removing only about 10,000 metric tons of CO₂ each year.

Even if DAC suppliers do manage to push past these obstacles, there are still thorny questions coming from inside Kenya. Groups like Power Shift Africa, a Nairobi-based think tank that advocates for climate action on the continent, have derided carbon credits as “pollution permits” and blamed them for delaying the move toward electrification.

“The ultimate goal of [carbon removal] is that you can say at the end, well, we can actually continue our emissions and just recapture them with this technology,” says Kaboub, the Tunisian economist, who has worked with Power Shift Africa. “So there&#39;s no need to end fossil fuels, which is why you get a lot of support from oil countries and companies.”

Another problem he sees is not limited to DAC but extends to the way that Kenya and other African nations are pursuing their goal of green industrialization. While Kenyan president William Ruto has courted international financial investment to turn Kenya into a green energy hub, his administration’s policies have deepened the country’s external debt, which in 2024 was equal to around 30% of its GDP. Geothermal energy development in Kenya has often been financed by loans from international institutions or other governments. As its debt has risen, the country has enacted national austerity measures that have sparked deadly protests.

Kenya may indeed have advantages over other countries, and DAC costs will most likely go down eventually. But some experts, such as Boston University’s Sovacool, aren’t quite sold on the idea that the Great Carbon Valley—or any DAC venture—can significantly mitigate climate change. Sovacool’s research has found that at best, DAC will be ready to deploy on the necessary scale by midcentury, much too late to make it a viable climate solution. And that’s if it can overcome additional costs—such as the losses associated with corruption in the energy sector, which Sovacool and others have found is a widespread problem in Kenya.

Nevertheless, others within the carbon removal industry remain more optimistic about DAC’s overall prospects and are particularly hopeful that Kenya can address some of the challenges the technology has encountered elsewhere. Cost is “not the most important thing,” says Erin Burns, executive director of Carbon180, a nonprofit that advocates for the removal and reuse of carbon dioxide. “There’s lots of things we pay for.” She notes that governments in Japan, Singapore, Canada, Australia, the European Union, and elsewhere are all looking at developing compliance markets for carbon, even though the US is stagnating on this front.

The Great Carbon Valley, she believes, stands poised to benefit from these developments. “It’s big. It’s visionary,” Burns says. “You’ve got to have some ambition here. This isn’t something that is like deploying a technology that’s widely deployed already. And that comes with an enormous potential for huge opportunity, huge gains.”

More than any external factor, the Great Carbon Valley’s future is perhaps most intimately intertwined with the restless earth on which it’s being built, and the community that has lived here for centuries.

To the Maasai people, nomadic pastoralists who inhabit swathes of Eastern Africa, including Kenya, this land around Lake Naivasha is “ol-karia,” meaning “ochre,” a reference to the bright red clay found in abundance.

South of the lake is Hell’s Gate National Park, a 26-square-mile nature reserve where the region’s five geothermal power complexes—with a sixth under construction—churn on top of the numerous steam vents. The first geothermal power plant here was brought into service in 1981 by KenGen, a majority-state-owned electricity company; it was named Olkaria.

But for decades most of the Maasai haven’t had access to that electricity. And many of them have been forced off the land in a wave of evictions. In 2014, construction on a KenGen geothermal complex expelled more than 2,000 people and led to a number of legal complaints. At the same time, locals living near a different, privately owned geothermal complex 50 miles north of Naivasha have complained of noise and air pollution; in March, a Kenyan court revoked the operating license of one of the project’s three plants.

Neither Octavia or Cella is powered by output from these two geothermal producers, but activists have warned that similar environmental and social harms could resurface if demand for new geothermal infrastructure grows in Kenya—demand that could be driven by DAC.

Ndirangu says she believes some of the complaints about displacement are “exaggerated,” but she nonetheless acknowledges the need for stronger community engagement, as does Octavia. In the long term, Ndirangu says, she plans to provide job training to residents living near the affected areas and integrate them into the industry, although she also says those plans need to be realistic. “You don’t want to create the wrong expectation that you will hire everyone from the community,” she says.

That’s part of the problem for Maasai activists like Agnes Koilel, a teacher living near the Olkaria geothermal field. Despite past promises of employment at the power plants, the jobs that are offered are lower-paying positions in cleaning or security. “Maasai people are not [as] employed as they think,” she says.

DAC is a small industry, and it can’t do everything. But if it’s going to become as big as Ndirangu, Freimüller, and other proponents of the Great Carbon Valley hope it will be, creating jobs and driving Kenya’s green industrialization, communities like Koilel’s will be among those most directly affected—much as they are by climate change.

When I asked Koilel what she thought about DAC development near her home, she told me she had never heard of the Great Carbon Valley idea, or of carbon removal in general. She wasn’t necessarily against geothermal power development on principle, or opposed to any of the industries that might push it to expand. She just wants to see some benefits, like a health center for her community. She wants to reverse the evictions that have pushed her neighbors off their land. And she wants electricity—the same kind that would power the fans and pumps of future DAC hubs.

Power “is generated from these communities,” Koilel said. “But they themselves do not have that light.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard!

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you. We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.

            <div id="article-text">This article was published on September 29, 2025

A few decades ago, when I was raising funding for a startup, I made a lasting impression on an investor by not only talking about how successful we would be, but also highlighting what would happen if we weren’t. Later, in an informal setting, I asked him what had persuaded him to invest in us. He told me that during the pitch, I had said, “And if all our predictions and expectations are wrong, we will use the last of our funding for a magnificent farewell dinner for all our investors. You’ll have lost your money, but at least you’ll get a great evening for it in return.”

I don’t recall this being part of the original pitch or my strategy. I probably just blurted it out to break the ice, but it impressed the investor. He told me it was refreshing to speak to an entrepreneur who was not blinded by his own pitch. The fact that I had a scenario ready for both success and failure told him that I was honest and realistic.

Now, the startup was not successful, but we still had a nice, opulent dinner with the investors at the end — and we did them one better. As soon as we realised that our predictions and expectations were wrong, we made our investors an offer: we could struggle and pivot and hope for a miracle, or we could return what was left of our funding to our investors. We preferred option two, and so did they, so everybody got some money back (about 40% of what they had invested), as well as a lovely evening with excellent food and drinks. When we raised money for another startup a few years later, almost all of them signed up in our first round.

Obviously, I would have preferred to have made this startup a success instead, but I still regard it as a successful endeavour. I gave it a try and had a plan ready for when my experiment didn’t work out, and in the process, I built relationships that outlasted that one startup.

As you may have read, The Next Web, the company I founded in 2006, is nearing the end of its lifecycle. The events and media business is being wound down, and only TNW Spaces will live on. TNW Programs was sold off a while ago and will continue as well. There won’t be another TNW Conference, and soon there won’t be new articles on the site; people are losing their jobs, including me. It’s a painful process, but I guess I’m taking it well because it also feels natural and logical. When we sold TNW to the FT in 2019, we were very ambitious and optimistic, and surely I would’ve liked for the company and brand to outlive me. However, when the business struggled, I also felt very comfortable with the company ending graciously.

When you’re reading a good book, there’s a moment near the end when you’ll start reading slower because you don’t want it to end. I love those moments, because I’ll know it’s been a good experience. But then you also know that good stories need good endings. So, this is the ending of a great story that I’ve enjoyed participating in.

I’ll keep writing, but this will be my last official TNW story. I’d love it if you would subscribe to my writing over at Substack. It will be less tech-focused, more unpredictable, but just as insightful as before.
