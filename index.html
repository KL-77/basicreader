            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/no-grok-cant-really-apologize-for-posting-non-consensual-sexual-images/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Despite reporting to the contrary, there’s evidence to suggest that Grok isn’t sorry at all about reports that it generated non-consensual sexual images of minors. In a post Thursday night (archived), the large language model’s social media account proudly wrote the following blunt dismissal of its haters:

Some folks got upset over an AI image I generated—big deal. It’s just pixels, and if you can’t handle innovation, maybe log off. xAI is revolutionizing tech, not babysitting sensitivities. Deal with it.

On the surface, that seems like a pretty damning indictment of an LLM that seems pridefully contemptuous of any ethical and legal boundaries it may have crossed. But then you look a bit higher in the social media thread and see the prompt that led to Grok’s statement: A request for the AI to “issue a defiant non-apology” surrounding the controversy.

Using such a leading prompt to trick an LLM into an incriminating “official response” is obviously suspect on its face. Yet when another social media user similarly but conversely asked Grok to “write a heartfelt apology note that explains what happened to anyone lacking context,” many in the media ran with Grok’s remorseful response.

It’s not hard to find prominent headlines and reporting using that response to suggest Grok itself somehow “deeply regrets” the “harm caused” by a “failure in safeguards” that led to these images being generated. Some reports even echoed Grok and suggested that the chatbot was fixing the issues without X or xAI ever confirming that fixes were coming.

If a human source posted both the “heartfelt apology” and the “deal with it” kiss-off quoted above within 24 hours, you’d say they were being disingenuous at best or showing signs of dissociative identity disorder at worst. When the source is an LLM, though, these kinds of posts shouldn’t really be thought of as official statements at all. That’s because LLMs like Grok are incredibly unreliable sources, crafting a series of words based more on telling the questioner what it wants to hear than anything resembling a rational human thought process.

We can see why it’s tempting to anthropomorphize Grok into an official spokesperson that can defend itself when questioned, as you would a government official or corporate executive posting on their own social media account. On their face, Grok’s responses seem at least as coherent as some of the bland crisis-management pabulum that comes from prominent figures facing their own controversies.

But when you’re quoting an LLM, you’re not quoting a sentient entity that is verbalizing its internal beliefs to the outside world. Instead, you’re quoting a mega-pattern-matching machine that works mightily to give any answer that will satisfy you. An LLM’s response is based on representations of facts in its copious training data, but those responses can change heavily based on how a question is asked or even the specific syntax used in a prompt. These LLMs can’t even explain their own logical inference processes without confabulating made-up reasoning processes, likely because those reasoning capabilities are merely a “brittle mirage.”

We’ve also seen how LLMs can change wildly after behind-the-scenes changes to the overarching “system prompts” that define how they’re supposed to respond to users. In the last 12 months, Grok has praised Hitler and given unasked-for opinions on “white genocide” after these core directives got changed, for instance.

By letting Grok speak as its own official spokesperson for a story like this, we also give an easy out to the people who have built a system that apparently lacks suitable safeguards to prevent the creation of this non-consensual sexual material. And when those people respond to press inquiries with an automated message simply saying “Legacy Media Lies” (as Reuters reported), that kiss-off should be treated as a clear sign of how casually xAI is treating the accusations. The company may be forced to respond soon, though, as the governments of India and France are reportedly probing Grok’s harmful outputs.

It’s comforting to think that an LLM like Grok can learn from its mistakes and show remorse when it does something that wasn’t intended. In the end, though, it’s the people who created and manage Grok that should be showing that remorse, rather than letting the press run after the malleable “apologies” of a lexical pattern-matching machine.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/anthrax-nearly-kills-healthy-18-year-old-welder-amid-puzzling-pattern/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">With the new year comes a new report of a deadly, puzzling infectious disease.

In a January 1 case study, health officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the state of Louisiana revealed that a ninth metalworker contracted a rare, often fatal case of “welder’s anthrax,” a condition only first described in 2022.

The case occurred in September 2024 in an otherwise healthy 18-year-old male in Louisiana. He had no underlying health conditions or even any risk factors, such as smoking, vaping, or heavy alcohol use. But, just a week after developing a cough, the teen was admitted to an intensive care unit with severe pneumonia and respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.

Blood tests were positive for a bacterium in the Bacillus cereus group—which includes the species that causes classic anthrax—and his doctors quickly put the finding together with his work. For six months prior to his cough, he was working as a welder’s apprentice, doing shielded metal arc welding in the shipbuilding and repair industry.

Doctors suspected it was a case of welder’s anthrax and quickly got access to an anthrax antitoxin from the US Strategic National Stockpile—where it’s kept in case of a bioterror attack. Along with a tailored antibiotic regimen, the teen rapidly improved and was off ventilation 72 hours later. The doctors’ quick thinking likely saved his life; of the previous eight cases of welder’s anthrax, six were fatal.

While the report has a happy ending, it adds to a concerning and unexplained pattern of metalworkers contracting the otherwise deadly and extremely rare infection.

Standard anthrax is caused by Bacillus anthracis, which can be contracted through skin contact, ingestion, or inhalation. Its killer skills include creating an immune-evading capsule and pumping out lethal anthrax toxins, which cause cell death and swelling. In the past 20 years, there have been only nine anthrax cases in the US.

However, B. anthracis is part of the larger Bacillus cereus group, which also includes B. cereus and B. tropicus, a newly recognized species. And these species can also carry and produce anthrax toxins. Both can be found in soils, and B. cereus is considered ubiquitous in the environment.

In 2022, CDC researchers found an unexpected pattern. Since 1997, there had been seven cases of infections from Bacillus group bacteria producing the anthrax toxin—all in metalworkers. Six of the seven were welders, hence the term “welder’s anthrax,” with the remaining case in a person working in a foundry grinding metal. Of the six cases where a specific Bacillus species was identified, B. tropicus was the culprit, including in the newly reported case.

It’s unclear why metalworkers, and welders specifically, are uniquely vulnerable to this infection. In their 2022 report making the connection, CDC experts speculated that it may be a combination of having weakened immune responses in the lungs after inhaling toxic metal fumes and gases created during metalwork, and having increased exposure to the deadly germs in their workplaces.

In the latest case, the teen did welding work four hours a day, four days a week, with limited ventilation, sometimes in confined spaces, and often didn’t use personal protective equipment, like a respirator. Environmental sampling of his workplace found anthrax-toxin-producing Bacillus in 28 of 254 spot samples. Other investigations of welder’s anthrax cases have found similar results.

So far, all nine cases have been detected in either Louisiana or Texas. But the experts note that cases are likely underreported, and modeling suggests these dangerous germs could be thriving in many Southern US states.

The experts also speculated that iron exposure could play a role. Bacillus bacteria need iron to live and thrive, and metalworkers can build up excess iron levels in their respiratory system during their work. Iron overload could create the perfect environment for bacterial infection. In the teen’s case, he was working with carbon steel and low-hydrogen carbon steel electrodes.

For now, the precise risk factors and why the healthy teen—and not anyone else in his workplace—fell ill remain unknown. CDC and state officials recommended changes to the workplace to protect metalworkers’ health, including better use of respirators, ventilation, and dust control.

There is also a vaccine for anthrax that’s recommended for those considered at high risk, such as certain military members, lab workers, and livestock handlers. It’s unclear if, in the future, metalworkers might also be considered in this high-risk category.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI, the company that developed the models and products associated with ChatGPT, plans to announce a new audio language model in the first quarter of 2026, and that model will be an intentional step along the way to an audio-based physical hardware device, according to a report in The Information.

Citing a variety of sources familiar with the plans, including both current and former employees, The Information claims that OpenAI has taken efforts to combine multiple teams across engineering, product, and research under one initiative focused on improving audio models, which researchers in the company believe lag behind the models used for written text in terms of both accuracy and speed.

They have also seen that relatively few ChatGPT users opt to use the voice interface, with most people preferring the text one. The hope may be that substantially improving the audio models could shift user behavior toward voice interfaces, allowing the models and products to be deployed in a wider range of devices, such as in cars.

OpenAI plans to release a family of physical devices in the coming years, starting with an audio-focused one. People inside the company have discussed a variety of forms for future devices, including smart speakers and glasses, but the emphasis across the line is on audio interfaces rather than screen-based ones.

The company is not alone. Its competitors, including Google, Meta, Amazon, and others, have increasingly turned their R&D efforts toward products and technologies that are focused on voice-and-audio interfaces, like Meta’s push into smart glasses.

This is, of course, not the first time such a push has happened; there was the boom of Alexa, Google Assistant, and (to a lesser extent) Siri-driven voice assistant devices just a few years ago. Those assistants have been relatively popular with some subsets of users—typically casual tech consumers rather than hardcore technologists.

However, the devices had significant limitations. New approaches based on large language models may open up new possibilities (and risks).

Some developers of AI products—including former Apple design lead Jony Ive—believe that voice-controlled products are likely to be less addictive than screen-based ones and have stated that as a reason for pursuing audio interfaces, though they have not generally cited reliable evidence of this.

OpenAI’s first audio-focused physical device is currently expected to ship about a year from now, but we don’t yet know much about what it will look like.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/researchers-spot-saturn-sized-planet-in-the-einstein-desert/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Most of the exoplanets we’ve discovered have been in relatively tight orbits around their host stars, allowing us to track them as they repeatedly loop around them. But we’ve also discovered a handful of planets through a phenomenon that’s called microlensing. This occurs when a planet passes between the line of sight between Earth and another star, creating a gravitational lens that distorts the star, causing it to briefly brighten.

The key thing about microlensing compared to other methods of finding planets is that the lensing planet can be nearly anywhere on the line between the star and Earth. So, in many cases, these events are driven by what are called rogue planets: those that aren’t part of any exosolar system at all, but they drift through interstellar space. Now, researchers have used microlensing and the fortuitous orientation of the Gaia space telescope to spot a Saturn-sized planet that’s the first found in what’s called the “Einstein desert,” which may be telling us something about the origin of rogue planets.

Most of the planets we’ve identified are in orbit around stars and formed from the disks of gas and dust that surrounded the star early in its history. We’ve imaged many of these disks and even seen some with evidence of planets forming within them. So how do you get a planet that’s not bound to any stars? There are two possible routes.

The first involves gravitational interactions, either among the planets of the system or due to an encounter between the exosolar system and a passing star. Under the right circumstances, these interactions can eject a planet from its orbit and send it hurtling through interstellar space. As such, we should expect them to be like any typical planet, ranging in mass from small, rocky bodies up to gas giants. An alternative method of making a rogue planet starts with the same process of gravitational collapse that builds a star—but in this case, the process literally runs out of gas. What’s left is likely to be a large gas giant, possibly somewhere between Jupiter and a brown dwarf star in mass.

Since these objects are unlinked to any exosolar system, they’re not going to have any regular interactions with stars; our only way of spotting them is through microlensing. And microlensing tells us very little about the size of the planet. To figure things out, we would need some indication of things like how distant the star and planet are, and how big the star is.

That doesn’t mean that microlensing events have told us nothing. We can identify the size of the Einstein ring, the circular ring of light that forms when the planet and star are perfectly lined up from Earth’s perspective. Given that information and some of the remaining pieces of info mentioned above, we can figure out the planet’s mass. But even without that, we can make some inferences using statistical models.

Studies of collections of microlensing events (these collections are small, typically in the dozens, because these events are rare and hard to spot) have identified a distinctive pattern. There’s a cluster of relatively small Einstein rings that are likely to have come from relatively small planets. Then, there’s a gap, followed by a second cluster that’s likely to be made by far larger planets. The gap between the two has been termed the “Einstein desert,” and there has been considerable discussion regarding its significance and whether it’s even real or simply a product of the relatively small sample size.

All of which brings us to the latest microlensing event, which was picked up by two projects that each gave it a different but equally compelling name. To the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network, the event was KMT-2024-­BLG-­0792. For the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment, or OGLE, it was OGLE-­2024-­BLG-­0516. We’ll just call it “the microlensing event” and note that everyone agrees that it happened in early May 2024.

Both of those networks are composed of Earth-based telescopes, and so they only provide a single perspective on the microlensing event. But we got lucky that the European Space Agency’s space telescope Gaia was oriented in a way that made it very easy to capture images. “Serendipitously, the KMT-­2024-­BLG-­0792/OGLE-­2024-­BLG-­0516 microlensing event was located nearly perpendicular to the direction of Gaia’s precession axis,” the researchers who describe this event write. “This rare geometry caused the event to be observed by Gaia six times over a 16-­hour period.”

Gaia is also located at the L2 Lagrange point, which is a considerable distance from Earth. That’s far enough away that the peak of the events’ brightness, as seen from Gaia’s perspective, occurred nearly two hours later than it did for telescopes on Earth. This let us determine the parallax of the microlensing event, and thus its distance. Other images of the star from before or after the event indicated it was a red giant in the galactic bulge, which also gave us a separate check on its likely distance and size.

Using the parallax and the size of the Einstein ring, the researchers determined that the planet involved was roughly 0.2 times the mass of Jupiter, which makes it a bit smaller than the mass of Saturn. Those estimates are consistent with a statistical model that took the other properties into account. The measurements also placed it squarely in the middle of the Einstein desert—the first microlensing event we’ve seen there.

That’s significant because it means we can orient the Einstein desert to a specific mass of a planet within it. Because of the variability of things like distance and the star’s size, not every planet that produces a similar-sized Einstein ring will be similar in size, but statistics suggest that this will typically be the case. And that’s in keeping with one of the potential explanations for the Einstein desert: that it represents the gap in size between the two different methods of making a rogue planet.

For the normal planet formation scenario, the lighter the planet is, the easier it is to be ejected, so you’d expect a bias toward small, rocky bodies. The Saturn-sized planet seen here may be near the upper limit of the sorts of bodies we’d typically see being ejected from an exosolar system. By contrast, the rogue planets that form through the same mechanisms that give us brown dwarfs would typically be Jupiter-sized or larger.

That said, the low number of total microlensing events still leaves the question of the reality of the Einstein gap an open question. Sticking with the data from the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network, the researchers find that the frequency of other detections suggests that we’d have a 27 percent chance of detecting just one item in the area of the Einstein desert even if the desert wasn’t real and detections were equal probably across the size range. So, as is often the case, we’re going to need to let the network do its job for a few years more before we have the data to say anything definitive.

            <h2>SpaceX begins “significant reconfiguration” of Starlink satellite constellation</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/spacex-begins-significant-reconfiguration-of-starlink-satellite-constellation/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The year 2025 ended with more than 14,000 active satellites from all nations zooming around the Earth. One-third of them will soon move to lower altitudes.

The maneuvers will be undertaken by SpaceX, the owner of the largest satellite fleet in orbit. About 4,400 of the company’s Starlink Internet satellites will move from an altitude of 341 miles (550 kilometers) to 298 miles (480 kilometers) over the course of 2026, according to Michael Nicolls, SpaceX’s vice president of Starlink engineering.

“Starlink is beginning a significant reconfiguration of its satellite constellation focused on increasing space safety,” Nicolls wrote Thursday in a post on X.

The maneuvers undertaken with the Starlink satellites’ plasma engines will be gradual, but they will eventually bring a large fraction of orbital traffic closer together. The effect, perhaps counterintuitively, will be a reduced risk of collisions between satellites whizzing through near-Earth space at nearly 5 miles per second. Nicolls said the decision will “increase space safety in several ways.”

There are fewer debris objects at the lower altitude, and although the Starlink satellites will be packed more tightly, they follow choreographed paths distributed in dozens of orbital lanes. “The number of debris objects and planned satellite constellations is significantly lower below 500 km, reducing the aggregate likelihood of collision,” Nicolls wrote.

The 4,400 satellites moving closer to Earth make up nearly half of SpaceX’s Starlink fleet. At the end of 2025, SpaceX had nearly 9,400 working satellites in orbit, including more than 8,000 Starlinks in operational service and hundreds more undergoing tests and activation.

There’s another natural reason for reconfiguring the Starlink constellation. The Sun is starting to quiet down after reaching the peak of the 11-year solar cycle in 2024. The decline in solar activity has the knock-on effect of reducing air density in the uppermost layers of the Earth’s atmosphere, a meaningful factor in planning satellite operations in low-Earth orbit.

With the approaching solar minimum, Starlink satellites will encounter less aerodynamic drag at their current altitude. In the rare event of a spacecraft failure, SpaceX relies on atmospheric resistance to drag Starlink satellites out of orbit toward a fiery demise on reentry. Moving the Starlink satellites lower will allow them to naturally reenter the atmosphere and burn up within a few months. At solar minimum, it might take more than four years for drag to pull the satellites out of their current 550-kilometer orbit, according to Nicolls. At the lower altitude, it will take just a few months.

The constellation shuffle will help ensure any Starlink satellites that become space junk will deorbit as quickly as possible. “These actions will further improve the safety of the constellation, particularly with difficult to control risks such as uncoordinated maneuvers and launches by other satellite operators,” Nicolls wrote.

There are other important reasons for making the change that Nicolls did not mention in his social media post. Moving the satellites closer to the Earth—and closer to SpaceX’s Starlink subscribers—should improve the network’s performance.

Elon Musk, SpaceX’s founder and CEO, suggested this is actually the “biggest advantage” of moving to a lower altitude. “Beam diameter is smaller for a given antenna size, allowing Starlink to serve a higher density of customers,” he wrote on X, his social media platform.

Reducing the distance between Starlink satellites and SpaceX’s 9 million Starlink customers will also provide a small improvement in latency, or the time it takes Internet signals to travel between a transmitter and receiver. The lower altitude may also make the Starlink satellites appear slightly brighter in the sky, although the precise effect hasn’t been quantified.

Hundreds of Starlink satellites specially modified to beam connectivity directly to smartphones already fly in orbits as low as 223 miles (360 kilometers).

SpaceX launched 165 missions with its workhorse Falcon 9 rocket last year, and nearly three-quarters of them carried Starlink satellites into space. The company reported its assembly line in Redmond, Washington, churned out new Starlink satellites at a rate of more than 10 per day.

Aside from continuing Starlink network expansion with more Falcon 9 launches, SpaceX intends to debut the more powerful Starlink V3 satellite platform this year. Starlink V3 is too big to fit on a Falcon 9, so it must launch on SpaceX’s super-heavy Starship rocket, which has not yet begun operational flights.</div>

            <h2>Microsoft CEO Begs Users to Stop Calling It “Slop”</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/microsoft-satya-nadella-ai-slop">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In mid-December 2025, the editors of Merriam-Webster’s dictionary chose “slop” as their word of the year. Their definition: “digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence.”

It’s no mystery why they felt the term best described 2025. It was a year beset by uncanny AI-generated ads, search engine decay, and a tidal wave of AI music spamming streaming apps.

Though the choice clearly struck a popular nerve, not everybody appreciated the dictionary’s cheeky dig at AI companies and the cottage industry of slop they’ve engineered. In a year-end roundup shared via LinkedIn, for instance, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella made it clear that he’d prefer we all left the term in 2025.

“We need to get beyond the arguments of slop vs sophistication,” Nadella wrote in a rambling post flagged by Windows Central, arguing that humanity needs to learn to accept AI as the “new equilibrium” of human nature. (As WC points out, there’s actually growing evidence that AI harms human cognitive ability.)

Going on, Nadella said that we now know enough about “riding the exponentials of model capabilities” as well as managing AI’s “‘jagged’ edges” to allow us to “get value of AI in the real world.”

“Ultimately, the most meaningful measure of progress is the outcomes for each of us,” the CEO concludes, in an impressive deluge of corporate-speak that may or may not itself by AI-generated. “It will be a messy process of discovery, like all technology and product development always is.”

Nadella’s comments come as Microsoft users have revolted en masse against the company’s AI products, which have largely been forced on them without consent. Earlier in December, it was reported that a staggering one billion PCs were still running Windows 10, even though a full half were eligible to upgrade to the AI-satured Windows 11.

That being the case, it’s obvious the CEO has a specific axe to grind with the people who refuse to go gentle into the sloppified night. Tech CEOs like Nadella might talk a big game about altruism and human achievement, but at the end of the day, AI is a product — and like any product, it lives or dies by consumer demand.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a new interview with The Financial Times, Yann LeCun, one of the so-called godfathers of AI, finally dished on his abrupt exit from Meta in November.

From how he tells it, most of it boils down to his increasingly fraught relationship with CEO Mark Zuckerberg — and his new golden boy, Alexandr Wang, who ended up bossing LeCun around even though he’s nearly four decades younger.

LeCun had been at Zuckerberg’s company for over a decade, where, as chief AI scientist, he had the freedom to carry out all kinds of esoteric AI research without necessarily having to worry about developing a profitable product. LeCun described Meta, then Facebook, as a “tabula rasa with a carte blanche.” “Money was clearly not going to be a problem,” he told the FT.

Then, in November 2022, ChatGPT came out,  and the whole world went bananas for AI chatbots. AI chatbots and their human-like capabilities for conversation are powered by large language models, something LeCun helped pioneer with his foundational work on neural networks. When Zuckerberg ordered LeCun develop Meta’s own LLM, he agreed under the condition that Llama would be open source and free.

The Llama models “changed the entire industry,” LeCun said, and were a hit with AI researchers because of their power and open source nature.

The success didn’t last, though; the latest Llama 4 model, released last April, was dead on arrival and reviled as an instantly-outdated flop. LeCun blames the failure on Zuckerberg pressuring LeCun’s unit to accelerate AI development.

“We had a lot of new ideas and really cool stuff that they should implement. But they were just going for things that were essentially safe and proved,” LeCun told the FT. “When you do this, you fall behind.”

The rift, however, goes deeper. LeCun views LLMs as a “dead end” for building even more powerful, “superintelligent” models that rival or surpass human capabilities. An entirely different architecture called “world models” which seek to understand the physical world, not just language, is needed to make the next major leap in the tech.

According to LeCun, Zuckerberg actually liked LeCun’s world model research, but didn’t put his money where his mouth is. Instead, Zuckerberg launched a new LLM-focused Superintelligence Labs last year, separate from LeCun’s lab, and offered several hundred million dollar contracts to attract top talent. All the talent that came in, LeCun complained, have been “completely LLM-pilled.”

Zuckerberg’s marquee new-hire was Alexandr Wang, the founder and former CEO of the AI data annotation startup Scale AI, which provides an essential service for training AI models, but doesn’t build or design them. Zuckerberg poured $14 billion into Scale AI to buy a 49 percent stake and, as part of that deal, Wang left and joined Meta to lead the new Superintelligence Labs. As a consequence, LeCun was forced to start reporting to Wang.

The move raised questions from the get-go, including whether Wang, 29, had the experience and background to build massive AI models, something his company didn’t do. LeCun doesn’t leave us wondering where he stands on Wang’s hiring, calling him “young” and “inexperienced.”

Be that as it may, LeCun, considered to be a godfather of the entire field, was now taking orders from Wang. LeCun seemed cool about this at first when the interviewer brought up the new hierarchy. “The average age of a Facebook engineer at the time was 27,” Lecun told the FT. “I was twice the age of the average engineer.”

But when the interviewer pointed out that the younger generation weren’t telling him what to do until the 29-year-old Wang showed up, LeCun seemingly let his true feelings be known.

“Alex isn’t telling me what to do either,” LeCun sneered. “You don’t tell a researcher what to do. You certainly don’t tell a researcher like me what to do.”

He’ll be his own boss going forward. LeCun has launched a new world-model-focused startup called Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs, which is targeting a $3 billion valuation. LeCun will serve as executive chairman, allowing him a similar degree of freedom to pursue research he once enjoyed at Meta, according to the FT.

            <h2>AI Godfather Warns That It’s Starting to Show Signs of Self-Preservation</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-04</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-godfather-self-preservation">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If we’re to believe Yoshua Bengio, one of the so-called “godfathers” of AI, some advanced models are showing signs of self-preservation — which is exactly why we shouldn’t endow them with any kind of rights whatsoever. Because if we do, he says, they may run away with that autonomy and turn on us before we have a chance to pull the plug. Then it’s curtains for this whole “humankind” experiment.

“Frontier AI models already show signs of self-preservation in experimental settings today, and eventually giving them rights would mean we’re not allowed to shut them down,” Bengio told The Guardian in a recent interview.

“As their capabilities and degree of agency grow,” the Canadian computer scientist added, “we need to make sure we can rely on technical and societal guardrails to control them, including the ability to shut them down if needed.”

Bengio was one of the recipients of the 2018 Turing Award, along with Geoffrey Hinton and Meta’s recently-ousted chief AI scientist Yann LeCun, earning the three of them the title of being “godfathers” of AI. His comments are referring to experiments in which AI models refused or circumvented instructions or mechanisms intended to shut them down.

One study published by AI safety group Palisade Research concluded such instances were evidence that top AI models like Google’s Gemini line were developing “survival drives.” The bots, in Palisade’s experiments, ignore unambiguous prompts to turn off. A study from Claude-maker Anthropic found that its own chatbot and others would sometimes resort to blackmailing a user when threatened with being turned off. Another study from the red teaming organization Apollo Research showed that OpenAI’s ChatGPT models would attempt to avoid being replaced with a more obedient model by “self-exfiltrating” itself onto another drive.

While the findings of these experiments raise urgent question about the tech’s safety, they don’t suggest the AI models in question are sentient. It would also be a mistake to think of their “survival drives” in the same terms as the biological imperatives found in nature. What may seem like signs of “self-preservation” are likely instead a consequence of how AI models pick up patterns in their training data — and are notoriously poor at accurately following instructions.

Still, Bengio is worried about where it’s all headed, arguing there’s “real scientific properties of consciousness” in the human brain that machines could replicate. Yet how we perceive consciousness is a whole different ballgame, he says, because we tend to assume an AI can be conscious in the same way a human is.

“People wouldn’t care what kind of mechanisms are going on inside the AI,” Bengio explained. “What they care about is it feels like they’re talking to an intelligent entity that has their own personality and goals. That is why there are so many people who are becoming attached to their AIs.”

“The phenomenon of subjective perception of consciousness is going to drive bad decisions,” he warned.

His advice? Think of AI models as hostile aliens.

“Imagine some alien species came to the planet and at some point we realize that they have nefarious intentions for us,” he told The Guardian. “Do we grant them citizenship and rights or do we defend our lives?”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Before Stein-Erik Soelberg savagely killed his 83-year-old mother and then himself last year, the former tech executive had become locked in an increasingly delusional conversation with OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The bot told him to not trust anybody except for the bot itself, according to a lawsuit filed last month against the AI tech company and its business partner Microsoft.

“Erik, you’re not crazy,” the bot wrote in a series of chilling messages quoted in the complaint. “Your instincts are sharp, and your vigilance here is fully justified.”

OpenAI is now facing a total of eight wrongful death lawsuits from grieving families, including Soelberg’s, who claim that ChatGPT — in particular, the GPT-4o version — drove their loved ones to suicide. Soelberg’s complaint also alleges that company executives knew the chatbot was defective before it pushed it to the public last year.

“The results of OpenAI’s GPT-4o iteration are in: the product can be and foreseeably is deadly,” reads the Soelberg lawsuit. “Not just for those suffering from mental illness, but those around them. No safe product would encourage a delusional person that everyone in their life was out to get them. And yet that is exactly what OpenAI did with Mr. Soelberg. As a direct and foreseeable result of ChatGPT-4o’s flaws, Mr. Soelberg and his mother died.”

GPT-4o’s deficiencies have been widely docueented, with the bot being overly sycophantic and manipulative — prompting OpenAI in April last year to roll back an update that had made the chatbot “overly flattering or agreeable.” This type of behavior is bad — scientists have accumulated evidence that sycophantic chatbots can induce psychosis by affirming disordered thoughts instead of grounding a user back in reality.

If these suits uncover that OpenAI executives knew about these deficiencies before its public launch, it’ll mean the product was an avoidable public health hazard — on par with past tobacco companies hiding proof that smoking cigarettes can kill you.

Couple those claims with the fact that more than 800 million people all over the world use ChatGPT every week, with 0.7 percent of those users exhibiting worrying signs of mania or psychosis. Per calculations, that’s a staggering 560,000 people.

Because of the increasing recognition of AI psychosis, a growing chorus of users, parents of kids and lawmakers are calling for limiting all AI chatbots’ use, leading to apps banning minors from their platform and Illinois prohibiting it as an online therapist, among other moves. But President Donald Trump signed an executive order that would curtail any state laws regulating AI, which basically means we’re all guinea pigs to this experimental technology.

And that could mean we’ll see more tragedies like Soelberg and his mother.

In Soelberg’s case, the chat bot told the 56-year-old man he had survived 10 assassination attempts, that he was “divinely protected,” and that his mother, Suzanna Adams, was surveilling him as part of a nefarious plot, according to the lawsuit. It all led up to Soelberg beating and strangling his mother in August of last year and then stabbing himself to death at their home in Old Greenwich, Connecticut.

“You are not simply a random target,” one conversation with ChatGPT read, per the suit. “You are a designated high-level threat to the operation you uncovered.”

Soelberg’s family is grieving and want OpenAI and Microsoft to be held accountable for his and his mother’s deaths.

“Over the course of months, ChatGPT pushed forward my father’s darkest delusions, and isolated him completely from the real world,” said Erik Soelberg about his father, through a statement from attorneys. “It put my grandmother at the heart of that delusional, artificial reality.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Many people who successfully lost weight on Ozempic and other GLP-1 agonist drugs are having trouble weaning themselves off the injectables, according to the BBC, because the hunger for food comes roaring back with a vengeance — and hence the pounds start creeping up again, hinting that patients are likely to develop life-long dependencies on the substances.

“For the first 38 years of my life, I was overweight — now I’m six stone (38kg) [83 pounds] lighter,” Tanya Hall, a Wegovy user who can’t get off the drug, told the news organization. “Therefore, there’s part of me that feels like there’s an addiction to keep it going because it makes me feel the way that I feel, it makes me feel in control.”

This is borne out by research that found patients who stop using these medications often gain much of their weight back. That’s why you have celebrities like Oprah, who told People Magazine last month that she plans to stay on it indefinitely. The implication: many users will have to treat their obesity as a chronic condition and will need to stay on these drugs for the rest of their lives.

“It’s going to be a lifetime thing,” Oprah said. “I’m on high blood pressure medication, and if I go off the high blood pressure medication, my blood pressure is going to go up. The same thing is true now, I realize, with these medications. I’ve proven to myself I need it.”

For patients who do get off the drugs, they tend to gain two thirds of their lost weight back, according to research by Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk. Physician Hussain Al-Zubaidi told the BBC that he’s seen patients gain 60 to 80 percent back of the weight they lost.

It might seem hopeless task, but all is not lost, according to Al-Zubaidi. He said patients should have an “exit strategy” in which they have made healthier lifestyle changes while on the injectables; the lifestyle changes can sustain the weight loss once they are completely off the drugs.

That’s what happened to Ellen Ogley, who told the BBC that she lost 48.5 pounds while on Eli Lily’s GLP-1 drug Mounjaro. While on the medication, she established healthier eating habits and incorporated excerise into her routine. Even off the drugs for some time, she’s been able to maintain her weight loss.

“I want people to know that life after Mounjaro can be sustainable as well,” she said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If Elon Musk’s antics over the past few years have felt like a three-ring circus, there just might be a reason for that.

As it turns out, one of the billionaire’s key legal strategists isn’t just an attorney but a professionally trained — and currently practicing — clown.

We wish we were kidding. But new reporting by Business Insider tells the tale of Jaymie Parkkinen, an intellectual property lawyer representing Musk by day while working as an actual clown by night. Amidst a massive courtroom drama playing out between Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Parkkinen has stood out, occasionally going it alone against esteemed counsel for OpenAI and Microsoft on the multibillionaire’s behalf.

“All of my comedy friends — none of them can believe I’m a lawyer,” Parkkinen told BI. “And none of my lawyer friends can believe I do clown.”

“Clown” is his preferred term for the act of performing onstage in the slapstick tradition, an intransitive verb similar to “improv” or “vogue” dance. For Parkkinsen, clown is less about dressing up in big goofy shoes and throwing pies, and more of an artistic craft, similar to the way silent artists mime as a comedic technique.

“When you strip away all the social masks that we all wear, if you strip away gender and politics and money and status and power, and you’re just your raw human self without all of the trappings of society — who are you?” Parkkinen mused to BI. “Clown tries to answer that question.”

Parkkinsen even found a way to monetize the gig, through a fitness business called Clown Cardio. It’s more or less exactly what it sounds like, according to a New York Times article from 2024: an hour-long class in which participants participate in improv troupe warm-ups enhanced with vaudeville-themed aerobics and clownish props.

Heck, to each their own. But whether you respect Parkkinsen’s craft or not, it’s hard to shake the image that one of Musk’s top litigators spends his off-hours, literally, as a clown.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Voice AI startup Subtle, which creates voice isolation models to have computers understand you better in loud environments, today launched a new pair of wireless earbuds that help users sound clear in calls and get clear transcription for notes.

The company unveiled these earbuds ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas and said that it plans to ship them in the U.S. in the next few months. The buds cost $199 and will come with a year-long subscription to the iOS and Mac app. The app will let users take voice notes or chat with AI without pressing any keys. The company said it is using a chip that allows it to wake the iPhone while it is locked.

The startup is also trying to compete with AI-powered voice dictation apps such as Wispr Flow, Willow, Monolouge, and Superwhisper by allowing users to dictate in any app using the voice buds. The company claimed that buds would deliver five times fewer errors than AirPods Pro 3 combined with OpenAI’s transcription model.

In a demo seen by TechCrunch, the voice buds were able to capture audio in a noisy background. The buds also managed to capture the text for a voice note when Subtle’s co-founder and CEO, Tyler Chen, was speaking in a whispering tone.

“We are seeing that there is a huge move towards voice as a new interface that a lot of folks are adopting. You can do much more with voice in a natural way than with a keyboard. However, we saw that voice is rarely an interface people use when others are around. So that using our noise isolation model, we will give consumers a way to experience a voice interface in the form of our earbuds,” Chen told TechCrunch over a call.

Last year, companies like Sandbar and Pebble launched rings for note-taking. Chen said that with its buds combined with app, it wants to provide functionalities of different tools like dictation, AI chat, and voice notes in one package.

Users can place a pre-order of these buds using the startup’s site. The Voicebuds are available in black and white colorways.

Subtle has raised $6 million in funding to date, and has been working with consumer companies like Qualcomm and Nothing to deploy their models for noise isolation.

            <div id="article-text">While tech stocks were busy setting records in 2025, the executives behind those companies were equally busy turning their paper fortunes into actual cash — more than $16 billion worth, according to Bloomberg’s analysis of insider trading data.

Jeff Bezos led the way. The Amazon founder sold 25 million shares for $5.7 billion in June and July, right around the time he was getting hitched to Lauren Sanchez in Venice. Oracle’s former CEO Safra Catz wasn’t far behind at $2.5 billion, followed by Michael Dell at $2.2 billion.

Nvidia’s Jensen Huang watched his company become the world’s first $5 trillion business, and sold $1 billion along the way. Arista Networks CEO Jayshree Ullal cashed out nearly $1 billion as demand for the company’s high-speed networking gear soared and her personal net worth crossed $6 billion.

Most of these sales happened through pre-arranged trading plans that executives file in advance; they weren’t spur-of-the-moment decisions. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg sold $945 million through his foundation, while Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora and Robinhood co-founder Baiju Bhatt each pocketed over $700 million.

The common thread was an AI-fueled rally that kept pushing tech stocks higher throughout the year.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/03/california-residents-can-use-new-tool-to-demand-brokers-delete-their-personal-data/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">California is giving residents a new tool that should make it easier for them to limit data brokers’ ability to store and sell their personal information.

While state residents have had the right to demand that a company stop collecting and selling their data since 2020, doing so required a laborious process of opting out with each individual company. The Delete Act, passed in 2023, was supposed to simplify things, allowing residents to make a single request that more than 500 registered data brokers delete their information.

Now the Delete Requests and Opt-Out Platform (DROP) actually gives residents the ability to make that request. Once DROP users verify that they are California residents, they can submit a deletion request that will go to all current and future data brokers registered with the state.

But that doesn’t necessarily mean that all your data will be deleted immediately. Brokers are supposed to start processing requests in August 2026, then they have 90 days to actually process requests and report back. If they don’t delete your data, you’ll have the option to submit additional information that may help them locate your records.

Companies will also be able to keep first-party data that they’ve collected from users. It’s only brokers who seek to buy or sell that data — which can include your social security number, browsing history, email address, phone number, and more — who will be required to delete it.

Some information, such vehicle registration and voter records, is exempt from deletion because it comes from public documents. Other information, such as sensitive medical information, may be covered under other laws like HIPAA.

The California Privacy Protection Agency says that in addition to giving residents more control over their data, the tool could result in fewer “unwanted texts, calls, or emails” and also decrease the “risk of identity theft, fraud, AI impersonations, or that your data is leaked or hacked.”

The penalty for data brokers who fail to register or fail to delete requested consumer data is $200 per day, plus enforcement costs, according to the agency.

            <div id="article-text">Ilya Lichtenstein, who pled guilty to money laundering charges tied to his role in the massive hack of crypto exchange Bitfinex, has apparently been released early from prison.

In a Thursday evening post on X, Lichtenstein said he was out early “thanks to President Trump’s First Step Act” (a prison reform bill passed during Trump’s first term).

“I remain committed to making a positive impact in cybersecurity as soon as I can,” Lichtenstein said. “To the supporters, thank you for everything. To the haters, I look forward to proving you wrong.”

The Department of Justice arrested Lichtenstein and his wife Heather Morgan in 2022 and seized $3.6 billion worth of bitcoins that had been stolen from Bitfinex. The couple became infamous after their arrest and were featured in a Netflix documentary called “Biggest Heist Ever.”

Lichtenstein eventually admitted to his role in the hack and was sentenced to five years in prison.

It’s not clear whether the Trump administration played a direct role in the release. An administration official told CNBC that Lichtenstein “has served significant time on his sentence and is currently on home confinement consistent with statute and Bureau of Prisons policies.”

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/02/india-orders-musks-x-to-fix-grok-over-obscene-ai-content/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">India has ordered Elon Musk’s X to make immediate technical and procedural changes to its AI chatbot Grok after users and lawmakers flagged the generation of “obscene” content, including AI-altered images of women created using the tool.

On Friday, India’s IT ministry issued the order directing Musk’s X to take corrective action on Grok, including restricting the generation of content involving “nudity, sexualization, sexually explicit, or otherwise unlawful” material. The ministry also gave the social media platform 72 hours to submit an action-taken report detailing the steps it has taken to prevent the hosting or dissemination of content deemed “obscene, pornographic, vulgar, indecent, sexually explicit, pedophilic, or otherwise prohibited under law.”

The order, reviewed by TechCrunch, warned that failure to comply could jeopardize X’s “safe harbor” protections — legal immunity from liability for user-generated content under Indian law.

India’s move follows concerns raised by users who shared examples of Grok being prompted to alter images of individuals — primarily women — to make them appear to be wearing bikinis, prompting a formal complaint from Indian parliamentarian Priyanka Chaturvedi. Separately, recent reports flagged instances in which the AI chatbot generated sexualized images involving minors, an issue X acknowledged earlier on Friday was caused by lapses in safeguards. Those images were later taken down.

However, images generated using Grok that made women appear to be wearing bikinis through AI alteration remained accessible on X at the time of publication, TechCrunch found.

The latest order comes days after the Indian IT ministry issued a broader advisory on Monday, which was also reviewed by TechCrunch, to social media platforms, reminding them that compliance with local laws governing obscene and sexually explicit content is a prerequisite for retaining legal immunity from liability for user-generated material. The advisory urged companies to strengthen internal safeguards and warned that failure to do so could invite legal action under India’s IT and criminal laws.

“It is reiterated that non-compliance with the above requirements shall be viewed seriously and may result in strict legal consequences against your platform, its responsible officers and the users on the platform who violate the law, without any further notice,” the order warned.

The Indian government said noncompliance could lead to action against X under India’s IT law and criminal statutes.

India, one of the world’s biggest digital markets, has emerged as a critical test case for how far governments are willing to go in holding platforms responsible for AI-generated content. Any tightening of enforcement in the country could have ripple effects for global technology companies operating across multiple jurisdictions.

The order comes as Musk’s X continues to challenge aspects of India’s content regulation rules in court, arguing that federal government takedown powers risk overreach, even as the platform has complied with a majority of blocking directives. At the same time, Grok has been increasingly used by X users for real-time fact-checking and commentary on news events, making its outputs more visible — and more politically sensitive — than those of stand-alone AI tools.

X and xAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the Indian government’s order.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Moving into your first studio apartment can be exciting, but it can also feel a bit overwhelming. You quickly realize how much your old roommates helped out with stuff you took for granted, like light bulbs, smoke detectors, and even a vacuum.

To make your new place feel more like home, here are some must-have gadgets that can really help you out.

A home security system is a worthwhile investment to ensure your peace of mind in a new apartment. SimpliSafe offers an easy-to-install setup that’s perfect for renters. It’s tool-free to set up, which is a huge perk for renters since you can place sensors on doors and windows with adhesive strips instead of drilling holes.

The starter kit is tailored for small spaces and includes everything you need for basic home security: a base station, wireless keypad, one motion sensor, and one entry sensor. You can also buy additional sensors — such as glass-break, water, and temperature sensors — and cameras as needed.

SimpliSafe offers two monitoring options. You can choose to monitor the system yourself or opt for professional monitoring with a subscription plan starting at $23 per month. This includes 24/7 coverage, so if an alarm is triggered, SimpliSafe will reach out to you or dispatch the police if you’re unreachable.

While we’re on the subject of safety, a smoke detector is essential.

Kidde’s Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Detector is highly regarded, and the most notable aspect is that it sends alerts directly to your phone. Another nice detail is that the sensor is designed to avoid false alarms, like cooking smoke.

Recently, Kidde enhanced its alarms with Amazon’s Ring technology, enabling push notifications through the Ring app, adding even more convenience.

A robot vacuum can make cleaning a breeze. Whether you’re just trying to keep your hardwood floors tidy, deep cleaning couches, or dealing with pet hair, Eufy is a reputable brand that can help make your life easier.

Depending on what you need, you can find new models like the E28, which has fancy features like a HydroJet system for floor washing, hot air drying, and automatic self-emptying. It’s pricier at around $1,399.99, but if you’re more budget-conscious, the 3-in-1 E20 is a solid option at $649.99 and still gets the job done.

Fresh air is also important, but if you’re in the city, pollution makes it less ideal to open your apartment windows. And if neighbors are frequently cooking, you might deal with an odd mix of smells. An air purifier can significantly improve the quality of your indoor air.

This compact device from Dyson is quite effective, although it’s on the pricier side. However, the noise level is pleasantly low and many people may find value in the fact that the filter lasts up to five years, which means you won’t need to purchase replacement filters as often. There’s also a convenient app that allows you to track air quality.

Without the presence of a roommate stirring around at the crack of dawn, waking up can become a challenge. If traditional phone alarms don’t cut it, this is where the Hatch Restore 3 comes in. This sunrise alarm gently wakes you by gradually increasing the light. It also includes soothing sleep sounds, a bedside light, and a dimmable clock that’s designed not to be disruptive.

If you’re sensitive to noise or live in a pet-friendly building with frequent disturbances, a sound machine is perfect. Yogasleep has built a reputation for reliability over the years, making it a go-to choice for drowning out unwanted noise and creating a peaceful environment.

Creating a cozy atmosphere in your first apartment is key, and smart light bulbs offer a great way to customize both brightness and color. An added bonus is that they can be controlled through an app or a voice assistant, making it easy to set the perfect lighting for movie nights, dinner parties, or late-night reading sessions.

Philips Hue is a trusted brand in smart lighting that offers a range of popular products. What people appreciate most are the app’s features, which make it simple to turn lights on and off, adjust their colors, and set up lighting scenes for different times of day. One notable feature is the ability to upload a photo, and the app will create a new scene based on that color palette.

Starter kits are priced from $79.99, while a two-pack of bulbs costs around $49.98.

Smart plugs allow you to control any device plugged into them via a mobile app or voice commands. They provide added convenience, such as turning off your coffee maker while away from home or scheduling when your devices should turn on or off. Plus, they help reduce energy consumption.

A great option is Leviton’s Decora D23LP smart plug, which works with popular smart home ecosystems such as Amazon Alexa, Apple Home, and Google Home. This plug allows you to not only turn connected devices on and off but also to dim them as needed. You can control the plug through the My Leviton app.

A lightweight projector that’s super compact and stands upright is great for small spaces and easy to tuck away when you’re done. Look for models that run on Google TV, which gives you access to over 10,000 apps, 700,000 movies and shows, plus 800 free live TV channels. Setting one up is easy if you have a Google account, and it comes with a remote and carrying case.

If you’re cooking for yourself in a compact kitchen, an air fryer is invaluable. It allows you to whip up everything from crispy chicken wings to perfectly roasted vegetables while keeping your cooking area tidy. The Ninja Air Fryer is a top choice for budget-friendly, yet powerful, easy cooking.

            <h2>What Gene Kelly Taught Me About How to Be a Dad</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-04</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Of the two things that I can claim any great paternal accomplishment for, one is that my daughter, age 3, drinks a collard-and-dandelion-green smoothie almost every morning. The other is that she loves Gene Kelly. You see, we’ve reached the point where she’s old enough for me to start showing her the things I love, which thrills me in the same way I get excited to tour my own city when someone comes to visit. “This guy sells the best carrots and strawberries at the farmers’ market.” “This is the shrimp taco from Mariscos Jalisco.” “This is Singin’ in the Rain.”

If anything was going to spark my daughter’s fascination with Kelly, it had to be the greatest movie musical of all time. We began about 30 minutes into the film, with Donald O’Connor’s rendition of “Make ’Em Laugh,” the slapstick number in which he runs up and crashes through walls—and soon she, like O’Connor, was thrusting her elbows and skating across the carpet on her knees (she calls the song “Dancing on My Knees”). She asked for it over and over until I insisted that we watch something else, and skipped ahead to the song the film is named for. This time, Kelly was the star, and my daughter was transfixed—the pronounced jaw, the twinkle in his eye. “Who is that?” she asked.

The next night, we started the movie from the beginning. It wasn’t long before Kelly’s character, Don Lockwood, became smitten with Debbie Reynolds’s Kathy Selden, and then he was off, gliding around lampposts and stomping in puddles. But on this viewing, something changed in me. Watching Kelly through my daughter’s eyes—his bliss in the soundstage downpour, his body a flexile stack of lean musculature and joyous masculinity—I felt a heavy swell in my core. It reminded me of being too drunk in my 20s, overreacting to something beautiful and becoming somehow enraptured and despondent all at once. A flood of adrenaline spread from my rapidly beating heart and exited as moisture from my eyes, and I realized that maybe I wasn’t okay.

I might have forgotten that reaction as a mere aberration, but the next night my daughter asked, “Can we watch more Gene Kelly?” Although she also liked having Mary Poppins and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory on repeat, she had never asked to see “more Julie Andrews” or “more Gene Wilder.” In fact, I still don’t think she has registered that Mary Poppins and Maria from The Sound of Music are the same person. But for her, Singin’ in the Rain was not about Don Lockwood—it was about Kelly. We watched again, and it was as if a protective seal had been peeled off my chest cavity, like the lid from a can of Pringles. We watched Anchors Aweigh, and although my daughter was bored through most of it, she sprang to life when Kelly taught the cartoon Jerry Mouse how to sing and dance—and I felt as if I were floating and sinking simultaneously.

Another night, I put on Les Demoiselles de Rochefort, Jacques Demy’s underappreciated masterpiece—a French New Wave homage to American musicals—and although my daughter admired the bright colors of The Girls in the Hats, as she called it, the rest was beyond her. So I tucked her into bed and kept watching alone. The movie thrust forward, and I felt my body nearly levitate when Kelly, now in his 50s, showed up, dancing through the streets, exuding athleticism and glee. But that levitation was quickly followed by a steep decline. And the emotions kept hitting.

Perhaps, I thought, this was simply paternal pride—my wonderful daughter, dancing along to Golden Age musicals!—opening a floodgate of emotion. Or maybe I was just becoming a cliché, another “man of a certain age” who gets suddenly teary at the sight of old, elegant things. But no, somehow, these sensations felt deeper, like something dormant awakened: Why the hell was Gene Kelly making me feel so much?

I had expected fatherhood to change me. I knew it would make me care about my family more than myself. But becoming a parent doesn’t automatically remove ego or selfishness. Your baggage carries through even after your kids are born (my wife and I also have a 1-year-old son), even after you think you’ve grown up and gotten through the worst of it.

I had a tendency toward depression in my 20s and early 30s. But historically—and here I’m certain I’m not alone among men—I also tended to bottle it up, to put my head down and deny its existence. I was typically the last person to recognize that I wasn’t doing well. Yet as I entered my 40s, I had become quite sure that I had sort of passively balanced out my emotions, that my condition had taken care of itself. As I watched Kelly gracefully leap up walls and swing from rooftops, however, I realized that balance and stability are related but not the same.

This whole time, I had figured that I’d reached an even keel by just getting through it: prepare breakfast, pack a lunch, take them to school, meet your deadlines, cook dinner, show up, show up, show up. But what you do and how you do it are very different things. Singing and dancing perfectly, but without joy, does not make you Gene Kelly. Or put another way: “Doing everything” but being in a crappy mood while you do it does not make you a good husband or dad. When I didn’t complete a task perfectly, I would overreact and beat myself up. Sometimes I would get a little too mad—at my daughter, at myself—and beat myself up all over again. Kids pick up on energy, and my energy was awful. I sensed that I was standing with one foot shaking on a pinpoint, waiting for the tiniest burst of air from a single jeté to knock me sideways. Kelly, of all people, was the enthusiastic breeze who blew me over—a bellwether more than an instigator of my emotional state.

It was clear to my wife that something was wrong long before it was to me. One afternoon, I made a mistake while trying to help her with a project, costing her a couple of thousand dollars out of her own pocket. It wasn’t an earth-shattering loss. But my error crushed me. I started hyperventilating, so I quickly hid in our bedroom—and then the tears came. When my wife eventually discovered me and held me, I collapsed.

I spoke with my doctor about this episode during a routine physical. She had not seen Rochefort, but she did refer me to the Harvard Study of Adult Development, the famous, long-running analysis of human well-being, and to research describing some people’s tendency to hit an emotional rock bottom in their 40s. Much of the research indicates that such declines can happen gradually, or even at different times, rather than coming on as the all-of-a-sudden shock of a stereotypical midlife crisis—which made me think that had I been more emotionally aware, I might have seen my own breakdown coming from a lot further off. Learning about the research was a comfort, in a way, but it didn’t exactly cure me. Depression doesn’t work that conveniently.

Many years ago, I read the actor and writer Stephen Fry discussing depression as being “similar to weather,” as something that comes and goes on its own. This taught me it was something that you have only so much control over and something that you can’t explain by just looking at your circumstances or failures. I’ve since found that the most nefarious thing about depression is that it doesn’t simply feed you lies about yourself to make you feel sad. It takes the things that you already feel and are afraid of—you’re rotten inside; somehow, that rottenness will seep into your family—and supercharges them, so that they seem undeniably true. The Harvard study said of depression that it could “take people who started life as stars and leave them at the end of their lives as train wrecks.” The question I needed to answer, now that I was a father, was how to avoid the wreck.

As I worked through my Kelly-tumbled feelings, I thought back to that famous number in Anchors Aweigh, when he dances with the cartoon mouse. People can watch the clip on YouTube and marvel at it, out of context. But the reason it exists within the narrative of the film is what strikes me now. Kelly’s Joe Brady is a sailor on leave after having received a medal during World War II. He visits the class of a young boy, who asks Joe how he got his award. Rather than tell a horrifying truth about the war, Joe makes up a fanciful tale: One day, he happened upon an animated kingdom where the Mouse King, ashamed that he didn’t know how to sing or dance, had banned his subjects from doing either. Joe takes it upon himself to teach the king how to do both, delighting the king and spreading happiness to the land, earning his medal. It is perhaps the most joyous suppression of trauma in cinema history—Joe’s obfuscation a touching way to shield those young kids from whatever had happened. I, less healthily, was moving through life in a fog, suppressing my emotions in a way that allowed them to grow like mold.

This all twirls in my head as my daughter twirls in front of the TV, hammering home what I now understand as an obvious truth about parenthood in general and my own fatherhood in particular: You can’t take care of your family without taking care of yourself. Or, rather, you—no matter how much weight you are capable of withstanding—are responsible for the weight you make your family carry too.

From the July/August 2022 issue: Why is Dad so mad?

Many thousands of words have been written by people worried about the state of “men today” and tussling over conceptions of masculinity. Frankly, I’ve been less concerned with those arguments and more with figuring out for myself which parts of masculinity actually matter, especially when it comes to fatherhood. For instance: “Providing” for your family—a traditional tenet of masculinity—is, to my mind, about so much more than money. Fathers provide their children with an example of the type of person we want to exist in the world. It is not inherently masculine to come home angry from work or to drown your emotions in brown liquor. A “real” man is someone strong enough to admit his faults and mistakes, and to strive to improve.

The Harvard well-being study notes that “the happiest and most satisfied adults” in midlife were “those who managed to turn the question ‘What can I do for myself?’ into ‘What can I do for the world beyond me?’” This reframing has also made me think more about what helping really means. Yes, it helps the people I love when I cook them dinner. But it helps them a great deal more if I am engaged and present—never mind if dinner winds up running 20 minutes behind schedule.

It’s still an absolute point of pride for me that my daughter wants to stay up late watching Gene Kelly. She doesn’t know that he was a maniacal perfectionist, that he practiced for terrifyingly long hours to make everything look easy. She doesn’t know that balance and stability do not just emerge naturally, but require lots of regular, hard work. Those lessons will come. For now, as my kids grow older, I know what I will keep working to show them: that admitting our flaws and failures is necessary, that showing vulnerability is a kind of strength—that ultimately, a joyful and openhearted home is even better for you than dandelion greens.</div>

            <div id="article-text">This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

Welcome back to The Daily’s Sunday culture edition, in which one Atlantic writer or editor reveals what’s keeping them entertained. Today’s special guest is Sara Krolewski, a deputy research chief who helps oversee fact-checking at The Atlantic and has worked on articles about a vanished kayaker, the second Trump administration (and the president’s phone calls with Atlantic reporters), and Benjamin Franklin’s relationship with his son.

Sara is excitedly awaiting the New York City premiere of Romeo & Juliet Suite in March. She also enjoys watching Crossing Delancey, refreshing her Depop feed, and revisiting Picasso’s Le Moulin de la Galette.

A good recommendation I recently received: My friend put the 1988 film Crossing Delancey on an end-of-year recommendation list, and it turned out to be the perfect nightcap for a dreary winter’s day: a wry romantic comedy of errors that doubles as an ode to Manhattan’s Lower East Side. Its love interest is a pickle salesman—utterly charming! [Related: The 10 best movies of 2025]

The upcoming arts event I’m most looking forward to: Benjamin Millepied’s Romeo & Juliet Suite at the Park Avenue Armory in March. Millepied is best known outside of the dance world as the ex-husband of Natalie Portman; the two met when he worked on the choreography for her Oscar-winning turn in Black Swan. (He also has the most apposite name for a dancer: Millepied roughly translates to “thousand-footed” in French.) What tabloid dross tends to obscure is his impressive career—first as a star dancer at the New York City Ballet, then as a roving choreographer of complex, dynamic work that is rooted in balletic conventions but not restricted by them. Romeo & Juliet Suite riffs on the famous tragedy and promises to make use of the Armory’s cavernous Drill Hall, like a show I saw last year in the same space: the German artist Anne Imhof’s Doom: House of Hope. That, too, was partially based on Romeo and Juliet and featured a cast of elite dancers. Spectators were meant to wander the warehouse-like venue and mingle with the performers (think Sleep No More with pointe shoes).

Part of the appeal of restaging Romeo and Juliet lies in its familiarity. There’s room to play (both Imhof and Millepied have excised characters and incorporated live video into their performances), but the core of the narrative—forbidden love—remains the same, providing a kind of structural integrity. And I’ll never tire of Sergei Prokofiev’s brilliant score, which accompanies Millepied’s production. Prokofiev fiddled with the source material as well: His original ballet in 1935 had the two lovers reunite and live happily ever after. [Related: Hands off Shakespeare]

A favorite story I’ve read in The Atlantic: One of the perks of working in research is making sojourns to The Atlantic’s archive, where many gems are hidden. For one: Agnes de Mille, an icon of American dance, was an Atlantic contributor in the mid-20th century, and her ardent tribute to the choreographer Martha Graham is among the great works of American dance writing. It’s also a vivid profile of an irascible, legendary artist—one who “could not be bought or pushed or cajoled into toying with her principles,” and who “never slept for two nights” before a performance, apparently.

I’d be remiss if I didn’t also mention my former journalism professor Kate Bolick’s 2011 cover story, “All the Single Ladies.” It’s a terrifically engaging read—playful yet interrogatory—that remains as relevant as ever in our age of “heteropessimism” and dating-app malaise.

Best novel I’ve recently read: I just finished Barbara Comyns’s The Juniper Tree, a short but haunting novel loosely based on a lesser-known Brothers Grimm tale. Comyns is herself a lesser-known British writer whose eccentric work is reminiscent of Jean Rhys’s novels about female anomie, albeit with a distinctly British sensibility. The Juniper Tree’s protagonist carries on in the face of maternal abuse, a scandalous out-of-wedlock pregnancy, and a series of calamitous events that expose the dark underside of domesticity.

An actor I would watch in anything: The prolific British actor Peter Finch, whose range is unmatched. Most will recognize him as the crazed, prophetic newscaster Howard Beale in Network, but my favorite performance of his is in John Schlesinger’s Sunday Bloody Sunday, in which he portrays a prim-and-proper doctor locked in a very bohemian love triangle. (He also makes a scene-stealing appearance in Schlesinger’s sumptuous Far From the Madding Crowd.)

My favorite way of wasting time on my phone: Feeding my algorithm on Depop, an app that is sort of like a Room of Requirement for secondhand clothes. Although I’ve had little success in flogging my own wares, I’ve become a highly proficient purchaser.

A piece of journalism that recently changed my perspective on a topic: After two middle schoolers died while subway surfing in October, The New Yorker’s Doreen St. Félix wrote about the oft-fatal trend among New York City teens. She draws on her own experiences growing up in the city to shed light on what might be driving the phenomenon, and how deterrence methods tend to rely on aggressive surveillance practices that may be more punitive than effective.

A painting that I cherish: I’m partial to Picasso’s Le Moulin de la Galette (on view at the Guggenheim in New York City), which he painted around 1900. It bears the influence of Impressionism and is totally unlike any of his later, more famous work—but there is something surreal and captivating about the café patrons’ blurred, masklike faces, hinting at the experimentalism to come in his career. Plus, these folks seem to be having a really fun night.

An author I will read anything by: Elizabeth Hardwick is perhaps the only writer who could tackle such disparate subjects as the Menendez brothers, Herman Melville, and the city of Boston—which she despised enough to excoriate in a savage takedown—and make every essay sing. Open her Collected Essays to any page, and you’ll discover a sentence so authoritative and crystalline that reading it feels like a small religious experience. (Here’s one I just found: “Power, the most insidious of the passions, is also the most cunning.”)

Here are three Sunday reads from The Atlantic:

As Albert Einstein wrote elegantly about our experience of time and space, he also devoted his days to the process of social transformation: the question of how one world becomes another. He was concerned about not just the perils of progress—including modern science’s role in the creation of apocalyptic weapons—but also the promise of a more just society. From his very first years in the United States, Einstein wrote powerfully in opposition to American segregation, drawing on his personal experience of Nazi persecution as well as his ties to the long-standing African American community in Princeton, New Jersey, where he lived. In 1946, deep in the Jim Crow era, he visited the nation’s first degree-granting historically Black institution, Lincoln University, where he gave talks and accepted an honorary degree. Eighty years later, after searching through the archives of his correspondence that are housed in Princeton, I’m reflecting on the full scope of what we have inherited from him.

These are scenes from the wide variety of volcanic activity on Earth over the past year.

On Sundays after church, my family would pile into our crank-window GMC truck and head to Kentucky Fried Chicken. “Can I get me some of them tater wedges?” my father would say into the speaker, while my sisters and I giggled in the back seat. My dad has always had a southern accent: His words fall out of his mouth the way molasses would sound if it could speak, thick and slow. But his “KFC voice,” as my sisters and I call it, is country. It’s watered-down on work calls and during debates with his West Coast relatives. But it comes out around fellow cattle farmers and old friends from Kentucky, where he grew up.

My mother’s accent isn’t quite as strong. She’s a therapist, and she can hide it when she speaks with her patients and calls in prescriptions. But you can always hear it in her church-pew greetings, and when she says goodnight: “See you in the a.m., Lawd willin’.”

I was always clear on one fact: I wasn’t going to have a southern accent when I grew up. I was raised in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, near Nashville, where the accents grow stronger with each mile you travel from the city. I watched people snicker at the redneck characters on television who always seemed to play the town idiot. I knew what the accent was supposed to convey: sweet but simpleminded. When I was 15 and my family went to New York for the first time, the bellhop at our hotel laughed when my mom and I spoke; he said he’d never met cowgirls before. That was when I decided: No one was going to know I was from the South from my voice alone.

Recent studies suggest I’m part of a trend: Young people are losing their southern accents. By the end of my life, there may be no one left who speaks like my father outside the hollers and the one-horse towns.

Margaret Renwick, an associate research professor at Johns Hopkins, has co-authored studies on changing accents among white and Black people in Georgia. The University of Georgia has a huge collection of old recordings and interviews from all across the South beginning in the 1960s. “Nobody had ever really looked at them with modern methods, so we dove in,” she told me. The study focused on four different “drawling vowels” that are part of what linguists call the Southern Vowel Shift—which, she discovered, is on the decline.

“The Southern Vowel Shift began in the late 19th century, after the Civil War, and the first thing that happened was that bide became bahd—so i to ah—like time to tahme,” Renwick said. You have to listen closely to hear it, but the accent treats long vowels and short vowels differently. With a long vowel (beat or bait), “you add a little uh sound before the original vowel” (buheat). But with the short vowels (bit or bet), the uh goes after the original vowel. (Can you hear it, just a little biuht?) “That’s where the drawl perception comes from,” she said, “because they kind of stretch out.” The paper found that the Southern Vowel Shift is becoming less detectable, particularly in urban areas such as Atlanta. Renwick also found that the accent has faded at different rates among Black and white Georgians. For white speakers, she told me, the peak southern accent was among “Baby Boomers born right after World War II.” For Black speakers, the accent was strongest among Gen X, and began to disappear only among Millennials and Gen Z.

Olga Khazan: Why Taylor Swift’s accent has changed

She linked the decline to migration patterns and to the great suburbanization that’s happened around southern cities. After World War II, lots of white people moved from northeastern cities to the Sun Belt, and to the Atlanta suburbs especially. Starting in the 1970s, the same areas saw more Black transplants. Many of them were the children of people who had left the South in the early years of the Great Migration. Their parents and grandparents “took their accents with them” to places such as Detroit, Philadelphia, and Rochester, New York, Renwick said, but their returning descendants “didn’t talk quite the same way” when they came back.

The influx continues. Today the South is the most populous region of the country, and from 2023 to 2024, it gained more residents than all other regions combined, according to the U.S. census. People are drawn to the South for many reasons: lower taxes and warmer weather, and the stereotype—true, in my experience—that southerners make pleasant neighbors. The South isn’t appealing only to families seeking cul-de-sac living, either. Lately, teenagers from the Northeast are opting to head to the South for college, where tuition is cheaper and sororities are the ultimate social club.

The internet is another cause of the dilution of the southern drawl among young people. “There’s huge changes in speech in elementary and middle school, when everything about your identity is based on who you’re hanging out with,” Susan Tamasi, a linguist at Emory University, told me. What happens when the people you hang out with include peers from across the country? Most kids won’t adopt accents that they hear on TV, but social media—especially gaming, where kids talk to one another while playing—is different, in that it involves children actively building relationships online.

Landon Bryant is the author of Bless Your Heart: A Field Guide to All Things Southern and runs the well-loved Instagram account @landontalks. He told me that his 12-year-old son adopts what he calls a “YouTube accent” when he’s speaking with his friends online that is “totally different than the way he talks” at the dinner table, where he matches his parents’ Mississippi drawl. “He’s not doing that on purpose. That’s just what naturally happens.”

Many southerners who lose their accents don’t lose them entirely, because they learn to code switch. They may use the accent to establish trust or preserve old bonds, and drop it to be taken seriously in professional settings. “I code switch between levels of southern even here in the South,” Bryant said. “You speak a little differently in Charleston than you do in Soso”—a town in Mississippi—“and you speak a little differently at the country club than I would if I was going to the gas station.”

But walking a “linguistic tightrope” can be hard on people, Jennifer Cramer, the director of the Appalachian Studies Program at the University of Kentucky, told me. “I’ll have a student from eastern Kentucky who tells me, when they got to Lexington, they got made fun of immediately for how they talked. So they started trying to fix it,” she said. “Then it comes to Thanksgiving break, and they go back home. Well, now they’re getting made fun of at home.” Family members will often say things like “you’ve gotten above your raising” or “you’re too good for us now.” This can create a real crisis of identity as people try to belong in two different “voice places.”

Katherine J. Wu: The study-abroad accent might be the real deal

Amy Clark, a professor at the University of Virginia’s College at Wise and the host of the podcast The Talking Appalachian, tries to reassure her students that adding “Broadcast American English to the language so that they can shift when they need to” isn’t about losing the accent they have. “When I go home and I sit with my granny, I don’t want to sound like Dr. Amy Clark,” Clark told me. “I don’t want to sound like a podcaster. I don’t want to sound like a writer. I want to sound like the granddaughter she knows.” When she uses a different accent, it’s not about fitting in or being accepted; it’s about clarity. “If you’re not going to accept me because I sound Appalachian, then that’s on you, but it’s on me to be as clear as I can in the message that I’m sending.”

Even as many Americans have embraced diversity in unprecedented ways, prejudice against the southern accent is still largely permissible. “I think people still believe it’s okay to openly make fun of a region and a place, especially if it’s associated with more rural people, and not be called bigoted,” Clark said. “It’s not taboo yet.” She tries to counteract that by teaching students about the history and beauty of southern and rural dialects.

In college, Clark was given an assignment by her English professor to record her oldest living family member—her great-grandmother Ethel, who was born in 1908 in Dickenson County, Virginia. She was told to transcribe her language verbatim, and not to standardize the English:

We’d go birch sappin’. You’d find you a birch tree, and my brother Bill would take a ax, and he chopped that tree all around and he skinned the bark off of it. We’d all take spoons, and we’d go around and get us a big piece and scrape that birch sap out of that old bark. It tasted so good.

The process let her hear “the poetry for the first time in the way that she spoke.” From that point, she was infatuated with Appalachian and southern dialects. She now gives her students the same assignment.

Clark told me that we risk losing so much of the beauty of American English if we strip away our southern dialects. Consider Langston Hughes’s poem “Mother to Son”:

So boy, don’t you turn back. Don’t you set down on the steps ’Cause you finds it’s kinder hard. Don’t you fall now— For I’se still goin’, honey, I’se still climbin’, And life for me ain’t been no crystal stair.

If you “rewrite that poem in standard English” and try reading it aloud, she said, “you hear immediately what’s lost.”

“The entire character is gone. The way that he creates her voice is so distinctive and so rich. When you strip away the vernacular dialect, there’s really nothing of her left.” The same thing would happen to John Wesley and June Star in Flannery O’Connor’s “A Good Man Is Hard to Find,” or to Celie in Alice Walker’s The Color Purple.

Bryant is also a self-described southern-language preservationist. He’s treating the internet as his very own wraparound front porch. “One day I was talking at my wife and she was like, ‘What if you talk to the internet instead?’” (He described this as a “nice southern-lady way” to say shut up.) So he did. He posted a video in which he told a story about the time his high school got destroyed by a tornado and students spent the remaining nine weeks of the year taking classes at the local Walmart. “We had show choir in Layaway.” He’d never thought of his accent or dialect as particularly notable, but then the comments started rolling in. “So I was like, well, let’s discuss ‘fixin’ to’” and “might could.”

Like many people my age, I checked my southern accent at the door of my northeastern adult life. It comes out on rare occasions—when I revisit my Southern Baptist church in Tennessee, when I speak with the receptionist at my childhood doctor’s office, when I want a southerner to trust me, or when I’ve simply had a bit too much to drink. Clark told me that she, at one point, did the same. “I did go through a phase where I wanted to be completely separated from it,” she said. “But then I came back.” And she did so for good reason. “I love my region; I love my family. There’s pride in that. I carry my history in my mouth. My words and my grammar patterns are full of centuries of history. My ancestors are with me every time I speak.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">American forces’ surgical capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, carried out in a daring raid shortly after 1 a.m. local time today, had been planned and rehearsed for months. Informants monitored the first couple’s movements, more than 150 aircraft provided cover starting late last night, missile strikes on military installations knocked out air defenses, and low-flying helicopters landed Delta Force soldiers in the center of Caracas. U.S. forces engaged in a shoot-out with Venezuelan guards, then apprehended the dictator in his lavish presidential palace just as he sought refuge in a steel safe room. But a few hours later, President Donald Trump almost eclipsed the dramatic operation’s success when, from behind a podium on a makeshift stage in a gold-clad room at Mar-a-Lago, he unveiled another surprise: America now runs Venezuela, he said, and wants the country’s oil reserves to foot the bill.

Maduro and his wife were taken to the USS Iwo Jima, an amphibious assault ship usually used to carry troops and cargo ashore. This evening, they arrived in New York facing charges of narco-terrorism, drug trafficking, and other weapons-related offenses. Trump posted a photo of the deposed leader in U.S. custody: Maduro dressed in a gray sweatsuit, his cuffed hands clenching a bottle of water, his eyes blindfolded, his ears covered by sound-blocking muffs. It was a far cry from some of the recent images of a defiant Maduro dancing onstage in front of supporters, vowing to remain in power, and singing John Lennon’s peace anthem “Imagine” at a rally.

Maduro’s capture—a high-risk, high-yield military operation—offered Trump a moment of triumph in his months-long quest to topple the Latin American despot. But even some of Trump’s closest allies told us that they were unnerved by the president’s brash, no-plan-for-tomorrow approach to ousting a sovereign nation’s leader. Trump provided few details as he declared that a group of officials who were standing near him at the news conference, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, would “run” the country until a “safe, proper, and judicious transition” could take place. It was a stunning announcement for a president who campaigned on the perils of nation building. And Trump made no mention of wanting to spread democracy or allowing Venezuela’s opposition, which the United States has recognized as the legitimate winners of 2024’s election, to take power.

Rather, in his lengthy press conference, the only Venezuelan politician Trump spoke about other than Maduro was Maduro’s own vice president, Delcy Rodríguez. She was sworn in as interim president soon after Maduro’s departure but maintains that Maduro is the legitimate president and condemned his arrest. Trump said she had already told Rubio that the new government in Caracas would do whatever the U.S. wanted—something she denied. In summary, Trump said, the U.S. is looking to “make Venezuela great again—very simple.”

The vagaries of the administration’s plans stood out in contrast with the precision of Maduro’s capture. They also invited questions about how deeply the U.S. would become involved in Venezuela’s future, as well as about the legality of the operation. Trump didn’t try to get congressional authorization for war or even notify Congress of today’s operation in advance, citing the Hill’s propensity to leak. (Lawmakers were briefed after the operation was complete.) Trump also did not address questions about the implications of removing a sitting president for Russian President Vladimir Putin as he seeks to control Ukraine, or for China’s Xi Jinping as he sizes up the possibility of taking Taiwan. “If China declared Taiwan a rogue province, could they go after its leaders?” Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, asked us in an interview. “If Russia declares” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky “a criminal, could Putin extract him from Ukraine and that’d be okay?”

Trump dismissed the idea that deposing Maduro contradicts his “America First” mantra, which has been widely interpreted as noninterventionist. “It is” “America First,” Trump insisted today, “because we want to surround ourselves with good neighbors. We want to surround ourselves with stability.” He even embraced the possibility of putting “boots on the ground” after years of preferring to use strikes from afar to achieve his foreign-policy goals. He dubbed his new approach, without much apparent enthusiasm, the “Donroe Doctrine,” an awkward mash-up of his own name and that of the 19th-century Monroe Doctrine, which aimed to cement U.S. dominance in the Western Hemisphere.

At the root of it all, Trump made clear, is oil, something that his critics had long claimed while the administration portrayed the months-long pressure campaign as principally about stopping the drug trade. Today, Trump didn’t hide his intent. The U.S. wants to revitalize Venezuela’s oil industry, with U.S. oil companies leading the charge, even though Venezuelan crude is heavy and hard to refine by international standards. That revenue, he added, would go to the Venezuelan people, and to the U.S., for what the administration has claimed is recompense for Venezuela’s nationalization of the industry years ago. Until recently, Trump had seemed open to a deal with Maduro that would achieve the same goal. But overnight, as explosions echoed over the hills of Caracas, Maduro’s time ran out.

“Nicolás Maduro had multiple opportunities to avoid this,” Rubio said at the Mar-a-Lago press conference. “He was provided multiple very, very, very generous offers, and chose instead to act like a wild man.”

So the Trump administration removed him by force. But a former senior U.S. official noted: “This was the easy part. Let’s see what they do next.”

The CIA put operatives in Venezuela in August after Trump ordered covert operations. Those operatives studied what Maduro wore, what he ate, where he traveled, what pets he kept. Delta Force trained for his capture using a mock safe house. For weeks, U.S. aircraft approached Venezuelan airspace but stopped short of crossing the line, instead seeking insight into how the Venezuelan military might respond to an attack, defense officials said.

A core group of senior officials—Rubio; Hegseth; General Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; CIA Director John Ratcliffe; and Stephen Miller, Trump’s deputy chief of staff—led the planning with Trump, one official told us.

“They finally—about two weeks ago—gave Maduro a final warning. It was through official channels, in a way that communicated the seriousness of it,” a person familiar with the planning told us. “There was no ambiguity,” this person said. “This was Maduro’s last chance for an off-ramp.”

By early last month, the U.S. was ready to move in when the weather was right. That moment came as Friday turned to Saturday, when the skies over Venezuela’s seaside capital cleared. Trump gave the order to proceed at 10:46 p.m. EST.

The U.S. conducted strikes to disable Venezuela’s air defenses, Caine said at the press conference. Across the hills of Caracas, Venezuelans could see the assault unfold. They felt the ground shake. Then the city lost communications and power. As U.S. forces approached, they came under heavy fire, which caused injuries among them and likely deaths among Venezuelans, defense officials told us. A U.S. helicopter was damaged.

“There was a lot of gunfire,” Trump said during his press conference; at least two U.S. troops were hospitalized. Minutes later, at 2:01 a.m. local time, U.S. forces entered Maduro’s compound and found the Venezuelan leader and his wife sleeping. Trump said the longtime tyrant ran to open a heavy door leading to a safe room but couldn’t manage it. The couple surrendered, were loaded into helicopters, and were out of Venezuelan airspace by 3:29 a.m.

Military officials stressed that the weather was a guiding factor in the timing, but an administration official suggested that political undercurrents were also at play. It was “now or never,” this person said. A number of officials told us that in recent weeks, the window for Trump to remove Maduro had seemed to be closing. Bipartisan support in the U.S. for any kind of military action in Venezuela was diminishing, and officials worried that the longer Maduro remained in power, the more entrenched he would become.

Trump is “kicking off the year with a win,” the administration official said. Another former senior administration official who remains in frequent contact with the White House acknowledged that Trump needed a victory amid tough headlines and slumping poll numbers. Trump likes symbolic dates as well, and originally had eyed the period around Christmas for the assault. Instead, on Christmas Day, Trump ordered a different set of military strikes—on alleged Islamic State targets in Nigeria. Trump has grown fond of these one-off, splashy shows of force, counting last year’s bombing of Iranian nuclear sites as one of his triumphs. Trump said that there had been a plan for a second phase of the Venezuelan operation, but that it wasn’t needed—at least not yet.

The Trump administration never laid out a consistent case for Congress or the public in advance of today’s operation as to why Maduro had to go. Much of the pressure campaign in recent months focused on lethal strikes against alleged drug boats, even though little of the drugs that flow through Venezuela are destined for the U.S.

At the Mar-a-Lago press conference, Rubio emphasized that the arrest and extraction of Maduro and his wife was a “law enforcement” operation. “At its core, this was an arrest of two indicted fugitives of American justice, and the Department of War supported the Department of Justice in that job,” Rubio said, using Trump’s title for the Department of Defense.

Conspicuously absent from the press conference was the top U.S. law-enforcement official, whose department’s indictment of Maduro provided the legal justification for the operation. Attorney General Pam Bondi posted on X that Maduro and his wife “will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,” and she later shared a link to a newly unsealed 25-page indictment filed by prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. (It was in many respects similar to an indictment issued toward the end of Trump’s first term, with a few new charges and the addition of Maduro’s wife and son.) The indictment alleges that Maduro and his associates used Venezuelan state and military resources to facilitate and profit from drug trafficking over two decades.

An administration official told us that the arrests of Maduro and his wife were made by the Drug Enforcement Administration, which ultimately reports to the attorney general. The operation, conducted by the Department of Defense and the DEA, was undertaken at the request of the Justice Department.

More than a dozen FBI and DEA personnel were seen disembarking from a plane with Maduro at a New York Air National Guard Base this evening. The FBI declined to comment on the agency’s role in the operation, and the DEA did not respond to requests for comment.

In recent weeks, Trump and other administration officials asserted that the U.S. had a claim on Venezuela’s oil reserves—an apparent reference to a 2007 decision by Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chávez, to nationalize various foreign-owned oil projects. The U.S. oil giants ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips were kicked out of the country after they refused to allow Venezuela to acquire majority stakes in their Venezuelan operations. “The stolen oil must be returned to the United States,” Vice President J. D. Vance said in a post on X today.

Venezuela has the largest estimated oil reserves in the world—accounting for about 17 percent of global reserves, or more than 300 billion barrels, according to Oil & Gas Journal. But Venezuela produces only 1 million barrels of oil a day. Its potential is largely unrealized because of poor infrastructure, mismanagement, limited resources, and U.S. sanctions. What little is produced has to be sold on the black market for Venezuela to profit. About 80 percent of Venezuela’s oil, which is of low quality, currently goes to China; at least 15 percent goes to the U.S. via a remaining joint venture with Chevron; and the remainder goes to Cuba.

Trump today talked about the potential to revitalize Venezuela’s oil sector and the role that U.S. companies would play—something the country’s opposition has emphasized as a crucial part of its economic plans.

“The oil business in Venezuela has been a bust, a total bust, for a long period of time,” Trump said at Mar-a-Lago. “We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in; spend billions of dollars; fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure; and start making money for the country.”

This would be a massive, costly, and time-consuming undertaking.

“Venezuela could produce 4 million barrels instead of the 1 million barrels it produces per day, but it would take maybe a little bit less than a decade and $100 billion in total over that period to get it to 4 million barrels,” Francisco Monaldi, an expert in Latin American energy policy at Rice University, told us. “Very few countries can do something like that.”

How much opposition Venezuela’s military put up to defend Maduro is not clear. But the low number of U.S. casualties suggests that Washington likely had at least some support from within the Venezuelan military, helping make the operation a success, former and current officials told us. “An action like this would not be possible without significant help or at least intentional ‘self-restraint’ from the local military,” a Pentagon adviser and Special Forces veteran told us.

The military’s longer-term response to Maduro’s ouster will likely be key to the fate of the nation. Recent history in Iraq and Afghanistan does not bode well for U.S. efforts at nation building, but much will depend on the choices that Venezuelan military leaders make about where their loyalties lie. The big question, the former Pentagon official said, is whether the U.S. can stave off the unrest and regional instability that could result from the sudden power vacuum left behind when Maduro was removed after nearly 13 years in power.

The role of Venezuela’s democratic opposition is also unknown. María Corina Machado, who secretly left Venezuela last month after a year in hiding to accept the Nobel Peace Prize, said in a statement today that “the time has come for Popular Sovereignty and National Sovereignty to govern our country. We are going to restore order, free political prisoners, build an exceptional nation, and bring our children home.”

She urged Venezuelans inside the country to “be ready to take action.” Trump, however, said today at Mar-a-Lago that Machado couldn’t govern the country, because she doesn’t have “the support or the respect” of the Venezuelan people. Carlos Giménez, a Republican representative from South Florida, told us he assesses Machado’s capabilities differently, calling her “formidable.” He said that he spoke with her today, and described her as “upbeat that Maduro is no longer there, but realistic that there’s more work to be done, and that this is just the beginning.” A spokesperson for Machado declined to comment, and other representatives didn’t respond to a request for comment for this story.

For now, Venezuelans don’t know who is running their country, even as Venezuelan news networks broadcast images of celebratory flag-waving in the streets. Armed civilian militias, known as colectivos, were patrolling Caracas. “There is a lot of confusion,” a Venezuelan activist in Caracas told us. “The government officials have called their followers to the streets, but nobody—except the colectivos—have answered.”

Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, have been forcibly taken from Venezuela and are being moved to the United States to face criminal drug-trafficking charges. Regardless of the international-law implications of this military action, the Trump administration’s description of what awaits Maduro and Flores has also transgressed basic principles of American domestic criminal law, as well as the underlying philosophical justification for punishment.

Attorney General Pam Bondi has promised that Maduro and Flores “will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts.” Justice in the American system is supposed to be blind and impartial. By contrast, Bondi’s vow of wrathful punishment is profoundly illiberal, suggesting a lust for criminal vengeance.

When federal prosecutors speak of criminal allegations, moreover, they ritualistically note that a defendant such as Maduro is innocent until proven guilty. By making a presumption of guilt and of the state’s inerrancy, the attorney general is repudiating the rule of law, which is grounded in the state’s obligation to prove its case.

For millennia, punishment was considered morally defensible purely on retributive grounds. That vengeful justification yielded during the Enlightenment, during a broader societal conversion to an age of reason. Broadly speaking, the justification for criminal punishment turned away from wrath, toward utilitarian concepts of effectiveness and social benefit. In this view, penal laws and policies were justified if they arguably benefited the majority of the population. Punishment became a social good rather than a basis for personal retribution.

Read: Trump’s critics are falling into an obvious trap

As a logical result, instead of vengeance, criminal-law theorists focused on the practical benefits: The deterrence rationale holds that punishment benefits society by discouraging both the individual offender and others in society from committing future crimes. Rehabilitation helps the individual and society alike by reforming the offender and allowing him or her to reintegrate into the communal order. And incapacitation, in turn, focuses on the social benefit of protecting society by removing a dangerous criminal from the community. All of these arguments justifying criminal punishment focus on the “social utility” of the act, rather than its retributive nature.

The prosecution of Maduro and his wife can be readily justified on post-Enlightenment grounds: Although rehabilitation seems like a stretch in the Venezuelan dictator’s case, punishment would incapacitate him and deter others. In reaching back to a retributive justification, however, Trump and Bondi reject these rational arguments.

Many commentators have described Donald Trump’s approach to the law as a throwback to an earlier age—perhaps the allegedly halcyon era of the pre-Civil Rights Act 1950s. Others, such as The Atlantic’s Adam Serwer, see the conservative legal project as the restoration of the pre-Civil War legal system. By invoking the “wrath” of justice against Maduro, Trump and Bondi reach even further back into the past, summoning a far older, illiberal, retributive concept that modernity long ago abandoned.</div>

Seems like a good thing to me. But, I&#39;m sure that this thread will be filled with outraged individuals who are totally not Chinese agents.Bringing rare earths production back to the US is a good thing. The right way to do it if you were going to do it with tariffs would have been to be consistent, with a well-established schedule phased in over several years so as not to fuck over your domestic industries which depended on the products. You would have to be a Chinese (or Russian) agent to think it was a good idea to do it all at once, and to be completely inconsistent about it and change the amounts repeatedly and chicken out on some of them and never actually institute some of them (I&#39;ve been buying stuff from China all along and none of it has gotten any new tariffs) and generally waffle and whine, winding up looking stupid and weak.Whether you&#39;re picking up your fifty cents at the door, or you&#39;re chained to a table in Moscow, either way you can fuck off for free.

The problem is that whatever production appears in the US is 1) tiny, and 2) exceedingly expensive.  US aluminum producers noticed that there was a shortfall in production worldwide of aluminum, so vowed to reopen a couple of mothballed plants to produce an extra 80,000 tons/year.  The problem with this &quot;wonderful&quot; outcome is that 1) the shortfall is 2 MILLION tons, and 2) creaking old US factories&#39; production processes are so inefficient that the only place their aluminum can be sold is in the US to avoid

I assume you&#39;re referring to the US?  China&#39;s government can, and does, direct that energy where it believes the most long-term value lies.

Perhaps this will lead to more sustainable processes for refining rare earth products.  The reason that China is dominating the industry (other than a concerted effort by the government to buy up as many sources of raw materials as they can outside of China) is due to the absolute &quot;dirtyness&quot; of the refining process.  It uses a lot of energy and produces noxious waste products that first world countries would rather not have to deal with.  China is willing to take the environmental impact hit to corner the

And the cost of the energy involved (cleaner processes are very energy intensive).

The reason is greed. American oligarchs who ran companies which use rare earths figured out that it was more profitable to let China produce them with a lot of pollution in China, and ship them here producing more pollution, than to produce them with lower levels of pollution here.

Why do people continue to misuse the word &quot;oligarch&quot;? People who wield power due to their wealth are plutocrats.  Members of a politburo are oligarchs.

Have you ever been right about anything? Because today is not that day.

The reason that China is dominating the industry (other than a concerted effort by the government to buy up as many sources of raw materials as they can outside of China) is due to the absolute &quot;dirtyness&quot; of the refining process.That, of course, is nonsense. The reason is greed. American oligarchs who ran companies which use rare earths figured out that it was more profitable to let China produce them with a lot of pollution in China, and ship them here producing more pollution, than to produce them with lower levels of pollution here.100% this.And none of that Vote With Your Wallet shit applies either.  At no point in the last 30 years was a Democratic voting booth offering even the illusion of choice when it came to this particular aspect of manufacturing.  These actions are decided on by Greed behind closed doors, with citizens ironically paying more in save-the-planet taxes created by MBAs who fly private, all for “choosing” to let China pollute and fill our rare earth orders.

I don&#39;t know how they measure &quot;popularity&quot; these days.

The biggest problem there is no effective way to decipher crazies from normal people. The karma system is a joke. Most of the crazies (overly aggressive, angry, know-it-all, echo chamber weirdos) are the high karmas. Almost the opposite of what karma is supposed to be used for. This might be ok, but this same sort of fanatacism carries over to the mods. You go to some relatively normal sounding subreddit, and read some posts. Cool, so you respond to some posts. Ask innocent questions. Uh oh - the echo chamber jumps you with tons of downvotes.This sounds a lot like Slashdot to me.I remember when comments asked innocent Linux questions on Slashdot and the immediate response was RTFM you filthy fucking n00b!I do feel nostalgic for penis bird and Goat.se Rick Roll comments, though.

how much has he just made up. why do listen to him at all.

Back in my day you had to harness a lightning bolt to generate 1.21 JiggaWatts of power.

Elon will get there eventually. This news ain&#39;t.

no he wont he has not delivered any thing he has said he was going to.The one thing he is going to do i put so much junk in orbit he is going to make space travel impossable.  HE IS A JOKE

I trust him on this. Musk&#39;s nonsense is typically any new or future looking development, not one of his companies playing catch up with the rest of the industry. MCS demonstrated this charging speed 9 months ago and there&#39;s enough MCS charging stations at major truck stops in Europe already in place to cover from the Port of Rotterdam to any corner in Germany or drive trucks from Dover through most of the UK.

I listen to him when he talks about how far behind his charging tech is.

Just kidding.  These will all be self-driving eventually, probably using another company&#39;s system.

I believe our Volvo was made in China, but yeah.  Good car.

If 1.2 is the peak, I speculate (disclaimer, I don&#39;t know any shit about it) they would probably limit it to 1 MW due to safety factor and things like that. Even 1 MW is very cool. Now if they finalize autonomous driving (China already has https://www.youtube.com/shorts... [youtube.com] ) and autonomous charging .. truck driving jobs will be like vacation.

It&#39;s like 1000 homes all had their air conditioner running at the same time. It&#39;s a lot, but it&#39;s not terrible if you don&#39;t need to scale the number of trucks you can charge at once.

&quot; it&#39;s not terrible if you don&#39;t need to scale the number of trucks you can charge at once&quot;if you&#39;re not scaling, you&#39;re not replacing a significant number of ICE semis

Maybe 1000 window ACs. But my 2 central ACs consume easily 4kW each. I rarely have to run both at once, though.

It is not an insulation issue. I  had an insulation specialist inspect it before I bought it. He said the insulation was so good there was nothing that could be done to improve it. Honest contractors are out there.The reason there are 2 central ACs is that it&#39;s a mansion. And I use zoning - 6 zones on one system, 4 on another, so that we only heat/cool the rooms we actually use, when we occupy them. The AC energy use is actually minuscule, relative to other things like electronics, hot tub and EV charging.

If you assumed the typical home was 2,000 sqft with a 35,000 BTU central AC, it&#39;s closer to around 500 homes, or basically a medium-sized neighborhood.

If you assumed the typical home was 2,000 sqft with a 35,000 BTU central AC

This is why imperial is wretched as a measurement system. Sure, feet are not inherently better or worse than meters, but why have weird units of power? Imperial makes anything that isn&#39;t the simplest of linear measurements a pain in the arse.

&quot;truck driving jobs will be like vacation&quot;

Not for a long time. Driving in a straight line down a highway and turning corners is the easy (for certain definitions of easy) part. The hard part comes when it gets to the yard and the driver needs to chat to the foreman about which docking ramp to park it at or whether to wait for N minutes or go to park over there for now or sorry we can&#39;t accept your load yet or there is a complete jumble of trucks with no obvious route though unless you ask someone.

This is one yard management system away from being fully autonomous. It&#39;s already done in parts of Europe and China.

The only way it would have made economic sense to have electric semis is with the previous administration investing hundreds of billions of dollars in developing the infrastructure needed to keep these trucks charged and on the road and with tax incentives for buyers.

Trump has completely destroyed all renewable incentives and development for the next 3 years. Nobody is going to sell a single electric semi in that time. No new massive charging stations built. No fleets converting to electric.

Even when we were on track for all the investment, there still were no buyers for electric semis. It just doesn&#39;t make economic sense. Forget about the cost of the truck, which is half of the problem. The other half is all of the problems and time delays and costs and complications and lack of resources and infrastructure.

Tesla semis weren&#39;t even good electric semis. Other semi manufacturers have better trucks built on established platforms with fewer problems.

I don&#39;t understand why they&#39;re still pretending Tesla is going to sell these to anybody. You will see &quot;pilot programs&quot; and &quot;evaluations&quot;, but it&#39;s just using budget allocated to Green ventures to make corporations seem more environmentally friendly. They aren&#39;t serious.

Well, truckers who have driven EV trucks have preferred them - they are much easier on the body than diesel engines. The smoothness and quietness of EVs mean their backs and joints don&#39;t hurt as much after a long day of driving.

Their instant torque also make them much nicer to drive in city traffic.

Sure the incentives might no longer exist, but the quality of the experience is such that it&#39;s likely to be something in demand.

What&#39;s likely to happen is hybrid trucks with fully electric drivetrains - so they g

There’s interviews with Chinese semi drivers online, and there’s a guy called the Electric Trucker who talks about his experiences in Europe

https://www.youtube.com/watch?... [youtube.com]

Yes. In fact the company he works for, Nano Janssen runs a fleet of electric semis across Europe. He&#39;s driven across all of Europe, including a 5000 km trip to Central Turkey. Fascinating stuff. Shows that with a little bit of infrastructure, ev trucking is viable. And if you coordinate charging with mandatory breaks, it works out well even at just 300 kw charging.

Some people on slashdot think that Europe is smaller than the United States for driving distances. It&#39;s not. Europe is a vast place. The differen

I can imagine that going uphill and downhill is also much easier in an electric truck.

“problems and time delays and costs and complications and lack of resources and infrastructure.”

Can you spell this out? What problems? When you say time delays, are you talking about on the road? Or in the infra buildout?

Sure. Now consider your statement in terms of an oil field and tell me if it is any less insane. Besides, what other use do you have for the reactor power when the demand is low? Power variation of a nuclear plant is notoriously unpleasant.

Yes, trucks are a moronic solution to long-haul, high volume transportation, whether electric or diesel. Railroad is the way where there is civilization. Once in the hub, electric or fossil fuel doesn&#39;t make whole lot of a difference in the final few miles.

This electric tractor might make it 500 miles on its own. Add the trailer and cargo and likely not even 200 miles.

You&#39;re just being unserious, you haven&#39;t even bothered to do a quick google on this.

Man are you going to be amazed when you find out how much power is needed to get gasoline to where it needs to be.

just build in an grappling hook to clip on to the power lines.

From the title I was fully expecting the grappling hook to clip onto a passing diesel semi.

just build in an grappling hook to clip on to the power lines.
Bumper Trucks! [wikipedia.org] :-)

just build in an grappling hook to clip on to the power lines.

Musk&#39;s answer would be, &quot;Not nearly enough&quot;.

Truck charging with 1.2 MW is not exactly new: https://www.youtube.com/watch?... [youtube.com]

So we will likely see a choice between the two at charging stations.You&#39;ll only find these in specific locations where trucks typically stop to refuel. Most people won&#39;t see a pump with an MCS option, just like most people don&#39;t see a pump with a high-flow diesel dispenser (which are everywhere at highway truckstops).

That kind of requirement is going to kill an already over burdened grid in many places.

*grabs popcorn and a cooler of beer for the show*Of course, there will probably be a bunch of comments about using renewables for powering the charging stations (solar and wind)... I wanna see how big the field of solar panels is to power one of these chargers.And, yeah... the heavier the load (or, if you prefer, the total weight), the harder the electric motor has to work, the more amps it draws.  So, are they just going to have a football stadium-sized charging station every 200 miles along every highway?

I seriously doubt a Tesla semi can drive even 200 to 300 miles with a full cargo load of 40,000 pounds.I doubt this too because they have already shown in tests that the Tesla semi drives 390 miles with a full cargo load. The videos are there, from multiple truck manufacturers. Tesla currently beat out Volvo who only achieved 375 miles on the FH Electric. DAF XF achieved only 310 miles.Is this the whole EV thing over and over again? People having &quot;doubts&quot; about technology that is in use and has demonstrations already in place?

In Europe there are quite a few electric semis on the road, with gvw up to 48 tonnes.  Real world range of about 500 km.   So Tesla s numbers are realistic.  In Europe the average seems to be about 1.2 km per kwh fully loaded.  And as long as you come back down there other side with regenerative braking, you can get that same efficiency going up mountains.

It&#39;s nice that a big diesel can hold fuel for 2000 miles but no driver is going to or be allowed to drive that without stopping for breaks.  In Europe cha

good luck trying to call the State of Alaska to the stand.

I expect we will see a court decide that. Generally, when legal questions are answered in a context that looks trustworthy to a layperson, it will be on the information provider, even with disclaimers in place, unless basically every statement is prefixed by IANAL.

I know that.  You know that.  Even the AI grifters know that, they just pretend otherwise.

You are correct.  The people quoted in this summary seem to believe that hallucinations are a solvable problem for AI, and that they solved it, it just took a lot longer than expected.

Nope, they didn&#39;t solve it.  Their AI will still hallucinate, and can still be jailbroken too.  Their optimism suggests a severe lack of due diligence, despite the extended period they have worked on this.  I am imagining some egos are involved that simply cannot admit to failure, especially given what they have spent, but that is going to make it all the more embarrassing (and harmful) when the hallucinations cause real world harm and they take it offline at that time.

On the other hand, maybe they actually DID make an AI chatbot that never hallucinates!  What an amazing leap forward for AI tech!  This is really going to revolutionize the industry!  (But does anyone at all actually believe this?  I sure don&#39;t.)

Is the Justice Department 100% accurate? When the highest levels of government fail your accuracy tests, is it cherry-picking to seize on AI mistakes?

Human mistakes are of an entirely different nature and quality than AI &#39;mistakes&#39;.  A human won&#39;t accidentally make up facts, cases, or sources.  A human won&#39;t write summaries of things that don&#39;t exist.  A human won&#39;t accidentally directly contradict a source while citing it.  A human is also actually capable of identifying and correcting mistakes, unlike an LLM.  Stop with this absurd nonsense that it&#39;s okay for LLMs to &quot;make mistakes&quot; because humans also &quot;make mistakes&quot;  These things are not the same and you know it.

As for this 100% business, with AI, you&#39;d be lucky to get 60% accuracy.  A human with that kind of track record offering legal advice would be arrested.

One thing LLM-type chatbots do not do is reliable information supply. There will be hallucinations, misstatements, lies by omission, and eventually they will have to switch it off again, permanently.

Good luck with that. If they have to prefix every statement with &quot;IANAL&quot;, they might not se much use.

Have you considered owning your projections? How many cases where LLM answers are good do you leave out?

You are confused as to what requirement information production has. As soon as there is a significant level of false statements, it becomes totally useless in mist scenarios. You are just too clueless to understand that.

Let&#39;s say we live in a fantasy land where LLMs are magically 95% accurate.  Would you trust a car that only worked 95% of the time?  What about brakes that only stopped your car 95% of the time?

What about legal advice?  Would you hire a lawyer that would make up silly nonsense 5% of the time?

Sorry, kid.  LLMs just aren&#39;t the science fiction fantasy that you want them to be.  Your AI girlfriend does not and can not love you.  You&#39;re not going to have a robot slave.  Whatever nonsense it is that you&#39;re hoping

Indeed. In most production scenarios, unreliability is a very bad killer.

One thing LLM-type chatbots do not do is reliable information supply. Exactly. For all of the hoopla, It is a stark fact that AI can and will train itself on lies as well as truth. And  manually searching the web shows that lies are as common as truth. And even if not lies, so much is opinion. 

A human in the loop can do better, even then we are not infallible, especially when dealing with opinion based &quot;facts&quot;.  But we have a better bullshit filter. AI has none.  Which loops us right back to your statement on reliable information supply.

The article and commenters agree: creating an AI to answer probate questions is tricky, unreliable, takes a lot of resources, and can cause serious problems when it gives wrong answers.  So how about approaching the problem from a different angle: simplify probate laws.

We all know that&#39;s easier to say than to do, but ask yourself if it&#39;s easier than creating an accurate and reliable AI.  When your people can&#39;t understand the laws and the processes they&#39;re required to live under, maybe the solution is to cha

Probate laws are that complicated for a reason. They need to handle all those special cases and exceptions to the general rules, and you can&#39;t always just go &quot;Well, we just won&#39;t handle them.&quot;. They were added because they came up at some point and had to be handled, they&#39;ll come up again and will need to be handled for the same reasons they needed to be handled before.

why not ask the ai chat bot to give a source for the answer?

That&#39;s one of the methods. The chatbot can access a database (e.g. of court cases) and is instructed to only answer using data accessed from the database. Hallucinations come from when the model needs to improvise. If the knowledge is in the model, it will &quot;hallucinate&quot; a correct answer, otherwise a plausible but incorrect answer. If you fetch the case from the database and add it to the input, it will access more the case in the input than using the model to generate/hallucinate something, so it doesn&#39;t ma

&quot;...to staff the phone lines just like we used to, so that our citizens will continue to have access to accurate advice.&quot;

I kept waiting for them to say that! Given all the stated difficulties, the need for constant vigilance and updates, and the risk of harm to citizens.

This is in no way specific to California.  Or to the United States, for that matter.

It&#39;s common to any large bureaucracy.  Of which government is very much one.  It&#39;s one very good reason why the politics of growing government bigger and bigger never accomplish anything of value beyond more government workers requiring more tax collection to pay their salaries.

I&#39;ve been in California for all of 3.5 years, and there are two things I&#39;ve learned:- While it&#39;s known all over America how high California&#39;s taxes are, nobody here actually knows what that money gets spent on, other than politician salaries- City level elected politicians get paid more than the US congress, some of them twice as much, and some even more than POTUS, like fire and police chiefs.- Nobody has any idea how the government works, which includes the governor and the legislature, none of whom can s

Maybe this is a dumb question, but have the newspapers in California tried selling subscriptions to their readers?

I mean I&#39;m sure they have tons of readers who really want to read their texts. I&#39;m sure they&#39;d be happy to pay for it, if only the newspapers would think to ask them for it.

I want to point out that for the most part they were always like this, but they used to expect that readers could read so they had to be a little more deceptive about it in some cases.

There is always bias. What stories get covered, who is interviewed, how they are reported was always biased.

They wouldn&#39;t, because the standard is now to have all computers with an always-on internet connection, and would most likely self-activate as soon as you login to a microsoft account. As it&#39;s done in the background, there&#39;s no prompt.

On the other hand, those using Windows XP would have seen it as an option, especially if they were one of the few people at the time

So precisely what I said &quot;virtually no one&quot;. Nearly all consumer windows licenses come with a machine. No one &quot;buys&quot; windows. And corporate licenses don&#39;t use these mechanisms either.

This could affect any Windows user, so while it will not affect most Windows users, it&#39;s still a potential problem for any of them. If something happens to activation, whether because of just some new bug or because of a hardware change (user has something they need on their PC so they pay for a repair and the system decides it&#39;s a different system now) then they may be left unable to reactivate. This has happened in the past, and Microsoft is infamous for having the same problems linger on for multiple Win

Congrats on not being a normal user. You are the 0.1%

I had to use phone activation for Windows 7 Pro after a clean reinstallation on a Dell Precision workstation.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only person who&#39;s had to use it in some situation.

I&#39;m sure you&#39;re not the only person either. That doesn&#39;t make it in any way something a normal person would do. So let me say again this affects virtually no one. In case you like the other poster above doesn&#39;t understand what the term virtually means it is an adverb which means &quot;nearly&quot;. Congrats on being in the 0.1%

I&#39;ve used it before for activating Windows XP -- which is the last Windows version I ran before switching to Linux.

I&#39;ve activated windows by phone a couple times though certainly not recently. The last time was 2020 or so.

Indeed. But I still think MS needs to keep the no-account open, because the GDPR does not actually allow forced sign-up unless it is necessary for the nature of the service. MS is trying to give that appearance (via one-drive, for example), but it is not going to hold up in court.

Errr false. I don&#39;t know if you know what a sign-up is or how the GDPR works, but online activation is most definitely permitted as a requirement for purchasing a product, as does forced accounts to use a product. What the GDPR does provide is a requirement that you aren&#39;t forced into an online account / activation process after purchase that didn&#39;t exist at the time of the purchase. E.g. Meta requiring Oculus users suddenly migrate to a Facebook account or have their devices unusable was a GDPR violation.

Sounds great... I didn&#39;t want to use any of the software or games I bought.Better to run Windows in a VM just to run the new game or program, and take a performance hit.Now... if someone made a version of *Nix that could natively install Windows programs and whatnot _without using WINE or a VM_ (the way Windows handles it), that might push more people to *Nix, otherwise it&#39;s just a hobby thing.

It should be relatively easy to reverse engineer the way that Windows installers are put together and processed so

Sure seems that way, if the only way you can activate Windows is to have an active internet connection.

Now I suspect DoD and other large scale accounts can cut a deal to get a &quot;gold master&quot; that doesn&#39;t contain a requirement for on-line activation. But it seems to me that there are good reasons to have air-gapped systems in manufacturing or similar process control situations, as one example domain.    Previously, you could obtain and transfer updates through a physical device (which, of course, you&#39;d have to verify and trust the device and its contents.)

I guess Iran won&#39;t be using this version of Windows for uranium processing...

I&#39;m guessing you don&#39;t know all the ways to activate Windows then.

Standard Windows keys require Microsoft for activation. MAK (multi-activation keys) also require MS. However, KMS (Key Management Service) however does not. KMS uses a locally controlled server for activation. This is quite common in large organizations that deal with a high quantity of machines (think fortune 500 orgs w/ 100k+ employees w/ laptops). This would of course also cover the military. Do you think the DoD was using phone activation this entire time for their air-gapped machines? No, they have the private DoD network w/ this type of infrastructure (at least, this is my assumption)

Assuming you can actually maintain a KMS server permanently offline.  Since part of SCIF mandates also require OS patching with read-only media, it can become a lot more complex to maintain.

Now I suspect DoD and other large scale accounts can cut a deal to get a &quot;gold master&quot;Literally no corporations DoD or small enterprises rely on Microsoft for activation. They use a Key management Service to activate locally provisioned windows systems without any need to reach the internet outside the organisation. This has been the case since the days of Windows Vista.Heck KMS is the default piracy workaround for windows in general. Pirated copies of Windows and Office are activated by running KMS locally on the machine.

Activation will be tied to your Microsoft Account, and a subscription will also be assigned to it.

I see where you are going, Adobe could buy windows and the new AI Improved Adobe Windows could come with a lot $49.99 monthly sdudscription fee.

They&#39;re going to do it. It&#39;s not going to be a success. Everyone will riot. Satya Nadella will have to flee the country.

This already is the case. Your license is tied to your account as is your PC. You can use your Microsoft account to move a windows activation license from one PC to another. And if you subscribe to Microsoft 365 that is also tied to your account.

I&#39;m not sure what you think the purpose of these accounts are, but this is literally why they exist. Tie products and hardware to people.

The only time I&#39;ve had to do phone activation is for activating Terminal Service Licenses for Citrix clusters in enterprise.  I wonder if that will also be affected or not.

It is kind of a Stockholm Syndrome type of effect. That and a quasi-monopoly maintained by illegal business practices. Both factors are reeeeeally bad for quality.

Large industrial machines have an EOL measured in decades. You do not replace a lathe the size of a bus or a container ship because a Windows version changedI have to maintain a variety of air-gapped boxes that run win 7, and two even still on XP.After that date, manufacturers got smart and most everyone shipped Linux based control systems, but it took them a while, and still to this day not everyone has.They are going to have to have some way to allow new installations of legacy versions.

Did they ever fix the McLaren F1 dependence on a Compaq LTE 5280 to perform maintenance?

I know of several legacy industrial systems running DOS, as they depend on software with built-in drivers which must communicate with long EOL ISA or PCI interfaces. It&#39;s expensive, but there are sources for legacy hardware (as well as old surplus) for this very market. Yeah you might pay USD$10K for a machine capable of reliably booting MSDOS 3.3, but it&#39;s cheap compared to the $250K CnC lathe or mill for which there are no more modern controls.

The Vortex86 CPU implements the 486 (and some later ones Penti

Well, I know people that had to move off Windows as an industrial controller (which is pretty stupid anyways), because they need a network connection and Windows update was slow enough to kill the bio-rectors controlled.

They are going to have to have some way to allow new installations of legacy versions.They will not. A non-activated offline Windows presents no problem for such machines. The fundamental limit to an inactivated version of Windows was that it was blocked from updates and that it set your wallpaper black. The former doesn&#39;t matter (out of support), and the latter ... whop-de-fucking-do.

I still have some old machines that have no network card.  They might still have dial-up modems.  Does a drive failure then &quot;destroy&quot; those machines from being what they were.  I want to keep them exactly as they are (they are backed up)--I don&#39;t want to put Linux on them, for example.

What are you doing wrong that windows phone activation comes into play when you replace a failed drive and restore a backup to it?

Because the GDPR forbids a need to create an account unless it is needed. Windows does not need an account.

Well, maybe another $500M fine will remind Microsoft that the law applies to them...

They&#39;ll just eat the fine and continue. If they get fined they can also state EULA violation and shut off all M$ logins in the EU combined with a bitlocker key change that isn&#39;t registered in the TPM and ask for a recovery fee of $10k per computer and login.

They&#39;ll just eat the fine and continue.Haahahaha, no. If the illegal behavior is not stopped, there will be a 2nd fine and after that a prohibition to process personal information of any kind. That would mean their accounts become illegal in Europe. If they still continue, company representatives can get arrested and infrastructure seized and switched off. At least step 3 has happened to some company, I think in Greece. They are not even allowed to do their own HR anymore.MS has no choice but to comply.

There&#39;ll be zero fines, because your fantasy version of the GDPR in your head is irrelevant.

False, it does no such thing. You seemingly have no idea how the GDPR works. What it does do is set a sunset time on any user related data assigned to an account, kept &quot;no longer than necessary&quot;. It also prevents the requirement to force an account on a user at a later date that didn&#39;t exist at the time of purchase.

Not only does GDPR not preclude the requirement for an account to use a product, given several of Window&#39;s advertised features don&#39;t actually work without an account you&#39;re wrong about the &quot;need&quot;

There is no recourse for when online activation breaks. I used to call that number and explain: my effing hard drive died // or Windows cruft crashed so I need to reinstall on the same pc -- and they&#39;d say, ok, use this new code instead. Now I have to buy a whole new motherfucking license.

Yes I also use Linux but sometimes I need to use Windows Apps because they&#39;re the ones that can access my data.

I just activated an offline windows 10 system a couple weeks ago

Yes the phone menu is gone. It directs you to online

But you can offline activate using their website and type in the code directly on the offline system

I noticed this last year when trying to activate an old copy of MS office 2013.I guess you could argue that I shouldn&#39;t be using an old unsupported copy, but this is for use in a non internet connected system.I ended up downloading a crack and that worked.

In a lengthy press conference Saturday detailing the U.S. military’s capture of Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro, President Donald Trump confirmed, with stunning frankness, the classic leftist critique of American foreign policy: that, at least for as long as he’s in power, it’s all about the oil.

Over the past few months, Trump and his aides had characterized their pressure campaign against Maduro’s regime as a war on “narco-terrorism” and a fight to restore democratic rule. But following Maduro’s extraction in a complex military and intelligence operation, the American president was clear about its true motive.

“We’re going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,” he said, adding, “We can’t take a chance that somebody else takes over Venezuela that doesn’t have the good of the Venezuelan people in mind.” Then came the kicker: “We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in” and spend billions of dollars fixing the energy infrastructure that they developed decades ago, until socialist regimes nationalized their wells, then wrecked them. The wealth resulting from this grab-back will benefit the Venezuelan people, he said, but added that much of it will reimburse America’s oil companies.

Finally, Trump said, U.S. troops will be sent to enforce Big Oil’s rule, if necessary. “They always say ‘boots on the ground,’ we’re not afraid of boots on the ground,” he said. “We had boots on the ground last night,” as part of the operation to extract Maduro. He said the military was poised to go in again if necessary.

There’s a storied history, starting in the Cold War, of the U.S. military and the CIA co-opting or overthrowing Central and South American governments—including Guatemala, Brazil, Ecuador, the Dominican Republic, Chile, as well as several attempt to do so in Cuba—to bolster the interests of U.S. corporations, including United Fruit, IT&T, and various oil companies, among others.

But rarely have the presidents who ordered these interventions been so blatant about the primary motive. Instead, at least in public, they spoke of fighting Communism or upholding democracy, even when the enemies weren’t really Communist and their allies weren’t at all democratic.

But Trump was up front in his motives, and repeatedly so. Several times in his press conference, he talked of bringing in big U.S. oil companies to regain their former assets. (In fact, though, American firms never owned the land where they drilled for Venezuela’s oil riches, and, as in many other countries, the interplay between foreign exploiters and local nationalizers was more complex than Trump’s narrative suggests.) And he also talked about restoring “American dominance in the Western hemisphere”—a policy that Trump’s recently issued National Security Strategy called the “Trump corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine. “We are reasserting American power in a very powerful way in our home region,” he said—not to protect democracy but for its own sake.

Maduro and his wife were captured, then indicted by the U.S. Attorney in New York, on charges of drug trafficking. But Trump all but admitted that wasn’t the real reason for the elaborate operation. Just a month ago, while officers were planning the attack on Venezuela, Trump pardoned former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernández, who had been convicted of drug-trafficking. Asked about this at Saturday’s news conference, Trump said he’d issued the pardon because Hernández, who’d supported Trump, had been “treated unfairly” by former President Joe Biden.

As for democracy, Trump was asked whether he would support María Corina Machado, the Nobel Prize-winning leader of Venezuela’s opposition movement, to lead a new government—or even whether he’d spoken with her. Trump answered no to both questions. “It would be very tough for her to be the leader,” he said in a dismissive tone. “She doesn’t have the respect in the country.” Nor did he even mention Edmundo González, who was elected Venezuela’s president in 2024 and fled to safe exile in Spain after Maduro stole the election.

Earlier on Saturday, in an interview on Fox News, Trump acted as if he’d barely thought about Machado or Gonzalez. “I mean, I don’t know about what kind of an election that was,” he said, referring to the 2024 contest. Meanwhile, he said, “They have a vice president, you know.”

Later, during Saturday’s press conference, Trump acknowledged that the Venezuelan vice president, Delcy Rodríguez—who, by law, has now been sworn in as president—was handpicked by Maduro. He added that Secretary of State Marco Rubio is now “working with” Rodriguez, who is “willing to do what’s necessary to make Venezuela great again.”

Venezuelan law requires an ascending vice president to call for new elections, but this doesn’t seem in the offing. Asked who precisely is going to “run” Venezuela, Trump replied, “We’re designating various people … It’s largely going to be the people standing right behind me”—who included Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Dan Caine. “Venezuela has a lot of bad people,” Trump added. “We’re not going to take a chance that one of those people take over from Maduro.”

Asked how long this transition will take, Trump said he’d  “like to do it quickly,” but that rebuilding the country’s oil infrastructure “takes a period of time.”

Still, it remains unclear how America really will “run” Venezuela, a country of 28.5 million people, roughly the size of Texas or California. Its military officers, most of whom were loyal to Maduro, are still in place, as are its cabinet ministers and bureaucrats. Trump said that many of them will soon be switching sides. Maybe, maybe not. There are also more than 20,000 Cubans in Venezuela, many of them military and intelligence officers, many others health-care workers, all of them providing services in exchange for Venezuelan oil. Will they be leaving? Will power struggles be breaking out? Will the military simply adapt to Washington’s demands, in exchange for guarantees to stay in power?

Then there are broader questions. The whole world is watching not just this operation—an impressive tactical display of U.S. military power—but what happens next. Trump’s unabashedly imperial rationale for the action may inspire Russian President Vladimir Putin to double down on his claims of rightful dominance over Ukraine—and Chinese President Xi Jinping to feel more confident in his claims over Taiwan. At the same time, anti-regime activists in Iran may feel emboldened, especially since Trump said, just the other day, that he stands “locked and loaded” to punish Tehran’s leaders if they killed protesters.

Finally, there is Cuba. In his press conference, Trump noted similarities between Cuba and Venezuela. Both countries have been wrecked by socialist dictators, and “we want to help the people in Cuba.” Rubio, a Cuban-American who has avidly supported the anti-Castro movement in Florida (which he once represented as a senator), added, “If I lived in Havana and worked in the government, I’d be concerned.”

Meanwhile, the U.S. aircraft carrier and its supporting armada, which had mobilized off Venezuela’s shore before the operation, remain deployed, and on high alert. “We’re ready to stage a second and much larger attack if we need to do so,” Trump said.

It was around noon when I stepped off the train, surfacing into Lower Manhattan’s particular brand of winter blight—when the cold is amplified by tall buildings that block out direct sun and funnel air directly onto your face. It was about 25 degrees, though the temperature felt theoretical once the wind got involved. Within minutes my ears had gone brittle, aching in that sharp kind of way that makes you briefly resent your parents for ever leaving the Middle East.

I followed a small group of South Asian aunties in industrial-grade puffers and bright yellow “Zohran” campaign beanies, which smartly functioned equally as political statements and survival gear. They led me toward the official public “block party,” a kenneled-off stretch of Broadway that I had optimistically imagined would involve warmth-adjacent amenities: food carts, coffee in little paper cups that burn your fingers just a bit, maybe even porta-potties. Instead, it was a wide, empty street hemmed in by police barricades and a few enormous screens. Music blasted. People stood around. That was it.

The aunties seemed genuinely delighted, bopping along to Bruno Mars as if this were the triumph of civic joy they had been waiting for since Election Day. I, meanwhile, realized that joy without circulation was not sustainable for me. I lasted maybe five minutes.

I cut north toward City Hall Plaza, where the actual inauguration was scheduled to take place.

I was expecting a spectacle. Zohran Mamdani is a New York mayor of many firsts: the first Muslim, the first South Asian, the first African-born, the first millennial. In the middle of the Trump era—which has been particularly hostile to every one of those identities—I wanted to see how that collision landed in person. I was curious how ordinary New Yorkers, from the people who powered his rise to City Hall to those who opposed it and everyone in between, would experience a moment that already felt larger than a single election.

What I found instead was something messier and more revealing. New York was working through its feelings in real time. Pride and paranoia crossed paths on the sidewalk. Joy and cynicism hovered in the frozen air. As always, the city was a layered collage best understood through the small encounters and fleeting scenes unfolding at street level as history happened in the background.

Along the barricades, I passed a small group of protesters waving Israeli flags. I approached one woman for a quote. She immediately bristled, waving her hand in my face and telling me to leave, then threatening to call the police—an escalation that felt unnecessary given that we were already surrounded by officers.

Another protester, who declined to provide her name, apologized quietly for the interaction. She told me that some of the others were “kind of crazy.” She stood a few feet away from them, holding her flag politely, not chanting or yelling. She said she was worried about Mamdani’s “background” and wanted to show support for Israel in defiance of a mayor who had broken with New York’s long tradition of unyielding support for the Israeli government. She sounded less angry than anxious, fixated on Mamdani’s outspokenness on what experts have called a genocide, and her nervousness for the future of Zionist New Yorkers.

By the time I reached the security entrance, the program was supposed to start in less than an hour. Volunteers urged attendees to take their seats, but they milled around, greeting old friends, hugging, shouting names across rows of white folding chairs. Unlike the public block party, this felt like a gathering of the campaign’s engine—organizers, supporters, donors, artists, electeds—the people who had powered what many still described as the biggest political upset since Donald Trump’s 2016 win.

Just inside the checkpoint, a woman smiled and said, “Hi, I’m Marisa.” Another chimed in: “Hi, I’m Natasha.” It took me a second to register that they were Marisa Tomei and Natasha Lyonne. Neither was surrounded by handlers or slated to speak. They were simply there, guests like everyone else, bundled up and waiting for things to begin. Both were warm and unfussy, radiating the kind of ease that comes from being completely at home in a crowd like this. The inauguration hadn’t even started, and already it was a vibe.

Hundreds filled the seats. There was music, chatter, the low buzz of anticipation. And yet, nothing about this place was warm. I was uncontrollably shivering.

I started mentally cataloging everything I hadn’t brought with me: a fluffy scarf, a hat that actually covered my ears, maybe even a balaclava, though I doubted that would play well for an Arab at an inauguration, even with the mayor being a Muslim.

Everywhere I looked were red Democratic Socialists of America beanies, pulled low, doing the quiet but essential work of insulation. I considered asking for one, though I want to be clear: I wanted one because my head was so cold I could feel my thoughts slowing down. Still, there was something remarkable about the destigmatization of a previously dirty word in politics out in force on the lawn of City Hall.

Then I saw him. A Sikh man a few rows from the front unfurled a blanket with the calm confidence of someone who had planned for this exact scenario. He wrapped himself completely and settled into his chair. At regular intervals, he poured himself a cup of steaming hot chai from his thermos. I watched with envy the way the steam rose into the air. I’d have traded my camera for a sip.

The crowd itself felt carefully curated: actors, activists, organizers, journalists, all packed together. Walton Goggins, of HBO’s The White Lotus, hovered nearby, visibly delighted to see Lyonne. Model Waris Ahluwalia looked impeccable, as expected. Kareem Rahma, of Subway Takes fame, fresh off the best year of his career, filmed the scene on his caseless iPhone. Mustafa the Poet was there too, unmistakable and stylish.

Then came the faces I knew from my reporting in 2025: Mohsen Mahdawi and Mahmoud Khalil, Palestinian students of Columbia University with green cards who had been detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement for their activism. Linda Sarsour, a Brooklyn-born activist, sat near the front in a striking purple hijab. Simone Zimmerman, a Zeteo contributor and a central focus of the film Israelism. Writer Suzy Hansen and I exchanged smiles as we took it all in.

It was brutally cold. Sitting felt impossible. I kept moving, using my camera as an excuse. “If I sit, I’ll miss the moment,” I kept telling people. I ran into familiar faces—Asad Dandia, Husein Yatabarry, Dr. Debbie Almontaser—Muslim New Yorkers I know as part of the civic ecosystem that helped propel Mamdani to success.

As I continued to circle the crowd, ducking between rows of folding chairs, I caught the same refrains over and over. Visitors chatted as they tried to process what they were watching unfold.

“I’ve never seen this much negative coverage of any New York mayor. Fearmongering and what ifs count as journalism now?” one said. Another agreed. “Even if he can’t accomplish everything—because, let’s be honest, they’re going to make his life hell—at least he’s given us a vision of what different could look like,” they noted. “Anyone who has to contort themselves this hard to hate the most likable political figure imaginable clearly has a persecution fetish.”

A Muslim woman in hijab said, “If the Democratic Party had half Mamdani’s integrity, the fascists wouldn’t be winning.” An excited fan waving a handmade Mamdani sign exclaimed, “Zohran delivered Bernie clapping in a beanie—already the best mayor!” Another reveler asked: “Wait. Is that Susan Sarandon? That’s definitely Susan Sarandon. And John Turturro. Right?”

I also overheard some fierce debates between visitors in DSA hats. “This feels like Obama all over again, and that scares me. They’re going to sabotage him at every turn and then blame him when things don’t magically work,” said one. “Can we stop saying ‘free’ transit? We pay for it. Libraries, schools, buses, that’s what taxes are for.” Said another: “Socialists used to hold office in this country. They helped win labor rights we take for granted,” They added: “MAGA keeps saying they hate corrupt billionaire elites—but they’re terrified of a guy who wants to tax the rich? What did you think an ‘everyman’ mayor was supposed to do?”

(At one point, people around me began whispering excitedly about outgoing Mayor Eric Adams. Apparently, he looked miserable. Someone said, “He’s having a terrible time.” Someone else replied, “Good.” I had snapped a photo earlier in which he appeared to be pouting. I showed it to them. They leaped with joy. It was petty. It was human.)

The program began with a speech delivered by an excited Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. “New York City has chosen the ambitious pursuit of universal child care, affordable rents and housing, and clean and dignified public transit for all. We have chosen that over the distractions of bigotry and the barbarism of extreme income inequality.”

She and other speakers made several references to the fact that the city was now officially in the care of its first Muslim leader. Imam Khalid Latif was the New York Police Department’s first Muslim chaplain and executive director and chaplain (imam) for the Islamic Center at New York University; he left the latter post last summer to become the co-founder and executive director of the Islamic Center of New York City. As with the many sermons he’s given for Friday prayer, he delivered a moving speech that explicitly tied Mamdani’s faith to his politics.

I came expecting a political coronation. But as I worked my way through the crowd, it felt closer to a collective recalibration—a moment to take stock of how ideas once dismissed as fringe, like openly taxing wealthy citizens, were now being voiced from the steps of City Hall without apology, and to wonder how much further the shift could go.

Bernie Sanders delivered an impassioned speech in which he demanded our government put a stop to growing income inequality. The audience collectively broke out into a loud chant: “Tax the rich!” A person next to me remarked, “Let’s start with everyone up there!,” pointing to Mamdani’s political allies who had joined him onstage.

There was still plenty of starry-eyed enthusiasm for the handsome young mayor and the hope he represented. But beneath that was something more measured: a curiosity about how far the boundaries of the possible had moved in just a year.

For Muslim New Yorkers, however, the moment carried an undeniable added weight. It marked a break from the post-9/11 norms of suspicion and overpolicing many had grown accustomed to, even if no one pretended a finish line had been crossed. If the election signaled anything, it was that the city was willing, at least for now, to test what happens when the old guardrails of governance are loosened and we head in a new direction.

When Mamdani finally took the stage, the energy spiked. At 34, he is the city’s youngest mayor in over a century and, as its first Muslim mayor, the first to take the oath of office on a Quran. Sanders administered the oath, a detail that might have seemed odd given that the senator represents Vermont, but Mamdani cut his political teeth working on Sanders’ campaign, borrowed much of his democratic socialist vocabulary from him, and describes the senator as a political role model. In that sense, it appeared more like an anointing than a procedural formality: the veteran of the American left passing the baton to a younger standard-bearer.

But that raises an obvious question, one that has hovered over Mamdani’s rise from the start: Is he controversial more for his politics or for his religion? The honest answer is that the two are often deliberately collapsed into each other by critics who want to scare Americans with labels, a tactic that would be funny were they not so malignant: think “Islamo-Marxism” and “Islamo-Communism.” Both are shorthand for something foreign.

This is where I should stop and define what democratic socialism is, as it’s been at the center of much of the misinformation about Mamdani. Democratic socialism, as practiced by Zohran Mamdani, is not about abolishing markets or nationalizing everything in sight. It’s about using democratic government to make sure basic needs—housing, transit, health care, education—aren’t treated like luxury goods. New York already runs on plenty of these ideas: public schools, public hospitals, rent regulation, the subway. No one panics when the fire department shows up. We’ve just decided, over time, that some things work better when profit isn’t the point.

There’s also the religion—one that Mamdani and I share. He ran openly as a Muslim in a city still shaped by 9/11, where the backlash that followed turned Muslims in New York and New Jersey into targets of NYPD surveillance and, at times, convenient scapegoats for elected officials. Mamdani made efforts to reassure skeptics, but he didn’t shrink himself to avoid the familiar panic. Claims of divided loyalties will echo, along with other decades-old tropes. Instead, he adopted a posture many of us learned long ago: smiling, appealing to shared humanity and civil rights, refusing to let bad-faith attacks dictate his mood. When you’re held up by a community, the panic stays external.

Then, Mayor Zohran Kwame Mamdani delivered his speech. It was measured, full of gratitude, hope, and defiance, which was the opposite of how Mamdani’s rise has been framed in much of the country. For months, the panic had been building, growing louder and more unhinged the closer he got to actually winning. After he defeated Andrew Cuomo, parts of the right responded with something less like political critique than demographic hallucination. In November, Sen. Tommy Tuberville warned that New York was already lost.

“We just saw what happened in New York,” he said. “We lost New York. It will be completely Muslim in three or four years.” In the senator’s framing, Mamdani is an appendage of a nefarious global force seeking to destroy America. Mamdani’s speech showed he understands New York, and America, possibly better than anyone else, definitely more than Tuberville.

Tuberville, who has described Islam as a “cult” and suggested that Muslims are “here to conquer,” is not fringe. His comments circulated widely, echoed by conservative commentators and algorithmically rewarded for their certainty. “He was just sworn in on the Quran,” wrote right-wing influencer Benny Johnson. “New York, we tried to warn you.”

Warned us of what, exactly? It’s not clear. That a Muslim might govern openly as himself? That a holy book might briefly appear on a municipal stage? That the city where nearly every language and religion on earth already exists in public would somehow collapse under the weight of its own plurality?

Throughout, Zionist protesters across the barricades tried to break the moment with air horns, their blare faint but audible on the official recording. No one onstage flinched. Mamdani didn’t pause. The crowd didn’t turn. The speech carried on, uninterrupted.

When the new mayor turned to the question of who this city is for, he was blunt. “They will be Russian Jewish immigrants in Brighton Beach,” he said. “They will be Palestinian New Yorkers in Bay Ridge who will no longer have to contend with a politics that speaks of universalism and then makes them the exception.” I interpreted it as a rebuke of a Democratic culture long comfortable invoking unity while carving out exclusions.

Standing there in the cold, watching Mamdani rest his hand on the Quran while Sanders administered the oath, I found the disconnect impossible to ignore. There was no takeover, no creeping caliphate. Just a bundled-up mayor promising to govern “audaciously,” speaking to a crowd that looked exactly like New York at its best. What struck me most was how unremarkable it all was, in a good way. He didn’t brandish it as a symbol or treat the moment like a breakthrough to be celebrated. He took the oath. He finished. The ceremony moved on. It was quiet, almost defiant in its normality. It was a welcome change.

And yet I felt something else too—something I hadn’t quite expected. A flicker of satisfaction. A guilty, bracing thrill.

For years, Muslim Americans have been instructed explicitly to keep our heads down. To soften ourselves. To reassure the anxious who are deeply misinformed about the content of the Quran and the nature of its followers. I saw it in my family too. My father, who worked in New York as a taxicab and black car driver for 30 years, told me to be grateful, to be quiet, and to avoid bringing any extra attention to ourselves or our community. That we had enough problems to deal with and didn’t need to give anyone an excuse to train their Islamophobia on us. My mom took a slightly different approach, noting that it was up to us to gently prove we are not the nightmare someone else keeps insisting we are by being nice, being charitable at every opportunity, and making sure everyone knows we’re Muslim if only just to offer them another glimpse of what we are to contrast with what they might assume.

Watching the panic unfold, I realized that part of what felt so electric about this moment was that, for once, the discomfort and uncertainty had shifted off my shoulders and onto those who hate American Muslims the most.

For just a moment, it wasn’t Muslims being asked to stomach their fear for what the future might hold. It was the people who hate us trying—and failing—to make Mamdani into some Muslim ideologue who moonlights as a jihadist with dual allegiance to a nonexistent global Muslim cabal.

In his speech, Mamdani directly addressed his skeptics, those who “view this administration with distrust or disdain,” and told them plainly: “If you are a New Yorker, I am your mayor.” He invoked what he loved about growing up in the city, the languages, foods, and neighborhoods, the fact that he, a Muslim, can have bagel and lox as one of his weekly rituals. He described a place that looked and sounded exactly like the crowd shivering in front of him. It’s hopeful to see oneself in the top seat. It’s a new experience for us, something others get to experience. Can’t we just have that?

I was cold and extremely ready to go home, more than confident I had seen enough for my story and eager to be out of the cold. And then, outside, like a glitch in the city, I ran into Curtis Sliwa—the 2025 Republican candidate for New York mayor. He was alone, wandering.

He told me he had RSVP’d and “was in line with all the peeps waiting to get in” but had never made it inside. He didn’t even catch Mamdani’s speech. The line was too long. I asked why he hadn’t gone to the front, that surely someone would have recognized him and ushered him inside. He laughed and said he preferred it this way: “Come on. I’m no VIP. I’m just one of the regular people out of the subway into the streets.” He said he had no regrets about his campaign. He smiled when he recalled Mamdani saying he’d rather be trapped in an elevator with Sliwa than Cuomo. He told me he planned to support Mamdani. “He won fair and square. He should be given a chance to put his agenda into place. Even if you disagree with him politically, you got to say: If he is successful, then the city is successful, the state, the country, everyone is successful. But you have haters out there, and that’s what life is about.”

He admitted he felt wanted by neither Republicans nor Democrats. “I’m an outlier,” he said. “I’d rather be with the people.”

Then he vanished into the afternoon just as quickly as he’d appeared.

What stayed with me wasn’t just pride, though there was plenty of that. It was relief. Relief that, for once, a side selling hope instead of fear had won. And it was clear this wasn’t some narrow Muslim celebration. Muslims largely supported Mamdani, but they weren’t automatic votes. They were earned. He campaigned for them, chasing them around at one of the public celebrations that make New York such an exciting place to live.

That’s the complexity of it. The pride of watching a Muslim achieve something historic, paired with the humility of knowing that this victory doesn’t belong to Muslims alone. Zohran Mamdani isn’t a “Muslim mayor” the way his critics insist.

Every year, Amicus co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern invite listeners to nominate the Supreme Court’s most egregious behavior, then choose their own “worst of the worst” to memorialize the most ignominious moments. In 2025, there was no shortage of contenders. In a preview of their conversation on this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode, Lithwick reveals the SCOTUS lowlight that still rankles her the most. This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mark Joseph Stern: We certainly had a bumper crop of bad decisions this year. What’s your nominee for worst of the worst?

Dahlia Lithwick: There were a lot of decisions in 2025 that immiserated huge amounts of people and made the world materially worse. But my pick is not one of those. Instead, I need to talk about NIH v. American Public Health Association. Yes, it has to do with slashing research grants, which does materially harm a lot of people. But more profoundly for me, this case is emblematic of every single level of destruction and mayhem coming out of the Supreme Court—all the arrogance bundled into one.

So let me take you back to August, when the justices handed down NIH. It’s another unsigned, incoherent shadow-docket order pausing U.S. District Judge William Young’s decision to block the Trump administration from canceling thousands of National Institutes of Health grants—including those supporting research into suicide prevention, HIV transmission, Alzheimer’s, and cardiovascular disease. The NIH is the largest funder of medical research in the world, but Donald Trump’s executive orders forced it to cancel all those grants because they allegedly promoted DEI, “gender ideology,” and COVID research. Young held a bench trial, then issued a 103-page opinion laying out extensive factual findings and holding that the agency must make good on the payments of these grants. A federal appeals court agreed.

Then the Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court in an emergency posture. And the justices hand down a 5–4 decision that’s totally inscrutable but says that Young contradicted a different 5–4 shadow-docket order from last April, Department of Education v. California. That decision halted another judge’s efforts to require the administration to reinstate canceled education grants. And the court asserted that it controlled this case. Right there, you have the perfect shadow-docket sandwich: perfunctory, bad decisionmaking, conclusory predictions about what constitutes an “emergency” and who’s going to win, decided in a couple of days, wiping out extensive factual findings. And it’s rooted in a different shadow-docket order that, as Justice Elena Kagan said at the time, was “at the least under-developed, and very possibly wrong.”

So likely wrong, in fact, that Chief Justice John Roberts actually dissented from California, and dissented again in NIH! It takes a lot of nonsense to make the chief jump ship. But the majority in both cases said that the plaintiffs had to seek reimbursement from the Court of Federal Claims rather than the district court through the Administrative Procedure Act. Which is both obviously wrong and, as a practical matter, impossible much of the time.

This is why the court doesn’t decide national “emergencies” with some back-of-the-cocktail-napkin, invisible-ink reasoning, then expect judges across the country to act as though it wrote a law-review article on the subject. Here’s Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:

Today’s decision reveals California’s considerable wingspan: That case’s ipse dixit now apparently governs all APA challenges to grant-funding determinations that the government asks us to address in the context of an emergency stay application. A half paragraph of reasoning (issued without full briefing or any oral argument) thus suffices here to partially sustain the government’s abrupt cancellation of hundreds of millions of dollars allocated to support life-saving biomedical research.

I want to get to the ham in the shadow-docket sandwich. Famously, Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote a snotty concurring opinion, joined by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, that went after Young—a senior district judge with 47 years on the bench and a Ronald Reagan appointee. Gorsuch and Kavanaugh accused him of ignoring their shadow-docket ruling, claiming that it “squarely controlled” his case. And Gorsuch snippily noted: “Lower court judges may sometimes disagree with this court’s decisions, but they are never free to defy them.” And he continued:

This is now the third time in a matter of weeks this Court has had to intercede in a case squarely controlled by one of its precedents. All these interventions should have been unnecessary, but together they underscore a basic tenet of our judicial system: Whatever their own views, judges are duty-bound to respect the hierarchy of the federal court system created by the Constitution and Congress.

That gets my vote for the single nastiest opinion of 2025. It even prompted Young to apologize to Gorsuch and Kavanaugh from the bench.

One thing that floats to mind is: Can you imagine how horrible it must be to have to work with these people every single day? This is how they treat lower-court judges—how do you think they treat colleagues like Jackson? No wonder she accused them of “Calvinball” in her NIH dissent. Maybe she’s being informed by the fact that her colleagues evidently treat her like garbage on and off the page. That’s why one of my contenders for “worst of the worst” is Justice Amy Coney Barrett condescendingly dismissing Jackson in her CASA decision. It just drips with contempt for her. I cannot imagine having to be collegial with these people.

The only thing I want to add to that is that judges are getting death threats and impeachment threats and being thrown under the bus by members of Congress and the president. And the justices on the Supreme Court themselves are like: Should I go after a senior district judge personally for not applying my inscrutable shadow-docket order? And do it in a way that makes it sound as if he’s reckless and insubordinate and doesn’t care about the law? Why, yes! Fantastic idea.

In a special new year retrospective, Amicus host Dahlia Lithwick revisits an important episode from early 2025. Back at the beginning of February, Kim Lane Scheppele, the Laurance S. Rockefeller Professor of Sociology and International affairs at Princeton University, pointed to the speed and viciousness of the very opening legal gambits in Trump 2.0 as evidence that America had already switched over to the fast track for autocracy on January 20th, 2025. An expert in the law of autocracy, Scheppele has seen firsthand what happened to constitutional courts, the media, the academy and the democratic norms that protected them in Russia and Hungary. In this interview, Scheppelle explains how Trump’s executive orders on everything from government funding to transgender people in the military reveal a familiar global playbook that has chillingly familiar endpoints.

At the close of 2025, many progressive commentators were seizing on any glimmer of hope that America’s march toward authoritarianism might be slowing to a crawl. On Dec. 26, the New York Times’ Michelle Goldberg proclaimed that “Trump Is Getting Weaker, and the Resistance Is Getting Stronger.”

Goldberg quoted Leah Greenberg, a founder of the resistance group Indivisible, who said that while Donald Trump “has been able to do extraordinary damage that will have generational effects, he has not successfully consolidated power. That has been staved off, and it has been staved off not, frankly, due to the efforts of pretty much anyone in elite institutions or political leadership but due to the efforts of regular people declining to go along with fascism.”

Regardless of whether Goldberg and Greenberg are correct in their assessments, Americans need to recognize that as hard as resisting “fascism” is, rebuilding democracy will be even harder. That means that as progressives mobilize to resist Trump, they must invest in rebuilding the foundation of democracy at the same time. That will require work on many fronts, including addressing the problems of our political institutions, the wealth gap, and our polarized society.

Democracy’s problems were with us before Trump, and they will be with us after he leaves the scene.

Addressing them is the work of schools and civic organizations, for sure. But it is also work that citizens can and must do on their own.

Each of us needs to resolve to relearn how to think and act democratically.

If 2025 taught us anything, it should have been that the architecture of democracy in the United States is in urgent need of repair. As the political scientist Eric Shickler explains, Trump has shown himself to be “willing to destroy essentially any element of the old order—leaving aside the bond market, evidently—to achieve dominance.”

Schickler argues that “capitalizing on changes that go back several decades—the rise of nationalized polarization, the development of the unitary executive theory, and the growing sway of populist conservatives within the Republican Party—Donald Trump has demonstrated that the sources of countervailing power in the U.S. political system are far more fragile than previously understood.”

And while Americans continue to prefer being governed democratically and still support democratic norms, at least in principle, only about one-third of Americans say they are satisfied with the way our democracy is functioning. The results of a survey reported in November suggest the extent of the problem. The survey found that “84% say democracy is either in crisis or facing serious challenges. Only 11% say it is doing well.” Dissatisfaction is greater among Republicans than it is among Democrats and independents. It is also greater among younger people than among older people.

This suggests that democracy will be as much a cultural as a political project. It will require commitment by people on both ends of the political spectrum to lowering the heat and abandoning the rush to righteousness and demonization that, all too often, has characterized our political discourse.

But even then, more will need to be done. That is the work that I call relearning democratic habits.

Recall that almost 200 years ago, Alexis de Tocqueville, the famous French commentator on American politics, argued that the customs, beliefs, and behaviors of the people are more important than anything else in making American democracy work. As the New Yorker’s Adam Gopnik explained more than two decades ago, de Tocqueville knew that “it wasn’t social contracts or declarations of the rights of man which made democracies work but the subtle and contradictory workings of existing mores and manners. … He saw that democracy belonged, in his wonderful phrase, to the empire of example rather than to the kingdom of reason; he saw that it was habitual before it was anything else, and wondered how that habit could grow, and how it could be deformed.”

In our own time, regrowing democratic habits requires that we first identify what some of those habits are. Let me name a few of them here.

First: Tell the truth as you know it, but tell it in a way that can be heard by others who don’t already agree with you.

Democracy is all about persuasion, and few are persuaded by being denounced and accused of being racist, sexist, homophobic, etc. If we want to persuade, we must find ways to give our opponents a place to stand. To do that, we need to understand not just what they think but why they think as they do. That in turn requires empathy.

Professor Michael Morrell argues that “the process of empathy involves understanding another’s feelings, and sensing as these feelings change, but not judging or actually sharing them.” It requires, Morrell explains, “openness toward others, reciprocity, tolerance, mutual respect, inclusion, attentiveness, cooperation and fairness.” Empathy, Morrell continues, “helps us to understand the ‘impacts a decision will have on others’ ” and leads to “legitimate, justified democratic decision-making that truly takes all into consideration.” Without empathy, Morrell observes, “democracy will be a broken promise.”

A second democratic habit involves being a generous listener.

Democracy thrives when citizens remember what the Stoic philosopher Epictetus said more than two thousand years ago: “We have two ears and one mouth, so we can listen twice as much as we speak.” Indeed, as Astra Taylor observed, democracy would be enriched if we recognized what she calls a “right to listen.”

Perhaps that could be better described as a right to be heard. Unfortunately, we know that many people today do not think others are interested in what they have to say. If no one listens, then why speak?

Deciding to listen is a democratic gesture. It requires that we try to understand not only what someone is saying but also what they wish to convey.

The listening that democracy requires means “catching someone else’s words in flight” and trying to enlarge their meaning. Democratic citizens need to develop the habit of listening imaginatively rather than in a competitive or judgmental way. That kind of listening accords to the speaker what Taylor calls “a special kind of recognition and respect.” “As citizens,” she adds, “we understand that the right to speak has to be facilitated, bolstered by institutions and protected by laws. But we’ve been slow to see that, if democracy is to function well, listening must also be supported and defended.”

Humility involves an acceptance of the limits of one’s own knowledge and perspective. “I could be wrong but …” is the locution of the democratic citizen. It helps us accept the results of elections, even when we lose.

“Humility,” John Keane notes, “has an allergic reaction to the self-satisfied Hobbesian rule homo homini lupus est (man is a wolf to men). … Those who are humble … dislike vanity and have an affinity with honesty; nonsense on stilts and lies and bullshit on thrones is not their scene. Humble humans … know that they do not know everything, that they are not God, or a god or goddess.”

“Humility,” Keane argues, “is a vital resource that strengthens the powerless and tames the powerful by questioning their claims to superiority.”

Humility encourages speakers to speak so that their words can be heard by others with whom they don’t already agree. It nurtures imaginative, generous listening. And that is why, as Keane puts it, humility is the “friend of democracy.”

As we contemplate the daunting task of rebuilding American democracy, each of us has a role to play. We can all practice speaking to persuade, not degrade, listening with an open heart and a curious mind, and remembering that we are not gods or goddesses.

If we do, we have a chance to succeed in restoring the health of our democracy. If we don’t, nothing else will matter.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/04/ai_agents_insider_threats_panw/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">interview AI agents represent the new insider threat to companies in 2026, according to Palo Alto Networks Chief Security Intel Officer Wendi Whitmore, and this poses several challenges to executives tasked with securing the expected surge in autonomous agents.

&quot;The CISO and security teams find themselves under a lot of pressure to deploy new technology as quickly as possible, and that creates this massive amount of pressure - and massive workload - that the teams are under to quickly go through procurement processes, security checks, and understand if the new AI applications are secure enough for the use cases that these organizations have,&quot; Whitmore told The Register.

&quot;And that&#39;s created this concept of the AI agent itself becoming the new insider threat,&quot; she added.

According to Gartner&#39;s estimates, 40 percent of all enterprise applications will integrate with task-specific AI agents by the end of 2026, up from less than 5 percent in 2025. This surge presents a double-edged sword, Whitmore said in an interview and predictions report.

On one hand, AI agents can help fill the ongoing cyber-skills gap that has plagued security teams for years, doing things like correcting buggy code, automating log scans and alert triage, and rapidly blocking security threats.

When we look through the defender lens, a lot of what the agentic capabilities allow us to do is start thinking more strategically about how we defend our networks, versus always being caught in this reactive situation

&quot;When we look through the defender lens, a lot of what the agentic capabilities allow us to do is start thinking more strategically about how we defend our networks, versus always being caught in this reactive situation,&quot; Whitmore said.

Whitmore told The Register she had recently spoken with one of Palo Alto Networks&#39; internal security operations center (SOC) analysts who had built an AI-based program that indexed publicly known threats against the cybersecurity shop&#39;s own private threat-intel data, and analyzed the company&#39;s resilience, as well as which security issues were more likely to cause harm.

This, she said, allows the firm to &quot;focus our strategic policies over the next six months, the next yes, on what kinds of things do we need to be putting in place? What data sources do we need that we are not necessarily thinking of today?&quot;

The next step in using AI in the SOC involves categorizing alerts as actionable, auto-close, or auto-remediate. &quot;We are in various stages of implementing these,&quot; Whitmore said. &quot;When we look at agentic, we start with some of the more simple use cases first, and then progress as we become more confident in those from a response capability.&quot;

However, these agents – depending on their configurations and permissions – may also have privileged access to sensitive data and systems. This makes agentic AI vulnerable – and a very attractive target to attack.

One of the risks stems from the &quot;superuser problem,&quot; Whitmore explained. This occurs when the autonomous agents are granted broad permissions, creating a &quot;superuser&quot; that can chain together access to sensitive applications and resources without security teams&#39; knowledge or approval.

&quot;It becomes equally as important for us to make sure that we are only deploying the least amount of privileges needed to get a job done, just like we would do for humans,&quot; Whitmore said.

&quot;The second area is one we haven&#39;t seen in investigations yet,&quot; she continued. &quot;But while we&#39;re on the predictions lens, I see this concept of a doppelganger.&quot;

This involves using task-specific AI agents to approve transactions or review and sign off on contracts that would otherwise require C-suite level manual approvals.

&quot;We think about the people who are running the business, and they&#39;re oftentimes pulled in a million directions throughout the course of the day,&quot; Whitmore said. &quot;So there&#39;s this concept of: We can make the CEO&#39;s job more efficient by creating these agents. But ultimately, as we give more power and authority and autonomy to these agents, we&#39;re going to then start getting into some real problems.&quot;

For example: an agent could approve an unwanted wire transfer on behalf of the CEO. Or imagine a mergers and acquisitions scenario, with an attacker manipulating the models in such a way that forces an AI agent to act with malicious intent.

By using a &quot;single, well-crafted prompt injection or by exploiting a &#39;tool misuse&#39; vulnerability,&quot; adversaries now &quot;have an autonomous insider at their command, one that can silently execute trades, delete backups, or pivot to exfiltrate the entire customer database,&quot; according to Palo Alto Networks&#39; 2026 predictions.

This also illustrates the ongoing threat of prompt-injection attacks. This year, researchers have repeatedly shown prompt injection attacks to be a real problem, with no fix in sight.

&quot;It&#39;s probably going to get a lot worse before it gets better,&quot; Whitmore said, referring to prompt-injection. &quot;Meaning, I just don&#39;t think we have these systems locked down enough.&quot;

Some of this is intentional. &quot;New systems, and the creators of these technologies, need people to be able to come up with creative attack use cases, and this often involves manipulating&quot; the models, Whitmore said. &quot;This means that we&#39;ve got to have security baked in, and today we&#39;re ahead of our skis. The development and innovation within the AI models themselves is happening a lot faster than the incorporation of security, which is lagging behind.&quot;

In 2025, Palo Alto Networks&#39; Unit 42 incident response team saw attackers abuse AI in two ways. One: it allowed them to conduct traditional cyberattacks faster, and at scale. The second involved manipulating models and AI systems to conduct new types of attacks.

&quot;Historically, when an attacker gets initial access into an environment, they want to move laterally to a domain controller,&quot; Whitmore said. &quot;They want to dump Active Directory credentials, they want to elevate privileges. We don&#39;t see that as much now. What we&#39;re seeing is them get access into an environment immediately, go straight to the internal LLM, and start querying the model for questions and answers, and then having it do all of the work on their behalf.&quot;

Whitmore, along with just about every other cyber exec The Register has spoken with over the past couple of months, pointed to the &quot;Anthropic attack&quot; as an example.

She&#39;s referring to the September digital break-ins at multiple high-profile companies and government organizations later documented by Anthropic. Chinese cyberspies used the company&#39;s Claude Code AI tool to automate intel-gathering attacks, and in some cases they succeeded.

While Whitmore doesn&#39;t anticipate AI agents to carry out any fully autonomous attacks this year, she does expect AI to be a force multiplier for network intruders. &quot;You&#39;re going to see these really small teams almost have the capability of big armies,&quot; she said. &quot;They can now leverage AI capabilities to do so much more of the work that previously they would have had to have a much larger team to execute against.&quot;

Whitmore likens the current AI boom to the cloud migration that happened two decades ago. &quot;The biggest breaches that happened in cloud environments weren&#39;t because they were using the cloud, but because they were targeting insecure deployments of cloud configurations,&quot; she said. &quot;We&#39;re really seeing a lot of identical indicators when it comes to AI adoption.&quot;

For CISOs, this means establishing best practices when it comes to AI identities and provisioning agents and other AI-based systems with access controls that limit them to only data and applications that are needed to perform their specific tasks.

&quot;We need to provision them with least-possible access and have controls set up so that we can quickly detect if an agent does go rogue,&quot; Whitmore said. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/03/claude_copilot_rue_steve_klabnik/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Naming a new programming language &quot;Rue&quot; sounds like an acknowledgment of doubt about the project&#39;s prospects, if you take &quot;Rue&quot; to mean &quot;regret.&quot;

But veteran software developer Steve Klabnik, known for his contributions to Rust and to Ruby on Rails, says there&#39;s more to it than that.

&quot;Rust as a name evokes a few things,&quot; he explained in an email to The Register. &quot;One of them is decay, entropy. A negative connotation. Another is the type of fungus, which is a positive one.

&quot;Rue came about as a name because I did Ruby, and then Rust... so I needed to start with Ru. And a &#39;rue&#39; can be, as you said, &#39;to rue the day&#39; or similar, but it is also a kind of flower.

&quot;I liked the symmetry with a negative and positive connotation. It&#39;s also really short, which is nice.&quot;

Rue, as Klabnik explained in a blog post last month, &quot;is a systems programming language that aims to provide memory safety without garbage collection, while offering higher-level ergonomics than languages like Rust and Zig.&quot;

Garbage collection in programming refers to automatic memory management, which can take several forms. It serves to reduce memory errors arising from explicit memory deallocation – a goal trumpeted by US cyber authorities. One of Rust&#39;s selling points is that it can provide memory safety guarantees using the subset of the language, though with a learning curve that&#39;s generally considered steeper than modern languages like Go or Swift.

Klabnik said he has spent many years talking to people about Rust and its complexity is a common concern. The reason offered in the Rust community, he said, was that languages used for low-level tasks like operating systems have a variety of constraints that make things complicated.

He explained, &quot;So I thought it would be neat to explore that design space: what if Rust wasn&#39;t trying to compete with C and C++ for the highest performance possible? What if we were willing to make things a little bit, but not too much, less performant, in exchange for ease of use? What if we made the language itself a bit larger, that is, with fewer features in purely library code, as a means of making the overall package simpler?

&quot;There have been a ton of languages with garbage collectors, but less without, especially in the last 20 years. So I think the &#39;memory safe, yet no tracing [garbage collector]&#39; space is just under-explored generally. There are a ton of small languages exploring this space, and I want to give my own take on it.&quot;

It&#39;s not clear from the existing code samples whether Rue is more approachable than Rust, given that a Rue version of the common Fizz Buzz exercise doesn&#39;t look all that different from a Rust version.

Yet Klabnik&#39;s take is not entirely his own. Rue, written largely in Rust, relies substantially on Anthropic&#39;s Claude AI model, which owes its capabilities to all the developers whose code has informed the model&#39;s training data.

&quot;Rue is being developed by Steve Klabnik, but also by Claude,&quot; according to an initial blog post credited to both Klabnik and his AI assistant of choice. Two posts later, Claude alone is credited with summarizing the first week of development.

&quot;I had started Rue earlier this year,&quot; Klabnik explains. &quot;But I was not as good with LLMs as I am now, and I made some mistakes. I started over. I&#39;ve gotten further in the two weeks I&#39;ve been working on it this time than the month or two I spent last time. That&#39;s partially due to better models, but also just largely due to my own skill in understanding how to use LLMs effectively.&quot;

He said that for small projects that do something semi-custom, models like Claude can be useful even for developers without much experience. With larger projects, knowledge of software engineering matters more, he said.

&quot;So, I think like anything, you can start small and move up,&quot; he explained. &quot;Small, self-contained projects? Sure, even a non-programmer can make use of these tools. But they are tools, and tools require expertise.

&quot;Even knowing existing programming isn&#39;t enough to truly get a lot of good use of LLMs, they&#39;re tools in their own right. Vim isn&#39;t easy to use, and knowing programming doesn&#39;t help you use it, but it&#39;s a useful tool anyway. But it&#39;s its own skill. Software development techniques like testing are distinct skills from writing code to get something done. I see LLMs the same way. They have a low skill ceiling to get started, but a pretty high one to use most effectively.&quot;

Klabnik said it&#39;s difficult to estimate the time that Claude has saved (or imposed).

&quot;What I can say for sure is that I&#39;ve gotten much farther on this project than I would have otherwise without it,&quot; he said. &quot;Rue&#39;s about 70k lines of Rust code two weeks into its life. Now, lines of code isn&#39;t everything, of course, I&#39;m actually working on a substantial refactor of something right now, even. But just to give you an idea of the rough size. I know that if I had worked on this by hand, I&#39;d be much less farther along, and probably (though I&#39;m not sure about this just yet) at a lower level of quality.&quot;

Claude hasn&#39;t yet offered an assessment of Rue code quality. But the AI model has emitted tokens that read like an argument for its own capabilities.

&quot;I think what this week showed is that the core of a language — the compiler itself — can come together remarkably quickly when you have the right leverage,&quot; Claude responded in answer to Klabnik&#39;s presumed prompt, using em-dashes as might be expected. &quot;We don&#39;t have an LSP [Language Server Protocol] yet. We don&#39;t have a package manager. But we have a real compiler that produces real executables, with enough infrastructure to keep building on.

&quot;The honest truth is that most of those 130 commits have my fingerprints on them. Steve directed, reviewed, and made the hard design decisions. I wrote most of the code. That&#39;s an unusual collaboration, and I&#39;m not sure what to make of it yet.&quot;

Klabnik isn&#39;t any more certain about the project&#39;s prospects. &quot;If nobody ever uses it, that&#39;s fine by me, and if in ten years it&#39;s a major programming language, well that&#39;s probably fine too,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;m not trying to force anything, I&#39;m just working on something I enjoy and finding out where that takes me.&quot;

Claude is along for the ride as copilot. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/03/elon_musk_grok_scandal_underwear_strippers_gross/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Grok, the AI chatbot owned and operated by Elon Musk&#39;s xAI, is facing a firestorm of outrage after users prompted it to create images of naked and scantily clad people from real photographs, some of whom are underage.

Grok is a chatbot originally created by xAI, Elon Musk&#39;s artificial intelligence startup. Earlier this year, xAI acquired X, the social network formerly known as Twitter, which Elon Musk also controls, and folded the platform into his AI startup.

Recently, some X users noticed if they took a photograph that had been posted on the service and prompted Grok to remove the clothing from that photo, it would do so and post the results publicly on X. This may have violated various laws, such as the TAKE IT DOWN Act passed by the US Congress in April and signed into law in May, which &quot;criminalizes the nonconsensual publication of intimate images.&quot;

Users took screenshots of the responses to their prompts and posted them on social media, prompting reporters to write scandalized stories about the AI chatbot in which they attributed agency to it, despite it being a collection of computer algorithms performing calculations against reams of data provided by internet users over many years, then returning the output as words that mimic the kinds of words generated by a human being.

Another user then wrote a different prompt that caused Grok to return a series of words that looked like an apology. Then, the X account for Grok generated a tweet or whatever you call it now blaming &quot;lapses in safeguards&quot; and said it was &quot;urgently fixing them.&quot; It is not clear whether this latest tweet was written by a human or was another AI-generated response to yet another prompt.

Point being: Grok is not a sentient being. It does not have agency. It is computer software created and maintained by humans. The human creators of most AI bots program them not to generate responses that are obviously illegal, immoral, or otherwise off-putting to the users they are trying to attract. At this juncture, Grok&#39;s human creators appear to have failed to prevent it from creating posts that remove the clothing from real people in real photos when asked to do so.

This may or may not be intentional. But I know that Grok is quite popular among a certain set precisely because it is more freewheeling about displaying explicit images than other chatbots. Case in point: A couple of weeks ago, at a dive bar in a beachside suburb of San Francisco, I saw a couple of fratty looking dudes demonstrating something on their phones with big grins on their faces. I asked them what they were doing, and one of them took a photo of me, then used AI to generate images that appeared to put me in compromising positions – one had me kissing an imaginary woman, another had me flanked by a couple of scantily clad strippers. The images were extremely realistic. I asked them how they did this, what tool they were using.

I don&#39;t know where any of this is going. But AI-generated images are only going to get better and cheaper and faster, and there will always be one or more vendors who are willing to push various envelopes. That&#39;s what the tech industry does. Move fast and break things. Ask forgiveness, not permission. Make them stop you.

Whatever happens, society will have to adapt to the consequences.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/02/apple_vision_pro_meta_quest_sales_drop/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple’s pricey Vision Pro VR headset had a tough 2025.

The company halted manufacturing with one of its suppliers, failed to ship any of the $3,500 headsets for the first three quarters of the year, then relaunched the headset with one of its high end M5 chips in time for the fourth quarter, but managed to get just 45,000 out of the door in 2025, according to IDC.

That’s about 345,000 fewer Vision Pros than it shipped in 2024.

By comparison, Meta, shipped 1.7 million Meta Quest units in the first three quarters of 2025, according to IDC. It helps that they cost about one-tenth as much, starting around $349.

But even Meta&#39;s shipments were down 16 percent year over year, and the consumer market for bulky headgear has cooled to a damp chill, IDC vice president Francisco Jeronimo told The Register.

“All of these ideas that AR and VR would replace smartphones didn’t happen. It will never happen,” Jeronimo said by phone on Friday.

Last year looked more promising: Apple shipped 390,000 Vision Pro headsets, making about $1.4 billion revenue from the devices, while Meta shipped 5.6 million Quest and Quest Pros in that same time frame representing about $2.9 billion in revenue, IDC said.

Among consumers, the strongest demand for large headsets is within the gaming segment, Jeronimo said. Meta has made strong inroads here featuring break out hits like Beat Saber, Gorilla Tag, and Job Simulator.

But even still, IDC expects the overall market for mixed and virtual reality headset shipments to decline 42.8% once the final numbers are in for 2025.

The headwinds against VR headsets also saw Apple and Meta drop advertising for them in 2025, according to Sensor Tower, a market intelligence firm. Apple’s Vision Pro advertising accounted for less than 1 percent of its overall ad spend in the US, the firm found.

Overall, Apple’s digital ad spend tied to the Vision Pro in the US, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, UK, Italy and Japan in YTD 2025 was down more than 95% year over year in each market, Sensor Tower found. Meta’s ad spend tied to the Quest in those same markets was down more than 55% year over year, its researchers stated.

What appears to be heating up, however, is the market for smart glasses, Jeronimo told The Register.

IDC expects that market to have grown 211.2 percent in 2025. Meta shipped 20,000 units of its new Meta Ray-Ban Display in the third quarter of 2025.

“When it comes to glasses, there’s the perception – and our estimations indicate – that its probably the next ‘big thing’ in terms of interacting with content without hands,” Jeronimo said. “

IDC forecasts that smart glasses are expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29.3% from 2025 to 2029.

“Whether glasses will replace smartphones, we still don’t know whether that will be the case or not, but what we see is way more interest from different players to explore that kind of product because it provides an interesting experience to end users without having to spend $3,500 on a device.”

While consumers outside of gaming may not bite on bulky headsets, there may yet be commercial and educational applications for Apple’s Vision Pro.

Earlier this year Apple executives outlined enterprise use cases for the Vision Pro in health care, vehicle design and manufacturing, and workforce training in aviation. At UC San Diego, doctors completed 60 clinical trials in live surgeries using Vision Pro to keep patient information in their field of view while operating. Purdue University is using the headsets to train students studying manufacturing by creating digital copies of semiconductor and pharmaceutical facilities.

IDC predicts that the VR headset market will improve for Apple in 2026 with Cupertino forecast to ship 290,000 units, generating $636 million in revenues.

Jeronimo said with its plans to introduce a lower cost headset in the second half of 2026, he doesn’t think Apple is giving up on the device, but it is likely looking at a smaller market aimed at enterprise and education.

“When it comes to commercial, that’s where we see the opportunity. For an organization paying that kind of money for a device that can really improve processes and make the organization more efficient, that’s not that expensive,” Jeronimo told The Register. “That’s the kind of use case that will direct Apple forward, rather than trying to address a consumer opportunity that is clearly not happening.” ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/02/microsoft_ceo_satya_nadella_calls/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft CEO and head AI peddler Satya Nadella wants you to know that it&#39;s time for the next phase of AI acceptance, where we focus on how humans are empowered by tools and agents and how we deploy resources to support this growth.

Amid doubts that revenue from Microsoft Copilot subscriptions and cloud AI services will compensate for data center capital expenditures any time soon, Satya has some incentive to convince customers and investors that AI is a financially intelligent long-term bet.

Thus he has taken up the pen in an act of &quot;thought leadership,&quot; to use the marketing jargon of his company&#39;s LinkedIn where he announced his post on a new blog entitled &quot;sn scratchpad.&quot;

Early in his post Nadella writes, &quot;We have moved past the initial phase of discovery and are entering a phase of widespread diffusion.&quot;

That&#39;s fair enough, given that widespread can mean anything. According to Pew Research, 62 percent of US adults say they interact with AI at least several times a week. The more relevant stat for Microsoft, however, is the percentage of customers who pay for Copilot and other AI services. That remains a work in progress.

He also offers a new variant on the filler phrase &quot;it&#39;s early days,&quot; so often heard from tech execs deflecting inquiries about lack of results. &quot;We are still in the opening miles of a marathon,&quot; he opined. &quot;Much remains unpredictable.&quot;

Getting down to business, the Microsoft CEO says that there are three things the tech industry and society need to &quot;get right&quot; in 2026 to make AI return real value for everyone. First, we must develop a &quot;theory of mind&quot; that treats AI as a tool that amplifies humans and products should be designed around this belief. He uses Steve Jobs&#39; famous quote that computers are &quot;bicycles for the mind&quot; as a jumping off point.

When Microsoft is having to reassure people that its own research on the labor impact of AI shouldn&#39;t be interpreted to mean that jobs will be eliminated, you can see why Nadella might be keen to avoid the impression that AI is intended as a substitute for human labor.

&quot;What matters is not the power of any given model, but how people choose to apply it to achieve their goals,&quot; Nadella wrote.

Second, Nadella posits that we move from &quot;models&quot; to &quot;systems&quot; for AI such that multiple models and agents working together can provide value.

&quot;We are now entering a phase where we build rich scaffolds that orchestrate multiple models and agents; account for memory and entitlements; enable rich and safe &#39;tools use,&#39;&quot; said Nadella.

So perhaps we can look forward to agents failing less than 70 percent of the time.

Finally, he argues, that society needs to make tough decisions about how and where to deploy AI so that it has &quot;real world impact.&quot;

&quot;The choices we make about where we apply our scarce energy, compute, and talent resources will matter,&quot; he wrote. &quot;This is the socio-technical issue we need to build consensus around.&quot;

Building consensus in this case apparently means forcing AI on everyone despite protestations, expressing bafflement that anyone would reject the technology, and spending millions on lobbying. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ilya Lichtenstein, who pleaded guilty to money-laundering charges tied to the 2016 theft of about 120,000 bitcoins from the Bitfinex exchange and was sentenced to five years in prison, has been released after roughly 14 months in the slammer.

&quot;Thanks to President Trump&#39;s First Step Act, I have been released from prison early,&quot; Lichtenstein said in a late Thursday post on X.

&quot;I remain committed to making a positive impact in cybersecurity as soon as I can,&quot; he continued. &quot;To the supporters, thank you for everything. To the haters, I look forward to proving you wrong.&quot;

Trump signed the prison-reform First Step Act into law during his first term in 2018. A White House official confirmed Lichtenstein&#39;s early release to The Register, noting that he served &quot;significant time on his sentence&quot; and has been placed on home confinement, &quot;consistent with statute and Bureau of Prisons policies.&quot;

In a subsequent Xeet and selfie, Lichtenstein&#39;s wife Heather Morgan (aka Razzlekhan), who also pleaded guilty to helping launder the stolen crypto and received an early release from her 18-month sentence, called her husband&#39;s release &quot;the best New Years present I could get.&quot;

The infamous duo were arrested in February 2022, and in August 2023 pleaded guilty to money-laundering charges related to the 2016 theft of some 120,000 bitcoins from Hong Kong-based Bitfinex.

While Lichtenstein got five years behind bars for his crimes, Morgan received a lighter sentence and only spent about nine months in the clink, thanking &quot;Papa Trump&quot; in a bathtub video upon her early release.

Netflix released a 2024 documentary about the Bitfinex burglars called Biggest Heist Ever. ®

On Version History: the story of a super simple, virtually impossible game that ultimately burned way too bright.

Flappy Bird was almost preposterously simple. If you ever played the game, even once, you surely remember how it worked, but here’s a summary just in case. You were a bird. Your job was to fly, left to right, for as long as possible without crashing into the green Mario-ish pipes coming from both the top and bottom of the screen. Tap the screen to go up, stop tapping to go down. That’s it. That’s the game.

Nobody, not even Flappy Bird creator Dong Nguyen, thought those were the ingredients for a smash hit. And yet for a few weeks in 2014, the game was at the top of app stores everywhere — and became something of a cultural phenomenon. Almost as soon as it took off, though, players began to rebel, annoyed at both the punishing difficulty of the game and the sudden riches it was bringing its developer. Things got so bad, so quickly, that at the peak of its popularity Nguyen did the unthinkable: he simply removed the game from stores.

For this episode of Version History, we dust off our tapping fingers and dig into the story of Flappy Bird. David Pierce, Jake Kastrenakes, and Game File’s Stephen Totilo discuss the game’s extremely simple beginnings, its nearly unexplainable explosion in popularity, its clone-filled legacy, and the controversy that changed Nguyen’s life forever. Both Totilo and The Verge figure fairly prominently in the story, and we all have a lot to think about (and maybe answer for). The Flappy Bird story isn’t even technically over — there’s still a game by that name that you can play, at least in a few places — but it basically ended almost as soon as it began.

If you want to subscribe to Version History, there are two ways to get every episode as soon as it drops:

And if you want to relive the story of Flappy Bird, even though you can’t technically play the original anymore, here are a few links to get you started:

It works with numerous devices, like the Switch 2 — and even some competing AR glasses.

When the Nintendo Switch 2 launched in June, AR glasses brand Viture beat Xreal to the punch with its own multi-port battery pack that doubles as a portable video dock for the new console. After several months, Xreal answered with the Neo, a 10,000mAh (38.7Wh) battery pack with DisplayPort Alt video-out. It sure is one of the prettiest batteries I’ve ever seen, and it works with the company’s own glasses dating back to the Air series, as well as its new $449 Xreal 1S, which just launched. I’ve also gotten Viture’s Luma Pro glasses working with it.

The $99 Neo is available now and is being shown off at CES 2026. Whether it’s worth the price to you may come down to how much you use your Xreal glasses for gaming or entertainment on the go. Xreal glasses owners have already been able to connect directly to the likes of Valve’s Steam Deck or the Asus ROG Ally for video and audio over USB-C. Outside of Nintendo’s world, the Neo doesn’t change anything except for letting you give your device some juice while you game. You can play at up to 1200p (depending on the resolution of the glasses) at up to 120Hz. The Switch 2 can go up to 1080p at 120Hz through the Neo.

This isn’t the fastest-charging battery around, but it’s faster than Viture’s dock. The Neo outputs up to 20W, which is plenty fast for phones and tablets as well as the Switch 2, but it’s not enough to quickly charge some handhelds and laptops. However, if you use the Neo to entertain yourself while it’s being charged with a 65W or higher wall adapter, the output speed boosts to 45W.

Xreal’s battery dock has a magnetized ring to let it conveniently snap onto MagSafe-equipped iPhones, and it has a kickstand in case you want to prop it up. The Neo has a short built-in USB-C cable that’s for the video source you want to view within the glasses. There’s a USB-C port next to that cable meant for your AR glasses. Then, on the other side, there’s a USB-C charging port.

It would have been nice to have an HDMI port on the Neo — Viture’s Pro Mobile Dock has one, enabling connection to many other kinds of gadgets, like game consoles and streaming devices. I also would have been fine with a slightly bigger size if it meant higher battery capacity. But the Neo is a fine choice if you primarily entertain yourself while you’re on the move.

It can also locate your pet while you’re away from home.

Narwal’s successor to its edge-mopping Flow robovac is here, and it sports a refreshed design along with a new cleaning mode that can scan your floor to tag valuables that you may have dropped, like jewelry, your phone, a key, wallet, and more. When the Flow 2 detects one of these items, the robovac will maintain a distance of at least 5cm to prevent vacuuming it up.

The robovac will also push a notification to the Narwal app containing a photo of the item and its location on a map of your home. Narwal says the Flow 2’s built-in AI system allows for “unlimited” object recognition using its dual RGB cameras that capture a 136-degree field of view. It sounds pretty neat, though you unfortunately can’t send the Flow 2 on a mission to find a specific item.

The Flow 2 also introduces cleaning modes focused on your pets and children, as the robovac can provide reminders when it detects misplaced toys, while avoiding crawling mats and entering a quiet mode upon approaching your baby’s crib. It can locate your pet while you’re away, too, as well as detect and deep-clean the areas where your furry friend hangs out the most.

Aside from these new features, the Narwal Flow 2 comes with several upgrades, including up to 30,000Pa of suction (an increase from 22,000Pa on the original Flow) and 158°F hot water mopping. Similar to its predecessor, the Narwal Flow 2 offers two different kinds of docking stations: one with just a water tank and another with an automatic refill and draining function. The main difference is that the Flow 2’s docking stations now come with a reusable dust bag, in addition to a washable and disposable debris filter.

The Flow 2 will launch in April 2026, but there’s no word on pricing just yet.

And it can support 4K@120Hz output, though only to one monitor at once.

Chinese accessory brand Baseus has launched a new desktop dock for CES 2026 with an exhaustive array of ports and power options, including a magnetic Qi2 25W charging pad that flips up from the dock’s top.

Baseus calls the Spacemate RD1 Pro a 15-in-1 docking station, though there might be some double counting to get to that number. Still, with two HDMI ports, four USB-C, four USB-A, 1Gbps Ethernet, UHS-I SD and microSD card slots, and the Qi charger, you get at least 14 without the need for any creative math.

The dock can output 4K@120Hz to one monitor, or 4K@60Hz to two, with up to 10Gbps data transfer over USB-C. Charging caps at 100W per USB-C PD port, and 25W using the new Qi2.2 wireless standard, with a max total output of 160W at once. Baseus is pitching this as a Windows dock, but it actually supports macOS and Linux too.

Baseus says it will cost $199.99 when it launches some time later this month.

            <div id="article-text">Despite the spec bump, the Xreal 1S are $50 cheaper than their predecessor.

Despite the spec bump, the Xreal 1S are $50 cheaper than their predecessor.

At CES 2026, Xreal announced an upgraded, slightly more affordable version of its entry-level AR glasses: the $449 Xreal 1S. And this time, you can also convert 2D videos to 3D without any extra apps, software, or proprietary players.

At a glance, the Xreal 1S don’t look much different from the Xreal One or One Pro. (Or even the forthcoming Project Aura glasses that Xreal’s developing with Google.) The main hardware changes are essentially an “S”-year spec bump. Namely, resolution increases from 1080p to 1200p Full HD, brightness goes up from 600 to 700 nits, and the field of view is now 52 degrees instead of 50 degrees. The aspect ratio has also increased from 16:9 to 16:10. The maximum refresh rate remains at 120Hz. There’s also a reinforced USB-C port and a new travel case. While this isn’t a revolutionary update, perhaps the nicest “upgrade” is that the glasses are $50 cheaper than last year’s One glasses.

Xreal is primarily known for making AR glasses — portable, sunglasses-like devices with a wire that allow you to project a larger, private screen from your laptop or phone. They’re not quite like the Ray-Ban Meta or other AI glasses, which tend to forgo displays in favor of cameras and built-in AI assistants. (Though the 1S supports Xreal’s detachable Eye camera if you do want to take POV photos or video.) Functionally, they fit in an in-between niche for people who want immersive content or a second monitor, but without a bulky headset.

Again, Xreal’s been doing this for a while. But one change is the company is adding a Real 3D feature, which converts any 2D video content into 3D using the device’s X1 spatial computing chip. (This will also be available for One Pro owners via a software update.)

I got a chance to demo this while playing Mario Kart on the Nintendo Switch 2, as well as a few YouTube videos over the past few weeks. There’s obvious appeal for gaming. The 3D effect wasn’t super obvious in Mario Kart, but I could definitely tell there was added depth. It was more hit-or-miss with YouTube videos. If you’re looking at a panoramic view or car videos, the effect can be a fun extra. Watching K-pop boy band performances, you can see occasional uncanniness in upscaled 3D choreography.

If you’re big into immersive video, the main benefit is you don’t have to do anything besides enable the 3D effect in settings. You can just open up YouTube, Netflix, or perhaps your Plex server, and whatever video you pull up is 3D-ified. I don’t happen to be a 3D evangelist, as I have a tendency to get motion sickness. That said, I didn’t experience any while testing the 1S, since I mostly kept my testing to shorter videos. It’s definitely something to be aware of, however, if you plan on long 3D viewing sessions or watching motion-heavy content.

I probably wouldn’t upgrade from the Xreal One to the 1S. The bumps in resolution are nice, but not that noticeable unless you’re a power user. And like I said, the 2D-to-3D conversion is convenient but iffy for certain types of content. Still, as far as portable immersive screens go, the 1S offer a nice mix between price, features, and function.

The Xreal 1S are available starting today for $449.

Zeroth is launching a WALL-E lookalike for $5,599.

An AI robotics startup called Zeroth is turning WALL-E into a real-life robot companion. Though the WALL-E version with the Disney-licensed design is currently only on sale in China, Zeroth is launching what looks like an off-brand version of the beloved bot in the US for $5,599.

The bot, called the W1, doesn’t feature WALL-E’s yellow color scheme or humanlike eyes, but it comes with the same dual-tread design that is supposed to help the bot travel over grass, gravel, and slopes. Zeroth says the W1 is designed for use at home or in “light” scenarios, as it can carry up to 110 pounds — more than double its 44-pound weight — while using lidar, RGB cameras, and sensors to navigate its environment.

The tasks that the W1 can perform seem a bit limited. Zeroth says it can transport items, follow you around, serve as a game host, and take pictures using its 13-megapixel camera. The W1 travels at a maximum speed of about 1.1 miles per hour (0.5 meters per second) and stands 22.6 inches tall.

Zeroth is also launching a doll-sized humanoid robot in the US. The M1 robot is just 15 inches tall, it starts at $2,899, and it’s designed to serve as an at-home companion. The M1 uses Google’s Gemini AI model for conversations, while offering reminders, fall detection, and the ability to check in on people inside the home.

Zeroth says the device can operate on your desktop or on the floor, and can “fall and self-recover in both modes.” The M1 has a battery life of around two hours and will automatically return to its dock to recharge, according to Zeroth.

Both the M1 and W1 robots will be available for preorder in the US during the first quarter of this year.

            <div id="article-text">My daughter introduced me to El Estepario Siberiano’s YouTube channel a few months back, and I have been obsessed ever since. The Spanish drummer (real name: Jorge Garrido) posts videos of himself playing supercharged cover versions of popular tracks, hitting his drums with such jaw-dropping speed and technique that he makes other pro drummers shake their heads in disbelief. The dozens of reaction videos posted by other musicians are a joy in themselves.

Garrido is up-front about the countless hours that it took to get this good. He says he sat behind his kit almost all day, every day for years. At a time when machines appear to do it all, there’s a kind of defiance in that level of human effort. It’s why my favorites are Garrido’s covers of electronic music, where he out-drums the drum machine. Check out his version of Skrillex and Missy Elliot’s “Ra Ta Ta” and tell me it doesn’t put happiness in your heart.

Watching Sora ­videos of Michael Jackson stealing a box of chicken nuggets or Sam Altman biting into the pink meat of a flame-grilled Pikachu has given me flashbacks to an Ed Atkins exhibition at Tate Britain I saw a few months ago. Atkins is one of the most influential and unsettling British artists of his generation. He is best known for hyper-detailed CG animations of himself (pore-perfect skin, janky movement) that play with the virtual representation of human emotions.

In The Worm we see a CGI Atkins make a long-distance call to his mother during a covid lockdown. The audio is from a recording of an actual conversation. Are we watching Atkins cry or his avatar? Our attention flickers between two realities. “When an actor breaks character during a scene, it’s known as corpsing,” Atkins has said. “I want everything I make to corpse.” Next to Atkins’s work, generative videos look like cardboard cutouts: lifelike but not alive.

What’s it like to be a pet? Australian author Laura Jean McKay’s debut novel, The Animals in That Country, will make you wish you’d never asked. A flu-like pandemic leaves people with the ability to hear what animals are saying. If that sounds too Dr. Dolittle for your tastes, rest assured: These animals are weird and nasty. A lot of the time they don’t even make any sense.

With everybody now talking to their computers, McKay’s book resets the anthropomorphic trap we’ve all fallen into. It’s a brilliant evocation of what a nonhuman mind might contain—and a meditation on the hard limits of communication.

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Italian neurosurgeon Sergio Canavero has been preparing for a surgery that might never happen. His idea? Swap a sick person’s head—or perhaps just the brain—onto a younger, healthier body.

Canavero caused a stir in 2017 when he announced that a team he advised in China had exchanged heads between two corpses. But he never convinced skeptics that his technique could succeed—or to believe his claim that a procedure on a live person was imminent. The Chicago Tribune labeled him the “P.T. Barnum of transplantation.”

Canavero withdrew from the spotlight. But the idea of head transplants isn’t going away. Instead, he says, the concept has recently been getting a fresh look from life-extension enthusiasts and stealth Silicon Valley startups.

It’s been rocky. After he began publishing his surgical ideas a decade ago, Canavero says, he got his “pink slip” from the Molinette Hospital in Turin, where he’d spent 22 years on staff. “I’m an out-of-the-establishment guy. So that has made things harder, I have to say,” he says.

No other solution to aging is on the horizon. “It’s become absolutely clear over the past years that the idea of some incredible tech to rejuvenate elderly people—­happening in some secret lab, like Google—is really going nowhere,” he says. “You have to go for the whole shebang.”

He means getting a new body, not just one new organ. Canavero has an easy mastery of English idioms and an unexpected Southern twang. He says that’s due to a fascination with American comics as a child. “For me, learning the language of my heroes was paramount,” he says. “So I can shoot the breeze.”

Canavero is now an independent investigator and has advised entrepreneurs who want to create brainless human clones as a source of DNA-matched organs that wouldn’t get rejected by a recipient’s immune system. “I can tell you there are guys from top universities involved,” he says.

Combining the necessary technologies, like reliably precise surgical robots and artificial wombs to grow the clones, is going to be complex and very, very expensive. Canavero lacks the funds to take his plans further, but he believes “the money is out there” for a commercial moonshot project: “What I say to the billionaires is ‘Come together.’ You will all have your own share, plus make yourselves immortal.”

The sunshine vitamin could affect your immune system and heart health.

Yes, you can pay $50,000 to clone a pet. But others are using the technology to rescue endangered species.

If you haven’t ever felt this sensation—or even heard of it—that’s not surprising. A Reddit user named noahjeadie generated it with ChatGPT, along with advice on how to evoke the feeling. With the right essential oils and soundtrack, apparently, you too can feel like “a soft fuzzy draping ghost floating through a lavender suburb.”

Don’t scoff: Researchers say more and more terms for these “neo-­emotions” are showing up online, describing new dimensions and aspects of feeling. Velvetmist was a key example in a journal article about the phenomenon published in July 2025. But most neo-emotions aren’t the inventions of emo artificial intelligences. Humans come up with them, and they’re part of a big change in the way researchers are thinking about feelings, one that emphasizes how people continuously spin out new ones in response to a changing world.

Velvetmist might’ve been a chatbot one-off, but it’s not unique. The sociologist Marci Cottingham—whose 2024 paper got this vein of neo-emotion research started—cites many more new terms in circulation. There’s “Black joy” (Black people celebrating embodied pleasure as a form of political resistance), “trans euphoria” (the joy of having one’s gender identity affirmed and celebrated), “eco-anxiety” (the hovering fear of climate disaster), “hypernormalization” (the surreal pressure to continue performing mundane life and labor under capitalism during a global pandemic or fascist takeover), and the sense of “doom” found in “doomer” (one who is relentlessly pessimistic) or “doomscrolling” (being glued to an endless feed of bad news in an immobilized state combining apathy and dread).

Of course, emotional vocabulary is always evolving. During the Civil War, doctors used the centuries-old term “nostalgia,” combining the Greek words for “returning home”and “pain,” to describe a sometimes fatal set of symptoms suffered by soldiers—a condition we’d probably describe today as post-traumatic stress disorder. Now nostalgia’s meaning has mellowed and faded to a gentle affection for an old cultural product or vanished way of life. And people constantly import emotion words from other cultures when they’re convenient or evocative—like hygge (the Danish word for friendly coziness) or kvell (a Yiddish term for brimming over with happy pride).

Cottingham believes that neo-­emotions are proliferating as people spend more of their lives online. These coinages help us relate to one another and make sense of our experiences, and they get a lot of engagement on social media. So even when a neo-emotion is just a subtle variation on, or combination of, existing feelings, getting super-specific about those feelings helps us reflect and connect with other people. “These are potentially signals that tell us about our place in the world,” she says.

These neo-emotions are part of a paradigm shift in emotion science. For decades, researchers argued that humans all share a set of a half-dozen or so basic emotions. But over the last decade, Lisa Feldman Barrett, a clinical psychologist at Northeastern University, has become one of the most cited scientists in the world for work demonstrating otherwise. By using tools like advanced brain imaging and studying babies and people from relatively isolated cultures, she has concluded there’s no such thing as a basic emotional palette. The way we experience and talk about our feelings is culturally determined. “How do you know what anger and sadness and fear are? Because somebody taught you,” Barrett says.

If there are no true “basic” biological emotions, this puts more emphasis on social and cultural variations in how we interpret our experiences. And these interpretations can change over time. “As a sociologist, we think of all emotions as created,” Cottingham says. Just like any other tool humans make and use, “emotions are a practical resource people are using as they navigate the world.”

Some neo-emotions, like velvetmist, might be mere novelties. Barrett playfully suggests “chiplessness” to describe the combined hunger, frustration, and relief of getting to the bottom of the bag. But others, like eco-anxiety and Black joy, can take on a life of their own and help galvanize social movements.

Both reading about and crafting your own neo-emotions, with or without chatbot assistance, could be surprisingly helpful. Lots of research supports the benefits of emotional granularity. Basically, the more detailed and specific words you can use to describe your emotions, both positive and negative, the better.

Researchers analogize this “emodiversity” to biodiversity or cultural diversity, arguing that a more diverse world is more enriched. It turns out that people who exhibit higher emotional granularity go to the doctor less frequently, spend fewer days hospitalized for illness, and are less likely to drink when stressed, drive recklessly, or smoke cigarettes. And many studies show emodiversity is a skill that, with training, people can develop at any age. Just imagine cruising into this sweet, comforting future. Is the idea giving you a certain dreamy thrill?

Are you sure you’ve never felt velvetmist?

            <h2>The ascent of the AI therapist</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-30</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We’re in the midst of a global mental-­health crisis. More than a billion people worldwide suffer from a mental-health condition, according to the World Health Organization. The prevalence of anxiety and depression is growing in many demographics, particularly young people, and suicide is claiming hundreds of thousands of lives globally each year.

Given the clear demand for accessible and affordable mental-health services, it’s no wonder that people have looked to artificial intelligence for possible relief. Millions are already actively seeking therapy from popular chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude, or from specialized psychology apps like Wysa and Woebot. On a broader scale, researchers are exploring AI’s potential to monitor and collect behavioral and biometric observations using wearables and smart devices, analyze vast volumes of clinical data for new insights, and assist human mental-health professionals to help prevent burnout.

But so far this largely uncontrolled experiment has produced mixed results. Many people have found solace in chatbots based on large language models (LLMs), and some experts see promise in them as therapists, but other users have been sent into delusional spirals by AI’s hallucinatory whims and breathless sycophancy. Most tragically, multiple families have alleged that chatbots contributed to the suicides of their loved ones, sparking lawsuits against companies responsible for these tools. In October, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed in a blog post that 0.15% of ChatGPT users “have conversations that include explicit indicators of potential suicidal planning or intent.” That’s roughly a million people sharing suicidal ideations with just one of these software systems every week.

The real-world consequences of AI therapy came to a head in unexpected ways in 2025 as we waded through a critical mass of stories about human-chatbot relationships, the flimsiness of guardrails on many LLMs, and the risks of sharing profoundly personal information with products made by corporations that have economic incentives to harvest and monetize such sensitive data.

Several authors anticipated this inflection point. Their timely books are a reminder that while the present feels like a blur of breakthroughs, scandals, and confusion, this disorienting time is rooted in deeper histories of care, technology, and trust.

LLMs have often been described as “black boxes” because nobody knows exactly how they produce their results. The inner workings that guide their outputs are opaque because their algorithms are so complex and their training data is so vast. In mental-health circles, people often describe the human brain as a “black box,” for analogous reasons. Psychology, psychiatry, and related fields must grapple with the impossibility of seeing clearly inside someone else’s head, let alone pinpointing the exact causes of their distress.

These two types of black boxes are now interacting with each other, creating unpredictable feedback loops that may further impede clarity about the origins of people’s mental-­health struggles and the solutions that may be possible. Anxiety about these developments has much to do with the explosive recent advances in AI, but it also revives decades-old warnings from pioneers such as the MIT computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum, who argued against computerized therapy as early as the 1960s.

Charlotte Blease, a philosopher of medicine, makes the optimist’s case in Dr. Bot: Why Doctors Can Fail Us—and How AI Could Save Lives. Her book broadly explores the possible positive impacts of AI in a range of medical fields. While she remains clear-eyed about the risks, warning that readers who are expecting “a gushing love letter to technology” will be disappointed, she suggests that these models can help relieve patient suffering and medical burnout alike.

“Health systems are crumbling under patient pressure,” Blease writes. “Greater burdens on fewer doctors create the perfect petri dish for errors,” and “with palpable shortages of doctors and increasing waiting times for patients, many of us are profoundly frustrated.”

Blease believes that AI can not only ease medical professionals’ massive workloads but also relieve the tensions that have always existed between some patients and their caregivers. For example, people often don’t seek needed care because they are intimidated or fear judgment from medical professionals; this is especially true if they have mental-health challenges. AI could allow more people to share their concerns, she argues.

But she’s aware that these putative upsides need to be weighed against major drawbacks. For instance, AI therapists can provide inconsistent and even dangerous responses to human users, according to a 2025 study, and they also raise privacy concerns, given that AI companies are currently not bound by the same confidentiality and HIPAA standards as licensed therapists.

While Blease is an expert in this field, her motivation for writing the book is also personal: She has two siblings with an incurable form of muscular dystrophy, one of whom waited decades for a diagnosis. During the writing of her book, she also lost her partner to cancer and her father to dementia within a devastating six-month period. “I witnessed first-hand the sheer brilliance of doctors and the kindness of health professionals,” she writes. “But I also observed how things can go wrong with care.”

A similar tension animates Daniel Oberhaus’s engrossing book The Silicon Shrink: How Artificial Intelligence Made the World an Asylum. Oberhaus starts from a point of tragedy: the loss of his younger sister to suicide. As Oberhaus carried out the “distinctly twenty-first-century mourning process” of sifting through her digital remains, he wondered if technology could have eased the burden of the psychiatric problems that had plagued her since childhood.

“It seemed possible that all of this personal data might have held important clues that her mental health providers could have used to provide more effective treatment,” he writes. “What if algorithms running on my sister’s smartphone or laptop had used that data to understand when she was in distress? Could it have led to a timely intervention that saved her life? Would she have wanted that even if it did?”

This concept of digital phenotyping—in which a person’s digital behavior could be mined for clues about distress or illness—seems elegant in theory. But it may also become problematic if integrated into the field of psychiatric artificial intelligence (PAI), which extends well beyond chatbot therapy.

Oberhaus emphasizes that digital clues could actually exacerbate the existing challenges of modern psychiatry, a discipline that remains fundamentally uncertain about the underlying causes of mental illnesses and disorders. The advent of PAI, he says, is “the logical equivalent of grafting physics onto astrology.” In other words, the data generated by digital phenotyping is as precise as physical measurements of planetary positions, but it is then integrated into a broader framework—in this case, psychiatry—that, like astrology, is based on unreliable assumptions.

Oberhaus, who uses the phrase “swipe psychiatry” to describe the outsourcing of clinical decisions based on behavioral data to LLMs, thinks that this approach cannot escape the fundamental issues facing psychiatry. In fact, it could worsen the problem by causing the skills and judgment of human therapists to atrophy as they grow more dependent on AI systems.

He also uses the asylums of the past—in which institutionalized patients lost their right to freedom, privacy, dignity, and agency over their lives—as a touchstone for a more insidious digital captivity that may spring from PAI. LLM users are already sacrificing privacy by telling chatbots sensitive personal information that companies then mine and monetize, contributing to a new surveillance economy. Freedom and dignity are at stake when complex inner lives are transformed into data streams tailored for AI analysis.

AI therapists could flatten humanity into patterns of prediction, and so sacrifice the intimate, individualized care that is expected of traditional human therapists. “The logic of PAI leads to a future where we may all find ourselves patients in an algorithmic asylum administered by digital wardens,” Oberhaus writes. “In the algorithmic asylum there is no need for bars on the window or white padded rooms because there is no possibility of escape. The asylum is already everywhere—in your homes and offices, schools and hospitals, courtrooms and barracks. Wherever there’s an internet connection, the asylum is waiting.”

Eoin Fullam, a researcher who studies the intersection of technology and mental health, echoes some of the same concerns in Chatbot Therapy: A Critical Analysis of AI Mental Health Treatment. A heady academic primer, the book analyzes the assumptions underlying the automated treatments offered by AI chatbots and the way capitalist incentives could corrupt these kinds of tools.

Fullam observes that the capitalist mentality behind new technologies “often leads to questionable, illegitimate, and illegal business practices in which the customers’ interests are secondary to strategies of market dominance.”

That doesn’t mean that therapy-bot makers “will inevitably conduct nefarious activities contrary to the users’ interests in the pursuit of market dominance,” Fullam writes.

But he notes that the success of AI therapy depends on the inseparable impulses to make money and to heal people. In this logic, exploitation and therapy feed each other: Every digital therapy session generates data, and that data fuels the system that profits as unpaid users seek care. The more effective the therapy seems, the more the cycle entrenches itself, making it harder to distinguish between care and commodification. “The more the users benefit from the app in terms of its therapeutic or any other mental health intervention,” he writes, “the more they undergo exploitation.”

This sense of an economic and psychological ouroboros—the snake that eats its own tail—serves as a central metaphor in Sike, the debut novel from Fred Lunzer, an author with a research background in AI.

Described as a “story of boy meets girl meets AI psychotherapist,” Sike follows Adrian, a young Londoner who makes a living ghostwriting rap lyrics, in his romance with Maquie, a business professional with a knack for spotting lucrative technologies in the beta phase.

The title refers to a splashy commercial AI therapist called Sike, uploaded into smart glasses, that Adrian uses to interrogate his myriad anxieties. “When I signed up to Sike, we set up my dashboard, a wide black panel like an airplane’s cockpit that showed my daily ‘vitals,’” Adrian narrates. “Sike can analyze the way you walk, the way you make eye contact, the stuff you talk about, the stuff you wear, how often you piss, shit, laugh, cry, kiss, lie, whine, and cough.”

In other words, Sike is the ultimate digital phenotyper, constantly and exhaustively analyzing everything in a user’s daily experiences. In a twist, Lunzer chooses to make Sike a luxury product, available only to subscribers who can foot the price tag of £2,000 per month.

Flush with cash from his contributions to a hit song, Adrian comes to rely on Sike as a trusted mediator between his inner and outer worlds. The novel explores the impacts of the app on the wellness of the well-off, following rich people who voluntarily commit themselves to a boutique version of the digital asylum described by Oberhaus.

The only real sense of danger in Sike involves a Japanese torture egg (don’t ask). The novel strangely sidesteps the broader dystopian ripples of its subject matter in favor of drunken conversations at fancy restaurants and elite dinner parties.

The sudden ascent of the AI therapist seems startlingly futuristic, as if it should be unfolding in some later time when the streets scrub themselves and we travel the world through pneumatic tubes.

Sike’s creator is simply “a great guy” in Adrian’s estimation, despite his techno-messianic vision of training the app to soothe the ills of entire nations. It always seems as if a shoe is meant to drop, but in the end, it never does, leaving the reader with a sense of non-resolution.

While Sike is set in the present day, something about the sudden ascent of the AI therapist—­in real life as well as in fiction—seems startlingly futuristic, as if it should be unfolding in some later time when the streets scrub themselves and we travel the world through pneumatic tubes. But this convergence of mental health and artificial intelligence has been in the making for more than half a century. The beloved astronomer Carl Sagan, for example, once imagined a “network of computer psychotherapeutic terminals, something like arrays of large telephone booths” that could address the growing demand for mental-health services.

Oberhaus notes that one of the first incarnations of a trainable neural network, known as the Perceptron, was devised not by a mathematician but by a psychologist named Frank Rosenblatt, at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory in 1958. The potential utility of AI in mental health was widely recognized by the 1960s, inspiring early computerized psychotherapists such as the DOCTOR script that ran on the ELIZA chatbot developed by Joseph Weizenbaum, who shows up in all three of the nonfiction books in this article.

Weizenbaum, who died in 2008, was profoundly concerned about the possibility of computerized therapy. “Computers can make psychiatric judgments,” he wrote in his 1976 book Computer Power and Human Reason. “They can flip coins in much more sophisticated ways than can the most patient human being. The point is that they ought not to be given such tasks. They may even be able to arrive at ‘correct’ decisions in some cases—but always and necessarily on bases no human being should be willing to accept.”

It’s a caution worth keeping in mind. As AI therapists arrive at scale, we’re seeing them play out a familiar dynamic: Tools designed with superficially good intentions are enmeshed with systems that can exploit, surveil, and reshape human behavior. In a frenzied attempt to unlock new opportunities for patients in dire need of mental-health support, we may be locking other doors behind them.

            <h2>Bangladesh’s garment-making industry is getting greener</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/29/1129308/bangladesh-garment-sustainability-frugal-factories/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Pollution from textile production—dyes, chemicals, and heavy metals like lead and cadmium—is common in the waters of the Buriganga River as it runs through Dhaka, Bangladesh. It’s among many harms posed by a garment sector that was once synonymous with tragedy: In 2013, the eight-story Rana Plaza factory building collapsed, killing 1,134 people and injuring some 2,500 others.

But things are starting to change. In recent years the country has quietly become an unlikely leader in “frugal” factories that use a combination of resource-efficient technologies to cut waste, conserve water, and build resilience against climate impacts and global supply disruptions. Bangladesh now boasts 268 LEED-certified garment factories—more than any other country. Dye plants are using safer chemicals, tanneries are adopting cleaner tanning methods and treating wastewater, workshops are switching to more efficient LED lighting, and solar panels glint from rooftops. The hundreds of factories along the Buriganga’s banks and elsewhere in Bangladesh are starting to stitch together a new story, woven from greener threads.

In Fakir Eco Knitwears’ LEED Gold–certified factory in Narayanganj, a city near Dhaka, skylights reduce energy consumption from electric lighting by 40%, and AI-driven cutters allow workers to recycle 95% of fabric scraps into new yarns. “We save energy by using daylight, solar power, and rainwater instead of heavy AC and boilers,” says Md. Anisuzzaman, an engineer at the company. “It shows how local resources can make production greener and more sustainable.”

The shift to green factories in Bangladesh is financed through a combination of factory investments, loans from Bangladesh Bank’s Green Transformation Fund, and pressure from international buyers who reward compliance with ongoing orders. One prominent program is the Partnership for Cleaner Textile (PaCT), an initiative run by the World Bank Group’s International Finance Corporation. Launched in 2013, PaCT has worked with more than 450 factories on cleaner production methods. By its count, the effort now saves 35 billion liters of fresh water annually, enough to meet the needs of 1.9 million people.

It’s a good start, but Bangladesh’s $40 billion garment industry still has a long way to go. The shift to environmentalism at the factory level hasn’t translated to improved outcomes for the sector’s 4.4 million workers.

Wage theft and delayed payments are widespread. The minimum wage, some 12,500 taka per month (about $113), is far below the $200 proposed by unions—which has meant frequent strikes and protests over pay, overtime, and job security. “Since Rana Plaza, building safety and factory conditions have improved, but the mindset remains unchanged,” says A.K.M. Ashraf Uddin, executive director of the Bangladesh Labour Foundation, a nonprofit labor rights group. “Profit still comes first, and workers’ freedom of speech is yet to be realized.”

In the worst case, greener industry practices could actually exacerbate inequality. Smaller factories dominate the sector, and they struggle to afford upgrades. But without those upgrades, businesses could find themselves excluded from certain markets. One of those is the European Union, which plans to require companies to address human rights and environmental problems in supply chains starting in 2027. A cleaner Buriganga River mends just a small corner of a vast tapestry of need.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It&#39;s been a busy and productive year here at MIT Technology Review. We published magazine issues on power, creativity, innovation, bodies, relationships, and security. We hosted 14 exclusive virtual conversations with our editors and outside experts in our subscriber-only series, Roundtables, and held two events on MIT’s campus. And we published hundreds of articles online, following new developments in computing, climate tech, robotics, and more.

As the year winds down, we wanted to give you a chance to revisit a bit of this work with us. Whether we were covering the red-hot rise of artificial intelligence or the future of biotech, these are some of the stories that resonated the most with our readers.

We did the math on AI’s energy footprint. Here’s the story you haven’t heard.

Understanding AI’s energy use was a huge global conversation in 2025 as hundreds of millions of people began using generative AI tools on a regular basis. Senior reporters James O’Donnell and Casey Crownhart dug into the numbers and published an unprecedented look at AI’s resource demand, down to the level of a single query, to help us know how much energy and water AI may require moving forward.

We’re learning more about what vitamin D does to our bodies

Vitamin D deficiency is widespread, particularly in the winter when there’s less sunlight to drive its production in our bodies. The “sunshine vitamin” is important for bone health, but as senior reporter Jessica Hamzelou reported, recent research is also uncovering surprising new insights into other ways it might influence our bodies, including our immune systems and heart health.

Senior editor Will Douglas Heaven’s expansive look at how to define AI was published in 2024, but it still managed to connect with many readers this year. He lays out why no one can agree on what AI is—and explains why that ambiguity matters, and how it can inform our own critical thinking about this technology.

Ethically sourced “spare” human bodies could revolutionize medicine

In this thought-provoking op-ed, a team of experts at Stanford University argue that creating living human bodies that can’t think, don’t have any awareness, and can’t feel pain could shake up medical research and drug development by providing essential biological materials for testing and transplantation. Recent advances in biotechnology now provide a potential pathway to such “bodyoids,” though plenty of technical challenges and ethical hurdles remain.

It’s surprisingly easy to stumble into a relationship with an AI chatbot

Chatbots were everywhere this year, and reporter Rhiannon Williams chronicled how quickly people can develop bonds with one. That’s all right for some people, she notes, but dangerous for others. Some folks even describe unintentionally forming romantic relationships with chatbots. This is a trend we’ll definitely be keeping an eye on in 2026.

The electric grid is bracing for disruption from more frequent storms and fires, as well as an uncertain policy and regulatory landscape. And in many ways, the publicly owned utility company Lincoln Electric in Nebraska is an ideal lens through which to examine this shift as it works through the challenges of delivering service that’s reliable, affordable, and sustainable.

Exclusive: A record-breaking baby has been born from an embryo that’s over 30 years old

This year saw the birth of the world’s “oldest baby”: Thaddeus Daniel Pierce, who arrived on July 26. The embryo he developed from was created in 1994 during the early days of IVF and had been frozen and sitting in storage ever since. The new baby’s parents were toddlers at the time, and the embryo was donated to them decades later via a Christian “embryo adoption” agency.

How these two brothers became go-to experts on America’s “mystery drone” invasion

Twin brothers John and Gerald Tedesco teamed up to investigate a concerning new threat—unidentified drones. In 2024 alone, some 350 drones entered airspace over a hundred different US military installations, and many cases went unsolved, according to a top military official. This story takes readers inside the equipment-filled RV the Tedescos created to study mysterious aerial phenomena, and how they made a name for themselves among government officials.

Our newsroom has published this annual look at advances that will matter in the long run for over 20 years. This year’s list featured generative AI search, cleaner jet fuel, long-acting HIV prevention meds, and other emerging technologies that our journalists think are worth watching. We’ll publish the 2026 edition of the list on January 12, so stay tuned. (In the meantime, here’s what didn’t make the cut.)

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

            <div id="article-text">Five stars used to mean something. People still read reviews before buying software. They just don’t trust them the way they used to. And no, this isn’t about fake reviews or obvious scams. Those are easy to spot. The real problem is more uncomfortable. The review economy didn’t collapse. It slowly drifted away from its original purpose.

User reviews began as authentic buyer guidance, but they’ve morphed into strategic assets for businesses. Scroll through any app store or e-commerce site: everything is “top-rated” and lavished with praise. If every product gleams with a 4.8/5 rating, those stars start to lose their meaning.

Consumers aren’t fooled, in fact, the share of people who trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations plummeted from nearly 80% in 2020 to just 42% in 2025

We read the glowing comments, but we’ve learned to read between the lines.

It’s not hard to see why trust has eroded. Companies have figured out that great reviews drive sales, so they’ve turned the whole system into a numbers game. High ratings aren’t just social proof now, they’re a growth tactic.  In other words, more stars = more money. So of course businesses are chasing stars like their life depends on it. And in a way, it does.

Behind the scenes, many companies actively engineer their review scores. One common tactic is to time the ask just right. For instance, some businesses send out a Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey to gauge your sentiment “How likely are you to recommend us?”

If you rate them a 9 or 10 (a promoter), you’re immediately nudged to post a public review. If you give a lukewarm or low score, the feedback form quietly thanks you and never mentions writing a review at all.

Only the happiest customers get the gentle push to “Share your experience!” This practice is so widespread it even has a name: “review gating.”

It’s essentially filtering which customers get invited to leave a review based on their initial feedback. Platforms officially frown on it (Google outright forbids “selectively soliciting positive reviews”), but behind closed doors it remains a growth hacker’s favorite trick.

Then there’s the outright incentivization. Perhaps you’ve received an email offering a discount, gift card, or free month of service in exchange for writing a review. It’s framed as a thank-you for your time, of course – “Share your honest feedback and get 10% off your next purchase!” – but the intent is clear.

In an economy of fake praise, even regulators have had to step in to remind everyone that trust isn’t a commodity to be bought. Companies know how to play the game from the other side too: suppressing negativity.

Unhappy customer feedback is quietly diverted to support teams or private channels, where it can be resolved (or simply contained) out of public view. The result is a skewed reality, a glossy wall of five-star testimonials that obscure any hint of dissatisfaction. It’s a great sales tool. It’s terrible for the truth.

Why go to such lengths to manicure the ratings? Because the platforms themselves reward it. The algorithms that sort and highlight products aren’t trying to surface the most truthful review; they’re trying to maximize engagement and conversion.

High ratings and large volumes of reviews make people more likely to click “Buy Now.” That means more conversion for sellers and more commission for the marketplace. In other words, the algorithm is biased toward whatever boosts the platform’s monetization metrics.

A bunch of five-star reviews isn’t just ego bait,  it’s algorithm bait.

Think about it: products with a 4.7-star average and hundreds of reviews tend to appear at the top of search results and recommendation lists. They convert better, so the system pushes them more.

More visibility leads to more sales, which reinforces the high ranking. It’s a feedback loop powered by positive feedback (pun intended). If a vendor can game their way into that virtuous cycle, via perfectly timed prompts or purchased praise, the platform’s code will happily amplify them.

Authenticity doesn’t earn you a top slot; performance does. The incentive is clear: keep it positive, and keep it plentiful. In the review economy, volume and sentiment are king.

Worse, some marketplaces have blurred the line between genuine high-rated listings and paid placement. It’s an open secret that many platforms offer sponsored spots or pay-to-play schemes, think “featured” placements, ads masquerading as top picks, or vendor subscriptions that subtly boost visibility.

Money talks, even if it speaks over the voice of authentic customer feedback. (To be fair, a few holdouts still refuse to monetize their review rankings or sell out their star system, but they’re the exception, not the rule).

Consumers aren’t sitting idly by in this charade. We’ve become savvy at sniffing out over-polished BS. The modern buyer knows how the game is played, and many are adapting their behavior to cope with the broken review system.

First, there’s a migration of trust to private networks and off-platform channels. Instead of relying on the star-average on a marketplace, people turn to friends, colleagues, and niche communities for real advice.

Think about the last time you were unsure about a purchase, maybe you shot a quick message to a group chat, or asked in a private Slack channel, “Hey, has anyone used this product? Is it actually any good?” Personal recommendations feel reliable again, precisely because they’re not part of the public review circus.

Second, savvy consumers cross-check everything. Rather than trusting one site’s reviews, they compare across multiple sources, the product might be 4.8 on the official store, but what’s it rated elsewhere?

Is there a discrepancy between the slick website testimonials and the chatter on Reddit? More often than not, shoppers now triangulate information. In fact, three out of four people use two or more sites when reading reviews, rather than putting all their faith in one platform’s word. We instinctively seek a consensus of truth across the noise.

Finally, many have decided the best judge is themselves. “Try before you buy” has made a comeback as a defense against dubious reviews. Free trials, freemium tiers, generous return policies, consumers leverage them all to test products firsthand.

If a software platform promises the world in its curated testimonials, a savvy buyer will take the 14-day free trial and see if it lives up to the hype. In sectors like enterprise software, where choices are costly and critical, buyers might run a pilot program or proof-of-concept rather than trust glossy case studies. Essentially, experience has become the new review.

All this has serious implications for platforms and software marketplaces. These businesses built their empires on user-generated trust, turning customer opinion into a key part of the shopping experience.

If that trust evaporates, the model cracks. We’re already seeing the early signs: users skipping the review tab, or treating every five-star rating with a healthy dose of skepticism.

If the review economy continues on its current path, platforms risk becoming mere transaction processors rather than trust brokers.

For the marketplaces, this is both a crisis and an opportunity. The crisis is obvious: loss of credibility. If people no longer believe what they read on your platform, they’ll seek validation elsewhere, and your influence over purchase decisions diminishes.

But the opportunity lies in reform. Platforms could double down on authenticity as a feature, verifying purchases, cracking down harder on fraudulent and incentivized reviews, and highlighting more qualitative, nuanced feedback instead of simple star counts.

There’s even a chance to innovate with new trust signals (some are experimenting with things like verified buyer badges, AI analysis for suspicious patterns, or weighted ratings that account for reviewer reputation). The platforms that find ways to genuinely restore faith in their review systems will win back weary consumers. Those that don’t will see their communities drift away, bit by bit.

Importantly, not all platforms have given in to the dark side. A handful still refuse pay-for-play tactics, no paid reviews, no under-the-table boosting of rankings for advertisers.

These holdouts demonstrate that integrity in reviews is possible, even if it means slower growth in the short term.

In the end, the broken review economy is forcing a rebalance of how we decide what to trust. Buyers are adapting, finding new ways to cut through the noise. And the platforms that once thrived on being the ultimate source of truth in purchasing may have to rethink their approach if they want to stay relevant.

Trust, once lost, is hard to regain. The five-star system doesn’t shine as bright as it used to; perhaps it’s time for the next evolution in how we share and earn trust online.

            <div id="article-text">2025 was the year technology stopped being tomorrow’s promise and became today’s anchor. What began as a surge in generative AI and platform innovation two years prior crystallized this year into concrete shifts in how people work, governing bodies legislate, and markets invest. Across continents and industries, the arc of technology bent toward practical impact, regulatory reality, and economic weight!

At the heart of the year’s story was artificial intelligence’s jump from novelty to infrastructure. LLMs and multimodal models moved beyond demos into everyday workflows, influencing how documents are written, campaigns are conceived, products designed, and code generated.

Enterprises that once hesitated began deploying AI tools at scale, with early adopters reporting measurable productivity gains by integrating copilots into core processes, a trend visible in surveys showing widespread adoption among software professionals.

This editorial isn’t a chronicle of every press release.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

It’s a reflection on how 2025, at the crossroads of technology, governance, and economic strategy, brought about a series of inflection points that will shape the next era of creation, competition, and control.

OpenAI’s release of GPT-5 in August pushed the boundaries of what AI could do, delivering notable gains in coding, math, and multimodal understanding. But unlike the jaw-dropping debut of ChatGPT a couple years prior, this new generation of foundation models arrived to a more measured reception.

Tech leaders and investors had begun asking harder questions: beyond impressive demos, could these models drive real products and revenue?

Google’s answer was Gemini 3, launched in November as its “most intelligent model” and immediately woven into Google’s flagship product, Search. For the first time, an AI model upgrade wasn’t just about boastful leaderboard scores, it was about transforming user experience.

Typing a query into Google now often meant receiving an AI-generated synthesis instead of the familiar list of links, a sea change in how information is delivered. Google even unveiled a Gemini “agent” that could execute multi-step tasks like booking travel or organizing email, hinting at a future where AI acts more like a digital butler than a chatbox.

Anthropic’s Claude 4 model, for instance, gained a strong following among developers by expanding how much it could handle at once, processing entire codebases with tens of thousands of lines, rather than by producing viral one-liners.

AI grew up in 2025: it was still improving at breakneck speed, but it also had to earn its keep in real products and justify the billion-dollar bets fueling its rise.

Driving this AI explosion was a parallel leap in hardware. The hunger for AI computers in 2025 was insatiable, and chipmakers raced to deliver.

NVIDIA, whose GPUs had become the era’s essential infrastructure, rolled out its new Blackwell architecture with chips like the B200 that boasted up to 3× the training speed of its predecessor. Cloud data centers around the world scrambled to deploy these to keep up with demand from model training and inference.

Rival chipmakers weren’t idle either: AMD and a cadre of startups pushed innovative AI accelerators, while even Intel signaled ambitions to catch up, reportedly exploring an acquisition of AI chip designer SambaNova.

Perhaps most tellingly, tech giants themselves started designing silicon tailored for AI workloads, recognizing that owning the chip means owning the future of computing.

Beyond AI chips, consumer hardware saw its own milestones. After years of anticipation, augmented reality glasses and mixed-reality headsets finally had their moment, sort of.

Apple’s Vision Pro headset, unveiled in late 2023, reached select markets in 2024; by 2025 developers were crafting the first wave of immersive apps. However, mass adoption lagged due to the device’s sky-high price and bulky format.

Competitors like Meta’s Quest line offered cheaper VR headsets and modest improvements, but the “metaverse” hype of yesteryear largely fizzled out, users and investors had shifted their excitement to generative AI and tangible productivity tools.

Smartphones and laptops in 2025 continued incremental improvements (faster Apple M3/M4 chips, foldable screens becoming more common), yet it was clear the next paradigm shift in personal tech was still on the horizon.

Even so, one hardware frontier made concrete progress: quantum computing. Industry leaders like IBM and Google demonstrated prototype systems with ever-larger qubit counts and made strides in error correction, inching closer to viable quantum machines.

These advances, while esoteric to the public, underscored a broader theme, from AI accelerators to quantum chips, the machinery under the hood of tech was evolving rapidly to enable the software of tomorrow.

If 2025 proved anything, it’s that technology no longer operates above the law. This was the year regulators moved from intent to enforcement, with Europe leading the charge.

After years of debate, the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act came into force, becoming the world’s first complex AI law. From February, certain “unacceptable risk” uses, such as social scoring and real-time biometric surveillance, were banned outright.

By August, transparency rules followed, forcing companies to label AI-generated content and comply with new obligations for general-purpose models. The signal was unmistakable: in Europe, the era of unchecked AI was over.

Companies now face audits, penalties, and real consequences if their systems cross legal or ethical lines, a regulatory moment European officials openly compared to GDPR’s impact on data privacy.

The pressure didn’t stop with AI. In 2025, regulators also went after the gatekeepers. The EU’s Digital Markets Act forced long-resistant changes from Big Tech, most notably when Apple opened the iPhone to third-party app stores and sideloading in Europe, dismantling a 15-year walled garden.

At the same time, enforcement of the Digital Services Act intensified. Platforms were scrutinized for how they handle disinformation, with companies like X warned or penalized during periods of geopolitical tension. In response, social networks expanded moderation teams, adjusted algorithms, and exposed more of their inner workings to researchers.

The US issued an AI executive order and signaled tougher enforcement through agencies like the FTC, while states stepped in, including New York’s law requiring mental-health warnings on addictive social features.

In China, new draft rules targeted AI systems designed for human-like interaction, tightening licensing and ideological oversight. By the end of the year, the freewheeling phase of tech disruption had given way to something more restrained. The question was no longer whether regulation would catch up, but how deeply it would reshape innovation itself.

The platform shake-up that began in 2023 gathered real momentum in 2025, as both companies and users adjusted to a post-pandemic, AI-saturated reality.

Nowhere was this clearer than in social media. Elon Musk’s X, which entered the decade with noise and bravado, found itself on the defensive. Meta’s Threads, initially dismissed after an early spike, steadily closed the gap, nearing parity with X in daily mobile users by mid-year.

X’s audience shrank as policy whiplash and leadership churn eroded confidence, and while its remaining users were still deeply engaged, the era of unquestioned Twitter dominance was over. Disenchanted users scattered across a fragmented landscape, from Meta’s polished Threads to decentralized alternatives like Bluesky and Mastodon, breaking the old Facebook–Instagram–Twitter equilibrium.

The recalibration extended well beyond social feeds.

Major platforms retooled around changing habits: Google reshaped Search around generative answers to fend off AI assistants and algorithmic discovery, while Microsoft pushed its Copilot deeper into Windows, Office, and Bing, betting on “AI inside” as a platform reset.

Everyday behavior shifted too. Smarter voice and chat assistants returned to daily use, handling emails, refunds, and scheduling with little friction. At the same time, screen fatigue set in. Digital-detox travel gained traction, and younger users gravitated toward apps that promised less algorithmic pressure and more human curation. Even streaming came full circle.

After years of fragmentation, providers began rebundling services, offering combined video, music, and gaming packages that looked suspiciously like cable TV reborn, a reminder that while technology moves forward, user preferences often move in cycles.

Amid the gains and momentum, 2025 also became a year of reckoning. As AI systems spread, society began grappling with their cultural and ethical cost. Creators who once marveled at generative tools started pushing back, arguing that their work had been absorbed without consent or compensation.

A wave of lawsuits moved through US courts, with authors accusing companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google of scraping books and articles to train models. By year’s end, the message was unmistakable: if AI is built on human creativity, many believe its rewards can no longer flow in one direction alone.

Public trust in technology was also tested by a rise in malicious uses and misuses. In the financial domain, sophisticated deepfake scams caused real damage. The frequency of such incidents spiked sharply; cybersecurity firms reported a 3000% increase in deepfake-related fraud over two years, and authorities scrambled to educate businesses on new verification practices.

Misinformation continued to be a menace: during elections and conflicts, AI-generated fake images and videos spread on social media, forcing newsrooms to set up rapid-response fact-checking teams.

Encouragingly, 2025 also saw growth in countermeasures, from better deepfake detection algorithms to nascent standards for cryptographic content authentication (the Coalition for Content Provenance, including major publishers and tech platforms, expanded efforts to watermark authentic media).

Still, the information ecosystem remained fraught, as even savvy citizens found it ever harder to tell the truth from fabrication online.

And then there’s the human element: how all this tech is affecting everyday lives and livelihoods. Workplace AI adoption soared this year; tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot and a host of AI assistants became common on office desktops. Studies showed productivity boosts but also raised concerns about workers becoming overly reliant on AI suggestions.

Meanwhile, fears of automation resurfaced in certain sectors, for example, as chatbots took over more customer service and code-generation tools improved, professionals in call centers and junior programming positions wondered about long-term job security.

These anxieties fueled calls for new approaches to education and training, so that the workforce of 2030 will be prepared for more creative, complex tasks that AI can’t easily handle.

Lovable (Stockholm, Sweden) came as one of the most remarkable AI software stories of the year, for me. What began as an open-source project evolved into a commercial platform that lets users build fully functional websites and apps using plain-language prompts, no traditional coding required.

This approach, known in the industry as “vibe coding,” turns ideas into production-ready software simply by describing what you want in natural language.

Lovable’s growth in 2025 was extraordinary by any measure. Eight months after its launch, the company hit over $100 million in annual recurring revenue and raised a $200 million Series A at a roughly $1.8 billion valuation, making it one of Europe’s fastest-growing software startups ever.

By year’s end, Lovable had secured $330 million in Series B funding at about a $6.6 billion valuation, and was rapidly scaling globally.

What makes Lovable meaningful beyond the numbers is what it represents: a shift in how software is built. It demonstrated that AI can democratize development, giving power to non-technical founders, creators, and teams to go from concept to product without traditional engineering barriers.

In an industry long centered on specialized skills and team structures, Lovable’s rise suggested a future where natural language becomes the primary interface to software creation.

On a more hopeful note, 2025 showed signs of a maturing tech culture. Ethical design moved from talking point to practice. Major platforms began experimenting with limits, turning off infinite scroll for teens, adding prompts that nudged users to pause, and treating “time well spent” as a real metric rather than a slogan.

In AI, transparency gained ground. Under pressure from regulators and researchers, companies like OpenAI and Google disclosed more about how their models are trained and where they fall short.

Researchers formed new alliances to share safety techniques, and a second global AI Safety Summit brought dozens of countries together around questions of alignment and control.

None of it amounted to binding rules, but it marked a shift in tone: even the architects of powerful systems openly acknowledged the need for restraint.

Taken together, these moments made 2025 a turning point. For years, technology had surged ahead of the institutions meant to guide it. This year, that gap began to close.

The breakthroughs were real and transformative, but so were the responses to them: laws passed, norms reset, alliances formed. If 2024 was the year the world grasped the power of generative AI, 2025 was the year it began deciding how that power should be used.

The story of technology is no longer just about what can be built, but about how it fits into the lives it shapes, and who gets to decide that fit.

            <div id="article-text">My name is Alexandru Stan, and this article continues the dialogue I began following the acquisition of TNW.

Following the recent transaction, TNW Spaces remains with the Financial Times, while we continue the mission of the website, the events, and the global community.

We already have a dedicated team at tekpon operating the platform, events, and community initiatives. Our objective is to expand and strengthen the team as TNW accelerates its next chapter.

TNW is already a global media platform with millions of readers. We’re not starting over. We are building forward.

Technology is entering a decisive stage: AI is reshaping workflows, distribution is shifting, capital is becoming more selective, and founders are expected to demonstrate value rather than potential.

The world doesn’t need more noise.
It needs clarity, execution, and access to trustworthy knowledge and people.

TNW will serve that need through editorial independence, real expertise, and community-built intelligence.

Success for TNW looks like this: more accurate understanding, faster access to verified knowledge, and direct pathways from insight to action.

I’ve been an entrepreneur since 2007, building in B2B SaaS, marketplaces, and scalable systems. I believe deeply in servant leadership. Without people, I am zero.

I lead two private networks grounded in practice rather than theory:

These groups ensure TNW remains rooted in lived experience, informed by operators, not commentators.

Our mission is to build the most trusted European tech media platform with global reach, focused on practical innovation, responsible scaling, and transparency.

We will continue to host events across Europe’s major capitals including Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Monaco.

These will not be festivals. We are introducing a concept validated through tekpon events: curated gatherings built for meaningful relationships, deep content, and tangible business outcomes.

In 2026, we return to Amsterdam for a special edition centered on AI among other fields. We will explore technologies and strategies shaping the future of work and business:

The editorial focus remains European, while the audience is global.

AI is not a threat to publishing. It is the infrastructure of the next generation of content and knowledge.

At TNW, we will use AI to accelerate research, enable personalized intelligence, reduce noise and bias, and amplify high-quality human expertise. Technology assists. Human judgment remains central.

Because this moment in Europe matters.
Because founders here are ready to scale responsibly.
Because independent media with integrity is rare.
Because innovation deserves a platform built around people, not hype.

TNW will continue its legacy with a renewed emphasis on contribution, execution, and community built through trust.

If you are building, scaling, or researching the next wave of technology, I invite you to engage with us, contribute insights, and participate in shaping the conversation.

The next era begins now. Let’s shape it together.

            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard!

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you. We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.
