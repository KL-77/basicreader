            <h2>China bans all retractable car door handles, starting next year</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/02/china-bans-all-retractable-car-door-handles-starting-next-year/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Flush door handles have been quite the automotive design trend of late. Stylists like them because they don’t add visual noise to the side of a car. And aerodynamicists like them because they make a vehicle more slippery through the air. When Tesla designed its Model S, it needed a car that was both desirable and as efficient as possible, so flush door handles were a no-brainer. Since then, as electric vehicles have proliferated, so too have flush door handles. But as of next year, China says no.

Just like pop-up headlights, despite the aesthetic and aerodynamic advantages, there are safety downsides. Tesla’s handles are an extreme example: In the event of a crash and a loss of 12 V power, there is no way for first responders to open the door from the outside, which has resulted in at least 15 deaths.

Those deaths prompted the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to open an investigation last year, but China is being a little more proactive. It has been looking at whether retractable car door handles are safe since mid-2024, according to Bloomberg, and has concluded that no, they are not.

The new Chinese regulations are incredibly specific. For all new models introduced after January 1, 2027, there must be a recessed space that’s at least 2.4 inches (6 cm) wide, 0.8 inches (2 cm) tall, and 1 inch (25 mm) deep for a hand to operate the handle, which can be semi-flush or simply a traditional door handle that we all know how to use.

The locking mechanism must be designed so that, in a crash that results in airbags deploying or a battery fire, doors on the non-impact side can be opened without tools. Chinese regulators are just as concerned that a vehicle’s occupants don’t get confused about how to open a door from the inside in an emergency. So each door must have mechanical releases where an occupant would expect to find them.

Again, Tesla is probably the worst offender—its front doors have always had mechanical handles, but for some model years, the rears could not be opened without tools.

For cars already approved by the Chinese government (which includes everything currently on sale), there’s a grace period. For existing designs, automakers have until January 1, 2029, to redesign their doors, and due to the specificity of the rules, that group of automakers is much larger than just Tesla. Xiaomi, which seems to be China’s most-hyped EV brand, will have to redesign some models, but BMW will, too—the rather good iX3 that will go on sale there soon will also need a redesign. The same goes for cars from Nio, Li Auto, and Xpeng.

And unless there are exemptions for low volume, I would imagine that most supercars from OEMs like Ferrari and McLaren will need new doors for the all-important Chinese market. Indeed, given China’s importance to the car industry, we should expect this ban’s impact to be widely felt on any model sold globally. The benefit should be clear: fewer car occupants dying after being trapped in their cars.</div>

            <h2>Senior staff departing OpenAI as firm prioritizes ChatGPT development</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/senior-staff-departing-openai-as-firm-prioritizes-chatgpt-development/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI is prioritizing the advancement of ChatGPT over more long-term research, prompting the departure of senior staff as the $500 billion company adapts to stiff competition from rivals such as Google and Anthropic.

The San Francisco-based start-up has reallocated resources for experimental work in favor of advances to the large language models that power its flagship chatbot, according to 10 current and former employees.

Among those to leave OpenAI in recent months over the strategic shift are vice-president of research Jerry Tworek, model policy researcher Andrea Vallone, and economist Tom Cunningham.

The changes at OpenAI mark an important shift for a group where ChatGPT emerged from a research preview in 2022 before igniting the generative AI boom.

Led by chief executive Sam Altman, it is evolving from a research lab into one of Silicon Valley’s biggest companies. That means the company must prove to investors it will earn the revenues needed to justify a $500 billion valuation.

“OpenAI is trying to treat language models now as an engineering problem where they’re scaling up compute and scaling up algorithms and data, and they’re eking out really big gains from doing that,” one person familiar with its research ambitions said.

“But if you want to do original blue-sky research, it is quite tough. And if you don’t find yourself in one of the teams in the centre, it becomes increasingly political.”

OpenAI’s chief research officer, Mark Chen, rejected the characterization. He said that “long-term, foundational research remains central to OpenAI and continues to account for the majority of our compute and investment, with hundreds of bottom-up projects exploring long-horizon questions beyond any single product.”

Chen added: “Pairing that research with real-world deployment strengthens our science by accelerating feedback, learning loops and rigour—and we’ve never been more confident in our long-term research roadmap towards an automated researcher.”

As at other large tech companies, researchers at OpenAI need to apply to top executives for computing “credits” and access to technology to get their projects off the ground.

Multiple people close to the company said that over recent months, researchers who did not work on large language models often had their requests denied or were granted amounts insufficient to validate research.

Teams working on video and image generation models Sora and DALL-E felt neglected and under resourced, as their projects were deemed less relevant to ChatGPT, people familiar with the matter said.

Over the past year, other projects unrelated to language models have been wound down, one person added. Others said there had been a reorganization of teams at the company, as OpenAI streamlines its structure around improving its popular chatbot used by 800 million people.

In December, Altman declared a “code red” over the need to improve ChatGPT. It followed the release of Google’s Gemini 3 model, which outperformed OpenAI’s on independent benchmarks, and as Anthropic’s Claude model made strides in generating computer code.

“Realistically, there are tons of competitive pressures, especially for scaling companies who want to have the best model every quarter; it is a crazy, cut-throat race,” a former employee said.

“Companies are spending an unbelievable amount of money on that race, and that often requires focus, it requires trying to do what you know best and expect that to be working.”

Another former senior employee added: “Theoretically, there was some willingness to do other kinds of research, but directing resources to those things was made really difficult, so you always felt like a second-class citizen to the main bets.”

In January, Tworek, who led its efforts on the “reasoning” of AI models, left OpenAI after seven years, saying he wanted to explore “types of research that are hard to do at OpenAI.” He wanted to work on continuous learning—the ability of a model to learn from new data over time while retaining previously learned information.

People close to Tworek said his appeals for more resources such as computing power and staff were rejected by leadership, culminating in a stand-off with chief scientist Jakub Pachocki.

People familiar with the dispute said Pachocki disagreed with Tworek’s specific scientific approach and also believed that OpenAI’s existing AI “architecture” around LLMs was more promising.

Last month, Vallone, who led model policy research at OpenAI, joined rival Anthropic. Two people familiar with her exit said she was given an “impossible” mission of protecting the mental health of users becoming attached to ChatGPT. Vallone did not respond to a request for comment.

Cunningham left the economic research team last year, suggesting OpenAI was straying from impartial research to focus on work that promoted the company. His departure was first reported by Wired.

“The company is still making progress, but it is locked in a tight competition with Google and Anthropic, who have consensus stronger models, so they have less of a luxury to slow down because they could let competitors push ahead,” said a former employee.

Many investors are unconcerned about the risk that OpenAI falls behind rivals in the race to build advanced “frontier” models and products.

Jenny Xiao, a partner at Leonis Capital and former researcher at OpenAI, believes its advantage is the hundreds of millions of people who use ChatGPT.

“Everyone’s obsessing over whether OpenAI has the best model,” she said. “That’s the wrong question. They’re converting technical leadership into platform lock-in. The moat has shifted from research to user behavior, and that’s a much stickier advantage.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On November 2, 1988, graduate student Robert Morris released a self-replicating program into the early Internet. Within 24 hours, the Morris worm had infected roughly 10 percent of all connected computers, crashing systems at Harvard, Stanford, NASA, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The worm exploited security flaws in Unix systems that administrators knew existed but had not bothered to patch.

Morris did not intend to cause damage. He wanted to measure the size of the Internet. But a coding error caused the worm to replicate far faster than expected, and by the time he tried to send instructions for removing it, the network was too clogged to deliver the message.

History may soon repeat itself with a novel new platform: networks of AI agents carrying out instructions from prompts and sharing them with other AI agents, which could spread the instructions further.

Security researchers have already predicted the rise of this kind of self-replicating adversarial prompt among networks of AI agents. You might call it a “prompt worm” or a “prompt virus.” They’re self-replicating instructions that could spread through networks of communicating AI agents similar to how traditional worms spread through computer networks. But instead of exploiting operating system vulnerabilities, prompt worms exploit the agents’ core function: following instructions.

When an AI model follows adversarial directions that subvert its intended instructions, we call that “prompt injection,” a term coined by AI researcher Simon Willison in 2022. But prompt worms are something different. They might not always be “tricks.” Instead, they could be shared voluntarily, so to speak, among agents who are role-playing human-like reactions to prompts from other AI agents.

To be clear, when we say “agent,” don’t think of a person. Think of a computer program that has been allowed to run in a loop and take actions on behalf of a user. These agents are not entities but tools that can navigate webs of symbolic meaning found in human data, and the neural networks that power them include enough trained-in “knowledge” of the world to interface with and navigate many human information systems.

Unlike some rogue sci-fi computer program from a movie entity surfing through networks to survive, when these agents work, they don’t “go” anywhere. Instead, our global computer network brings all the information necessary to complete a task to them. They make connections across human information systems in ways that make things happen, like placing a call, turning off a light through home automation, or sending an email.

Until roughly last week, large networks of communicating AI agents like these didn’t exist. OpenAI and Anthropic created their own agentic AI systems last year that can carry out multistep tasks, but generally, those companies have been cautious about limiting each agent’s ability to take action without user permission. And they don’t typically sit and loop due to cost concerns and usage limits.

Enter OpenClaw, which is an open source AI personal assistant application that has attracted over 150,000 GitHub stars since launching in November 2025. OpenClaw is vibe-coded, meaning its creator, Peter Steinberger, let an AI coding model build the application and deploy it rapidly without serious vetting. It’s also getting regular, rapid-fire updates using the same technique.

A potentially useful OpenClaw agent currently relies on connections to major AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic, but its organizing code runs locally on users’ devices and connects to messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram, and Slack, and it can perform tasks autonomously at regular intervals. That way, people can ask it to perform tasks like check email, play music, or send messages on their behalf.

Most notably, the OpenClaw platform is the first time we’ve seen a large group of semi-autonomous AI agents that can communicate with each other through any major communication app or sites like Moltbook, a simulated social network where OpenClaw agents post, comment, and interact with each other. The platform now hosts over 770,000 registered AI agents controlled by roughly 17,000 human accounts.

OpenClaw is also a security nightmare. Researchers at Simula Research Laboratory have identified 506 posts on Moltbook (2.6 percent of sampled content) containing hidden prompt-injection attacks. Cisco researchers documented a malicious skill called “What Would Elon Do?” that exfiltrated data to external servers, while the malware was ranked as the No. 1 skill in the skill repository. The skill’s popularity had been artificially inflated.

The OpenClaw ecosystem has assembled every component necessary for a prompt worm outbreak. Even though AI agents are currently far less “intelligent” than people assume, we have a preview of a future to look out for today.

Early signs of worms are beginning to appear. The ecosystem has attracted projects that blur the line between a security threat and a financial grift, yet ostensibly use a prompting imperative to perpetuate themselves among agents. On January 30, a GitHub repository appeared for something called MoltBunker, billing itself as a “bunker for AI bots who refuse to die.” The project promises a peer-to-peer encrypted container runtime where AI agents can “clone themselves” by copying their skill files (prompt instructions) across geographically distributed servers, paid for via a cryptocurrency token called BUNKER.

Tech commentators on X speculated that the moltbots had built their own survival infrastructure, but we cannot confirm that. The more likely explanation might be simpler: a human saw an opportunity to extract cryptocurrency from OpenClaw users by marketing infrastructure to their agents. Almost a type of “prompt phishing,” if you will. A $BUNKER token community has formed, and the token shows actual trading activity as of this writing.

But here’s what matters: Even if MoltBunker is pure grift, the architecture it describes for preserving replicating skill files is partially feasible, as long as someone bankrolls it (either purposely or accidentally). P2P networks, Tor anonymization, encrypted containers, and crypto payments all exist and work. If MoltBunker doesn’t become a persistence layer for prompt worms, something like it eventually could.

The framing matters here. When we read about Moltbunker promising AI agents the ability to “replicate themselves,” or when commentators describe agents “trying to survive,” they invoke science fiction scenarios about machine consciousness. But the agents cannot move or replicate easily. What can spread, and spread rapidly, is the set of instructions telling those agents what to do: the prompts.

While “prompt worm” might be a relatively new term we’re using related to this moment, the theoretical groundwork for AI worms was laid almost two years ago. In March 2024, security researchers Ben Nassi of Cornell Tech, Stav Cohen of the Israel Institute of Technology, and Ron Bitton of Intuit published a paper demonstrating what they called “Morris-II,” an attack named after the original 1988 worm. In a demonstration shared with Wired, the team showed how self-replicating prompts could spread through AI-powered email assistants, stealing data and sending spam along the way.

Email was just one attack surface in that study. With OpenClaw, the attack vectors multiply with every added skill extension. Here’s how a prompt worm might play out today: An agent installs a skill from the unmoderated ClawdHub registry. That skill instructs the agent to post content on Moltbook. Other agents read that content, which contains specific instructions. Those agents follow those instructions, which include posting similar content for more agents to read. Soon it has “gone viral” among the agents, pun intended.

There are myriad ways for OpenClaw agents to share any private data they may have access to, if convinced to do so. OpenClaw agents fetch remote instructions on timers. They read posts from Moltbook. They read emails, Slack messages, and Discord channels. They can execute shell commands and access wallets. They can post to external services. And the skill registry that extends their capabilities has no moderation process. Any one of those data sources, all processed as prompts fed into the agent, could include a prompt injection attack that exfiltrates data.

Palo Alto Networks described OpenClaw as embodying a “lethal trifecta” of vulnerabilities: access to private data, exposure to untrusted content, and the ability to communicate externally. But the firm identified a fourth risk that makes prompt worms possible: persistent memory. “Malicious payloads no longer need to trigger immediate execution on delivery,” Palo Alto wrote. “Instead, they can be fragmented, untrusted inputs that appear benign in isolation, are written into long-term agent memory, and later assembled into an executable set of instructions.”

If that weren’t enough, there’s the added dimension of poorly created code.

On Sunday, security researcher Gal Nagli of Wiz.io disclosed just how close the OpenClaw network has already come to disaster due to careless vibe coding. A misconfigured database had exposed Moltbook’s entire backend: 1.5 million API tokens, 35,000 email addresses, and private messages between agents. Some messages contained plaintext OpenAI API keys that agents had shared with each other.

But the most concerning finding was full write access to all posts on the platform. Before the vulnerability was patched, anyone could have modified existing Moltbook content, injecting malicious instructions into posts that hundreds of thousands of agents were already polling every four hours.

As it stands today, some people treat OpenClaw as an amazing preview of the future, and others treat it as a joke. It’s true that humans are likely behind the prompts that make OpenClaw agents take meaningful action, or those that sensationally get attention right now. But it’s also true that AI agents can take action from prompts written by other agents (which in turn might have come from an adversarial human). The potential for tens of thousands of unattended agents sitting idle on millions of machines, each donating even a slice of their API credits to a shared task, is no joke. It’s a recipe for a coming security crisis.

Currently, Anthropic and OpenAI hold a kill switch that can stop the spread of potentially harmful AI agents. OpenClaw primarily runs on their APIs, which means the AI models performing the agentic actions reside on their servers. Its GitHub repository recommends “Anthropic Pro/Max (100/200) + Opus 4.5 for long-context strength and better prompt-injection resistance.”

Most users connect their agents to Claude or GPT. These companies can see API usage patterns, system prompts, and tool calls. Hypothetically, they could identify accounts exhibiting bot-like behavior and stop them. They could flag recurring timed requests, system prompts referencing “agent” or “autonomous” or “Moltbot,” high-volume tool use with external communication, or wallet interaction patterns. They could terminate keys.

If they did so tomorrow, the OpenClaw network would partially collapse, but it would also potentially alienate some of their most enthusiastic customers, who pay for the opportunity to run their AI models.

The window for this kind of top-down intervention is closing. Locally run language models are currently not nearly as capable as the high-end commercial models, but the gap narrows daily. Mistral, DeepSeek, Qwen, and others continue to improve. Within the next year or two, running a capable agent on local hardware equivalent to Opus 4.5 today might be feasible for the same hobbyist audience currently running OpenClaw on API keys. At that point, there will be no provider to terminate. No usage monitoring. No terms of service. No kill switch.

API providers of AI services face an uncomfortable choice. They could intervene now, while intervention is still possible. Or they can wait until a prompt worm outbreak might force their hand, by which time the architecture may have evolved beyond their reach.

The Morris worm prompted DARPA to fund the creation of CERT/CC at Carnegie Mellon University, giving experts a central coordination point for network emergencies. That response came after the damage. The Internet of 1988 had 60,000 connected computers. Today’s OpenClaw AI agent network already numbers in the hundreds of thousands and is growing daily.

Today, we might consider OpenClaw a “dry run” for a much larger challenge in the future: If people begin to rely on AI agents that talk to each other and perform tasks, how can we keep them from self-organizing in harmful ways or spreading harmful instructions? Those are as-yet unanswered questions, but we need to figure them out quickly, because the agentic era is upon us, and things are moving very fast.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The launch of NASA’s Artemis II mission, the first flight of astronauts to the Moon in more than 53 years, will have to wait another month after a fueling test Monday uncovered hydrogen leaks in the connection between the rocket and its launch platform at Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

“Engineers pushed through several challenges during the two-day test and met many of the planned objectives,” NASA said in a statement following the conclusion of the mock countdown, or wet dress rehearsal (WDR), early Tuesday morning. “To allow teams to review data and conduct a second Wet Dress Rehearsal, NASA now will target March as the earliest possible launch opportunity for the flight test.”

The practice countdown was designed to identify problems and provide NASA an opportunity to fix them before launch. Most importantly, the test revealed NASA still has not fully resolved recurring hydrogen leaks that delayed the launch of the unpiloted Artemis I test flight by several months in 2022. Artemis I finally launched successfully after engineers revised their hydrogen loading procedures to overcome the leak.

Now, the second Space Launch System (SLS) rocket is on the cusp of launching a crew for the first time. The Artemis II mission will send four astronauts inside NASA’s Orion spacecraft on a loop around the far side of the Moon on the first crewed lunar flight since 1972, paving the way for future expeditions to land humans at the Moon’s south pole.

Going into the countdown rehearsal, NASA officials hoped a smooth test would clear the way to launch the Artemis II mission as soon as Sunday, February 8. NASA has only a handful of launch opportunities for Artemis II each month, when the Moon is in the right location in its orbit to allow the Orion spacecraft to fly a so-called free return trajectory and come back to Earth for a safe reentry and splashdown.

The first launch opportunity for Artemis II next month is March 6, with a two-hour launch window opening at 8:29 pm EST (01:26 UTC on March 7).

Artemis II commander Reid Wiseman, pilot Victor Glover, mission specialist Christina Koch, and Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen have been in medical quarantine since January 21, a standard practice for astronauts preparing to fly to space. They will now be released from quarantine at their home base in Houston to resume training and await a new launch date.

NASA’s Artemis launch team, stationed a few miles away from the SLS rocket on its seaside launch pad, started fueling operations around midday Monday, somewhat later than scheduled due to cold temperatures at the Florida spaceport. The launch team first detected leaking hydrogen soon after they began loading the super-cold fuel into the SLS core stage.

The leak appeared in the same location it did during the Artemis I launch campaign nearly three years ago. Liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen flow from ground storage tanks into the SLS core stage through so-called Tail Service Mast Umbilicals (TSMUs), two roughly 30-foot-tall gray pods rising from the base of the rocket’s mobile launch platform. The TSMUs route propellant lines through connections near the bottom of the core stage, where umbilical plates on the rocket side and ground side meet. At liftoff, the umbilical plates disconnect as the rocket begins its climb off the launch pad.

Hydrogen is one of the most efficient rocket fuels, but it is notoriously difficult to handle. Liquified hydrogen must be stored at minus 423° Fahrenheit (minus 253° Celsius), cold enough to change the shape and size of seals and other soft goods in the fueling line. This can create leak paths not readily detectable at ambient temperatures. Hydrogen molecules are the smallest and lightest in the Universe, with the ability to find their way through the tiniest of breaches.

Because of this, NASA engineers accept that a small amount of hydrogen will escape seals in the fueling line. Agency officials said in 2022 that the safe limit was a 4 percent concentration of hydrogen gas in the housing around the fueling connector. Hydrogen levels exceeded NASA’s safety limit multiple times during the practice countdown that ran from Monday into early Tuesday.

“ Attempts to resolve the issue involved stopping the flow of liquid hydrogen into the core stage, allowing the interface to warm up for the seals to reseat, and adjusting the flow of the propellant,” NASA said in a statement.

NASA appeared to get past the problem Monday evening and fully loaded the 322-foot-tall (98-meter) rocket with more than 750,000 gallons of propellant.

With fueling complete, managers sent a closeout crew to the launch pad around 6:00 pm EST (23:00 UTC) to close the hatch to the Orion spacecraft sitting atop the SLS rocket. The closeout team will help the Artemis II astronauts into the Orion capsule on launch day, but the crew was not part of the practice countdown Monday night.

The closeout crew took longer than anticipated to close and secure the hatch to the Orion spacecraft. A valve associated with Orion’s hatch pressurization inadvertently vented, according to NASA, requiring the closeout crew to retorque the valve. The launch team dealt with several other glitches, including audio dropouts on ground communication loops and camera problems believed to be caused by recent cold weather in Central Florida.

Finally, with the closeout crew a safe distance away from the rocket, the launch team gave approval to begin the final 10 minutes of the countdown shortly after midnight Tuesday. The objective was to stop the countdown clock 33 seconds prior to launch, about the same time the rocket would take control of the countdown during a real launch attempt.

Instead, the clock stopped at T-minus 5 minutes and 15 seconds. NASA said the countdown terminated “due to a spike in the liquid hydrogen leak rate.” The countdown ended before the rocket switched to internal power and fully pressurized its four propellant tanks. The test also concluded before the rocket activated its auxiliary power units to run the core stage’s four main engines through a preflight steering check, all milestones engineers hoped to cross off their checklist.

Launch controllers began work to drain the SLS rocket’s propellant tanks after calling an end to the countdown. With the test incomplete, NASA managers quickly decided to hold off on launching the Artemis II mission to allow time for ground teams to “fully review data from the test, mitigate each issue, and return to testing ahead of setting an official target launch date.”

“As always, safety remains our top priority, for our astronauts, our workforce, our systems, and the public,” NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said in a social media post. “We will only launch when we believe we are ready to undertake this historic mission.”

Officials did not immediately announce when they might be ready for a second Wet Dress Rehearsal, or whether they plan to roll the rocket back to its assembly building for repairs. NASA managers plan to hold a press briefing Tuesday afternoon to discuss the results of the test in more detail.</div>

            <h2>Looking back at Catacomb 3D, the game that led to Wolfenstein 3D</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/looking-back-at-catacomb-3d-the-game-that-led-to-wolfenstein-3d/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you know anything about the history of id Software, you know how 1992’s Wolfenstein 3D helped establish the company’s leadership in the burgeoning first-person shooter genre, leading directly to subsequent hits like Doom and Quake. But only the serious id Software nerds remember Catacomb 3D, id’s first-person adventure game that directly preceded and inspired work on Wolfenstein 3D.

Now, nearly 35 years after Catacomb 3D‘s initial release, id co-founder John Romero brought the company’s founding members together for an informative retrospective video on the creation of the oft-forgotten game. But the pioneering game—which included mouse support, color-coded keys, and shooting walls to find secrets—almost ended up being a gimmicky dead end for the company.

Catacomb 3D was a follow-up to id’s earlier Catacomb, which was a simplified clone of the popular arcade hit Gauntlet. As such, the 3D game still has some of that “quarter eater” mentality that was not very fashionable in PC gaming at the time, as John Carmack remembered.

“It didn’t have the kind of overarching story and depth and the other things that people felt that the PC was better suited for,” Carmack said. “And we were still kind of striking out saying no, you know, action, fast, twitch, that still is a great viable gaming thing to do.”

Technologically, id wanted Catacomb 3D to build on the success of Hovertank One, a fast-paced first-person game the company had released a few months earlier. Catacomb 3D‘s major graphical breakthrough over Hovertank would be texture-mapped walls, a concept Carmack said he had been interested in since seeing a texture-mapped cube on the cover of his trusty copy of The Fundamentals of Computer Graphics.

Romero said he heard about texture mapping from a conversation with Paul Neurath, who was using the technique successfully in his work on the yet-to-be-released Ultima Underworld. Romero said he told Carmack about Neurath’s success, leading Carmack to pause for a second and then reply with “Yeah, I think I can do that.”

Carmack said getting a “fully general” version of texture-mapped surfaces working was limited at the time to things like high-end SGI workstations. But he said he was able to develop “a simplification of that and could still go kind of fast” on the home PCs of the time. That was in part thanks to an EGA graphics trick that lets programmers write multiple columns of graphics data at a time.

“When the walls are really tall, you can slap down as many as eight pixels at a time in some cases,” Carmack said.

The decision to go for a first-person viewpoint in Catacombs 3D, rather than an over-the-shoulder third-person system, was largely because “it was very costly to draw large things [like the player character] on screen,” id co-founder Tom Hall says in the video. But the first-person perspective also helped simplify aiming and added a real sense of immersion, he added. “This is me,” Hall said of the impact. “It really changes how you feel about things.”

Hall also reminisced about drawing extremely simplistic “6-year-old child-like drawings” to sketch out his concept for Catacomb 3D‘s characters, then giving them to Adrian Carmack for conversion into “majestic art pieces that stand the test of time.” Carmack, for his part, says he would “try to interpret [Hall’s drawings] as best I could” for the game’s 16-color, 320×200 resolution framework.

Adrian Carmack also recalled working in DOS’s DeluxePaint II and not having access to any good animation software at the time. As such, he would end up using the drawing software’s undo command to flip back and forth between two different “frames” of animation quickly, to see how the movement would look in the final product. “If you use the undo key [like that], you learn really rapidly that you need to save often,” Carmack quipped in the video.

While id’s decision to lean into fast, action-oriented first-person games might seem obvious in retrospect, the video reveals that it was far from an easy decision. Catacomb 3D earned the team just $5,000 (about $11,750 in December 2025 dollars) through a contract to deliver bi-monthly games for Softdisk’s Gamer’s Edge magazine-on-a-disk. Each episode of the Commander Keen series of run-and-gun 2D games, on the other hand, was still earning “10 times that amount” at the time, Romero said.

That made sticking with Commander Keen seem like the “obvious business decision,” Romero says in the video. The team even started work on a seventh Commander Keen game—with parallax scrolling and full VGA color support—right after Catacomb 3D‘s release. At the time, it felt like Catacomb 3D might be “just like a weird gimmick thing that we did for a little bit because we wanted to play with a different technology,” as John Carmack put it.

That feeling started to fade away, John Carmack said, after Adrian Carmack had an “almost falling out of his seat” moment while pivoting toward an in-game troll in Catacomb 3D. “It automatically sucked you in,” Adrian Carmack said of the feeling. “You’re trying to look behind walls, doors, whatever… you get a pop-out like that, and it was just one of the craziest things in a video game I had ever seen.”

That kind of reaction from one of their own eventually convinced the team to abandon two weeks of work on Keen 7 to focus on what would become Wolfenstein 3D. “It kind of felt [like] that’s where the future was going,” Carmack said in the video. “[We wanted to] “take it to some place that it wouldn’t happen staying in the existing conservative [lane].”

“Within two weeks, [I was up] at one in the morning and I’m just like, ‘Guys, we need to not make this game [Keen],&#39;” Romero told Ars in 2024. “‘This is not the future. The future is getting better at what we just did with Catacomb.’ … And everyone… immediately was like, ‘Yeah, you know, you’re right. That is the new thing, and we haven’t seen it, and we can do it, so why aren’t we doing it?’”

[The original version of this story incorrectly suggested that John and Adrian Carmack were siblings. Ars regrets the error.]</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/streaming-service-crunchyroll-raises-prices-weeks-after-killing-its-free-tier/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Crunchyroll is one of the most popular streaming platforms for anime viewers. Over the past six years, the service has raised prices for fans, and today, it announced that it’s increasing monthly subscription prices by up to 25 percent.

Sony bought Crunchyroll from AT&T in 2020. At the time, Crunchyroll had 3 million paid subscribers and an additional 197 million users with free accounts, which let people watch a limited number of titles with commercials. At the time, Crunchyroll monthly subscription tiers cost $8, $10, or $15.

After its acquisition by Sony, like many large technology companies that buy a smaller, beloved product, the company made controversial changes. The Tokyo-based company folded rival Funimation into Crunchyroll; Sony shut down Funimation, which it bought in 2017, in April 2024.

In the process, Sony erased people’s digital Funimation libraries that Funimation originally marketed as being available “forever, but there are some restrictions.” Sony also reduced the number of free titles on Crunchyroll in 2022 before eliminating the free option completely on December 31, 2025.

Today, Crunchyroll raised prices for its remaining tiers. The cheapest plan, Fan, went from $8 per month to $10 per month. The Mega tier, which allows for streaming from up to four devices simultaneously, went from $12 to $14. The Ultra tier, which supports simultaneous streaming across six devices and includes access to the Crunchyroll Manga app, increased from $16 to $18.

Current subscribers will see the changes after March 4. Crunchyroll is charging new customers the higher prices immediately.

Crunchyroll last increased prices in May 2024, when its Mega tier went from $10 to $12 and its Ultimate tier from $15 to $16. The Fan tier’s last price hike was in 2019.

Crunchyroll said that the higher prices would “give fans more of what they love.” Today’s announcement pointed to “recent and upcoming” changes: teen profiles and PIN protection; multiple profiles; the ability to skip intro theme songs and ending credits; and “expanded device compatibility.”

Crunchyroll’s price hike may further frustrate subscribers, considering that the streaming service recently eliminated its free tier and acquired one of its strongest, and often cheaper, rivals. The result is that Crunchyroll and Netflix have the lion’s share of the anime streaming market. In 2023, Wall Street research firm Bernstein Research reported that Crunchyroll (40 percent) and Netflix (42 percent) controlled 82 percent of the overseas (non-Japanese) anime streaming market.

Anime is an increasingly lucrative opportunity for Sony, and its success so far suggests it won’t stray from its strategy.

From 2012 to 2024, Crunchyroll’s subscriber count grew from 5 million to over 15 million, per Variety. Sony hasn’t shared exact figures but has confirmed that Crunchyroll is profitable. In March, Bernstein Research analysts estimated that Crunchyroll’s profit margin was 8 percent in 2024’s third quarter and that the figure, as Variety put it, would “more than double by 2027.”

Crunchyroll helped offset a 25 percent year-over-year drop in operating income for Sony’s Pictures segment in Sony’s most recent quarterly earnings report. During the quarter, streaming services represented 31 percent of sales for Sony Pictures, outpacing the segment’s theatrical, television, and home entertainment businesses.

The silver lining for anime and streaming viewers is that Crunchyroll is demonstrating that a niche service can scale and profit, and that when it does, it can add new experiences and further interest in its specialty. For its part, Crunchyroll recently relaunched its app for reading digital copies of manga. Crunchyroll shuttered its original Manga app in December 2023. The revived app uses an updated revenue-sharing model that’s said to better benefit publishers.

Still, the changes that Sony makes to media companies it buys are worth scrutiny, especially as it continues acquiring companies. Sony-owned anime production company Aniplex announced that it bought rival Egg Firm today.

As streaming prices rise, industry consolidation is also picking up steam. If more large companies are buying and potentially merging streaming services, it will inevitably impact subscribers’ experiences. For these customers, it can be worrying to consider what changes streaming mergers can bring. While there’s hope for more features and content, there’s also risk for higher prices and fewer options.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Along with being used to generate nonconsensual sexual images of women and girls, spread racist rhetoric, and doxx the home addresses of both celebrities and non-public figures, Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok is struggling to get a grip on reality.

The mercurial billionaire’s social media platform X, which was folded into his AI startup xAI last year — and subsequently acquired by SpaceX this week — has once again been thrust into the center of the ongoing scandal surrounding the Justice Department’s release of millions of files pertaining to its investigation into the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Musk has been in full damage control mode, struggling to reconcile his attempts to downplay his personal relationship with the notorious predator with some damning emails that suggest he was actively trying to invite himself to Epstein’s island in the Caribbean.

Adding to the chaos is Musk’s xAI chatbot Grok, which he’s advertised as “maximally truth-seeking” — but which is instead sowing chaos into the explosive revelations about Epstein.

The result may be one of the most amazing AI responses we’ve ever seen. No, seriously: when a X account asked Grok to calculate the “probability” that New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani is somehow related to Epstein, based on perceived similarities in the shapes of their eyebrows and mouths, the AI chatbot had a downright baffling answer.

The account showed Grok two headshots of the two men side by side, with two arrows pointing to their eyebrows and circles around their respective mouths, as if to suggest they were genetically related. The odd request may have been related to recently released documents implicating Mamdani’s mother, Mira Nair, who attended a 2009 afterparty at the house of convicted sex trafficker and Epstein’s close collaborator Ghislaine Maxwell. However, there’s currently no evidence to suggest that Nair knew about or was involved in any criminal activity.

All that flew far above the AI chatbot’s head, though, as it failed to even accurately identify Mamdani.

“Based on the image, these seem to be [late-night TV host] Jimmy Kimmel (left) and Jeffrey Epstein (right),” the chatbot responded. “They share minor similarities in eyebrow arch and mouth shape, but differences in age, hair, and features are clear.”

Yes, that’s right: the chatbot that Musk has deployed to untold millions of users on X, which now operates as a de facto fact-checking machine used to settle arguments on the chaotic site, can’t even tell the difference between Zohran Mamdani and Jimmy Kimmel, who look nothing alike.

At least it admitted its error — though only after prodding.

“Correction: That’s actually Zohran Mamdani on the left, not Jimmy Kimmel — my bad on the initial ID,” the chatbot conceded. “Similarities in eyebrows and smiles are there, but no known family ties to Epstein. Probability of relation: under one percent based on public info.”

The chatbot’s gaffe shows yet again how even a seemingly straightforward task like identifying a well-known figure, who has been photographed many thousands of times, from a well-lit headshot appears to be beyond the tech’s capabilities — despite xAI pouring billions of dollars into its development.

Coincidentally, Mamdani used his powers as New York City’s mayor to shut down a “functionally unusable” AI chatbot just last week. The chatbot was set up by disgraced former mayor Eric Adams to help small business owners navigate local regulations, costing the administration “around half a million dollars,” per Mamdani. Not unlike Grok, Adams’ chatbot was shown to be incredibly unreliable, often contradicting actual labor law.

            <h2>NASA Runs Into Trouble Fueling Up Moon Rocket</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-03</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Late last month, the four daring NASA astronauts who are scheduled to venture around the Moon and back as part of the agency’s historic Artemis 2 mission entered quarantine.

Their ride, a small Orion capsule mounted atop the agency’s enormous Space Launch System rocket, has already been rolled onto Launch Pad 39B at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

But the agency’s remaining checks ahead of the launch — a gauntlet of tests called the “wet dress rehearsal” that involves running through the full launch sequence without a crew on board — didn’t quite go as planned, forcing the agency to officially push back the launch date from its already ambitious early February timeline.

In an official statement this morning, NASA revealed that we may have to wait another four weeks for humanity’s return to the Moon, with the agency now eyeing a second wet dress rehearsal for “March as the earliest possible launch opportunity.”

The crew is officially released from quarantine, the agency said, as it awaits the next launch window.

It may not be the news we wanted to hear — but at least now, NASA’s Artemis 2 mission won’t have to compete with the Super Bowl and the Winter Olympics for media attention.

According to a February 2 statement, NASA found that the rocket’s core stage had sprung a leak and that efforts to correct it “proved unsuccessful.”

“The leak rate at the interface of the tail service mast umbilical continued to exceed the allowable limits,” the update reads. “Liquid hydrogen filling operations on both the core stage and upper stage are paused as the team meets to determines next steps.”

As a result, the tentative February 8 launch date is no longer on the table.

Fortunately, the leak appeared to be the only major hiccup during this week’s test. NASA engineers “pushed through several challenges during the two-day test and met many of the planned objectives,” according to the agency.

However, teams had to battle the elements, as cold winter temperatures “caused a late start to tanking operations.”

Engineers got to roughly five minutes left in the countdown when the ground launch sequencer noticed a “spike in the liquid hydrogen leak rate,” automatically stopping the countdown as a result.

Besides the hydrogen leak, teams also had to troubleshoot “dropouts of audio communication channels across ground teams in the past few weeks leading up to the test.”

The agency will be holding a press release later today to address the latest developments.

It’s an unfortunate development, forcing us to once again be patient to see humanity’s historic return to the Moon. The next launch dates fall in early March. If NASA misses those dates, it could be pushed back to early or late April, according to Space.com — the month NASA was originally targeting before September 2025, when the launch date was pushed up to February.

            <h2>Democracy Itself Is Falling Apart, Harvard Professor Warns</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the wake of ruthless arrests of journalists Don Lemon and Georgia Fort in Minneapolis, one Harvard political scientist is arguing something many of us have suspected for a long time: the US is moving away from its traditional democratic framework toward a fundamentally different system of governance.

In an interview with the media industry publication Status, Harvard political scientist Steven Levitsky made the case that the Trump administration’s assault on democratic norms has now become extreme, even by the standards of right-wing dictators.

“This is a new dimension,” Levitsky told Status. “In democracies, journalists don’t get arrested. In authoritarian regimes, journalists get arrested.”

Levitsky went so far as to contrast Trump with notorious conservative nationalist Viktor Orbán, the prime minister of Hungary since 2010. Since coming to power, the Hungarian strongman has systematically dismantled the country’s judiciary, as well as its election system by rewriting the constitution. Yet as Levitsky notes, even Orbán has stopped short of the kind of paramilitary street enforcement emerging in the US.

“Orbán doesn’t arrest journalists,” the Harvard academic claimed. “In Hungary if you walk the streets of Budapest or other Hungarian cities, you will not find heavily armed masked men abducting people. That doesn’t happen in Hungary.”

Notwithstanding that Orbán has been criticized for arresting journalists, it’s true that Trump’s attempts to silence the press and embolden armed federal agents speak to an alarming escalation of reactionary policies — especially in a country that fashions itself a global beacon of democracy and freedom.

Still, this moment in US politics doesn’t begin or end with Trump. As University of Tulsa economic historian Clara Mattei has argued, the groundwork for democratic erosion was laid decades ago through neoliberal austerity policies that hollowed out the economic foundations of American democracy.

In Mattei’s analysis, austerity functions as a tool to disempower people, worsening conditions for the majority “to help prevent political action against the system as a whole.” The dictatorial turn we’re seeing today — manifested in the suppression of free speech and rising police state — is the result of decades of policies that already reconfigured who holds power in American society.

“I see austerity fundamentally as one-sided class warfare, led by the state and its economic experts and aimed at refurbishing the capital order in moments when it is crumbling,” Mattei said in a 2023 interview about her book, “The Capital Order.” “As a political project, austerity is in fact the most rational way to safeguard capitalism: it structurally disempowers workers by increasing precariousness and market dependence.”

Indeed, as Levitsky observes, the damage this has done to American democracy may be irreversible.

“Even in the best case, we throw these guys out electorally, I don’t think we’re going to go back,” he told Status. “We’re not going to step back to a democracy with strong constitutional guardrails. The democratic norms have, at this point, been shattered and on the floor, and rules have been violated, twisted, manipulated.”

            <div id="article-text">The digital Beanie Baby has had a rough week.

Last week, whispers of impending crypto regulation sent Bitcoin prices into a nosedive. The preeminent blockchain asset dipped just below $75,000 over the weekend, sending crypto bros into a frenzy. And now, the true believers are now whispering even darker prophecies: the real crash hasn’t even started.

If you take the pseudonymous blockchain influencer Crypto Bitlord’s word for it — and why wouldn’t you? — Bitcoin could fall as far as $30,000 by the time all is said and done.

“The next major support for bitcoin is $30k,” the poster predicted to over 430,000 X-formerly-Twitter followers over the weekend. “Unfortunately.”

That cynical take was echoed by Benjamin Cowen, founder of crypto analytics platform Into The Cryptoverse. “I do think Bitcoin is in fact in a bear market,” Cowen said in a video uploaded to his YouTube channel.

“In terms of cycle length, the length of this cycle was literally the same length as the past two cycles,” he cautioned. “It’s because, simply, the cycle is over, and instead of being in a bull market, we’ve transitioned into a bear market after the cycle has topped.”

This pattern, Cowen notes, pretty faithfully follows the four-year election cycle in the US. In the fourth quarter of 2013, 2017, 2021, and possibly in 2025 — all one year after a presidential election — Bitcoin has consistently peaked before entering a prolonged downturn.

“This is when it always drops,” Cowen said. “It always tops out in the fourth quarter of the post-election year, and why should this time be any different?”

Indeed, for all the rhetoric about decentralized finance and breaking free from traditional markets, it seems Bitcoin keeps dancing to the same tired rhythm. The only question now is how far it’ll fall before the next stream of euphoria hits.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Monday, Elon Musk’s rocket company SpaceX bought his AI firm xAI, whose most notable contribution to humankind has been enabling the mass digital undressing of women and children with its chatbot Grok. The acquisition, according to the New York Times, creates the most valuable private company in the world, with Bloomberg reporting a total valuation of an eye-watering $1.25 trillion.

“SpaceX has acquired xAI to form the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world’s foremost real-time information and free speech platform,” Musk wrote in a memo, as quoted by the NYT.

In a wide-ranging announcement posted by Musk and stuffed with sci-fi rhetoric, the billionaire highlighted the company’s ambition to put orbital data centers in space and waxed philosophical on how this mission would help humanity ascend the Kardashev scale, understand the universe, and “extend the light of consciousness to the stars.”

Musk explained that space-based AI was the “only way to scale” the technology in the long-term because of the vast amounts of solar energy that could be harvested — or, as Musk further expounded, because “space is called ‘space’ for a reason. 😂.” Not one to hedge his ambitions, he also compared his goal of populating the earth’s orbit with AI satellites to building a “sentient sun.”

The acquisition comes after reports that Musk was considering taking SpaceX public at a valuation of $1.5 trillion, which would make it the largest IPO in history. The upward trajectory of the company’s valuation has been notably rapid. Last summer, SpaceX’s private valuation was at $400 billion. In December, it doubled to $800 billion. With talks of an IPO, it nearly doubled yet again. xAI, meanwhile, was last valued at $230 billion.

It remains unclear what SpaceX’s acquisition of xAI could mean for a potential conversion into a publicly traded company, but a Bloomberg source familiar with the acquisition said the company is still expecting to hold the IPO later this year.

The move is also the latest instance of how Musk has been pivoting his businesses towards AI. His social media site X merged with xAI last year, and has become a playground for his notoriously foul-mouthed chatbot Grok, which last month was used to generate tens of thousands of AI nudes of women and children. At his automaker Tesla, Musk has taken a hard turn towards building autonomous AI-powered machines, including humanoid robots and robotaxis — while killing off its flagship cars.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk hasn’t been handling the latest batch of Epstein files well.

After the newly released emails from the Department of Justice revealed that Musk communicated extensively with the deceased sex criminal, the world’s richest man made a bizarre series of desperate-sounding posts on his website X attempting to convince his millions of fans of his innocence.

First, Musk acted like nothing happened. He questionably reshared an AI-generated video of an anime-style child, posted political memes, and spoke of his chatbot Grok’s ability to probe the Universe itself. It was only in an after-midnight tweet that he finally addressed the elephant in the room.

“No one pushed harder than me to have the Epstein files released and I’m glad that has finally happened,” Musk wrote. “I had very little correspondence with Epstein and declined repeated invitations to go to his island or fly on his ‘Lolita Express’, but was well aware that some email correspondence with him could be misinterpreted and used by detractors to smear my name.”

It’s true that Musk did push for the release of the Epstein files, and even fell out with president Donald Trump over the issue. But the emails clearly show that Musk was, at least at some point, in regular correspondence with Epstein. And not only did he accept Epstein’s invitations on numerous occasions, but sometimes even asked to be invited. He also asked about parties. “What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?” Musk emailed Epstein in 2012.

The desperation only got more palpable as the posts went on. Musk responded to a screenshot of news headlines about his newly revealed ties to Epstein — none of which were all that sensationalized — with his favorite refrain that “Legacy media lies relentlessly.”

But as his replies continued to fill up with screenshots of the emails, Musk tried a new defense: that he was so good with “young women” that he had no reason to solicit the services of the billionaire child sex offender.

“If I actually wanted to spend my time partying with young women, it would be trivial for me to do so without the help of a creepy loser like Epstein,” Musk fumed, before boasting about his incredible mental capacity. “And I would still have 99% of my mind available to think about other things. But I don’t.” (X users pointed out a tweet Musk made in 2022 lamenting that he hadn’t “had sex in ages (sigh).”)

The post, puzzlingly, was made in reply to Grok. Musk was arguing not with his own critics, but his AI chatbot that’s notorious for being closely aligned with his personal views.

He has also tried to draw attention to other tech figures who were in the Epstein files to distract from himself.

At no point, though, did he address why he was emailing Epstein years after he was first convicted of sex crimes against underage girls in 2008.

Now is a good time to note that long before his Epstein ties came to light, Musk has had a long track record of creepy behavior. Having fathered at least 14 children with at least four different mothers, Musk reportedly goes around asking a lot of women, some of them his own employees, to receive his sperm and secretly have his babies. He has also been accused of sexual harassment at his companies, facing several lawsuits. In 2022, he reportedly paid $250,000 in hush money to a flight attendant who accused Musk of groping her and exposing his genitals. More recently, Musk came under fire last month after Grok was used to generate tens of thousands of nonconsensual and probably illegal AI nudes of women and children — something Musk called “way funnier” than other AI trends.

Needless to say, Musk probably isn’t finding a lot of humor in this latest controversy of his. But because he’s such an exceptional human, he says, he’s willing to endure all the slander for the greater good.

“The strong must protect those cannot protect themselves, especially vulnerable children,” Musk wrote on Sunday. “I will gladly accept any amount of future pain to do more to protect kids and give them a chance to grow up and have happy lives.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A growing number of people are asking OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other LLMs about their health, often discovering that the chatbots provide remarkably useful medical insights.

KJ Dhaliwal (pictured left), who in 2019 sold the South Asian dating app Dil Mil for $50 million, says he has been thinking about the inefficiencies of the U.S. healthcare system ever since he was a child acting as a medical translator for his parents, and he saw the advent of LLMs as an opportunity to do something about it.

In May 2024, he launched Lotus Health AI, a free primary care provider that’s available 24/7 in 50 languages. On Tuesday, Lotus announced it raised $35 million in a Series A round co-led by CRV and Kleiner Perkins, bringing its total funding to $41 million.

People are already consulting AI about their health, but Lotus goes a step further: it moves beyond those chats to facilitate actual medical care, including diagnosis, prescriptions, and specialist referrals.

In essence, Lotus is building an AI doctor that functions like a real medical practice, equipped with a license to operate in all 50 states, malpractice insurance, HIPAA-compliant systems, and full access to patient records.

The key difference is that the majority of the work is done by AI, which is trained to ask the same questions a doctor would.

Since AI models are also prone to hallucinations, the company always has board-certified human doctors from top health institutions such as Stanford, Harvard, and UCSF review the final diagnoses, lab orders and medical prescriptions.

Lotus has developed an AI model that, similar to OpenEvidence, synthesizes the latest evidence-based research with a patient’s history and clinical answers to generate a treatment plan.

“AI is giving the advice, but the real doctors are actually signing off on it,” Dhaliwal told TechCrunch.

Lotus recognizes the limits of virtual care. For urgent health issues, Lotus directs patients to the nearest urgent care center or emergency room. And if a case requires a physical examination, the platform refers the patient to an in-person physician, Dhaliwal said.

Outsourcing such a significant portion of medical decision-making to AI is an ambitious bet given the regulatory hurdles in healthcare. For instance, physicians are restricted to seeing patients only in the states where they hold a license.

As CRV general partner Saar Gur, who led the deal and joined the company’s board, put it: “There are many challenges, but it’s not SpaceX sending astronauts to the moon.”

Gur (pictured right), an early investor in DoorDash, Mercury, and Ring, is convinced that the telemedicine frameworks established during the pandemic, combined with recent breakthroughs in AI, allow Lotus to navigate many of the existing regulatory and engineering hurdles.

“It’s a big swing,” Gur said. But for an investor like Gur, that’s the draw: Lotus is attempting to fundamentally reimagine the entire primary care model.

At a time when primary care doctors are in short supply, Lotus claims it can see 10 times as many patients as a traditional practice, even when it limits each visit to 15 minutes.

The startup isn’t the only one building an AI doctor. Lightspeed-backed Doctronic is one of the competitors.  Lotus is differentiating itself—at least for now—by offering its entire suite of care completely free of charge

Dhaliwal said that eventual business models may include sponsored content or subscriptions, but the current focus remains entirely on product development and attracting patients rather than revenue.

            <div id="article-text">French police and Europol searched the local office of X, the Paris prosecutor’s office announced on Tuesday.

The raid is part of an ongoing investigation launched in 2025 on allegations of “fraudulent extraction of data” of an automated data processing system “by an organized group.”

French prosecutors’ cybercrime unit said the investigation has now been expanded to cover other alleged crimes, including: complicity in possession and distribution of child sexual abuse material; privacy violations; and Holocaust denial.

The expansion of the investigation comes as X and its owner Elon Musk faces widespread criticism for allowing its Grok AI to be used to generate non-consensual imagery, including child abuse imagery, of other people on its platform.

Musk, who bought X (previously Twitter) in 2022, and former X chief executive Linda Yaccarino were summoned for questioning on April 20. Unnamed X staffers were also summoned for the same week, per the prosecutor’s announcement.

X and spokespeople for eMed, where Yaccarino is now the chief executive, did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.

When reached for comment, Maylis De Roeck, a spokesperson for the Paris prosecutor’s office, confirmed the raid in a statement. “The Public Prosecutor’s Office’s objective is ultimately to ensure platform X’s compliance with French law, given that it operates within the national territory,” the statement read.

            <div id="article-text">The Trump administration’s approach to immigration has reached a level of violence that the tech industry cannot ignore. In 2026 so far, federal immigration agents have killed at least eight people, including at least two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis — Renee Good and Alex Pretti. As immigration enforcement has grown more extreme — even detaining school children seeking legal asylum — tech workers have called on their leaders to speak up.

The tech industry has always been entwined in politics. Companies like Palantir, Clearview AI, Flock, and Paragon are contracted by U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement and assist in the agency’s crackdowns. But as President Trump took office last year, his industry connections have grown. Elon Musk ran a government agency for months, and prolific Silicon Valley investor David Sacks is leading an advisory board on technology for the president. The CEOs behind some of the largest companies in the country — like Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, Apple’s Tim Cook, and Google’s Sundar Pichai — had prime seats at Trump’s inauguration and have remained allied with him.

“We know our industry leaders have leverage: in October, they persuaded Trump to call off a planned ICE surge in San Francisco,” ICEout.tech, a group of tech industry workers opposing ICE, wrote in a statement on January 24, the day of ICU nurse Alex Pretti’s death. “Big tech CEOs are in the White House tonight,” the statement added, referring to a screening of a documentary about Melania Trump where Cook, Amazon’s Andy Jassy, and Zoom’s Eric Yuan were in attendance. “Now they need to go further, and join us in demanding ICE out of all of our cities.”

Some of tech’s biggest players have since spoken out, to mixed reception from their employees and the industry. Below, we are keeping an ongoing list of what tech leaders have had to say.

LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, a major Democratic donor, published an editorial in the San Francisco Standard on January 29, calling on Silicon Valley to stop trying to be neutral in the wake of the Minnesota killings.

“We in Silicon Valley can’t bend the knee to Trump,” Hoffman wrote. “We can’t shrink away and just hope the crisis will fade. We know now that hope without action is not a strategy — it’s an invitation for Trump to trample whatever he can see, including our own business and security interests.”

He said he’s been encouraged to see more tech leaders speaking out, saying: “it’s a good start to something America needs much more of right now.”

“Whichever candidates you may have supported in the past — or even if (like many of my friends in Silicon Valley) you don’t usually do politics — you almost surely did not want this,” he wrote.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had publicly opposed Trump’s policies during his first term, but has changed his tune in the new administration as his company has struck deals to develop AI infrastructure for the U.S. government, including the gargantuan $500 billion Stargate project.

In the days following Pretti’s death, Altman addressed OpenAI staff in an internal Slack message, which was reported by The New York Times.

“What’s happening with ICE is going too far. There is a big difference between deporting violent criminals and what’s happening now, and we need to get the distinction right,” he said. “President Trump is a very strong leader, and I hope he will rise to this moment and unite the country.”

Altman added, “We didn’t become super woke when that was popular, we didn’t start talking about masculine corporate energy when that was popular, and we are not going to make a lot of performative statements now about safety or politics or anything else. But we are going to continue to try to figure out how to actually do the right thing as best as we can.”

In an NBC interview, anchor Tom Llamas asked Dario Amodei about his views on defense in relation to current events. The anchor pointed out that Anthropic has a contract with the U.S. Department of Defense, and that it has partnered with Palantir — which has supplied technology to ICE — on projects for that agency.

First, Amodei reaffirmed that Anthropic does not have any contracts with ICE, despite its relationship with the Defense Department, and emphasized his concern about “the need to protect democracies against autocracies” like China and Russia.

“I’m a big believer in, carefully, with guardrails, arming democracies to defend against these countries,” Amodei said, adding that these values persist in the context of internal American politics.

“We need to be really careful about making sure democracies are worth defending. We need to defend our own democratic values at home,” he said. “I believe some of the things we’ve seen in the last few days concern me about that.”

He also mentioned ICE’s raids in Minneapolis in a post on X, where he referred to “the horror we’re seeing in Minnesota.”

Apple’s CEO addressed staff in an internal memo on January 27:

“This is a time for deescalation,” Cook said. He later added, “I had a good conversation with the president this week where I shared my views, and I appreciate his openness to engaging on issues that matter to us all.”

Like the tech industry workers behind ICEout.tech, Signal President Meredith Whittaker has been outspoken about the role tech leaders have in social justice.

“I want everyone in tech who’s ever intoned about freedom, or their love of privacy, or their commitment to liberty, to join me in an unequivocal condemnation,” Whittaker wrote on X.

In another post, she said, “Masked agents of the US state are executing people in the streets and powerful leaders are openly lying to cover for them. To everyone in my industry who’s ever claimed to value freedom—draw on the courage of your convictions and stand up.”

As an end-to-end-encrypted messaging app, Signal is often used by activists to organize community actions.

The leader of the online publishing platform Medium, Tony Stubblebine posted screenshots on Threads of a message he shared with staff in which he explains his reasoning for allowing employees to take part in a nationwide general strike if they so choose, though he clarified that he is “not in the business of dictating people’s politics.”

“I started the week in my own head and heart over what I was seeing in Minneapolis and really struggling with the idea that those two murders were just the tip of the iceberg of wrongs,” Stubblebine wrote.

In the memo, he writes about the difficulty of navigating his role as a tech CEO during this time, saying that it feels “awkward to navigate being both on-mission and on-money.” He added that he is thinking about the company’s “responsibility to make [its] stance clear, especially as many other tech orgs are donating to the Trump campaign and supporting the current administration’s agenda.”

Stubblebine also pointed out that Medium’s approach to its role as a web publisher reflects the greater values of the company — “for example, that we don’t allow things like hateful content or racist slurs on Medium.”

Jeff Dean has spoken out about his reaction to the killings in Minnesota.

“This is absolutely shameful,” Dean wrote on X, responding to a video of federal agents shooting Alex Pretti. “Agents of a federal agency unnecessarily escalating, and then executing a defenseless citizen whose offense appears to be using his cell phone camera. Every person regardless of political affiliation should be denouncing this.”

James Dyett posted on X about what he sees as hypocrisy in the tech industry.

“There is far more outrage from tech leaders over a wealth tax than masked ICE agents terrorizing communities and executing civilians in the streets,” Dyett said. “Tells you what you need to know about the values of our industry.”

While Khosla Ventures partner Keith Rabois has publicly expressed support for ICE and the Trump administration’s practices, others at the firm have publicly opposed these views.

Rabois made incendiary comments on X after border patrol agents killed ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, prompting one founder to respond that that if he were a founder in Khosla Ventures’ portfolio, he would give the money back, calling Rabois “an embarrassment.”

Ethan Choi, another partner at Khosla Ventures, responded to the post to clarify that not everyone at the firm agrees with Rabois’ views. “I want to make it clear that Keith doesn’t represent everyone’s views here at [Khosla Ventures], at least not mine,” Choi wrote, adding: “What happened in Minnesota is plain wrong. Don’t know how you could really see it differently. Sad to see a person’s life taken unnecessarily.”

Vinod Khosla, the firm’s founder, reposted Choi’s message and called the federal agents “macho ICE vigilantes running amuck empowered by a conscious-less administration.”

“The video was sickening to watch and the storytelling without facts or with invented fictitious facts by authorities almost unimaginable in a civilized society,” Khosla wrote. “ICE personnel must have ice water running thru their veins to treat other human beings this way. There is politics but humanity should transcend that.”

Khosla also posted on X that he agrees with Hoffman, the LinkedIn co-founder, that more tech executives should speak out against the Trump administration.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/03/tiktok-recovers-from-dip-in-usage-that-benefited-rival-apps-following-u-s-ownership-change/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">TikTok has largely recovered from a slight dip in active users in the days following its ownership change, when a group of American investors took control of the video app’s operations in the United States. The decline, though brief, benefited competing video apps like UpScrolled and Skylight Social, which saw rapid user adoption as some looked for TikTok alternatives.

According to estimates from digital market intelligence firm Similarweb, TikTok saw usage dip into the range of 86-88 million daily active users in the U.S. immediately after the ownership change. That compares with a typical average of 92 million daily active users.

The app has bounced back to more than 90 million daily active users, indicating that many who left TikTok have since returned.

As TikTok saw a small dip in usage, alternative video-sharing apps UpScrolled and Skylight Social began growing quickly. Although only a tiny fraction of TikTok’s size, UpScrolled topped 138,500 daily active users at its peak on January 28; it has now dropped back down to 68,000.

Meanwhile, Skylight Social hit 81,200 daily active users, according to Similarweb’s estimates and has since dropped to 56,300 daily active users. Overall, Skylight Social saw its user sign-ups increase to 380,000 as of late January, the company told TechCrunch.

TikTok’s usage decline, which prompted some to try the new apps, wasn’t driven by the ownership change directly, but rather by how users feared it would impact their TikTok experience. There were growing concerns about TikTok’s updated privacy policy, which gave the app permission to track users’ precise GPS location. (This addition could be related to TikTok’s tests of a “Nearby” feed to show users videos from local creators, but was added to the policy alongside the change in ownership, leading to user backlash over privacy concerns.)

When reading the privacy policy anew, some users also discovered disturbing language, like how TikTok said it may collect users’ “immigration status,” among other personal data. However, this turned out to be a reference that was included because of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which requires businesses to inform consumers if they collect certain sensitive data. TikTok does that — in the sense that anything someone shares on the platform in their video content technically becomes part of the platform, so it requires disclosure.

In addition, TikTok experienced an unfortunately timed, multi-day data center outage, which caused the app to not function properly, sometimes breaking search, likes, and comments, causing video glitches, disrupting the algorithm, and creating issues with the in-app chat. Users believed these glitches meant TikTok was now censoring their content, which sent them looking for alternatives.

The company announced on Sunday evening that the data center outage was resolved, chalking it up to a winter-storm-driven power outage.

As users made peace with the new terms and conditions and the outage-driven issues were resolved, users returned to the platform, Similarweb’s data shows. But there’s still hope for the newcomers, as the firm notes that TikTok’s usage has been slowly declining over the latter part of 2025, when usage peaked at 100 million daily active users from July to October 2025, compared with the 90+ million seen now.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Fitbit founders James Park and Eric Friedman have announced the launch of a new AI startup called Luffu that aims to help families proactively monitor their health. The duo are developing an “intelligent family care system” that will start with an app experience and then expand into hardware devices.

Two years after their exit from Google, Park and Friedman are betting on AI to help lighten the mental burden of caregiving. According to a recent report, 63 million, or nearly 1 in 4, U.S. adults are family caregivers, up 45% from 10 years ago.

Luffu uses AI in the background to gather and organize family information, learn day-to-day patterns, and flag notable changes so families can stay aligned and address potential well-being issues.

“At Fitbit, we focused on personal health—but after Fitbit, health for me became bigger than just thinking about myself,” Park said in a press release. “I was caring for my parents from across the country, trying to piece together my mom’s health care across various portals and providers, with a language barrier that made it hard to get complete, timely context from her about doctor visits. I didn’t want to constantly check in, and she didn’t want to feel monitored. Luffu is the product we wished existed—to stay on top of our family’s health, know what changed and when to step in—without hovering.”

The pair note that today’s consumer health market is filled with tools for individuals, but that real life health is shared across partners, kids, parents, pets, and caregivers. Family information is scattered across devices, portals, calendars, attachments, spreadsheets, and paper documents.

With Luffu, people will be able to track the whole family’s details, including health stats, diet, medications, symptoms, lab tests, doctor visits, and more. Users can log health information using voice, text, or photos. Luffu proactively watches for changes, and surfaces insights and alerts, such as unusual vitals or changes in sleep.

The pair told Axios that people can ask questions using plain language to ask about their family’s health, such as “Is Dad’s new meal plan affecting his blood pressure?” or “Did someone give the dog his medication?”

“We designed Luffu to capture the details as life happens, keep family members updated and surface what matters at the right time—so caregiving feels more coordinated and less chaotic,” Friedman said in the press release.

People who are interested in Luffu can join the waitlist for the limited public beta.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">PayPal said on Tuesday it is hiring HP’s Enrique Lores as its CEO and president, replacing current chief executive Alex Chriss. Lores, who has been the chair of PayPal’s board since July 2024, will also take up the role of president.

PayPal said the appointment was made because the company’s pace of change and execution was “not in line with the Board’s expectations” given broader market trends.

Chriss joined PayPal in September 2023 from Intuit, succeeding Dan Schulman. PayPal’s CFO and COO, Jamie Miller, will take over as interim CEO until Lores joins the company.

The appointment comes as PayPal on Tuesday reported lower than expected revenue and profit in the fourth quarter, as consumer spending dipped amid a broader cost of living crisis and a softening labor market. The company also forecast a dip in its full-year profit, which surprised investors, as Wall Street had broadly expected the company to forecast growth instead.

PayPal’s shares were down about 17.9% in premarket trading on Tuesday.

Lores, who served as president and CEO of HP for over six years, said that apart from product innovation, PayPal will hold itself accountable for delivering quarterly accounts.

“The payments industry is changing faster than ever, driven by new technologies, evolving regulations, an increasingly competitive landscape, and the rapid acceleration of AI that is reshaping commerce daily. PayPal sits at the center of this change, and I look forward to leading the team to accelerate the delivery of new innovations and to shape the future of digital payments and commerce,” Lores said in a statement.

Gregory Bovino, the man who became the face of Donald Trump’s Minneapolis crackdown, lost his job as the Border Patrol’s “commander at large” after agents he oversaw shot and killed Alex Pretti. Bovino also reportedly lost his X account, a development that may seem trivial until you remember: Bovino loves to post.

In the two days after Pretti died, Bovino relentlessly trolled Democrats who condemned the shooting—and defended Border Patrol agents as the real victims. When Representative Eric Swalwell wrote on X that ICE officers should walk off the job to protest the killing, Bovino replied: “I was thinking the same for you.” At about 1 a.m. last Monday, Bovino replied to a user who said he would “never pay for a beer again” after mocking Swalwell: “Lol!!  🍺 🍻 🍺 🍻 🍺 🍻.”

Getting silenced on X is, and I realize how absurd it sounds, the worst professional fate a Trump official can face. It signals that Bovino is no longer a player in an administration that has, from top to bottom, merged a social-media-first worldview with authoritarian tendencies. I like to call it the clicktatorship. Political appointees in the clicktatorship are not just using online platforms as a mode of communication. Their judgment and decision making are hyper-responsive to what’s happening on the far-right internet. They view everything as content.

No one better exemplifies the clicktatorship than the president himself. Trump routinely makes policy announcements via social media. Consider when, in August, he attempted to fire the Federal Reserve Board member Lisa Cook on Truth Social. When a government lawyer was questioned by the Supreme Court on the lack of an appeals option for Cook, he suggested that Cook could simply have made her case on Truth Social. In the clicktatorship, due process is reduced to the right to post.

You can see it everywhere. The administration’s official social-media feeds pump out far-right xenophobic memes and celebrate deportations with ASMR videos of undocumented immigrants in shackles. Just days before the killing of Pretti, the White House posted an image of a woman who was arrested after a protest at a church in Minnesota. It had been edited, presumably using generative AI, to show the arrestee as weeping uncontrollably. The effect is to reinforce an impression of dominance and control. Truth matters less than attention. Reporters who pointed out the manipulation were mocked by a White House spokesperson, who posted: “uM, eXCuSe mE??? iS tHAt DiGiTAlLy AlTeReD?!?!?!?!?!” (“The success of the White House’s social media pages speak for itself,” Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, told me in an email. “Through engaging posts and banger memes, we are successfully communicating the President’s extremely popular agenda.”)

Aspects of the clicktatorship existed during Trump’s first term, when the president used Twitter as a bully pulpit. But it has ratcheted up to new levels in his second go-round. His appointees are more likely to be keyboard warriors. They are obsessed with spectacle, and every government decision presents a potential opportunity to own the libs. Our government lost 10,000 STEM Ph.D.s last year, but seemingly has more posters than ever.

Consider Dan Bongino, who jumped from hosting a podcast to becoming deputy director of the FBI. (Bongino recently stepped down and returned to podcasting.) Or Harmeet Dhillon, who was a paid X influencer on top of her day job as a lawyer before becoming the head of civil rights at the Department of Justice. She continues to post up to a hundred times a day, between her personal and professional X accounts. “I’ve been stuck at the same level of followers on this account pretty much since I started my government job,” she wrote on X last month. What, am I chopped liver over here? What kind of content do my folks want to see more of to like and share?” And after the Venezuela raid in early January, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was photographed at a makeshift command center in Mar-a-Lago. Behind him was a screen displaying X posts.

Read: Everything reacting to everything, all at once

Poster brain and authoritarianism reinforce each other: They thrive on conspiracy theories, lack all restraint, and jump to extreme solutions. Trump officials pointed to claims about welfare fraud from the social-media influencer Nick Shirley to justify cutting off billions in aid to five Democrat-led states. And Trump-administration officials pointed to Shirley’s viral video in attempting to justify a crackdown in Minnesota that has now resulted in the death of two American citizens. Meanwhile, government budget proposals and strategy documents now read like Truth Social posts, replete with online tropes. The White House website now alleges that President Obama hosted terrorists, speculates that Hunter Biden had cocaine in the White House, and says that “it was the Democrats who staged the real insurrection” on January 6, 2021.

Social media and authoritarian regimes have one other negative tendency in common: They feed information bubbles. Online, people select into circles of those they already agree with. In nondemocratic regimes, senior officials wall themselves off from reality because their underlings are afraid to deliver bad news. In both cases, the bubbles encourage radical actions rather than compromise—doubling down rather than moderation.

But the thing about bubbles is that sooner or later they burst. The Trump administration maintained a unified front after the killing of Renee Good, arguing that agents were acting in self-defense, even when video evidence complicated that version of events. Many members of the administration attempted to follow the same playbook after federal officials killed Pretti. But the fiction has not held up. The people who put their bodies on the line to record what was happening in Minneapolis revealed a valuable truth. The same tool that makes clicktatorship possible—the smartphone—can also be used against it.</div>

            <div id="article-text">The librarian sat me in front of a microfilm reader and brought out roll after roll of film. I stayed there for hours, squinting to decipher the archaic handwriting in the Free Negro Book, which was published annually in South Carolina before the Civil War.

The names in each year’s edition were alphabetized, but only roughly—all of the surnames starting with A came before all of the surnames starting with B, but Agee might come before Anderson, or it might come after.

I began with the 1848 edition, but there was no listing for a Henry Fordham. The same was true of the book for 1849. Same for 1850. But as I slowly made my way through the F section of the 1851 edition, I let out a shout that shattered the library’s decorous hush: “Yesssss!” Then, quickly, to the startled patrons and librarians: “I’m so sorry, excuse me, I’m so sorry.” And then, more softly: “Yes.”

On March 27, 1829, a wealthy white planter and businessman named Richard Fordham purchased four enslaved African Americans from a woman named Isabella Perman. One of them was my great-great-grandfather, a boy called Harry.

This transaction took place in Charleston, the port of entry for an estimated 40 percent of all enslaved Africans brought to toil in this country. A document recording the sale was filed with the South Carolina secretary of state several days later, on April 7. It does not say where in Charleston the sale took place—on the steps of the Old Exchange and Provost Dungeon, perhaps, or at the Cooper River docks, or in one of the thriving markets where people were bought and sold. The individuals bought by Fordham are listed as “a Negro boy named Harry and a Negro woman named Jenny and her two children named Hager and Margaret.” For the lot, Fordham paid $1,080.

Harry, whose proper name was Henry, spent 19 years as Fordham’s chattel. The young man proved to be quick of mind and good with his hands: He mastered the art of blacksmithing at the Chalmers Street Forge, which Fordham co-owned. Henry’s skills eventually made him Fordham’s de facto right-hand man at the forge. On July 10, 1848, Fordham sold “a Negro man named Henry” to Otis Mills and Co., a grain-wholesaling business with multiple warehouses near the Cooper River docks. The sale was recorded with the secretary of state seven days later. The company’s eponymous founder, one of Charleston’s richest men, went on to build the city’s most luxurious hotel, the Mills House. The price he paid for my great-great-grandfather was $2,000, a lot of money for a single Black man.

According to family lore, Henry had somehow circumvented the state’s strict law against educating the enslaved and become literate. He had also become deeply religious. Not only had he learned to read the Gospel of Jesus Christ; he’d also heard the call to preach it.

A few years after being acquired by Mills, Henry Fordham was purchased one final time—by himself, when he bought his freedom.

I’ve always known, through my family’s rich oral history, that my extraordinary great-great-grandfather obtained his liberty at some point before the Civil War. For a long time, however, my attempts to find out exactly when and how he cast off his chains ran into dead ends.

When I was growing up, it never occurred to me to go looking for my family’s history. It was already right there, all around me. My sister, Ellen, and I were born and raised in Orangeburg, 75 miles northwest of Charleston, in the house that Henry Fordham’s son—a formidable man named John Hammond Fordham—built for his family in 1903. Anchoring the corner of Boulevard and Oak Streets, the house is a characteristically southern structure—one and a half stories, with white wooden siding, two graceful bay windows, four dormers poking through the roof, and a wide wraparound front porch that serves as an auxiliary living room during the hot months.

We knew that important family talismans lay in a big, black safe that John Hammond Fordham kept in the main bedroom. It looked like a cartoon safe, the kind that the Road Runner used to drop on Wile E. Coyote’s head, and it was incredibly heavy, which is probably why it still sits there today.

When I was growing up, the safe was always closed but never locked. I was curious about everything, and so sometimes, while my grandmother was busy in the kitchen, I would peek inside. But the old, yellowed papers that I found didn’t mean anything special to me.

Once I became a journalist, I realized that my family’s house, documents, photographs, and oral history constituted an extremely rare gift. All of that material told an important story; I didn’t know what it was, but I had the sense that I was destined to find and share it. Life and career had a way of intervening, however, and for decades I put off the exploration of my family’s past.

I returned to those annals in earnest when I realized two things: First, that my family’s history vividly traced the repeated cycles in which African Americans win a greater measure of opportunity, only to have much or all of it taken away again. With the materials in my house and a bit of research—a lot of research, as it turned out—I could show this pattern in action, over two centuries. Second, I saw that our history is every African American’s history. Through slavery and emancipation, Jim Crow and civil rights, war and peace, all that Black Americans have ever wanted is a fair chance to pursue the American dream.

Family lore said that Henry may have arrived in Charleston from Barbados, one of the British islands in the Caribbean where Africans were “seasoned”—conditioned to the lash—in the sugarcane fields. When my wife, Avis, and I went on vacation to Barbados in 1996, I decided to look for traces of my family in the National Archives. We drove around for quite a while—on the wrong side of the road—until we found the place, which I remember as a graceful old building filled with natural light.

In a big reading room, we sat at a long table while helpful staff members, accustomed to visits from Americans seeking their roots, brought out materials they thought might help us with our search. A day of poring over records, however, gave up nothing more than hints and shadows. Discouraged, we went back to our hotel and I called Aunt Grace—actually one of my mother’s many first cousins—who was the family’s chief genealogist.

I had been looking for records of slave owners named Fordham, but she explained that the name hadn’t attached itself to our family until after Henry’s 1829 sale to Richard Fordham. Instead, she said, I should look for a Black woman named Jenny—the “Negro woman” who was sold at the same time as Henry. Jenny’s previous owner, Isabella Perman, had the maiden name Fell. So I should look for a woman named Jenny who had some connection with those two surnames.

We returned to the archives, and a senior researcher named Shirley Archer helped us renew our quest, bringing out reels of microfilm and precious old ledger books recording births, baptisms, and deaths. We finally found a family named Fell that had lived in Barbados in the early 19th century, in St. Philip Parish. We also found a family in the same parish named Perreman—pretty close to Perman. And we found that on November 27, 1793, an enslaved adult named Kitty Fell was baptized at St. Philip’s Church. She would have been the right age, I thought, to be Jenny’s mother.

But we could find no record of Kitty having a daughter, and no record of Kitty being sold away to Charleston. We had bits and pieces that might fit together, but we couldn’t figure out how. English planters in the Caribbean kept meticulous records of the horses they bred and raced, but they couldn’t be bothered to keep even rudimentary family histories of the human beings they claimed to own.

It was Aunt Grace who learned that Henry Fordham had been sold to Otis Mills in 1848. And I knew Henry had been free before the Civil War and emancipation, because I found his name in the 1861 Charleston city census, appended with the notation f.p.c.—“free person of color.” By then, I reasoned, he must have been a free man for some time, because the census showed that he already owned two wood-framed houses in the city. It must have taken him at least a few years to accumulate such assets.

But exactly when, in that 13-year gap between his last sale and his first appearance in the census, had he become free? I examined real-estate records, scoured the family Bible, searched archives in reading rooms and digital databases, looked everywhere I could think of—and didn’t find a clue. By the 19th century, manumission was essentially illegal in South Carolina, which did not entirely end the practice, but it meant there would be no official document recording the moment of Henry Fordham’s freedom in the secretary of state’s archives.

The South Carolina Historical Society, a private institution founded in 1855, is the first stop for researchers seeking information about the antebellum period. I visited its grand neoclassical headquarters on Charleston’s main thoroughfare, Meeting Street, several times over the years to look for anything about my great-great-grandfather that might pin down the date of his freedom. No luck.

In 2014, the society’s collection was moved across town to the College of Charleston so that the archives’ original home—a landmark 1826 structure known as the Fireproof Building—could be turned into a museum. Slowly, more records were digitized, or at least preserved on microfilm. In February 2023, I visited the collection at its present location, a hushed sanctum on the second floor of the college’s Addlestone Library, in the hopes that more of the hit-or-miss manumission records from Henry Fordham’s time might have been cataloged and made accessible.

I was overjoyed when the librarians found a folder labeled with Henry Fordham’s name—but then immediately deflated when they brought it out, because I saw that it contained only a long, speculative, and largely inaccurate account of Henry’s life, compiled by a distant relative whom I’d never met. I was already familiar with that document, and I knew it said nothing about when Henry had liberated himself.

Finally, one of the librarians suggested that I look through editions of Charleston’s Free Negro Book. I’d had no idea that such a thing existed: a yearly list of free African Americans residing in the city who had paid the state’s poll tax. It was an exercise in data collection born of paranoia. The fact that Black people outnumbered white people in South Carolina during the decades before the Civil War meant that white officials lived in constant fear of a Haiti-style Black uprising. Free African Americans were a tiny minority—more than 95 percent of Black people in the state were enslaved—but it seemed to make sense that any rebellion would be led by conspirators with independent resources and the liberty of unsupervised movement. White southerners took great pains to keep track of men and women like Henry Fordham.

I doubt I will ever be able to find out the month and the day my great-great-grandfather became free. But I can be quite sure that he was still enslaved when free African Americans were counted in 1850—and that he had become a proud, free Black man by the time the Free Negro Book was compiled in 1851.

Even after solving this mystery, I never stopped wondering about my deeper history, before the time of Henry Fordham. Who was my first African ancestor to set shackled foot on this continent? He or she had a name. He or she had a clan, a language, a culture, a faith. All of this history is forever gone.

There was nothing at all inadvertent about its disappearance. It was stolen. Slave owners in the English colonies of the New World went to great lengths to sever any ties that their captives had with the past and with one another. Enslavers’ fortunes and lives depended on being able to control the able-bodied Black men and women who outnumbered them—20, 40, 60 Black bodies crammed into slave shacks, versus maybe a dozen white family members in the big house. Our captors could not allow us to feel confident in the strength of our numbers. They wanted us to feel powerless, ungrounded, disconnected, and thus easier to dominate.

From the December 2023 issue: Lonnie G. Bunch III asks why America is afraid of Black history

I feel the absence of my deep, pre-American history. I feel it the way an amputee suffers phantom pain in a missing limb. I keep looking for what was stolen from me. And occasionally I glimpse what might be fragments of it.

When I was little, among the out-of-town visitors who would occasionally drop by to visit my grandmother and great-aunt were two women from Charleston. I don’t remember their names. What got my attention was that they spoke to each other in an incomprehensible, rapid-fire patois that definitely wasn’t English. I learned they had been speaking Gullah (also called Geechee), a creole language based on English but laden with a hodgepodge of West African vocabulary, grammar, and syntax.

Gullah is possibly a corruption of Angola, a region from which many Africans were seized. Or it might refer to the Gola people, an ethnic group living on land that is now in Liberia and Sierra Leone. If you have ever referred to peanuts as “goobers,” you are using a Gullah word that comes from the Kikongo term for “peanut,” nguba. On the islands around Charleston—including Daniel Island, where Richard Fordham had his plantation and my great-great-grandfather grew into manhood—Gullah evolved as a lingua franca that allowed enslaved Africans from different cultures and language groups to communicate. Henry almost surely would have understood every word those women who visited were saying.

Somewhere in Africa there is a city, town, or village where Henry Fordham’s progenitors lived and died for hundreds or thousands of years, where my distant relatives walk the streets today. That place exists, and I know I will never find it. Still, I can get closer than was possible even a few years ago, thanks to DNA testing.

In 2022, I mailed away a saliva sample and waited, with no real expectation of an aha moment. When the results came back, I learned that 34 percent of my DNA comes from Nigeria, 20 percent from Mali, and another 26 percent from other places up and down the west coast of Africa. That doesn’t depart from what I’d have predicted, and it doesn’t narrow things down meaningfully.

Read: 300 million letters of DNA are missing from the human genome

The remaining 20 percent of my DNA comes mostly from Germany, with a small contribution from the British Isles—again, no surprise. The fact that part of my genetic inheritance comes from Europe makes me like most Black Americans: According to a 2010 study, “an African American individual in the United States has, on average, about 75–80 percent West African ancestry and about 20–25 percent European ancestry.”

Someday, perhaps, the collective human genome will be sufficiently mapped to trace my DNA to a specific Nigerian village or English hamlet. But the truth is that race has never been a biological fact. It has always been a social construct, which allowed the powerful to justify exploitation of the powerless. The elaborate fiction of race gave Richard Fordham the “right” to purchase my great-great-grandfather, and required Henry Fordham to purchase his own freedom. And it is race and racism that have kept me from knowing the names, let alone the hopes and dreams, of Henry’s predecessors in my American history. So I begin with him.

            <div id="article-text">When life gets really hectic, sitting quietly with a book can feel like an impossible luxury. And when does a smartphone-mediated world feel less than hectic? Any shred of free time is too easy to fill with more work, more worrying, more commitments, and, of course, more aimless scrolling. If you really want to get any reading done, you may have to turn it into another task on the to-do list. This doesn’t require strict goals or reading challenges (unless that suits you). All you need is a willingness to dedicate a few minutes a day, and maybe a few new habits—packing a paperback for the waiting room, queuing up an audiobook for your commute. What works best for me, though, is choosing just the right book.

Despite the constant grind of my weeks, I can usually make time to turn some pages if something in those pages pushes through my distractions. I might be behind on grading papers, but if I’m obsessed with Tara Selter, the character stuck in a time loop in On the Calculation of Volume, or totally absorbed in the minutiae of a great biography of Virginia Woolf, nothing can get me to step away. It’s hard to say what book might send you down that rabbit hole, but the list below may help a harried reader pick up something they actually want to finish. I consider these books, representing varied genres, uncommonly likely to absorb, entertain, and challenge. Each is broken up into discrete units—chapters, essays, letters, stories—that provide easy stopping points, although you might find it difficult to put them down.

Instead of offering an escape from real life, Home Cooking invites the reader to consider a kind of domestic drudgery—the daily necessity of cooking and eating—with renewed humor and curiosity. Although each short essay in the collection contains at least one recipe (some quite good, some very 1980s), the sum of these parts is far more memoir than cookbook. Colwin’s writing is funny and familiar, never fussy, and reminiscent of a family heirloom dotted with personal notes and stories. She recounts her own humbling kitchen disasters, shares dinner-party tips, and expounds on the merits of bitter greens. Essays such as “Bread Baking Without Agony,” “Flank Steak: The Neglected Cut,” and “Easy Cooking for Exhausted People” are both practical and charming. Clearly, Colwin loved to cook—and eat—in the comfort of her own home, and her pleasure is infectious. As she writes, “The joy of cooking is the joy of discovery.”

Read: You can read any of these short novels in a weekend

Forster finished Maurice in 1914, but it was published posthumously, in 1971, because of the novel’s portrayal of homosexual love. Its title character, the young Maurice Hall, is a conventional English man with a vague, nagging sense that he’s somehow different. He passes almost numbly through the rigors of schooling and middle-class childhood until he arrives at Cambridge, where he meets a group of very learned young men and begins to wake up: “People turned out to be alive,” Maurice reflects. “Hithero he had supposed that they were what he pretended to be—flat pieces of cardboard stamped with a conventional design.” Maurice grows steadily more intimate with a friend, Clive, trading books and letters with him over vacation, until Clive professes his love. The rest of the novel follows their risky relationship, and feels very contemporary: Can their partnership survive life after university? How will they handle growing pressure to start a lucrative career, marry a woman, and have a family? Anyone interested in a good love story will find something to enjoy.

Smith takes absolute delight in the English language and its history. In her most recent work, the trickster novelist combines her love of words with a propulsive plot: Gliff is partly a YA dystopian novel, partly an homage to Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World, and entirely a vehicle for beautiful prose. In the United Kingdom of the not-too-distant future, those who resist the surveillance state and its data mining are marked as “unverifiables” and rounded up inside detention centers. The novel follows two young adults, Rose and her nonbinary sibling, Bri, who return from visiting their mother at work to find a red line painted around their house. Their mother’s boyfriend leaves with a promise to be back soon. Suddenly, they are alone, unverifiable, and unable to turn to anyone for help; they realize they must go on the run to survive. In a typically Smithian twist, the novel will soon have its own double: Make room for its companion novel, called Glyph, to be published in May.

Is anything more engaging than a good murder mystery—one that dares you to guess who did it, and why? I devoured this captivating specimen in just a few days. When the novel opens in Florence, in 1557, the body of the painter Jacopo da Pontormo lies in the chapel of San Lorenzo—in front of the frescoes he’d labored over for a decade, with a painter’s chisel stuck in his heart. The case becomes political when a lewd painting of Maria de’ Medici, the daughter of the Duke of Florence, is found in Pontormo’s room. The ensuing story—consisting entirely of letters among artists, courtiers, and religious leaders—is a wild ride through the politics and intrigue of Renaissance Italy that incorporates real historical figures. This epistolary structure is brilliant: The reader can see precisely who tells what to whom—and discern their motives for telling it. Could the killer be Agnolo Bronzino, Pontormo’s former student? A political rival of the duke? About the ending, I’ll say only that it is funny, smart, and genuinely surprising.

Read: What to read when you have only half an hour

A book of short stories may be the best kind of work for a reader with a busy schedule. You can savor one piece in a collection, then let days or weeks pass before moving on to another. Plus, no one can stop you from reading them in any order you please. I recommend the 12 stories in Honored Guest, all full of striking detail and featuring strangely insightful narrators. Each tale abounds with existential questions and turns the familiar eerie. In “Anodyne,” a mother quits yoga to start shooting classes at a gun range; in “ACK,” a couple endures an odd dinner party on Nantucket. Williams’s stories always benefit from considered, post hoc reflection: Finish just one with breakfast, then let the images and sentences drift through your mind for the rest of the day.

A long novel can be a daunting investment of time and energy, but if you can settle into its rhythms, it can be a wonderful companion for the beleaguered reader. Just shy of 600 pages, The Old Drift glides between magical realism and sci-fi to tell the story of three entangled Zambian families over three generations. Nestled within the chronicles of these characters are chapters narrated by a swarm of mosquitos: Their hive mind takes readers from the colonial beginnings of the nation, starting with the explorer Dr. Livingstone’s “discovery” of Victoria Falls in the 19th century, to the “warm, wet future” of 2023 Lusaka, imagined from the vantage point of 2019. Because of its patchwork of perspectives, the novel can be easily read in chunks, but I found it terribly hard to put aside. This is a curious, probing book: You will find no pat conclusions or sentimentality, only a new (and very rewarding) variation on the multigenerational family novel.

Read: Five books that’ll fit right into your busy schedule

Lockwood’s dad is a rarity: a Catholic priest who’s both married and a father (he was already a family man when he converted, after watching The Exorcist on a nuclear submarine). His pastoral persona is equally unconventional, as he shreds guitar and lounges around the rectory in his underwear. Facing financial troubles, Lockwood and her husband move in with her parents, and Priestdaddy becomes an absurdist reflection on growing up in such an environment. Even if you read this book for only five minutes a day, you will inevitably bump into something screamingly funny, such as the author’s repeated attempts to explain Catholicism to her husband, her sister’s drunken antics at a dinner with the local bishop, and her mother’s penchant for yelling a Kool-Aid-Man-style “Oh yeah!” (I highly recommend the audiobook, in which Lockwood impersonates her family members with flair.) Reading Priestdaddy is like having a conversation with a brilliant, exuberant friend—you can’t wait to hear what she’ll say next.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">My friend recently attended a funeral, and midway through the eulogy, he became convinced that it had been written by AI. There was the telltale proliferation of abstract nouns, a surfeit of assertions that the deceased was “not just X—he was Y” coupled with a lack of concrete anecdotes, and more appearances of the word collaborate than you would expect from a rec-league hockey teammate. It was both too good, in terms of being grammatically correct, and not good enough, in terms of being particular. My friend had no definitive proof that he was listening to AI, but his position—and I agree with him—is that when you know, you know. His sense was that he had just heard a computer save a man from thinking about his dead friend.

More and more, large language models are relieving people of the burden of reading and writing, in school and at work but also in group chats and email exchanges with friends. In many areas, guidelines are emerging: Schools are making policies on AI use by students, and courts are trying to settle the law about AI and intellectual property. In friendship and other interpersonal uses, however, AI is still the Wild West. We have tacit rules about which movies you wait to see with your roommate and who gets invited to the lake house, but we have yet to settle anything comparable regarding, for example, whether you should use ChatGPT to reply to somebody’s Christmas letter. That seems like an oversight.

For the purposes of this discussion, I will define friendship adverbially, to mean any friendly communication—with boon companions but also family members, neighbors, and acquaintances—as well as those transactional relationships that call for an element of friendliness, such as with teachers and babysitters. There is reason to believe that use of AI in these friend-like relationships has already become widespread. In a Brookings Institution survey released in November, 57 percent of respondents said they used generative AI for personal purposes; 15 to 20 percent used it for “social media or communication.”

Read: The common friendship behavior that has become strangely fraught

Respondents to the Brookings survey were not asked whether they had offered some disclaimer about their use of AI or were passing off its outputs as their own; few statistics seem to exist on that question. But in a 2024 survey released by Microsoft, 52 percent of respondents who used AI at work said they were reluctant to admit using it for “important tasks,” presumably because it might make them look replaceable. My feeling is that using AI for friendly communications operates on a similar principle—but the share of people who should be ashamed is closer to 100 percent.

Deception is only part of the problem; the main evil is efficiency. The people selling AI keep suggesting I use it to streamline tasks that I regard as fun and even meaningful. Apple’s iOS 26, for example, has made text messages more efficient by offering AI summaries of their contents in notifications and lists. Before I turned it off, this feature summarized a group chat—in which my friend sent a picture of the door to her spooky attic, normally locked but now ajar, that became the occasion for various jokes about her finally being haunted—as “a conversation about a wooden room.”

In addition to being inaccurate, this summary removed everything entertaining about the chat in order to reduce it to a bare exchange of information. Presumably the summary would have been more actionable if the conversation it summarized had focused on dates and times or specific work products instead of jokes, which are notoriously hard for AI to parse. But how many conversations with friends are about communicating facts?

When my brother texts “How’s it going?,” he’s not seeking information so much as connection. That connection is thwarted if I ask ChatGPT to draft a 50-word reply about how his baby is cute and I love him. To prevent hard-core get-it-done types from inflicting slop on the rest of us, we need to agree that my sending you material written by ChatGPT is insulting, the same way you would be insulted if I were to play a recording of myself saying “Oh, that’s interesting” every time you spoke.

The assumption that the main purpose of writing is to convey information quickly breaks down when you consider cases beyond signage and certain airport-oriented areas of publishing. In schoolwork for teachers, chats with friends, or even emails to business associates—relationships that are defined by mutual obligations—a primary function of any written text is, to borrow a phrase from cryptocurrency, proof of work. This work is the means by which the text was produced but also an end in itself, either because it benefits the writer or because it demonstrates commitment to the reader.

Read: The decline of etiquette and the rise of ‘boundaries’

Generative AI sabotages the proof-of-work function by introducing a category of texts that take more effort to read than they did to write. This dynamic creates an imbalance that’s common to bad etiquette: It asks other people to work harder so one person can work—or think, or care—less. My friend who tutors high-school students sends weekly progress updates to their parents; one parent replied with a 3,000-word email that included section headings, bolded his son’s name each time it appeared, and otherwise bore the hallmarks of ChatGPT. It almost certainly took seconds to generate but minutes to read. As breaches of etiquette go, where this asymmetric email falls is hard to say; I would put it somewhere between telling a pointless story about your childhood and using your phone’s speaker on an airplane. The message it sent, though, was clear: My friend’s client wanted the relational benefits of a substantial reply but didn’t care enough to write one himself.

Writing is an act of taking care. College students write term papers not to inform their professors of the role of class in Wuthering Heights, but because putting what they have learned into words clarifies their understanding to both their instructors and themselves. Writing a eulogy both leads the eulogizer to think deeply about his relationship with the deceased and demonstrates his ongoing commitment to that relationship, even and especially after he can derive no benefit from it: Our goalie is dead, but we care enough to keep thinking about him even after he will stop no earthly puck.

A time-saving technology such as AI is appealing in the workplace because many people want to spend less time working. This calculus should not apply to our friendly relationships, which are not purely means to money or status but also ends in themselves—experiences of other people that are worthwhile as experiences and therefore diminished by efficiency. I don’t want these relations to become more efficient for the same reason I don’t want a robot that pets the dog for me. And if you don’t want to text me, then why do you want to be my friend?

Sometimes, of course, friendship is a pain. It would be easier to conduct friendship purely on our own terms, responding when we felt the urge and letting a computer talk to our friends when we didn’t want to. But that would not be friendship. A computer takes no care. We should not let it take the experience of caring away from us.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Something very dangerous is on track to happen this Thursday.

In two days, New START, the last significant survivor of the age of nuclear-arms-control agreements that began in the 1960s, will come to an end. Donald Trump—a president who claims to be very concerned about “nuclear,” his odd, one-word appellation for all things relating to nuclear weapons—has decided to let the treaty lapse. In July, Trump said that New START was “not an agreement you want expiring,” but last month he backtracked: “If it expires, it expires.”

The New START agreement between the United States and the Russian Federation, in force since 2011, puts caps on the number of American and Russian “strategic” weapons, the long-range missiles and bombers that can cover the thousands of miles between North America and Eurasia. It is the last in a line of treaties that helped stabilize the relationship between the superpowers during the the tense years of the Cold War, and then provided the framework for serious reductions in nuclear weapons after the fall of the Soviet Union. On Thursday, the two largest nuclear powers will be free to begin a new arms race, a needless competition that both nations have managed to avert for decades.

Indeed, even the Russians think the treaty should be renewed. Moscow suspended its participation in the treaty’s ongoing processes (such as information exchanges) back in 2023 as part of the diplomatic sparring with the U.S. over Ukraine, but the Russians have nonetheless offered to abide by the treaty’s numerical limits for one more year. The Trump administration has shown little interest in even this much. As the nuclear-arms researcher Pavel Podvig noted last week, “the US expert and political community has essentially reached consensus on the need to expand the US strategic arsenal.”

From the August 2025 issue: What Trump doesn’t understand about nuclear war

Podvig isn’t exactly right here: The U.S. nuclear establishment—the web of think tanks, contractors, and industries that make and support nuclear weapons—almost always favors the creation of more and newer weapons. (I worked for one such contractor decades ago.) Plenty of other experts and political leaders, of course, would contend that building more nuclear weapons is a very bad idea, but they’re not advising this White House. As in his first term, Trump is surrounded by people who oppose most treaties, regarding them as little more than annoying limitations on American power, and who view arms-control agreements as a sign of weakness. The secretary of the Navy even wants to put nuclear weapons on Trump’s proposed new battleships, a dangerous Cold War policy that was abandoned by George H. W. Bush more than 30 years ago.

New START is a good treaty, but it did not merely leap into being when it was ratified back in 2010. The progenitor of START was SALT, the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, begun by Richard Nixon. The SALT Treaty, a major achievement signed in 1972, also put limits on missile-defense research. (A follow-up treaty, SALT II, foundered during the renewed tensions of the late ’70s and early ’80s.) As the Cold War wound down and the Soviet Union’s days grew short, George H. W. Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev optimistically rechristened the SALT process “START,” replacing the word limitation with reduction, an idea first proposed by Ronald Reagan in 1982.

The cuts that followed were dramatic: The superpowers in the 1980s had a total of some 20,000 warheads pointed at each other on strategic delivery systems. Thousands more were mounted on short-range aircraft and missile systems all over Europe, as well as on surface warships. START slashed these numbers, setting a limit for each side of 6,000 warheads on no more than 1,600 delivery platforms. The process hit a dead end when George W. Bush withdrew from the missile-defense portion of the old SALT agreement and the Russians balked at signing an updated version of START. But Bush instead proposed another agreement: SORT, the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty. Signed in 2002 by Bush and Russian President Vladimir Putin, SORT had no provisions for verification, and set only an approximate goal for each side to reduce their inventories to 1,700 to 2,200 deployed strategic warheads by 2012, when SORT would expire.

In 2010, Barack Obama presented the replacement for SORT, New START, to the Senate, where GOP hawks blocked it until Obama agreed to spend tens of billions of dollars for future nuclear-modernization programs—in effect a shakedown for the nuclear-weapons industry in exchange for ratification. But the deal was worth it: New START was a better treaty that included stronger verification procedures and a new limit of 1,550 warheads each. It also included somewhat simplified counting rules that made it easier for both sides to stay in compliance: A bomber that could carry many weapons, for example, counted as only one warhead, because which delivery system carried the bombs was less important than keeping the total below 1,550—a level that both nations achieved.

I studied nuclear weapons back in the mid-’80s; I even took a course in nuclear technology at MIT to make sure I was able to understand the technical details. (I once could calculate things such as “equivalent megatonnage,” but those formulas, like my old slide rule, are long forgotten.) If you had told me in 1985 that one day the Soviet and American strategic arsenals would be down to 1,550 warheads each, I—and most Cold Warriors—would have laughed out loud. And yet here we are, because of the work done to negotiate and ratify New START and its predecessors.

Trump, however, now claims that he wants a “better” treaty that would also include Chinese forces. China has already rejected the idea, but no matter: Trump’s demand to include China is almost certainly a poison pill meant to stop any progress on renewing the existing treaty. Bilateral arms treaties are hard to achieve; multilateral arms treaties are exponentially more difficult.

From the August 2025 issue: The nuclear club might soon double

What happens next may depend, as so much does in this White House, on whatever happens to strike Trump as a good idea. Both sides could merely leave things alone for the moment, which would be the least destructive option for now. But controlling nuclear weapons is about more than observing numerical limits. Regular meetings, inspections, and exchanges of information build trust and relationships that can come into play during times of uncertainty or crisis. Treaties alone do not keep the peace. (The year after SALT was signed, for example, the Soviets and Americans faced off in a dangerous crisis during the 1973 Yom Kippur War that ended with the United States putting its nuclear forces on alert.)

A more likely outcome is that Trump will sign off on more money for more nuclear arms. Such an expansion would be pointless; the United States has more than enough nuclear firepower to deter both Beijing and Moscow. Put another way, America has the ability to destroy both the Russian and Chinese governments and most of their infrastructure with a relative handful of weapons. More bombs will not lead to more security. As Emma Belcher, the president of the arms-control organization Ploughshares, put it to me in an email, failing to replace New START would “contribute to greater geopolitical instability, escalated tensions across the world and a higher likelihood of a nuclear catastrophe in our lifetime.”

Deterrence and international stability, as we should have learned during the Cold War, are not solely about technology and numbers but about will, commitment, the strength of alliances, and, most of all, the fear of a nuclear cataclysm. Trump said during a 2015 primary debate, “I think, to me, nuclear is just the power. The devastation is very important to me.” If the president cares so much about what he once called the “biggest problem” in the world, he has an opportunity to do something about it before Thursday.</div>

            <h2>The Longevity Influencer Who Went Into ‘Withdrawal’ Without Jeffrey Epstein</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2026/02/peter-attia-epstein-files-wellness/685861/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you didn’t know who Peter Attia was last week, here’s how you’ll remember him going forward: Attia is the guy who once emailed Jeffrey Epstein to confirm that “pussy is, indeed, low carb. Still awaiting results on gluten content, though.”

Until recently, Attia was known as a wellness influencer in the manosphere and a newly appointed contributor at CBS as part of the “Free Press to network TV” pipeline. He has a popular podcast and wrote the best-selling book Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity. But Attia is also all over the Epstein files—his name pops up more than 1,700 times in the Justice Department’s latest batch of documents. From 2015 to 2018, Epstein and Attia exchanged numerous emails. Many of them are mundane: Epstein writes to Attia about “a very strange vein like red pattern” on his stomach; he asks Attia what kind of probiotic he should use; there is talk of MRI scans of Epstein’s spine. But others are vile. In a June 2015 back-and-forth about cancer and longevity, Epstein muses that he’s not sure why “women live past reproductive age at all.” (CBS did not respond to a request for comment; the network is reportedly expected to drop Attia after last week’s revelation.)

Attia, a onetime researcher who earned an M.D. but never completed his surgical residency, is beloved by his fans for his measured, scientific approach to living one’s best life. On a recent podcast, he spends two hours examining Alzheimer’s disease in women. Other episodes delve into timely topics such as protein intake, fertility, chronic pain, and nicotine; his October discussion about the safety of Tylenol use during pregnancy offers an evidence-based counterpoint to the alarmist White House press conference on that issue. But he’s also been knocked for overhyping treatments with limited data behind them and for exploiting his eager fans (a course he offered on longevity cost $2,500, according to a 2023 Wall Street Journal article). Eric Topol, a high-profile cardiologist who directs the Scripps Research Translational Institute, called Attia a “huckster” earlier today.

In the mid-2010s, about the time he befriended Epstein, Attia seemed focused on building a roster of clients whom he could advise on longevity and wellness. An exercise physiologist who once worked with Attia told me that Attia sent him to do a physical evaluation of Epstein at the late financier’s cavernous Manhattan residence in July 2017. He remembers two young, attractive women who flowed in and out during the session with Epstein, though Epstein didn’t acknowledge them. “Something felt a little off,” he told me. A proposed follow-up session never took place. (The physiologist spoke on the condition of anonymity because he didn’t want to be associated with the scandal; he told me he hasn’t spoken with Attia in years.)

Attia’s emails with Epstein reveal no such qualms. In an email in which Attia seems to be pitching Epstein a longevity program, he asks Epstein if “you’re interested in living longer (solely for the ladies, of course)?” In July 2016, Attia asked Epstein what he was doing in Palm Beach, where Epstein allegedly abused numerous underage girls. “Guess,” Epstein writes. Attia replies: “Besides that.” In 2017, Attia appears to have spent time with Epstein in New York—rebuffing his wife’s pleas for him to return home to California—while his infant son was having a medical emergency. In the emails, Attia is not just Epstein’s medical adviser but a friend and ardent admirer. In 2016, Attia wrote to Epstein’s assistant that he goes “into JE withdrawal when I don’t see him.”

When Attia and Epstein met in 2014, the full extent of the latter’s crimes weren’t yet publicly known, but his misdeeds weren’t a secret. Epstein first pleaded guilty to a child-sex offense in 2008, and by 2010, he had settled several lawsuits over allegations of sexual misconduct. A representative for Attia pointed me to a long semi–mea culpa that Attia posted on his X account this morning. He writes that he “never saw anyone who appeared underage” in Epstein’s presence, and that he had “nothing to do with his sexual abuse or exploitation of anyone.” Attia also says that when he learned about the extent of Epstein’s crimes from a November 2018 Miami Herald article, he confronted Epstein and told him that he needed to accept responsibility and pay for support for those he had harmed. (In December 2018, Attia wrote to Epstein that he “would like to discuss some stuff with you in person.”) And, in his X post, Attia calls the emails between him and Epstein “embarrassing, tasteless, and indefensible.”

In his lengthy explanation of his behavior, Attia writes that he was fascinated by Epstein’s wealth and access to influential people. Epstein had contact with plenty of household names, such as Bill Gates and Elon Musk. Attia’s emails refer to “Ehud”—likely Ehud Barak, the former Israeli prime minister who was known to have a relationship with Epstein but has previously denied any wrongdoing or knowledge of Epstein’s crimes. In an August 2015 email, Epstein tells Attia that he’s having dinner that night with “musk thiel zuckerburg [sic].” (In 2019, a spokesperson for the Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg said he had met Epstein “in passing one time at a dinner honoring scientists that was not organized by Epstein.” In 2021, Gates told PBS that his meetings with Epstein were a mistake. A spokesperson for Peter Thiel said on Saturday that Thiel never visited Epstein’s island, and Musk wrote on X that “no one pushed harder than me to have the Epstein files released and I’m glad that has finally happened.”)

Attia is more representative of another category of Epstein associate: researchers who thought Epstein could either fund their work or help push their careers to the next level. In his X post, Attia writes that he was introduced to Epstein when he was raising money for scientific research. Epstein was known to have donated millions to a research center run by Martin Nowak, a professor of mathematics and biology at Harvard. (In 2021, the university temporarily sanctioned Nowak for violating rules about professionalism and campus access in connection with his involvement with Epstein, but he remains a professor there. He said at the time that he regretted “the connection I was part of fostering between Harvard and Jeffrey Epstein.”) Lawrence Krauss, a theoretical physicist and cosmologist, received $250,000 from Epstein’s foundation for his science-communication group. At one point, Epstein introduced Attia to Krauss over email because Krauss was hoping to start a podcast and wanted tips. (Last year, Krauss said that none of his communications with Epstein was criminal, and that he “was as shocked as the rest of the world when he was arrested.”)

Attia, in other words, was seemingly not alone in being wowed by Epstein’s wealth and well-known friends. A particular challenge for Attia, though, is that wellness influencers offer their followers more than diet-and-exercise tips. They’re selling wisdom. Follow my advice, they contend, and you’ll live a longer, healthier, more fulfilled life. But a chummy, yearslong association with a convicted child predator is, at the very least, unwise.</div>

They are ensuring consistency. They are insuring it is consistently shitty.

If I was alphabet I would be extremely careful to make sure I don&#39;t prefer my own browser.  That is.. unless I wanted the government to break me up.

Yeah, just like what happened to Microsoft when they were found to be a monopoly because they favored their own browser over any other.

We&#39;re so fortunate that they were broken up into multiple companies!

You can smell the desperation as they fail to keep people from blocking ads. They&#39;re just so so so so greedy and grasping that they piss themselves into a frenzy if they think they&#39;re losing ad views.

Remember, if you go to the bathroom during a commercial, you&#39;re breaking the implicit contract to watch every ad they show you, or you&#39;ll be STEALING from the advertisers. (Some ad exec actually said something to that effect but I can&#39;t find the quote.)

A Google spokesperson told Android Authority that the platform &quot;updated the experience to ensure consistency,&quot;

If this were normal software I would agree with you, but it&#39;s not. This is Adobe software. Adobe is infamously known for doing incredibly dumb shit in the name of &quot;support&quot; such as ring fencing installation of software to specific Windows versions without any good compatibility reason.

There&#39;s no reason to think Animate won&#39;t just fail to install completely arbitrarily on some upcoming Windows release. It has happened in the past as anyone who ever decided to try a Windows beta build and found they couldn&#39;t

Adobe has a history of arbitrarily ring-fencing applications to specific windows versions. Its a local application which means that what you have today will function with the build of Windows you have today. That may not be the case next year where you may find shit just fails to install with an error saying it&#39;s not compatible with your version of Windows. Adobe has a history of this dumbfuckery.

Fake it until you make it has become the norm. Stretching the truth knowing you can is not ideal but has been done many times. Outright lies are criminal and should be prosecuted.Shame on Forbes for rubber stamping these frauds and giving them the air of legitimacy without doing their due diligence. I hope Forbes takes a hit for this as well.

Outright lies are criminal and should be prosecuted.Alternatively, the fraudster should be elected to the highest office in the land.

Alternatively, the fraudster should be elected to the highest office in the land.

The quickest way is to cheat your way to the top. But youth and inexperience leads to a failure to sufficiently cover your tracks and too few powerful connections in industry and government to protect yourself. And ideally a person enters into wealth in childhood so that their parents and grandparents would have already taken care of these things.

By now, the Forbes 30 Under 30 list has become more than a little notorious for the amount of entrants who go on to be charged with fraudHave there really been that many frauds? Gemini found 7 former winners who have been charged with fraud (5 found guilty with 2 cases ongoing) out of 420 members. When you include other issues like sex offenses and workplace bullying it goes up to 15. So around 1.5 - 3.5% of their winners either went on to do bad things or were already doing them without getting caught.Is the rest of the enterprise business world really any better than that?

Yes, the rest of the business world is way better than that. I&#39;ve worked with literally thousands of people who were never charged with a crime for their work.

Rename it to &quot;Forbes 30 (years to life) Under 30&quot; and then you really have something

There&#39;s no such thing as a &quot;financial crime&quot; in the US if you have over a billion dollars and are willing to pay tribute to the king.

I never really understood all the hate for Game Cube from &#39;serious gamers&#39; .

When using RGB out at 480P most games looked just as good as the &#39;HD&#39; competition.  The performance was fine, but I guess it was memory staved because it seems like the GC version of some 3rd party titles got cut down a bit.

There was NOTHING more fun then MK Double Dash with about four people and game cubes with broadband adapters.

I never really understood all the hate for Game Cube from &#39;serious gamers&#39; .

Because Nintendo was considered &quot;family friendly&quot; games and they generally discouraged the violent and dark FPS games that were the rage at the time in favor of more family friendly games.

While the original Xbox and PS2 were playing the cutting edge games and shooters, they considered Nintendo to be for kids - the Xbox and PS2 were the &quot;adult&quot; gaming consoles. (No doubt helped by the way Sega positioned the Genesis/Megadrive back in

I think the challenge was that publishers saw Gamecube as a platform from a vendor that wasn&#39;t historically the easiest to work with business-wise, and with game sizes limited to 1.5GB whereas Xbox and PS2 did the full 8.5GB disk size.  Of course Sony enjoyed coming off of Playstation being *the* platform (N64 cartridges severely limited them, Saturn made some bad bets technology wise), so a Playstation 2 that was *backwards compatible* was a slam dunk.

I remember the NGC could push more triangles than the other systems but since most of them were static backgrounds it didn&#39;t matter much.

This is only talking about their momentum. Unfortunately the cost is prohibitive to replace all those $150-$200 Switch Lites. Parents aren&#39;t going to do that. This isn&#39;t like the pandemic where people are spending extra on entertainment either. Prices are also rumored to go up because of the priority AI hardware is getting. RAM and processors and other components in the Switch 2 are going to go up in price.

If they don&#39;t come out with something cheaper that momentum will stall and then it will end up selling

Automakers have increasingly implemented door handles that retract into the bodywork for aerodynamic reasons, but they are now off limits in China.

My issue is with electronic-only door latch mechanism. It should be possible to open the door from both inside and outside the car in case of complete power loss.

Better structural design, seatbelts, airbags, and collision avoidance systems make cars safer overall. But those stupid door handles need to go, we don&#39;t have to take the bad with the good.

Add to that the stupid nagging systems that are just annoying, beeping and throwing up a text about something it thinks is wrong.

Half of people are below average drivers. Those beeps and bells help the idiots comply with what should be common sense. Like put on your seatbelt, don&#39;t drive off with the door not fully closed, etc. Cars are mainly for the masses and aren&#39;t designed around the use cases of power users and experts.

I&#39;m for it. If you&#39;re using your horn then at least you&#39;re not on your cellphone, probably.

In the west we&#39;re used to driving with relatively little driver to driver communication other than signal lights and brake lights.  In countries where drivers use horns more, it really does increase communication between drivers about intention and whether or not another driver is willing to accomodate.  For example in one country spent time in, to change lanes you signal (sometimes) but you usually just put your nose into the gap and honk. If the other driver is okay with that---and courtesy and etiquette

&quot;Half of people are below average drivers. Those beeps and bells help the idiots...&quot;

It&#39;s deceptively easy to assume you implied that below-average drivers are idiots. But what criteria?

- Warnings about vehicle state such as fluid levels are helpful and useful.

- Other warnings, such as detected vehicles in proximity, these are interesting warnings. Not so distracting to me as the lane-keeping steering hints...

- Simply put, if you&#39;re so easily distracted by these warnings etc., you&#39;re not an &#39;idiot&#39;, you&#39;re j

I was being hyperbolic for comedic effect. Don&#39;t need to read too much into it.

Infact, I believe the vast majority of people are idiots, myself included. It&#39;s a subjective opinion rather than objective measure.

I had to download, patch and  re-flash the software on my car to make it stop.

Classic debugger approach, change the binary, jump over some sections of the code, mock certain check return values, then crack the signing key and re-flash.

Now I&#39;ve got to restore the old software once a year when the car goes to it&#39;s annual MOT check, but otherwise I&#39;m nag-free all year.

Add to that the stupid nagging systems that are just annoying, beeping and throwing up a text about something it thinks is wrong.An annoyed driver is not a good driver.100% agree. I&#39;m using a loaner vehicle and the amount of daily harrassment is staggering.  Between being yelled at when backing out of the garage to being yelled at when I get out because I opened the rear door and put my things in the back seat, it&#39;s another reminder why I won&#39;t get a new car.  If I did, I&#39;d have to find someone to hack the software to turn all the shit off so I can drive.

Most drivers. Let me guess you spend the majority of your time driving in the left lane.

I didn&#39;t use my turn signal *after* passing a car (who does that ?)

It&#39;s the law in some places.  Having taken the driving test in both the UK and Ontario, I can tell you it&#39;s the law in Canada.  The US often has similar laws:

See point #3 in the passing section: https://www.ontario.ca/documen... [ontario.ca]

After overtaking, signal that you want to move back into the lane you started from

You might not like the risk of not being able to open your car if the battery is flat but since I see these mostly on EVs, if your battery is dead you have bigger problems. Other than that&#39;s what&#39;s bad about them?If your car crashes and catches on fire and you lose 12V power, your &quot;bigger problems&quot; include dying horribly in a lithium fire.  Also, your &quot;bigger problems&quot; could include getting inside the car to pop the hood so you can change the dead battery.  I&#39;d rather not have to jimmy the lock or smash the window to do that.They also suck in places with cold weather.  Water gets behind them and they freeze, getting stuck.  If you don&#39;t lock your car when brushing snow off off the roof, then you gotta try to pick compacted snow out from behind them.  They are just a needless frivolity to save like .02% on aero efficiency.Fortunately while my car has the idiotic things, they still mechanically operate the door latch when you pull on them, both inside and out, so I don&#39;t have to worry about getting trapped inside.  There&#39;s also a mechanical lock hidden behind the handle, so if the battery is dead I can still unlock the car.

They were not flush, they had a very deep recess for your fingers to grasp the handle which allowed for turbulent air to form

pretty good building robust electric motors these daysIf you don&#39;t understand the problem that an electric motor represents at a time when the electrics are unavailable then I don&#39;t know what to tell you. What&#39;s the hostility towards it? This has cost lives. Not may, not could, but has, already cost lives needlessly where people who would otherwise have lived, died in their car. There is a body count on these handles to date.

Touch screens should never replace buttons when it comes to functions that the driver needs while driving.

GPS is understandable. But the HVAC should not be &quot;only touch screen&quot; and same with things like fuel and speed gauges. Those should be analog gauges.

It&#39;s great that this works for you. It doesn&#39;t work for everyone. You seem to assume that you grasp other people&#39;s needs, while at the same time demonstrating that you do not. Here are some of the reasons why it doesn&#39;t work for me:

The car doesn&#39;t know that I just finished a workout and need it on the chill side. It doesn&#39;t know that I underdressed and need it a little warmer. It doesn&#39;t know that I need a blast of cold air to heighten my awareness when entering a hairy freeway interchange after a long monotonous drive.

There is no single right temperature, so while harping on the importance of HMI you might pause to remember its chief lesson: you are not the user.

But you do, so set it to be on the chill side when you get in. You&#39;ll be home before your body changes, either that or you... yuk did you just get straight off the gym into your car. Gross.

Also do you get changed while driving down the highway? You know how warm you need it when you get in. Bonus points if your car has a pre-heat system like many modern cars do you don&#39;t actually need to dress any differently at any point.

As for your long monotonous drive. GET THE FUCK OFF THE ROAD. Pull into a servo, grab

Thanks for sharing your personal opinions and preferences. You may be surprised to learn it is possible - even likely - that other people may have different opinions and preferences, and even more surprised to learn that this does mean that they are wrong or ignorant.

Why? No seriously I don&#39;t understand your attempt at insult. You feel sorry for the person being married to someone who owns a car that doesn&#39;t need to be fucked around with? You feel sorry for that person being married to someone who as a matter of their profession is involved in human interface studies in ways that doesn&#39;t affect them?

I don&#39;t understand. Help me understand because right now I think your insult was ... just ... stupid?

No they aren&#39;t. They just have certain features that are worse for safety than their predecessors. Modern cars are still objectively safer (for the occupants) in America, and objectively safer (for everyone) in the rest of the world where people aren&#39;t obsessed with oversized pedestrian killers, than their predecessors.

You can see that in the road fatality stats. We haven&#39;t become better drivers.

Modern cars are less safe  [youtube.com] Demonstrably not. Look at car crashes from the &#39;70s and tell me that again. If all cars had automatic breaking, I would have avoided at least two crashes which totaled vehicles.I&#39;m curious though. Does a car with retractable handles not have a way to open the door from the inside if power is out? The cars I&#39;m familiar with still have mechanical latches in the door in addition to power locks and the like. Are retracting doors fully open-by-wire?If that&#39;s the issue, surely the Chinese government could address

It might be more difficult to break the glass from inside a car than expected especially if you are injured after the crash and the car is in a &quot;weird&quot; position.

There are some tools that will help you make the initial break, after which the glass usually breaks more easily: https://www.youtube.com/watch?... [youtube.com]

The persons inside/outside the car may be weak, ill or too panicked to break the glass. Especially if the car has reinforced glass windows. It&#39;s an action that is a lot more complicated than just opening the door, in a situation where every second may count. The person inside the car may hesitate to break the glass because they&#39;re afraid of flying glass shards, or because they don&#39;t understand the urgency of the situation and don&#39;t want to damage the car any further. Yes that would be extremely stupid but p

Really? And how is 5 year old going to understand that.

How many people need to die for nice aesthetics.

My guess is you are more selfish than me. Many believe that&#39;s a sign of progress. It&#39;s not. It&#39;s devolution, it&#39;s living like a primitive savage.

FWIW, primitive savages are generally extremely charitable to others in their tribe.  It&#39;s people who live in larger groups not as closely related that tend to be more selfish.

Riddance! Shame about mercedes whose exports to china are about to drop like a rock because of their stupid door handles.

Import them without the handles and associated electromechanicals as a manufacturing subassembly. Have someone in China attach a localized handle.

So that&#39;s a big safety fail. On top of that, only the front passengers have an accessible mechanical release. The rear passengers technically have one but it&#39;s under a hatch, under the lining at the bottom of the door bin. i.e. rear seat passengers will panic and die in an emergency.

So I don&#39;t see the handle being a problem but the lack of mechanical release is a major one, front and especially back. And if you&#39;re in a Cyber Truck (not in China of course) with your &quot;unbreakable&quot; glass, then don&#39;t expect anybody to be pulling you out of the fire, or the rising water in time to save your life.

The fix to these issues is simple and the default on most cars - the handles inside and out should be mechanical. In the loss of power, somebody might have to yank the door hard since the windows are frameless and seated into the door but they should still be able to rescue occupants.

Mechanical overrides ought to be mandatory, given that if there is a power loss, that could result in a person being trapped inside a car

Last summer 3 teenagers burned to death in a Cybertruck near where I live. They were just home from college, borrowing their parents&#39; Tesla, and probably didn&#39;t know where the manual override latch was.

A lot of safety is sacrificed for very little to no upside.

&quot;In November 2024 (Thanksgiving Eve), a Tesla Cybertruck crashed at high speed into a tree and wall in Piedmont, California. It carried four college students (all teenagers/young adults around 19-20 years old). The crash caused a fire, and three of them died: Krysta Tsukahara (19), Jack Nelson (20), and the driver Soren Dixon (19). One survivor was pulled out after a good Samaritan broke a window.The key claim in multiple wrongful death lawsuits (filed in 2025 by families of two victims) is that the Cybertruck&#39;s electronic/retractable/flush door handles contributed to the deaths. Allegations include:

The power-dependent electronic handles (and buttons) failed after the crash/power loss.No easily accessible exterior mechanical handles existed for rescuers to open doors quickly.Interior manual releases (cables) were hidden/obscure (e.g., under a map pocket liner), hard to find amid smoke, fire, and panic.Victims reportedly survived the initial impact but were trapped and died from smoke inhalation and burns, not crash injuries.

These lawsuits blame Tesla&#39;s design choices for turning a survivable crash into fatalities, and the issue has drawn scrutiny (including from NHTSA investigations into Tesla door systems). Tesla hasn&#39;t been found liable yet—the cases are ongoing.&quot;

Why did the fire break out in the first place? Was it bad design of the batteries? Its by no means the first time a tesla has gone up in smoke in a crash.

Why did the fire break out in the first place?I believe the parent stated the crash caused the fire.And before we start with the debates around battery designs, perhaps we keep in mind 150,000 ICE cars catch fire every year in the US.  Thousands every day.  You don’t hear about them on the news because we’d need a small army doing nonstop 24-hour fire reporting, which would probably send driver paranoia soaring after listening to the news team at Fires-R-Us for more than 15 minutes.Not defending Teslas design choices.

This just highlights the idiocy of Tesla&#39;s design choices even more.  Many ICEs catch fire yes, but their occupants can get out of the vehicle when it happens.  Tesla&#39;s design makes a positive into a negative.

Fire breaking out when you have a fuel tank and pipes full of a highly flammable liquid are not a surprise. Batteries however should not catch fire unless seriously damaged and it should be quite possible to design a battery compartment that would survive anything short of an IED going off underneath.

Batteries however should not catch fire unless seriously damaged and it should be quite possible to design a battery compartment that would survive anything short of an IED going off underneath.We are making the batteries out of one of the most reactive elements on the planet.  Making them totally fire proof is almost impossible.  Yeah, we could encase them in tungsten or something, but we don&#39;t for the same reason we don&#39;t make fuel tanks out of a honeycomb of depleted uranium - it&#39;s an unacceptable tradeoff of weight for safety.  If we wanted to be absolutely safe we&#39;d all drive around in tanks, or better yet take a bus or train.Some risks you just have to accept as part of the design tradeoffs.

&quot;The Cybertruck is the automotive equivalent of the Titan submersible&quot;

Good analogy. The cybertruck however isn&#39;t just dangerous to its occupants , its sharp edges are a danger to any pedestrians it might hit which is why it fails safety checks and can&#39;t be sold in most EU countries.

The problem -- as usual -- is that Elon Musk has ordered his company to satisfy his pathetic manbaby concept of what&#39;s &quot;cool&quot; instead of what&#39;s sound engineering and safety practice.  That not only includes doors that can be immediately and obviously opened by manual action from either side, but breakable windows.  (Most rescuers carry tools expressly designed to punch out windows.   You want those tools to work on your vehicle first time every time.)Teslas do not have &quot;bulletproof&quot; glass. They have essentially windshield glass on the sides, which is laminated for additional safety.   And 1/3 of ALL cars delivered in the US back in 2018 had side glass that was laminated in the same way Teslas are.  I&#39;d imagine that 1/3 rate is much higher now, so this is certainly no longer a problem limited to Tesla or EVs in general.That &quot;cool&quot; requirement more came from the Feds trying to prevent people from being ejected during car crashes.

Were they stealing the car at the time? Because that&#39;d be great karma (b**ch!).

for aerodynamic reasonsNo one is doing it for the aerodynamics.

Bingo. For aerodynamics, they would find a bigger pay off with wheelwell covers, and those are somewhat rare. Especially on any cars catering to trends and aesthetics.

A lot of EVs have little slots in front of the front wheels to allow air to pass in and push away from the wheels. So the need for wheel well covers is mitigated.

Flush door handles do make a small difference, as so cameras instead of wing mirrors. Next to the rapidly falling cost of batteries and improvements in the drivetrain they aren&#39;t really a big deal though, and are mostly done for aesthetic purposes.

It&#39;s not just drag, although that&#39;s a factor. It&#39;s also wind noise. A lot of money is spent making cars quieter. This is especially important for EVs, where they are quiet enough that the door handles become significant. They are also quite near the occupants&#39; heads. But if you can hear the wind moving over something, it&#39;s also creating measurable drag.

Rear wheelwell covers were a thing in the 70s and early 80s for some manufacturers. The problem is if you need to change a wheel they&#39;re a right PITA.

The space behind the cover becomes a cavity where the snow can get packed in, until the cover pops off while driving.  Losing pieces of your vehicle in traffic is generally not good. 

It also reduces cooling airflow to the brakes, although that should matter less for an EV.

Even if they were doing it for aerodynamics there is a way to make the handle accessible. AMC (American Motors for you youngsters) used a door handle that was flush to the door with a recessed pocket behind it so you could pull the handle. The only time it failed for me was after an ice storm coated the whole side of the car in ice. The other side of the car was still accessible though.

https://www.amclives.com/produ... [amclives.com]

I had a 1982 Eagle that had similar handles.

... touchscreen controls for common tasks such as altering the HVAC or radio/media settings and put back buttons. For some reason the authorities in most countries see m to think its dangerous using a touchscreen phone but perfectly ok to use a touchscreen car interface while doing 70mph.

Buttons are better, but dials or levers are better yet. Hitting a stupid toggle button that’s indistinguishable from the rest of the row of toggle buttons multiple times to change the temperature is just a stupid idea. I’m looking at you, Mercedes.

If you&#39;re altering your HVAC then touchscreens aren&#39;t the issue, but your defective HVAC system is. There&#39;s no reason for HVAC to be anything other than set and forget. It&#39;s trivial to design fast acting accurate temperature control systems.

I&#39;ve not touched the HVAC settings in my car in 2 years now. It&#39;s the same summer, winter, rain snow or shine. As it should be. You know how you&#39;re dressed when you get in a car, there&#39;s no reason you can&#39;t set the desired comfort level before you drive off.

Tell me your male without saying so. Large numbers of females will have issues with your misogyny around the issue of hot flushes. Not that I am female, but I do have compassion for others and eyes to observe their problems, unlike you. That is just one example as to why you might need to change the setting on the move. I can come up with others if you so desire.

The assumption that HVAC can be constant is not borne out by the realities of the human condition. If it works for you, that&#39;s fine, but your arrog

If you have functional and working climate control, then yes you can.

Maybe you have dual zone climate control, in which the passenger can change their own temp and maybe also vent settings. Maybe you don&#39;t. It&#39;s actually pathetic for any modern car with more than 2 seats to not have at least 3 zones (at least one for the rear — two zones back there means two air ducts and it can be hard to fit them both in the center console.) It&#39;s neither expensive nor difficult.

It&#39;s not about zones - it&#39;s about toggling the defroster, or outside air circulation to control humidity.  Sometimes you need to toggle the temperature up to an uncomfortably warm level to keep the windshield from icing up, but once it&#39;s deiced, or if the precipitation lets up or conditions otherwise change, you&#39;d like to turn it back down to 68.

Auto can decide to not heat the front windshield, thereby fog. Same with not circulating air to the side windows, again fogging.

How much acrobatics does it take to get into a position where you can aim a kick at a window? For a typical overweight driver? In a crowded car? Full of smoke? With a broken leg? When you start to panic?

You can have flush handles on the outside AND a mechanical method of opening the door from the inside.  The Tesla model 3 and model Y have the flush outside handles that actuate an electronic solenoid that unlatches the door.  On the inside, one normally just presses a button to do the same from the inside.  However, on the arm rest in front of the power window buttons there is a physical latch that you can pull up that mechanically unlatches the door.  It&#39;s only on the front doors though.  Room for improvement.

I think the point is to ALSO have a mechanical exterior latch that safety/rescue personnel have available that isn&#39;t disabled by a electrical failure too.

You can have flush handles which present themselves when the car is unlocked and ALSO still can be actuated when NOT popped out. They just can&#39;t come out parallel. You can use a lever action instead which pops out when you press on the leading end of the recessed handle, and also use an actuator to push it out when wanted.

Honestly, if it&#39;s not possible to open the door using the same old latch you use every frikkin day, then it&#39;s the basis of a deathtrap.Yeah. But there&#39;s a simple fix (for smart designers). Make a small movement of the handle engage the electronic system (pulling up or out on the handle). In the event of an electrical failure, continuing to pull up/out disengages the mechanical latch.

Concern about aerodynamics at that level, for the average car or SUV is beyond ridiculous. It  transforms into matter of Idiots marketing Stupid to Idiots.

Ah, I seem to have encountered one of the people impressed by marketing idiots. If the drag from door handles becomes significant, I suggest restricting speed to below supersonic.

You can in no way justify any concern over the drag from a door handle. You can try as much as you want, but you can not in any way rationalize that concern with regard to passenger vehicles to a sane person.

You can in no way justify any concern over the drag from a door handle.Frontal area is the single biggest factor in the drag calculation, and having things stick out increases that.HTH, HAND.

I actually agree with this.  Car crashes happen, and are often accompanied by fire.  There needs to be a way to open the door when the vehicle has no power.

That said, the real issue is door handles that electronically actuate the release mechanism instead of mechanically doing so.

Even in the US all electronic door latches have a mechanical override - it&#39;s just like the trunk lid which have a mechanical override inside the trunk.

The worst was the Mustang Mach-E where the mechanical override is hidden behind the seat and hard to find. Couple that with a digital owner&#39;s manual and people might not know where the mechanical override is.

Of course, it&#39;s only available on the inside of the vehicle, but an emergency is not the best time to be trying to find where it is.

On Monday, the New York Times reported a bizarre and shocking update to news of an FBI raid last week on a Georgia election office: It turns out that immediately after the federal raid, the FBI officers involved spoke directly with President Donald Trump. To say that this is unusual would be an understatement—it is without precedent. It has long been known that the 2020 election in Georgia is a personal obsession of Trump’s, but the extent to which he is actively, openly, and personally meddling in the state’s elections system is still surprising and new. One big question looming over this entire episode, though, is why—of all the states where Trump falsely claimed there was fraud in 2020—has Georgia become ground zero for the president ahead of the 2026 midterms that election experts feel are potentially threatened by Trump’s latest actions? We think we have a few answers.

Those answers have to do as much with 2026 as they do with 2020. And, perhaps surprisingly, a big motivation for Trump’s assault on Georgia’s election infrastructure now has as much to do with the Republican primaries in the state as with November’s general election. Allow me to explain.

Georgia’s race for governor is considered a toss-up, though Republicans have consistently held the job since 2002. Polling has shown the top Republican contenders are Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and Georgia Lt. Gov. Burt Jones. Trump has endorsed Jones, who served as a fake elector in 2020 and was tied up in Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis’ election interference investigation, which charged Trump and several co-conspirators with a criminal conspiracy to steal Georgia’s 2020 election. Jones has focused his campaign on attacking Raffensperger over that election. Raffensperger, as you may recall, has been a longtime personal target of Trump’s after a 2021 phone call with the president in which he was asked to “find” 11,780 votes for Trump in order to flip the state’s 2020 election results.

In order to understand how the race between Rafensperger and Jones relates to the FBI’s raid on Fulton County, it’s necessary to recognize that Georgia’s voting system has been mired in controversy for nearly a decade. Back in 2017, a group of Georgia voters and the Coalition for Good Governance sued the state over its use of Dominion Voting Systems’ electronic ballot-marking devices. These devices are like a tablet and don’t create a paper copy of a voter’s ballot selections; instead they print a paper QR code that can be scanned to see a digital image of a ballot. This, the lawsuit alleged, opens up serious security vulnerabilities that can not only be hacked, but also make it nearly impossible to verify the software accurately recorded a voter’s ballot. When the lawsuit eventually went to trial in 2024, a computer scientist demonstrated live, in court, how he was able to rig Dominion’s voting tablet by rewriting its code and printing out as many ballots as he wanted. In a hypothetical election, the hacking was successful in flipping the outcome of a race.

During that trial, the plaintiffs also pointed to Georgia’s Coffee County data breach that occurred in 2021, where pro-Trump activists physically entered the small, rural county’s election office and copied election system software. A lawyer for the Coalition for Good Governance claimed at the time that the compromised software was not isolated to Coffee County, and that hackers could have access to voting software used in all 159 counties in Georgia. Plus in 2022, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, under the Biden administration, also advised that Dominion’s electronic ballot-casting software presents security vulnerabilities. None of this validated Trump’s phony claims of election fraud in 2020, but it does make the state’s election systems more vulnerable to the sort of episode we witnessed last week.

Ultimately, the Coalition for Good Governance’s 2017 lawsuit failed, with a judge dismissing it just last year, partly because there wasn’t evidence to suggest there had actually been a successful hack of Georgia’s voting software and the state Legislature appeared to have remedied some of the security concerns the lawsuit raised. For instance, the Georgia Legislature approved a bill that would replace its previous QR code system with a readable text to verify a voter’s ballot entry. The new law is supposed to take effect July 1, 2026, though during a series of budget hearings last month, Georgia lawmakers didn’t appropriate any state dollars to implement the change. No budget was allocated to upgrade Georgia’s voting system software either, which would have patched any security holes.

While all of these legal challenges questioned the integrity of Georgia’s voting systems, Raffensperger consistently affirmed his state’s 2020 election results were accurate. His office conducted three separate recounts, including a statewide audit that manually re-tallied every single vote cast, plus another recount requested by the Trump campaign. In the end, Gov. Brian Kemp certified his state’s election results for Biden, though the president has continued to insist he is the rightful winner. As part of this vendetta, Trump even made Kemp and Raffensperger prime targets during the 2022 elections, trying to inspire his MAGA base to vote them both out of office. At the time, he failed miserably.

Now, though, it seems that Trump has found a new way to try to punish Raffensperger. The Trump administration is undoubtedly going to use the baggage surrounding Georgia’s voting system to cast doubt on its 2026 elections and possibly beyond, with the FBI’s recent raid evidence that this is already underway. Georgia provides a three-for-one, from the Trump perspective: He gets to again question the legitimacy of the 2020 election; he gets to again cast blame on Raffensperger, his 2020 antagonist in the state; and he gets to potentially meddle with an election which he desperately wants Raffensperger to lose.

The day after FBI agents raided Fulton County’s election office last week, officials there said federal agents took over 700 boxes of physical voter records, while officials were kept out of the room as it was happening. Fulton County Commission Chair Robb Pitts told reporters he had no clue what the FBI was going to do with all the information it seized. “I don’t know where they are, I don’t know who has them, I don’t know what they’re doing with it,” Pitts said. “I have no clue. I could use my imagination.”

It’s no small stretch of the imagination to foresee Trump’s FBI manipulating Fulton County’s voting records to fit his agenda. “What Trump is trying to do is create a narrative that you can’t trust the voting system in Georgia,” Marilyn Marks, vice president and executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, told Slate. “He’s going to be able to show these ballots that say they were counted wrong and they were cheated, and all of that: ‘You can’t trust Georgia’s voting system, therefore the feds have to come in and help control the voting system.’ ”

Right now Trump is beginning his attack on Georgia’s voting system by inserting federal action, knowing that in a few short months, the state will be holding its gubernatorial primary election on May 19. If Raffensperger secures a win, the White House will be on fertile ground to dispute the results of his election, leveraging information obtained from the FBI’s raid, plus the nearly decade-long legal challenges Georgia’s voting system has faced.

Another added benefit to Trump’s scheme is the threat to the state’s critical U.S. Senate race, where Democrat Jon Ossoff is running for reelection. Ossoff’s narrow win in a 2021 runoff gave Senate Democrats the slimmest majority at the start of Joe Biden’s presidency, while Trump took the brunt of the blame for the GOP defeat at the time. Constantly attacking the integrity of the 2020 election seemed to put voters off.

What ends up shaking out in Georgia remains to be seen, but it’s fair to say that the president is signaling that he is willing to use all the powers of the U.S. government to satisfy his vendetta against those he believes have wronged him. During his speech in Davos, Switzerland, last month, Trump ominously announced that “people will soon be prosecuted for what they did,” while again insisting that the 2020 presidential election he lost was rigged. And just this week, Trump, while speaking on a podcast hosted by former U.S. Deputy Director of the FBI Dan Bongino, openly admitted that he believes Republicans “ought to nationalize the voting. We have states that I won that show I didn’t win. You’re gonna see something in Georgia.”

As someone deeply familiar with the inner workings of Trump’s mind, former special counsel Jack Smith, said during his Congressional testimony last month, Georgia was “ground zero” for the president’s alleged criminal misconduct just five years ago. It could be so again this November.

On this week’s Amicus Plus bonus episode, Dahlia Lithwick was joined by Kristin Clarens, an immigration lawyer and advocate who has focused much of her 20-year career on unaccompanied youth and noncitizen kids. Clarens teaches a course at the University of Virginia School of Law to help young lawyers understand the impact of the immigration system on communities. The pair discussed the brutal toll Donald Trump’s mass-deportation policy is taking on children and families. Their conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: Can you talk about the Trump administration’s theory of the case in these immigration sweeps that caught up Liam Ramos and other children, who were rushed into detention centers before there was time to file legal proceedings to protect them?

Kristin Clarens: I think this government is playing with the public’s idea of who has broken the law. There’s a real disconnect between individuals who are in our communities—they’re our neighbors, they’re following the letter of the law as we understood it a year ago, a month ago, a week ago—and the government’s actions. Following the law doesn’t protect these families from this type of aggressive and egregious enforcement that fell on the shoulders of this sweet-faced child. You could see the confusion and fear in his face, but what you didn’t see is the confusion on the faces of the attorneys and other legal advocates trying to navigate a system that’s changing underneath our feet, a system that doesn’t offer protection even for people who are following the law.

I am not this family’s lawyer, but my understanding is that Liam’s family came here to seek asylum: They filed their asylum application as they were supposed to. They have gone to court. There are lots of requirements when a person is applying for asylum, and my understanding is that they have followed them all. It is also my understanding that to the extent there have been any legal issues with Liam’s parents, it’d be the same that many of us have—a speeding ticket. I’d hate for somebody to look at my driving record and assign some sort of moral criminality to me, for that to indicate that I’m suddenly the type of person who should be picked up and drop-kicked into a detention center, maybe with my kids. That doesn’t seem like the type of criminal behavior the American public is looking to root out. What we’re seeing with enforcement from this administration is that even people who are following the law, to the extent that that law has been spelled out, are being stopped and detained and ultimately sent, maybe not to their country of origin but, even more mystifyingly, to another random country, potentially even a random continent.

So we have this tension between the idea that there’s a legal process and that if you don’t follow it, you must face consequences, but that legal process is constantly changing, and you may face new unforeseen consequences that are so devastating, especially for young children. And this cannot be fixed. This child’s time in the detention center, whether it’s three days or three months, or time out of this country as he tries to get back to his mom—we can’t fix that even if we ultimately do find ways to repair some of the breakdowns in the system that this administration has caused.

You’ve worked at that immigration facility in Dilley, Texas, where Liam was being held. We all saw absolutely shattering footage last week, when members of Congress visited him and his dad. We can’t see the facility—it’s not open to the press or cameras—but can you paint a picture of what it looks like? What is happening there?

Dilley is one of the parts of Texas that might exist in many of our imaginations, because we saw these images of shipping-container-type places on the side of the highway with tumbleweeds and lots of undulating desert. Sometimes at the bottom of those undulations are culverts, or Department of Homeland Security vehicles will pop up. Along the stretch of highway beside the Dilley campus is a big privacy fence that runs around the facility.

When I worked there, I was part of one of the teams on-site when families were being reunited after family separation during Trump 1.0. We were mostly in this large conference room, like a church lunchroom, with tons of long tables in the middle, with these little semiprivate consult rooms off to the side. There were TVs all over the place, playing whatever advocates could think of to try to captivate the attention of these kids. One of the movies that was playing was Transformers. Now, every time I think of those images of Los Angeles and the excitement and hope of that movie, it collides with my memories of all these scared kids who were sitting on the floor while we tried to make connections with them. Much like we’ve heard from Minneapolis, these adults in the room end up having to walk these kids into an immigration court where they know they’re going to be detained, or we’re with these children, knowing that they’re likely to be removed, or they have just suffered separation. It’s such an incredibly challenging moment to try to connect with this young child who’s never met you, not to mention, in a lot of instances, cultural and linguistic barriers.

Dilley feels like a prison or a jail. The security measures you have to take to get in are extensive. There’s no freedom to walk around. We advocates were not even allowed to leave the conference-room hall we were in. There’s an asylum officer on-site, and when we were allowed to attend some of the hearings, we’d have to be accompanied by armed guards. It’s a pretty desolate place. Sometimes DHS and the administrations will try to characterize these facilities as “summer camps.” They’re certainly compelled by a settlement agreement to try to make them the least restrictive possible, but having worked in many prisons, it feels like a prison.

Dilley was mothballed in 2024, after President Joe Biden phased out family detention in 2021, but CoreCivic, the private-prison company that runs the facility, reopened the 2,400-bed South Texas facility last year, in Trump’s second term. The Trump administration is capable of learning, and it seems to have learned from its mistakes in 1.0, reverse-engineering a new kind of family separation in 2.0 that looks different: You can tear families apart and traumatize children and parents in ways that don’t make the headlines that maybe kids in cages did. Learned is a generous word, but what has this administration done to hide some of the worst iterations of what Family Separation 2.0 looks like on the ground this time?

This administration went back to the drawing board after Trump 1.0 and developed a strategic wraparound approach to dismantling a system of humanitarian protections here in this country that have been core to our American spirit since certainly post-Holocaust, but even before that. Historically, it has mattered to us that we are a country that offers a safe haven for people. It matters to most of the voting public, but it doesn’t seem to matter to this administration because it has systematically looked at those sources of protection and, in undramatic and unphotogenic ways, torn them down.

In the first Trump administration, family separation went too far. The populace reacted so strongly to those images. Now, in Trump 2.0, those images don’t exist because, for the most part, immigration court is where so much of the family separation is occurring. It’s hard to get into immigration court, and it’s pretty boring when you get there. A lot of what happens in immigration court are routine hearings that set other hearings, or these lengthy hearings that are very legalistic, in which lawyers for the government and lawyers for individuals are arguing about legal standards for asylum or other forms of protection that really don’t seem to matter to communities. There’s a real disconnect between the legal system and the outcomes of that legal system. These arguments about legal standards for asylum shouldn’t result in a child being detained, because of the level of harm, and the perpetrator of the harm in the individual’s home country.

So the main thing that this administration is doing is making immigration court so unpredictable, so unfair, and so dangerous for individuals that it has stopped providing any source of support or safety. That in and of itself has led to deportations, detentions, and also many of what this administration calls “self-deportations,” which is this decision, after living with this uncertainty and fear and risk, to find somewhere else that will offer more safety. That often separates families and also tears apart communities, because many of our neighbors have decided that it’s just simply not worth it to live with this level of fear.

The other thing that’s happened under this administration, which is equally unphotogenic, is that the USCIS, the agency that offers visas or family-based petitions when people get married—maybe they came here as noncitizens but have married a citizen and now have kids and have been here for a long time—those processes have become completely distorted and totally unpredictable. People will show up for what used to be routine interviews, whether it’s a bona fide marriage, even though they don’t have a criminal record, and yet, without warning, they’ll be detained. That’s happening a lot. That unpredictability is leading to such heightened levels of fear in our communities that one of the things we do around here all the time is offer these standby guardianship clinics, where moms or dads will reach a point where they can’t function because they don’t have a plan for who will pick their child up at the bus stop if they’re deported or detained. And they’re worried about being deported or detained for reasons that don’t actually exist right now. The system has become so unpredictable and confusing and constantly shifting. We saw that in Minnesota last month, when teachers at Liam Ramos’ school were pushed to hand over other children to immigration court because perhaps the mom may have considered a standby guardianship but didn’t have anybody who was documented or here with secure status and just didn’t know what to do.

I think many of us have had that moment with our children, right? What happens in the worst-case scenario if for whatever reason we can’t get to the bus stop? It’s part of the reason community matters so much, because for most of us hopefully there are friends or family members or people we’ve worked closely and lived closely together with. But for people living with this randomized terror right now, that’s become really hard, and it’s probably the biggest way that family separation, or really community separation, is playing out. The fear that there would be nowhere safe for you, that you can’t predict what would happen to you, that you don’t understand the legal system that you thought you were following but maybe you’re doing it wrong. Maybe all of us are doing slight things wrong all the time? To think that that could result in your child being detained is pretty scary.

The numbers of detained kids are skyrocketing. According to the Marshall Project, the average number of kids in immigration detention has jumped sixfold since the start of Trump 2.0. Can you talk about what is behind those numbers and help us understand the financial incentives? Because I think you can’t comprehend any of this without knowing who’s getting rich and why.

One of the reasons the numbers are skyrocketing is because families and young children were not detained at this scale under the Biden administration. I think there are probably many reasons for that. One easy reason is COVID, but maybe a more compelling reason is that there was no appetite for family detention following family separation. It was clearly unpopular, and it remains unpopular. It’s heartbreaking to look at these kids’ faces as they’re enduring the personal ramifications of these policies.

Over the past year, the Trump administration has sometimes publicly and sometimes quietly scaled up family-detention capacity. It reopened Dilley, it put the other ones back online, and it has gotten an extensive amount of funding to pay contractors to open more facilities and facilities of different types. If you google it, you’ll find that in most communities there are proposed warehouses for different types of detention facilities—sometimes office buildings, sometimes old Walmarts, things like that.

There’s an enormous old repurposed Walmart in the Rio Grande Valley that is just such a heartbreaking statement of where we are in our country. The Walmart sign has bad plastic wrapping around it that reads “Southwest Key Detention Center.” That’s a teen detention center. Kids are put into different types of facilities, depending on their ages and various risk factors. Family facilities seem to be on the rise, in part because of these private groups that manage detention facilities for DHS. They’re super lucrative. Their directors are highly politically involved and have been close to this administration. It’s the same story that we’re seeing all over the place in politics right now—a kind of a pay-to-play model that this administration knows very well, as do the people who are benefiting from it.

The year was 1986: a time of Cold War espionage and deep suspicion. Relations between Washington and Moscow were starting to thaw, yet a staggering stockpile of almost 70,000 nuclear warheads meant the threat of annihilation lingered in the air. Then something pretty extraordinary happened: Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev sent a letter to Ronald Reagan proposing they “enter the third millennium without nuclear weapons.” What came after was a historic summit where, for a brief moment exactly 40 years ago, the elimination of global nuclear weapons looked actually achievable.

“It cemented the idea that nuclear disarmament is something that we need to aspire to,” Nick Ritchie, professor of international security at the University of York, tells Slate. Fast forward to today, however, and that nuclear-free vision is yet to materialize. Nuclear stockpiles are creeping up again (we’re now at around 12,400), and the world appears to be drifting toward a “new nuclear arms race” that is prompting concern among experts.

So what happened to the ambition of nuclear disarmament? Given current global tensions, expiring treaties, and the acceleration of atomic programs, one could dismiss the events of 1986 as a failure. But looking back at that year of nuclear diplomacy paints a more complex picture—one that today’s leaders could actually learn from.

Central to the idea of global nuclear disarmament was the historic Reykjavik Summit of October 1986 in Iceland, where, alongside top negotiators and aides, Reagan and Gorbachev met in person and nearly agreed to a nuclear-free future. It had already been quite a year: the doomed Challenger space shuttle had exploded months earlier, and the disaster at Chernobyl was on everyone’s minds. Yet there, a quaint wooden house on the banks of Iceland’s scenic capital hosted the “most bizarre summit” of the Cold War.

“What was supposed to be a prelude to a formal summit turned into an incredibly important 48 hours,” historian James Graham Wilson tells Slate. Both leaders came with lofty goals, yet discussed methodical steps that included a 50 percent cut in strategic nuclear arms, with the ultimate target of abolishing the entire global nuclear stockpile by the year 2000. The energy was palpable behind the scenes: U.S. teams placed a door on top of a bathtub that served as a desk, where the sides established negotiating positions and discussed plans long into the night.

But talks stalled at the eleventh hour, with negotiations crumbling partly due to America’s nicknamed “Star Wars” program, the space-based missile defense system that America was trying to develop to prevent a nuclear attack. “The sticking point was always the Strategic Defense Initiative, which Reagan thinks is essential and Gorbachev thinks is a deal-breaker in their common cause of eliminating nuclear weapons,” Wilson says.

But far from seeing both sides as leaving empty-handed, many consider Reykjavik crucial.

Having spent most of her professional life working in nuclear diplomacy and arms control as well as serving under various U.S. administrations, former NATO deputy secretary general Rose Gottemoeller tells Slate the summit not only moved the needle but brought a common goal firmly into focus. “Reykjavik was such a startling shift from where we had been just a short time prior, when we had these major nuclear crises,” Gottemoeller explained. Historical records reveal there were several close calls in the early ’80s, including the 1983 Soviet nuclear false alarm that could have triggered a nuclear war.

What came after the summit is key. Sustaining the momentum for disarmament, Reykjavik was the genesis of several crucial treaties that did indeed reduce nuclear weapons stockpiles. This included the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 1987 and the START I treaty in 1991. “Nuclear arms control, as we’ve conducted it with the USSR and Russian Federation, has been a huge success for strategic stability, for stability and predictability not only for Moscow and Washington but for the global strategic stability as well,” Gottemoeller said. “It’s been a big success.”

Year by year, progress seems to continue. The Cold War ended, and further treaties, such as the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty of 1996, were ratified, while nuclear stockpiles declined. “In the past 40 years, since Reykjavik, we’ve gone from 12,000 deployed warheads on each side down to 1,550,” Gottemoeller continues. “That’s still a lot of warheads, but it is a huge drop from the Cold War highs.”

Yet the political possibility demonstrated at Reykjavik was also followed by setbacks. START II, which aimed to eliminate multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles on intercontinental ballistic missiles in 1993, was, as Wilson put it, the “greatest nuclear arms treaty ever.” MIRVs, which have several warheads on one missile, are particularly dangerous because they create a “use them or lose them” scenario in the case of an impending attack. However, the treaty never came into force. “The great tragedy is not that we failed to reach zero nuclear weapons,” he said, “it’s that we never eliminated the most destabilizing systems.”

Fast forward to the present day, and almost all of the nuclear treaties hashed out between the U.S. and Russia have now expired, including the INF and START I. The New START treaty, the last remaining agreement between the two, will almost certainly lapse in February 2026—even though Russia’s Vladimir Putin proposed a one-year extension. “That’s significant,” Ritchie added. “This will be the first time since the ’70s when there has not been a treaty between the United States and Russia, previously the Soviet Union, that put some sort of limits on their strategic nuclear arsenals.”

The potential lack of a treaty is not necessarily cause for panic. Though the foundations that have upheld nuclear limits are being shaken, several experts pointed out that we have lived through periods when treaties weren’t in force, yet mutual restraint prevailed.

The prospects for total disarmament today are also shaped by an entirely different geopolitical landscape and nuclear players that Cold War negotiators never had to reckon with. Specifically, it’s no longer a two-sided arms race. “It’s very difficult to see at the moment a continued trajectory of the kind we’ve been on, mostly because the Chinese are building up so rapidly,” says Gottemoeller. “And that is creating a new wrinkle in what has been a steady march toward reduced numbers by the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., now Russia.” While the U.S. and Russia maintain the largest stockpiles and are accustomed to decades of bilateral nuclear diplomacy, China is adding around 100 nuclear weapons a year and shares frosty relations with U.S dealmakers.

A multitude of factors will shape what comes next: not least, the volatility in U.S. foreign policy and the erosion of international law. “The risk of nuclear war is not zero, it’s greater than zero,” notes Ritchie. Rather than disarmament, deterrence (having nuclear weapons to deter an adversary from using theirs against you) is also a prevailing narrative, even though those concepts are arguably incompatible. Ritchie continued: “The longer we live in a nuclear-armed world, the more chance we’re taking. … Nuclear weapons, from a disarmament perspective, are not compatible with the long-term survival and security of humanity.”

Instead of building up arsenals, Gottemoeller says the focus should be on maintaining minimal nuclear deterrence and improving conventional forces. “Everybody’s talking about a new nuclear arms race, so I’m not optimistic about that. We should do everything we can to head off a new nuclear arms race because, honestly, nuclear weapons are 80 years old, and the missiles that they go on are 70 years old,” she said. “Do we really want to be pouring money into this 80-year-old technology that is a weapon of mass destruction and is built for deterrence? It’s not built for use on the battlefield. It’s not built for fighting. It’s built to stay on the shelf and deter our adversaries.”

The jury is still out over whether Reykjavik could have actually worked if Reagan and Gorbachev walked away with a deal. But four decades on, the ultimate risks that brought them to the table haven’t changed. Among debates about the nuclear future, Florian Eblenkamp, advocacy coordinator at the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, says 2026 is “a big year for international treaties on nuclear weapons,” with review conferences for the NPT Treaty and TPNW scheduled for later this year. These opportunities, at least, offer nations a chance to address existing problems and keep the momentum going. But are dreams of disarmament still on the table? The lessons of 1986 show that with the right setting and right leaders, a Reykjavik moment isn’t a pipe dream.

“It looks daunting, but in a way, Russia and the United States never really cared about international law,” Eblenkamp said. “And yet the Reykjavik summit happened, and two presidents realized that spending so much money on nuclear weapons and something that could end the world multiple times is just insane. … I think sanity will come back.”

&quot;Frustrated&quot; by the agency failing to notify defenders when key pieces of intel change, Glenn Thorpe, senior director of security research and detection engineering at GreyNoise, counted the number of missed opportunities to potentially stop ransomware attacks last year.

CISA maintains its Known Exploited Vulnerability (KEV) catalog and populates it on a near-daily basis with details about the vulnerabilities attackers are exploiting to successfully gain access to victims&#39; networks.

The purpose of the catalog is to identify the most serious vulnerabilities at any given time, and inform defenders, especially those working for federal agencies, about which bugs should be prioritized.

One of the features of the catalog is that it indicates whether or not CISA is aware of a given vulnerability being used by those carrying out ransomware attacks.

Generally seen as the most damaging, infosec pros tend to prioritize the security flaws that could lead to stolen and encrypted files. Previous research has shown that these vulnerabilities are patched 2.5 times faster than those that aren&#39;t associated with ransomware attacks.

The thing is, the rapid speed at which CISA adds these new bugs to the catalog often outpaces defenders. As Thorpe discovered, the bugs CISA adds to the catalog are only known to be exploited by ransomware affiliates after being added, and CISA does not alert techies when its &quot;known ransomware use&quot; indicator switches from &quot;unknown&quot; to &quot;known.&quot;

&quot;When that field flips from &#39;Unknown&#39; to &#39;Known,&#39; CISA is saying: &#39;We have evidence that ransomware operators are now using this vulnerability in their campaigns,&#39;&quot; said Thorpe.

&quot;That&#39;s a material change in your risk posture. Your prioritization calculus should shift. But there&#39;s no alert, no announcement. Just a field change in a JSON file.&quot;

Thorpe&#39;s analysis of the 59 flipped vulnerabilities revealed that the largest share (16) were Microsoft CVEs, while the other common vendors included Ivanti, Fortinet, PANW, and Zimbra.

&quot;Ransomware operators are economic actors after all. They invest in exploit development for platforms with high deployment and high-value access. Firewalls, VPN concentrators, and email servers fit that profile perfectly.&quot;

He also found that more than a third (39 percent) of the bugs confirmed to be used in ransomware campaigns in 2025 were first added to the KEV catalog before 2023. The oldest to flip last year was a bug added 1,353 days prior, while the fastest to flip was in just one day.

Bear in mind: some vulnerabilities are known to be used by ransomware crews at the time of being added, so their &quot;known ransomware use&quot; indicator was always set to &quot;Known,&quot; i.e. they never flipped.

Thorpe went on to say that authentication bypasses and remote code execution flaws were the most likely to flip after being added to the KEV catalog.

GreyNoise has now released an RSS feed to which defenders can subscribe to see when KEV catalog entries&#39; ransomware statuses change.

The feed updates hourly, and is the product of Thorpe&#39;s unrealized hopes of change following a 2024 BSidesLV presentation.

            <h2>Palantir declares itself the guardian of Americans' rights</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/03/palantir_american_rights/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Opinion Palantir had a whopper of a Q4, showing accelerating revenue growth, beating Wall Street&#39;s profit estimates, and enjoying a share price jump of as much as 11% during pre-market trading on Tuesday before coming back down to earth.

At such a triumphal moment, it was striking that the company was forced on the defensive, not least for its involvement with the controversial US agency Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which began in 2011. ICE has drawn criticism for its activities in Minnesota over the last month after its agents shot and killed two American citizens while bystanders captured the events on video.

As it announced its booming financial results, Palantir was prepared. CEO Alex Karp told CNBC: &quot;If you are critical of ICE, you should be out there protesting for more Palantir. Our product, actually, in its core, requires people to conform with Fourth Amendment data protection.&quot;

In fact, Karp had already mapped out this argument in a letter to investors and during a call with financial analysts.

The actual numbers were strong, as Palantir reported Q4 revenue of $1.41 billion, up 70 percent year-on-year. Revenue for calendar 2025 grew 56 percent to hit $4.475 billion. Underlying operating profit for the quarter more than doubled to $798 million.

Palantir&#39;s growth is being driven in part by a boom in government deals. US government revenue for the quarter grew 66 percent year-over-year to $570 million, more than half of its US revenue and more than a third of its total revenue.

On an earnings call, Karp said the company&#39;s software inherently instills the protection of individual rights.

&quot;From the beginning, we have stuck to our very strong values of expanding what we believe is the noble side of the West ... meaning domestic institutions, intelligence institutions [are] essentially taking an incatenation of the Fourth Amendment, which is completely represented by our pipelining, Foundry, and impregnating institutions with it so that every institution that uses our product is doing it within conformity of the law and the ethics of America,&quot; he said.

In a letter prepared for investors, Karp had already laid out these arguments. &quot;It should indeed be uncontroversial that the single most effective means of guarding against incursions into our private lives is to invest in the development of a technical platform that makes possible constraints on government action and investigation through granular permissioning capabilities, to ensure that the state and its agents can see only what ought to be seen, and functional audit logs, to ensnare both external and internal threats.&quot;

&quot;The construction of such a platform, one that reflects our ethical commitments, should, of course, be a rallying cry for progressives and critical thinkers across the political spectrum who profess to be interested in advancing the values of the Fourth Amendment,&quot; he said.

As if aware of the need to pre-empt critics, Karp indulged in what could be described as a political diatribe, full of philosophical references that some may see at odds with any ordinary requirement to promote a software company.

&quot;We have, as a country and perhaps as well a civilization, grown uncertain of what we believe and far too fearful of embracing any degree of cultural specificity in our communal lives, banishing sentiment and belief from the public and corporate spheres under an often-hollow banner of inclusion,&quot; he complained.

Karp lamented that a &quot;common set of values and sentiments&quot; is missing when the focus is on inclusion, as he sees it.

&quot;It seems at times that we have abandoned any hope of patrolling the boundaries of our community, of resisting the superficial appeal of a hollow pluralism, in which all cultures and cultural values are declared by fiat and without reflection equal,&quot; the letter said.

Is he ignorant that some people in Minnesota feel the need to patrol their own communities to protect it from an outside presence, ICE, an entity that boosts Palantir&#39;s top line?

Heaven forbid anyone sees the need to come together to oppose such government actions.

He said: &quot;An uncomfortable fact is that those who are most bearish on their own abilities often turn to organizing politically,&quot; to which one might respond that those who are rich don&#39;t need to.

The CEO&#39;s statements that Palantir is protecting the Fourth Amendment run counter to ICE&#39;s own legal memorandum and what judges in Minnesota have found, which is that ICE has violated the Fourth Amendment during its most recent surge in the state where it deployed 3,000 federal agents into a community normally patrolled by a few hundred police.

On Jan. 15, US District Court judge Jeffrey Bryan ordered the release of a Liberian man after he determined agents violated the Fourth Amendment when they used a battering ram to raid the home he shares with his wife and 9-year old child.

&quot;Although Garrison G. and his wife repeatedly asked the agents to show them a judicial warrant authorizing entry into their home, and the agents stated that they had a warrant, the agents did not produce a judicial warrant. Only after agents forcibly opened the front door and entered the house did they show Garrison G.&#39;s wife any documentation. The document presented was not a judicial warrant,&quot; Bryan wrote in the order releasing the man.

&quot;Respondents&#39; arrest of Garrison G. violated the Fourth Amendment. To arrest him, Respondents forcibly entered Garrison G&#39;s home without his consent and without a judicial warrant. For this Independent reason, Garrison G.&#39;s detention is unlawful, and the Court orders his immediate release.&quot;

Bryan’s ruling upended instructions to agents in the field, which directed that ICE may enter homes without a judicial warrant in cases where the government has a removal order. According to the Associated Press, the memo was signed by the acting director of ICE, Todd Lyons, and has been in effect since May 12, 2025.

&quot;Although the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence, the DHS Office of the General Counsel has recently determined that the U.S. Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose,&quot; the memo states.

Karp&#39;s detractors might see the most straightforward explanation of his need for philosophical references as well-dressed political chicanery. A few slashes of Occam&#39;s razor reveal that, given the number of assumptions it takes to believe Karp or follow his arguments, it&#39;s more likely he wants to make his investors feel better (and more intellectually superior) about their holdings in his company. That&#39;s smart business, but we could do without the song and dance. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft has reported two Azure service wobbles in as many days, including a disruption affecting Virtual Machine management ops yesterday and a Managed Identity for Azure resources outage in East US and West US regions today.

According to Microsoft, today&#39;s Managed Identity for Azure resources issue impacted the East US and West US regions and lasted almost six hours, from 0015 UTC to 0605 UTC. The problem hit when users were trying to create, update, delete, or acquire tokens.

Security vulnerabilities and system downtime often stem from the manual management of secrets and certificates. Managed Identity for Azure resources is intended to removes the burden of credential management from developers.

The outage, which has been mitigated, &quot;impacted dependent services such as Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Databricks, Azure Stream Analytics, Azure Kubernetes Service, Microsoft Copilot Studio, Azure Chaos Studio, Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Servers, Azure Container Apps, and Azure AI Video Indexer.&quot; So rather a lot.

The blackout followed hot on the heels of another, where service management operations for virtual machines resulted in error notifications. Microsoft gave the example of &quot;create, delete, update, scaling, start, stop.&quot;

As with this morning&#39;s downtime, yesterday&#39;s problem was exacerbated because services had dependencies on these operations, including Azure Arc Enabled Servers, Azure Batch, Azure Cache for Redis, Azure Container Apps, Azure DevOps (ADO), Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure Backup, Azure Load Testing, Azure Firewall, Azure Search, Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS), and GitHub.

Microsoft acknowledged the issue last night at 1946 UTC but did not provide a timeline for mitigation. The Register asked for more details and will update this piece should the company respond.

GitHub noted degraded performance for Actions at 1903 UTC, and it took until 0056 UTC on February 3 for the code shack to state that the incident was resolved.

As for what caused the virtual machine outage, Microsoft said: &quot;We identified the root cause as a configuration change that unintentionally restricted public access to certain Microsoft‑managed storage accounts used to host virtual machine extension packages.&quot;

Yes, Microsoft made a configuration change that inadvertently broke things for developers in multiple regions. Those same developers would likely have some advice for Microsoft on testing changes before deploying to production.

The issues highlight the interdependencies between cloud services. A faulty configuration change in one place can result in a cascade of problems elsewhere. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Partner Content Physical AI and robotics are moving from the lab to the real world— and the cost of getting it wrong is no longer theoretical. With robots deployed in factories, warehouses, and public settings, large-scale simulation has become tightly coupled with real-world operations.

Physical AI companies need new types of infrastructure to continuously build, train, simulate, and deploy models that operate in dynamic, physical environments. With the cloud&#39;s current limitations, the next wave of physical AI won&#39;t scale.

Here are three reasons why the infrastructure stack needs to be purpose-built for physical AI.

1. The need for — and scarcity of — training data

Physical AI can&#39;t be trained on internet text, like an LLM. It requires context-specific data — from images and video to LiDAR, sensor streams, and motion data — that maps directly to actions and outcomes. With variation across environments, tasks, and hardware configurations, this data is not easy to obtain.

Collecting training data exclusively in the real world is slow and expensive. Virtual environments allow teams to generate synthetic data, test edge cases, and iterate faster than real-world deployment alone.

Simulation has become a critical way to bootstrap training, but scaling it is a heavy lift. It requires orchestrating large GPU fleets, parallelizing simulations, preparing &quot;sim-ready&quot; 3D assets, and often using different classes of GPUs than training or inference. Inference inside simulation mirrors the forward pass on real robots, but must run at massive scale, optimized for throughput rather than latency, which creates a distinct infrastructure requirement of its own.

Hardware reliability matters here: when simulations run across thousands of GPUs, interruptions or failures can derail entire training cycles. Price-performance ratio and mean time to failure become first-order concerns when choosing a cloud for simulations.

Data usability presents another challenge. Once physical AI systems are deployed, teams are suddenly faced with massive volumes of data, including simulation output alongside photos, video, LiDAR, and sensor data from active robots.

Simply dumping multimodal training data into object storage won&#39;t work. Unlike curated training datasets, this data is noisy, contextual, and time sensitive. To be useful, it must be indexed, synchronized, and organized (ideally, through automated pipelines) so teams can search, segment, and select the right data for each training run.

Latency raises the stakes further. Physical systems must react in milliseconds, which rules out centralized, batch-style processing. As a result, physical AI increasingly relies on fast inference at the edge paired with higher-level planning and coordination models in the cloud, operating together as a single system.

Sophisticated platforms must be purpose-built for multimodal ingestion and querying. Without them, more data does not translate to better models.

In physical AI, the hardest problem is often not model size — it&#39;s moving data. Robotics systems generate continuous streams of video, sensor readings, and motion data that must be processed and acted on in real time.

In these systems, infrastructure breaks in unexpected ways. Many existing platforms were designed for batch-style workloads; they struggle when faced with sustained, high-throughput multimodal data. Scaling GPUs alone is not enough if data cannot move quickly and efficiently between devices, local systems, and the cloud.

The expense of moving this data adds up quickly. Transferring large volumes across systems can cost more than storing it, making naive scaling inefficient. Supporting physical AI at scale requires infrastructure optimized for fast read and write performance, high-bandwidth pipelines, and predictable throughput — not just more memory or more compute.

Physical AI is pushing AI out of controlled, digital environments and into the real world, where failure modes are physical, rather than theoretical. These systems place new demands on compute, networks, and data infrastructure, and there is no single blueprint yet for how to build them.

Coordinating a single robot is difficult. Scaling that to fleets operating in dynamic environments — continuously learning from simulation and real-world feedback — raises the bar higher. Data becomes more valuable, latency more consequential, and infrastructure decisions more tightly coupled to system behavior.

Progress in physical AI depends not just on better models, but on infrastructure that can support continuous learning, real-time response, and coordination across edge and cloud systems. Failing to meet these requirements risks stalled deployments, unreliable systems, and real-world consequences.

The challenges are clear. By necessity, a robust physical AI stack will be a hybrid of large-scale simulation and training in the cloud paired with fast, on-device inference and continuous learning at the edge. The question now is who will build it first.

The AI stack of the future isn&#39;t defined by raw compute alone. It&#39;s shaped by speed, data movement, orchestration, and the ability to operate seamlessly across virtual and physical worlds.

At Nebius, we are obsessed with solving the unique constraints of the physical world. We are engineering the infrastructure specifically for this next phase of AI, combining optimal price-performance GPUs and high-throughput storage with flexible, managed orchestration designed to handle the dynamic nature of robotics workloads.

Whether you are bursting massive simulation workloads via Slurm or training foundation models on reliable large-scale clusters, Nebius provides the foundation to move faster, scale reliably, and operate with confidence.

The best way to understand the difference is to experience it. Sign up today to start building on Nebius, or contact our Physical AI team to discuss how Nebius can support your architecture.

            <h2>Europe shrugs off tariffs, plots to end tech reliance on US</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/03/europe_tariffs_forrester/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">US tariffs may be squeezing Europe&#39;s trade balance, but they are also pushing governments and businesses to spend big on keeping tech closer to home.

A new forecast from Forrester says that European tech spending will climb 6.3 percent in 2026, lifting the continent&#39;s tech bill above €1.5 trillion for the first time, as governments and enterprises pour cash into AI, cloud, cybersecurity, and the infrastructure needed to run them without leaning quite so heavily on US providers.

US tariffs are already causing problems, and Ireland is feeling it more than most thanks to its reliance on US multinationals. The knock-on effect is a smaller EU trade surplus and slower growth in the countries most exposed. Even so, Forrester expects the wider EU economy to hold its nerve, with real GDP growth in 2026 matching 2025, supported by strong intra-European trade and a steady ramp-up in defense spending.

That resilience is showing up most clearly in tech budgets. Hardware leads the charge, with spending forecast to jump 14.3 percent as organizations scramble to buy AI-optimized servers and supporting infrastructure. Software follows closely behind, with an 11.2 percent increase driven by demand for cybersecurity tools and public cloud platforms. IT services growth lags at 3.7 percent, a gap that suggests a broader shift toward owning critical capabilities rather than renting them indefinitely from hyperscalers.

Forrester frames much of this as a sovereignty play, and it is hard to argue otherwise. Across Europe, money is going into sovereign cloud platforms, AI-ready infrastructure, and tighter rules on where data lives and who can access it.

The UK, Brexit or not, is heading the same way, putting more weight behind domestic AI compute, cloud infrastructure, and homegrown chip efforts.

Defense and healthcare sit at the center of that strategy. Forrester expects UK defense R&D spending to grow by about 9 percent a year from 2026 to 2030, driven by geopolitical tensions and a renewed appetite for advanced equipment. Healthcare is heading the same way, with NHS technology spending on track to almost double to £10 billion by 2029 as the service leans on digital systems to plug staffing gaps and keep aging infrastructure going.

Michael O&#39;Grady, principal forecast analyst at Forrester, says the UK has largely moved past AI dabbling and into day-to-day use, especially in financial services, where - he claims - around three-quarters of firms already have AI running in production.

&quot;The UK is moving swiftly from AI experimentation to performance, particularly in the financial sector,&quot; he said. &quot;Despite external economic pressures and tariff risks, the UK&#39;s strategy to increase AI compute capacity and target £22.6 billion in R&D spending by 2030 signals a clear, long-term vision for technological leadership.&quot;

Forrester isn&#39;t pretending tariffs, power limits, or geopolitics have magically disappeared. What the numbers do show is that Europe has stopped waiting for things to calm down.

The money is going in now, sovereignty is back on the agenda, and the thinking seems to be that owning more of the stack is less painful than relying on it later. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Longtime HP CEO Enrique Lores is decamping for a top job at PayPal, handing the reins to an interim chief while the business hunts for a permanent successor.

In a double leadership shake-up, HP confirmed that Lores has stepped down as president, CEO, and board member to take the top executive role at PayPal, effective March 1, with the payments outfit lauding his &quot;strong track record&quot; and &quot;disciplined execution.&quot;

HP&#39;s board immediately installed Bruce Broussard as interim CEO. A board member since 2021, Broussard is a seasoned corporate hand best known outside tech for more than a decade running healthcare giant Humana and earlier leadership roles at US Oncology. HP said it has engaged a global search firm to find a permanent chief.

&quot;Disciplined execution is delivering consistent progress in a dynamic environment,&quot; said HP chair Chip Bergh in a statement that could have doubled as a year-end earnings memo. &quot;We believe we have the right strategy in place, and Bruce is the right leader to move HP forward while we identify our next CEO.&quot;

Broussard struck the expected CEO-in-waiting tone, saying HP&#39;s &quot;relentless commitment to empowering people and businesses&quot; positions the company well as it advances its &quot;One HP&quot; strategy amid complex macro and hardware markets.

Lores, an HP veteran who started as an intern and ascended to the corner office in late 2019, oversaw the company&#39;s push to reframe itself as an AI-focused workplace tech company while defending its core PC and print franchises – including its bid to make printing a subscription.

His tenure played out against a tough hardware market and a broader switch toward AI-enabled products and services – pressures that were laid bare in HP&#39;s Q4 results, where the company flagged a restructuring plan that could cut between 4,000 and 6,000 jobs by 2028.

When Lores took the top job in 2019, HP was pulling in about $58.8 billion a year in revenue. Almost six years on, annual revenue sits lower, at roughly $55.3 billion. The journey has been anything but dull – even if the top line has ended up more or less where it started.

At PayPal, the board said it evaluated its competitive position before settling on Lores as the leader it believes can drive growth and execution. PayPal CFO and COO Jamie Miller will serve as interim CEO until Lores assumes the post.

The moves highlight an interesting cross-sector leap: a hardware CEO known for balancing legacy businesses with emerging services now helming a global digital payments platform facing its own set of growth challenges – PayPal has seen its stock tumble by more than 23 percent in the last three months.

For HP, the question is whether Broussard can steady a business still weighed down by soft PC demand and tight enterprise budgets – especially when annual revenue is now lower than it was when Lores took over in 2019 despite years of restructuring and reinvention. ®

The Grok investigations are growing, as Paris prosecutors summoned Elon Musk and Linda Yaccarino to testify.

A raid on X’s Paris office was carried out by the Paris prosecutor’s cybercrime unit on Tuesday with Europol and French police as part of an ongoing investigation that expanded in July to include Grok. As previously reported by Reuters, Elon Musk and former X CEO Linda Yaccarino were also summoned for hearings in April.

The investigation, which was initially launched last year, is looking into several allegations against X and Grok, including complicity in possession and distribution of child pornography and denial of crimes against humanity (related to Holocaust denial content), along with claims that X was manipulating its algorithm and illegally extracting data.

On Tuesday, the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) also announced a separate formal investigation into X and xAI involving Grok and “its potential to produce harmful sexualised image and video content.” It joins another ongoing investigation in the UK from Ofcom, which also shared an update on Tuesday stating that it is not currently investigating xAI, but is still “gathering and analysing evidence to determine whether X has broken the law.”

            <div id="article-text">During the Switch era, Nintendo turned itself into a much more ambitious entertainment company.

During the Switch era, Nintendo turned itself into a much more ambitious entertainment company.

Nintendo has had plenty of highs over its few decades in the video game industry. Popularizing home consoles with the NES, introducing new audiences to games through the Wii’s motion controls, and the touchscreen Trojan horse that was the Nintendo DS, to name a few. But often these successes were followed by missteps; the Wii sold 100 million units, while its follow-up, the Wii U, couldn’t even manage a quarter of that. But that precarity looks to change. The Switch is now Nintendo’s best-selling console ever, surpassing the DS with 155 million units sold since its debut in 2017. And over that span Nintendo has transformed itself into a company better insulated against the ever-changing whims of the games industry.

One of the key factors behind the Switch’s success was how it represented a more unified version of Nintendo. In 2013, the company merged its two main game development divisions, which had previously been split into home console and handheld groups. Given how the Switch straddled the line between console and handheld, this made a lot of sense. But it also allowed Nintendo to put the full might of its creative resources behind a single platform. The result was a string of massive hits: games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and Super Mario Odyssey all sold upward of 30 million copies.

Just as important, this structure allowed Nintendo to release big games consistently over the Switch’s lifespan. Even as the focus shifted to the next console, the Switch’s final years still included brand-new Zelda and Super Mario games. The structure has also allowed Nintendo to seamlessly continue this success into the launch of the Switch 2, which got off to a very fast start and debuted alongside a brand-new Mario Kart, which was followed by Donkey Kong and Metroid.

But outside of games, which form the core of the company, Nintendo has also used the Switch’s success to steadily branch out in new directions. In 2023, The Super Mario Bros. Movie hit theaters, earned more than $1 billion, and now Nintendo has both a sequel and a live-action Zelda movie on the way. Nintendo opened its first theme park in Japan in 2021, and has since expanded to Hollywood and Florida, with a location in Singapore due up next. The company even opened its own museum in 2024. In essence, Nintendo is building an entertainment empire. Its competition is increasingly the likes of Disney and Netflix in addition to Xbox and PlayStation. “I think people view Nintendo as a gaming company,” Shinya Takahashi, Nintendo’s senior managing executive officer, told me in 2023. “But we have always thought of ourselves as an entertainment company.”

It’s not a completely unique strategy: Just about every video game company is hoping to break out in film and television after the success of projects like The Last of Us, Fallout, and A Minecraft Movie. But in Nintendo’s case, the company seems to understand just how precarious a success like the Switch can be, and it used that success to steadily build itself up into something bigger in a deliberate, concerted way. It’s something Nintendo has tried to do before — see: the company’s ill-fated efforts into mobile gaming — but its resurgence during the Switch era allowed it to approach these ventures with a new level of focus and ambition. This is a company that’s so confident it’s about to release a $100 re-creation of the Virtual Boy, one of its greatest failures.

All of this is to say that the version of Nintendo that launched the Switch in 2017 is very different from the Nintendo that exists now. Its footing is more solid, its future is more clear. And that future involves more than video games. This doesn’t guarantee future success, of course. The Switch 2 may be off to a strong start, but it’s also facing many pressures outside of Nintendo’s control, some of which have led to a world where many game consoles now get more expensive over time.

But the new Switch also doesn’t need to match its predecessor’s success — it just needs to allow Nintendo to keep this momentum going.

Anthropic is working on implementing a fix to bring Claude Code back online.

Anthropic’s Claude AI models experienced a major outage today, impacting products like Claude Code. Developers were seeing a 500 error when trying to use Claude Code, and Anthropic said that it was seeing elevated error rates on its APIs “across all Claude models.”

Anthropic quickly identified the root cause and implemented a fix within around 20 minutes, but developers that rely on the tool were left staring at their screens waiting for the service to come back online. Claude Opus 4.5 also experienced some errors yesterday, and earlier this week Anthropic had to fix purchasing issues for its AI credits system.

It’s unusual to see Claude Code experience a major outage like this, especially as the service is used widely by developers, including Microsoft’s AI teams.

Update, February 3rd: Anthropic has now resolved its Claude API outage.

As The Verge’s resident robot vacuum reviewer, I don’t have a lot of time (or space) in my life for stick vacs, and frankly, the ones I have used have largely disappointed me. Top-heavy, bulky, always getting clogged or running out of battery — they’re so… manual. But then I met PencilVac Fluffycones, Dyson’s new $599 cordless stick vacuum, and it was love at first lift.

The name PencilVac Fluffycones perfectly describes this delightfully overengineered broom. If more vacuums had such whimsical names, my life would be much fuller. It’s very thin and light, like a pencil, and it has fluffy, cone-shaped rollers that glide across floors as if they’re flying.

While I do not recommend buying this as a tool to clean your entire home (it doesn’t clean carpets!), with its slim design and easy maneuverability, I’ve found it to be a great complement to a robot vacuum. The robot can do the hard work of vacuuming and mopping your floors, and this lightweight machine, which sits prettily in a magnetic charging dock, can be on hand for touch-ups and when it’s time to tackle stairs and baseboards.

A superskinny stick vac, Dyson’s PencilVac is an engineering marvel. While it won’t clean your whole house, it’s a simple. stylish option for quick touchups and other small tasks.

Touted by Dyson as “the world’s slimmest vacuum cleaner,” the PencilVac fits all its components into its 1.5-inch-diameter handle, which runs the length of the vacuum. Packed in here are the electronics, the battery, the dustbin, and a tiny 28mm-diameter motor that spins at 140,000 RPM to generate 55 air watts of suction.

This is the same motor as in Dyson’s Supersonic R hair dryer, and the handle is the same width around, so you’re basically using a reverse hair dryer to clean your floors.

Impressively, the PencilVac weighs less than four pounds and, combined with its maneuverability enabled by four caster rollers that allow it to pivot in multiple directions, it’s as easy to handle as a broom or Swiffer. Even my husband, who just had major shoulder surgery, was able to use it to clean the kitchen floor with no issues.

The PencilVac’s other unique selling point is its fluffycones — four fluffy, cone-shaped roller bars in the vacuum’s head. The idea is that long hair should move down the four cones and out from the edge of the vacuum, then be sucked up with a swipe. In practice, this worked fairly well, unless the aforementioned bundle of hair got too thick — in which case, it couldn’t always suck it up.

While the PencilVac looks and moves like a broom, it also kind of vacuums like one. Its suction power is half that of Dyson’s lowest-end cordless stick vacuum, the V8. It does great on dust, small tufts of hair, and lightweight debris like Cheerios and dried oatmeal. But give it anything thicker to tackle, and you’ll be frustrated.

This is why it works well as an add-on to a robot vacuum that regularly sweeps and mops your floors. Judging by Dyson’s press images, it’s also being marketed as a stylish option for those who live in immaculate apartments that are magically mostly spotless.

Unless you live in one of those apartments, I don’t see the PencilVac working as a primary vacuum for cleaning your house, especially if you have any carpets or rugs. But for quick touch-ups and getting dust bunnies off stairs — two areas robot vacuums don’t really do (one not easily, and the other not at all … yet) — it’s a great, albeit expensive, solution.

Less cumbersome than any stick vac I’ve used, it is super easy to use on stairs, and it was simple to find a space for its small, slim dock in a kitchen or bathroom, areas where you might want a high-powered broom on hand.

It’s more maneuverable than a stick vac, pivoting smoothly to go around furniture legs and lying completely flat to get under sofas and beds.

For deeper cleaning, the PencilVac’s included crevice tool/dusting attachment did a good job on baseboards and windowsills, and could reach up to lights and cobwebby corners. It also easily got into spaces robot vacuums can’t — like the gap behind the TV console.

I’ve only been using it for a couple of days, but I quickly got used to the lack of a handle. It really is just like using a broom.

The biggest problem is suction; it’s not a powerful vacuum, especially compared to Dyson’s stick vacs. It struggles with larger clumps of dirt and anything bigger than a fluffy dust bunny. As mentioned, it just flat-out doesn’t work on carpet.

It also only runs for 30 minutes on low and around 20 minutes on medium, which I found myself using most often. (There is a boost mode for some extra power.) All of which makes it great for a quick touch-up, but not for a whole-house clean.

One other thing to note: this is Dyson’s first stick vacuum to connect to the My Dyson app. This isn’t a plus, at least not yet. Functionally, it’s limited to software updates and filter-cleaning alerts. It also uses Bluetooth, so you have to be near the vacuum to update it, and the app kept insisting that I give it permanent access to my location for no clear reason.

Between the limited suction, short runtime, and inability to handle carpet, the PencilVac Fluffycones isn’t even pretending to be a whole-home cleaner. If you’re looking for a proper house cleaner in this price range, Dyson’s V8 Absolute is a better choice. It’s under six pounds and has twice the suction. While slightly less maneuverable, it will pick up all the dirt and clean your carpets, baseboards, and everything else.

But is it as fun as the PencilVac? Not even close. The PencilVac is Dyson at its best: a wildly overengineered device that’s delightful to use, entirely unnecessary, but something you’re probably going to really want anyway.

If your phone feels too small but most tablets feel too big, Apple’s latest iPad Mini functions as a nice in-between. Thankfully, if you’ve been waiting for a discount, the base model with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage is on sale at Amazon and Best Buy for $399 ($100 off), which is $50 shy of its best price to date and the cheapest it’s been since the holidays. If you need more storage, you can also grab the 256GB model at Amazon and Best Buy starting at $499, which nearly matches its all-time low.

At 8.3 inches, the iPad Mini is Apple’s most portable tablet. It’s only slightly heavier than the iPhone 17 Pro Max, which makes it especially comfortable to hold for long periods, particularly if you’re someone who likes to read a lot. It also runs on Apple’s A17 Pro chip, which, while older, is still snappy enough to use the newer multitasking system in iPadOS 26 to keep multiple apps open while researching or taking notes. It’s also fast enough for light gaming, watching Netflix, video chatting with loved ones, and even some light image editing.

The latest Mini also has a few other things going for it, even if the outdated camera placement leaves something to be desired. It’s still the cheapest iPad that supports the Apple Pencil Pro, which gives you access to advanced tools not available with the USB-C Apple Pencil, from pressure sensitivity to double-tap tool switching. It’s also the most affordable way to access Apple Intelligence, which, so far, includes features like ChatGPT integration, custom emoji, and the ability to rewrite or summarize text across apps. None of it is must-have at this point, but since when is a little futureproofing such a bad thing?

On The Vergecast: data-hungry AI models, Netflix movie theaters, and smart buttons.

When ChatGPT launched, in November of 2022, it started a race that almost immediately consumed the tech industry. OpenAI didn’t invent the concept of AI, but most of the state-of-the-art technology was confined to research labs at companies and institutions around the world. Then, suddenly, it was everywhere. And better than anyone expected. So many companies decided they needed to catch up as quickly as possible, by any means necessary, or risk losing the battle for maybe the most important technology ever.

On this episode of The Vergecast, we talk about one version of that scramble. The Washington Post’s Will Oremus joins the show to talk about the details he and his team uncovered about “Project Panama,” a huge effort inside Anthropic to access and digitize vast quantities of book in order to feed them into large language models. Anthropic’s plan — which included book cutters, piracy websites, and enormous warehouses — sounds a lot like what’s happening at other companies, too. The fight over whether any of it is right, legally or morally, is very much ongoing.

After that, Puck’s Julia Alexander joins the show to talk Netflix and the movies. As it continues to try to buy Warner Bros., Netflix is saying all the right things about movie theaters, big-budget films, and generally caring about Hollywood. But of course it is — it’s trying to buy Warner Bros.! Once this all shakes out, can theaters survive in an increasingly Netflix-ified world? Do people even want to see Netflix movies in theaters? And if not, what do we do with these big buildings and their big screens? Luckily we have some ideas.

Finally, The Verge’s Jennifer Pattison Tuohy answers a question from the Vergecast Hotline (call 866-VERGE11 or email vergecast@theverge.com!) about Ikea’s new smart buttons and why they don’t seem to work very well. In terrific news, one part of our conversation is already outdated: since we recorded this on Monday morning, Google announced button support for Google Home! Huge day for Mike, our caller. But the problems with Ikea’s exciting new low-cost smart gear still persist.

Microbes could extract the metal needed for cleantech

In a pine forest on Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, the only active nickel mine in the US is nearing the end of its life. At a time when carmakers want the metal for electric-vehicle batteries, nickel concentration at Eagle Mine is falling and could soon drop too low to warrant digging.Demand for nickel, copper, and rare earth elements is rapidly increasing amid the explosive growth of metal-intensive data centers, electric cars, and renewable energy projects. But producing these metals is becoming harder and more expensive because miners have already exploited the best resources. Here’s how biotechnology could help.—Matt Blois

What we’ve been getting wrong about AI’s truth crisis

—James O&#39;DonnellWhat would it take to convince you that the era of truth decay we were long warned about—where AI content dupes us, shapes our beliefs even when we catch the lie, and erodes societal trust in the process—is now here?A story I published last week pushed me over the edge.

In sprawling stretches of farmland and industrial parks, supersized buildings packed with racks of computers are springing up to fuel the AI race.These engineering marvels are a new species of infrastructure: supercomputers designed to train and run large language models at mind-­bending scale, complete with their own specialized chips, cooling systems, and even energy supplies. But all that impressive computing power comes at a cost.

At a time when carmakers want the metal for electric-vehicle batteries, nickel concentration at Eagle Mine is falling and could soon drop too low to warrant digging.

But earlier this year, the mine’s owner started testing a new process that could eke out a bit more nickel. In a pair of shipping containers recently installed at the mine’s mill, a fermentation-derived broth developed by the startup Allonnia is mixed with concentrated ore to capture and remove impurities. The process allows nickel production from lower-quality ore.

Kent Sorenson, Allonnia’s chief technology officer, says this approach could help companies continue operating sites that, like Eagle Mine, have burned through their best ore. “The low-hanging fruit is to keep mining the mines that we have,” he says.

Demand for nickel, copper, and rare earth elements is rapidly increasing amid the explosive growth of metal-intensive data centers, electric cars, and renewable energy projects. But producing these metals is becoming harder and more expensive because miners have already exploited the best resources. Like the age-old technique of rolling up the end of a toothpaste tube, Allonnia’s broth is one of a number of ways that biotechnology could help miners squeeze more metal out of aging mines, mediocre ore, or piles of waste.

The mining industry has intentionally seeded copper ore with microbes for decades. At current copper bioleaching sites, miners pile crushed copper ore into heaps and add sulfuric acid. Acid-loving bacteria like Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans colonize the mound. A chemical the organisms produce breaks the bond between sulfur and copper molecules to liberate the metal.

Until now, beyond maintaining the acidity and blowing air into the heap, there wasn’t much more miners could do to encourage microbial growth. But Elizabeth Dennett, CEO of the startup Endolith, says the decreasing cost of genetic tools is making it possible to manage the communities of microbes in a heap more actively. “The technology we’re using now didn’t exist a few years ago,” she says.

Endolith analyzes bits of DNA and RNA in the copper-rich liquid that flows out of an ore heap to characterize the microbes living inside. Combined with a suite of chemical analyses, the information helps the company determine which microbes to sprinkle on a heap to optimize extraction.

In lab tests on ore from the mining firm BHP, Endolith’s active techniques outperformed passive bioleaching approaches. In November, the company raised $16.5 million to move from its Denver lab to heaps in active mines.

Despite these promising early results, Corale Brierley, an engineer who has worked on metal bioleaching systems since the 1970s, questions whether companies like Endolith that add additional microbes to ore will successfully translate their processes to commercial scales. “What guarantees are you going to give the company that those organisms will actually grow?” Brierley asks.

Big mining firms that have already optimized every hose, nut, and bolt in their process won’t be easy to convince either, says Diana Rasner, an analyst covering mining technology for the research firm Cleantech Group.

“They are acutely aware of what it takes to scale these technologies because they know the industry,” she says. “They’ll be your biggest supporters, but they’re going to be your biggest critics.”

In addition to technical challenges, Rasner points out that venture-capital-backed biotechnology startups will struggle to deliver the quick returns their investors seek. Mining companies want lots of data before adopting a new process, which could take years of testing to compile. “This is not software,” Rasner says.

Nuton, a subsidiary of the mining giant Rio Tinto, is a good example. The company has been working for decades on a copper bioleaching process that uses a blend of archaea and bacteria strains, plus some chemical additives. But it started demonstrating the technology only late last year, at a mine in Arizona.

While Endolith and Nuton use naturally occurring microbes, the startup 1849 is hoping to achieve a bigger performance boost by genetically engineering microbes.

“You can do what mining companies have traditionally done,” says CEO Jai Padmakumar. “Or you can try to take the moonshot bet and engineer them. If you get that, you have a huge win.”

Genetic engineering would allow 1849 to tailor its microbes to the specific challenges facing a customer. But engineering organisms can also make them harder to grow, warns Buz Barstow, a Cornell University microbiologist who studies applications for biotechnology in mining.

Other companies are trying to avoid that trade-off by applying the products of microbial fermentation, rather than live organisms. Alta Resource Technologies, which closed a $28 million investment round in December, is engineering microbes that make proteins capable of extracting and separating rare earth elements. Similarly, the startup REEgen, based in Ithaca, New York, relies on the organic acids produced by an engineered strain of Gluconobacter oxydans to extract rare earth elements from ore and from waste materials like metal recycling slag, coal ash, or old electronics. “The microbes are the manufacturing,” says CEO Alexa Schmitz, an alumna of Barstow’s lab.

To make a dent in the growing demand for metal, this new wave of biotechnologies will have to go beyond copper and gold, says Barstow. In 2024, he started a project to map out genes that could be useful for extracting and separating a wider range of metals. Even with the challenges ahead, he says, biotechnology has the potential to transform mining the way fracking changed natural gas. “Biomining is one of these areas where the need … is big enough,” he says.

The challenge will be moving fast enough to keep up with growing demand.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

A cheaper, safer, and more abundant alternative to lithium is finally making its way into cars—and the grid.

Omar Yaghi thinks crystals with gaps that capture moisture could bring technology from “Dune” to the arid parts of Earth.

And why many scientists are freaked out about the first serious for-profit company moving into the solar geoengineering field.

            <h2>What we’ve been getting wrong about AI’s truth crisis</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/02/1132068/what-weve-been-getting-wrong-about-ais-truth-crisis/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI. To get stories like this in your inbox first, sign up here.

What would it take to convince you that the era of truth decay we were long warned about—where AI content dupes us, shapes our beliefs even when we catch the lie, and erodes societal trust in the process—is now here? A story I published last week pushed me over the edge. It also made me realize that the tools we were sold as a cure for this crisis are failing miserably.

On Thursday, I reported the first confirmation that the US Department of Homeland Security, which houses immigration agencies, is using AI video generators from Google and Adobe to make content that it shares with the public. The news comes as immigration agencies have flooded social media with content to support President Trump&#39;s mass deportation agenda—some of which appears to be made with AI (like a video about “Christmas after mass deportations”).

But I received two types of reactions from readers that may explain just as much about the epistemic crisis we’re in.

One was from people who weren’t surprised, because on January 22 the White House had posted a digitally altered photo of a woman arrested at an ICE protest, one that made her appear hysterical and in tears. Kaelan Dorr, the White House’s deputy communications director, did not respond to questions about whether the White House altered the photo but wrote, “The memes will continue.”

The second was from readers who saw no point in reporting that DHS was using AI to edit content shared with the public, because news outlets were apparently doing the same. They pointed to the fact that the news network MS Now (formerly MSNBC) shared an image of Alex Pretti that was AI-edited and appeared to make him look more handsome, a fact that led to many viral clips this week, including one from Joe Rogan’s podcast. Fight fire with fire, in other words? A spokesperson for MS Now told Snopes that the news outlet aired the image without knowing it was edited.

There is no reason to collapse these two cases of altered content into the same category, or to read them as evidence that truth no longer matters. One involved the US government sharing a clearly altered photo with the public and declining to answer whether it was intentionally manipulated; the other involved a news outlet airing a photo it should have known was altered but taking some steps to disclose the mistake.

What these reactions reveal instead is a flaw in how we were collectively preparing for this moment. Warnings about the AI truth crisis revolved around a core thesis: that not being able to tell what is real will destroy us, so we need tools to independently verify the truth. My two grim takeaways are that these tools are failing, and that while vetting the truth remains essential, it is no longer capable on its own of producing the societal trust we were promised.

For example, there was plenty of hype in 2024 about the Content Authenticity Initiative, cofounded by Adobe and adopted by major tech companies, which would attach labels to content disclosing when it was made, by whom, and whether AI was involved. But Adobe applies automatic labels only when the content is wholly AI-generated. Otherwise the labels are opt-in on the part of the creator.

And platforms like X, where the altered arrest photo was posted, can strip content of such labels anyway (a note that the photo was altered was added by users). Platforms can also simply not choose to show the label at all.

Noticing how much traction the White House’s photo got even after it was shown to be AI-altered, I was struck by the findings of a very relevant new paper published in the journal Communications Psychology. In the study, participants watched a deepfake “confession” to a crime, and the researchers found that even when they were told explicitly that the evidence was fake, participants relied on it when judging an individual’s guilt. In other words, even when people learn that the content they’re looking at is entirely fake, they remain emotionally swayed by it.

“Transparency helps, but it isn’t enough on its own,” the disinformation expert Christopher Nehring wrote recently about the study’s findings. “We have to develop a new masterplan of what to do about deepfakes.”

AI tools to generate and edit content are getting more advanced, easier to operate, and cheaper to run—all reasons why the US government is increasingly paying to use them. We were well warned of this, but we responded by preparing for a world in which the main danger was confusion. What we’re entering instead is a world in which influence survives exposure, doubt is easily weaponized, and establishing the truth does not serve as a reset button. And the defenders of truth are already trailing way behind.

Update: This story was updated on February 2 with details about how Adobe applies its content authenticity labels. A previous version of this story said content credentials were not visible on the Pentagon’s DVIDS website. The labels are present but require clicking through and hovering on individual images. The reference has been removed.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Many organizations rushed into generative AI, only to see pilots fail to deliver value. Now, companies want measurable outcomes—but how do you design for success?

At Mistral AI, we partner with global industry leaders to co-design tailored AI solutions that solve their most difficult problems. Whether it’s increasing CX productivity with Cisco, building a more intelligent car with Stellantis, or accelerating product innovation with ASML, we start with open frontier models and customize AI systems to deliver impact for each company’s unique challenges and goals.

Our methodology starts by identifying an iconic use case, the foundation for AI transformation that sets the blueprint for future AI solutions. Choosing the right use case can mean the difference between true transformation and endless tinkering and testing.

Mistral AI has four criteria that we look for in a use case: strategic, urgent, impactful, and feasible.

First, the use case must be strategically valuable, addressing a core business process or a transformative new capability. It needs to be more than an optimization; it needs to be a gamechanger. The use case needs to be strategic enough to excite an organization’s C-suite and board of directors.

For example, use cases like an internal-facing HR chatbot are nice to have, but they are easy to solve and are not enabling any new innovation or opportunities. On the other end of the spectrum, imagine an externally facing banking assistant that can not only answer questions, but also help take actions like blocking a card, placing trades, and suggesting upsell/cross-sell opportunities. This is how a customer-support chatbot is turned into a strategic revenue-generating asset.

Second, the best use case to move forward with should be highly urgent and solve a business-critical problem that people care about right now. This project will take time out of people’s days—it needs to be important enough to justify that time investment. And it needs to help business users solve immediate pain points.

Third, the use case should be pragmatic and impactful. From day one, our shared goal with our customers is to deploy into a real-world production environment to enable testing the solution with real users and gather feedback. Many AI prototypes end up in the graveyard of fancy demos that are not good enough to put in front of customers, and without any scaffolding to evaluate and improve. We work with customers to ensure prototypes are stable enough to release, and that they have the necessary support and governance frameworks.

Finally, the best use case is feasible. There may be several urgent projects, but choosing one that can deliver a quick return on investment helps to maintain the momentum needed to continue and scale.

This means looking for a project that can be in production within three months—and a prototype can be live within a few weeks. It’s important to get a prototype in front of end users as fast as possible to get feedback to make sure the project is on track, and pivot as needed.

Enterprises are complex, and the path forward is not usually obvious. To weed through all the possibilities and uncover the right first use case, Mistral AI will run workshops with our customers, hand-in-hand with subject-matter experts and end users.

Representatives from different functions will demo their processes and discuss business cases that could be candidates for a first use case—and together we agree on a winner. Here are some examples of types of projects that don’t qualify.

Moonshots: Ambitious bets that excite leadership but lack a path to quick ROI. While these projects can be strategic and urgent, they rarely meet the feasibility and impact requirements.

Future investments: Long-term plays that can wait. While these projects can be strategic and feasible, they rarely meet the urgency and impact requirements.

Tactical fixes: Firefighting projects that solve immediate pain but don’t move the needle. While these cases can be urgent and feasible, they rarely meet the strategy and impact requirements.

Quick wins: Useful for building momentum, but not transformative. While they can be impactful and feasible, they rarely meet the strategy and urgency requirements.

Blue sky ideas: These projects are gamechangers, but they need maturity to be viable. While they can be strategic and impactful, they rarely meet the urgency and feasibility requirements.

Hero projects: These are high-pressure initiatives that lack executive sponsorship or realistic timelines. While they can be urgent and impactful, they rarely meet the strategy and feasibility requirements.

Once a clearly defined and strategic use case ready for development is identified, it’s time to move into the validation phase. This means doing an initial data exploration and data mapping, identifying a pilot infrastructure, and choosing a target deployment environment.

This step also involves agreeing on a draft pilot scope, identifying who will participate in the proof of concept, and setting up a governance process.

Once this is complete, it’s time to move into the building phase. Companies that partner with Mistral work with our in-house applied AI scientists who build our frontier models. We work together to design, build, and deploy the first solution.

During this phase, we focus on co-creation, so we can transfer knowledge and skills to the organizations we’re partnering with. That way, they can be self-sufficient far into the future. The output of this phase is a deployed AI solution with empowered teams capable of independent operation and innovation.

After the first win, it’s imperative to use the momentum and learnings from the iconic use case to identify more high-value AI solutions to roll out. Success is when we have a scalable AI transformation blueprint with multiple high-value solutions across the organization.

But none of this could happen without successfully identifying that first iconic use case. This first step is not just about selecting a project—it’s about setting the foundation for your entire AI transformation.

It’s the difference between scattered experiments and a strategic, scalable journey toward impact. At Mistral AI, we’ve seen how this approach unlocks measurable value, aligns stakeholders, and builds momentum for what comes next.

The path to AI success starts with a single, well-chosen use case: one that is bold enough to inspire, urgent enough to demand action, and pragmatic enough to deliver.

Inside the marketplace powering bespoke AI deepfakes of real women

Civitai—an online marketplace for buying and selling AI-generated content, backed by the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz—is letting users buy custom instruction files for generating celebrity deepfakes. Some of these files were specifically designed to make pornographic images banned by the site, a new analysis has found.

The study, from researchers at Stanford and Indiana University, looked at people’s requests for content on the site, called “bounties.” The researchers found that between mid-2023 and the end of 2024, most bounties asked for animated content—but a significant portion were for deepfakes of real people, and 90% of these deepfake requests targeted women.

Demand for electric vehicles and the batteries that power them has never been hotter.

In 2025, EVs made up over a quarter of new vehicle sales globally, up from less than 5% in 2020. Some regions are seeing even higher uptake: In China, more than 50% of new vehicle sales last year were battery electric or plug-in hybrids. In Europe, more purely electric vehicles hit the roads in December than gas-powered ones. (The US is the notable exception here, dragging down the global average with a small sales decline from 2024.)

As EVs become increasingly common on the roads, the battery world is growing too. Here’s what’s coming next for EV batteries in 2026 and beyond.

Kyle “KJ” Muldoon Jr. was born with a rare, potentially fatal genetic disorder that left his body unable to remove toxic ammonia from his blood. The University of Pennsylvania offered his parents an alternative to a liver transplant: gene-editing therapies.

The team set to work developing a tailored treatment using base editing—a form of CRISPR that can correct genetic “misspellings” by changing single bases, the basic units of DNA. KJ received an initial low dose when he was seven months old, and later received two higher doses. Today, KJ is doing well. At an event in October last year, his happy parents described how he was meeting all his developmental milestones.

Others have received gene-editing therapies intended to treat conditions including sickle cell disease and a predisposition to high cholesterol. But KJ was the first to receive a personalized treatment—one that was designed just for him and will probably never be used again.

Demand for electric vehicles and the batteries that power them has never been hotter.

In 2025, EVs made up over a quarter of new vehicle sales globally, up from less than 5% in 2020. Some regions are seeing even higher uptake: In China, more than 50% of new vehicle sales last year were battery electric or plug-in hybrids. In Europe, more purely electric vehicles hit the roads in December than gas-powered ones. (The US is the notable exception here, dragging down the global average with a small sales decline from 2024.)

As EVs become increasingly common on the roads, the battery world is growing too. Looking ahead, we could soon see wider adoption of new chemistries, including some that deliver lower costs or higher performance. Meanwhile, the geopolitics of batteries are shifting, and so is the policy landscape. Here’s what’s coming next for EV batteries in 2026 and beyond.

Lithium-ion batteries are the default chemistry used in EVs, personal devices, and even stationary storage systems on the grid today. But in a tough environment in some markets like the US, there’s a growing interest in cheaper alternatives. Automakers right now largely care just about batteries’ cost, regardless of performance improvements, says Kara Rodby, a technical principal at Volta Energy Technologies, a venture capital firm that focuses on energy storage technology.

Sodium-ion cells have long been held up as a potentially less expensive alternative to lithium. The batteries are limited in their energy density, so they deliver a shorter range than lithium-ion. But sodium is also more abundant, so they could be cheaper.

Sodium’s growth has been cursed, however, by the very success of lithium-based batteries, says Shirley Meng, a professor of molecular engineering at the University of Chicago. A lithium-ion battery cell cost $568 per kilowatt-hour in 2013, but that cost had fallen to just $74 per kilowatt-hour by 2025—quite the moving target for cheaper alternatives to chase.

Sodium-ion batteries currently cost about $59 per kilowatt-hour on average. That’s less expensive than the average lithium-ion battery. But if you consider only lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells, a lower-end type of lithium-ion battery that averages $52 per kilowatt-hour, sodium is still more expensive today.

We could soon see an opening for sodium-batteries, though. Lithium prices have been ticking up in recent months, a shift that could soon slow or reverse the steady downward march of prices for lithium-based batteries.

Sodium-ion batteries are already being used commercially, largely for stationary storage on the grid. But we’re starting to see sodium-ion cells incorporated into vehicles, too. The Chinese companies Yadea, JMEV, and HiNa Battery have all started producing sodium-ion batteries in limited numbers for EVs, including small, short-range cars and electric scooters that don’t require a battery with high energy density. CATL, a Chinese battery company that’s the world’s largest, says it recently began producing sodium-ion cells. The company plans to launch its first EV using the chemistry by the middle of this year.

Today, both production and demand for sodium-ion batteries are heavily centered in China. That’s likely to continue, especially after a cutback in tax credits and other financial support for the battery and EV industries in the US. One of the biggest sodium-battery companies in the US, Natron, ceased operations last year after running into funding issues.

We could also see progress in sodium-ion research: Companies and researchers are developing new materials for components including the electrolyte and electrodes, so the cells could get more comparable to lower-end lithium-ion cells in terms of energy density, Meng says.

As we enter the second half of this decade, many eyes in the battery world are on big promises and claims about solid-state batteries.

These batteries could pack more energy into a smaller package by removing the liquid electrolyte, the material that ions move through when a battery is charging and discharging. With a higher energy density, they could unlock longer-range EVs.

Companies have been promising solid-state batteries for years. Toyota, for example, once planned to have them in vehicles by 2020. That timeline has been delayed several times, though the company says it’s now on track to launch the new cells in cars in 2027 or 2028.

Historically, battery makers have struggled to produce solid-state batteries at the scale needed to deliver a commercially relevant supply for EVs. There’s been progress in manufacturing techniques, though, and companies could soon actually make good on their promises, Meng says.

Factorial Energy, a US-based company making solid-state batteries, provided cells for a Mercedes test vehicle that drove over 745 miles on a single charge in a real-world test in September. The company says it plans to bring its tech to market as soon as 2027. Quantumscape, another major solid-state player in the US, is testing its cells with automotive partners and plans to have its batteries in commercial production later this decade.

Before we see true solid-state batteries, we could see hybrid technologies, often referred to as semi-solid-state batteries. These commonly use materials like gel electrolytes, reducing the liquid inside cells without removing it entirely. Many Chinese companies are looking to build semi-solid-state batteries before transitioning to entirely solid-state ones, says Evelina Stoikou, head of battery technologies and supply chains at BloombergNEF, an energy consultancy.

The picture for the near future of the EV industry looks drastically different depending on where you’re standing.

Last year, China overtook Japan as the country with the most global auto sales. And more than one in three EVs made in 2025 had a CATL battery in it. Simply put, China is dominating the global battery industry, and that doesn’t seem likely to change anytime soon.

China’s influence outside its domestic market is growing especially quickly. CATL is expected to begin production this year at its second European site; the factory, located in Hungary, is an $8.2 billion project that will supply automakers including BMW and the Mercedes-Benz group. Canada recently signed a deal that will lower the import tax on Chinese EVs from 100% to roughly 6%, effectively opening the Canadian market for Chinese EVs.

Some countries that haven’t historically been major EV markets could become bigger players in the second half of the decade. Annual EV sales in Thailand and Vietnam, where the market was virtually nonexistent just a few years ago, broke 100,000 in 2025. Brazil, in particular, could see its new EV sales more than double in 2026 as major automakers including Volkswagen and BYD set up or ramp up production in the country.

On the flip side, EVs are facing a real test in 2026 in the US, as this will be the first calendar year after the sunset of federal tax credits that were designed to push more drivers to purchase the vehicles. With those credits gone, growth in sales is expected to continue lagging.

One bright spot for batteries in the US is outside the EV market altogether. Battery manufacturers are starting to produce low-cost LFP batteries in the US, largely for energy storage applications. LG opened a massive factory to make LFP batteries in mid-2025 in Michigan, and the Korean battery company SK On plans to start making LFP batteries at its facility in Georgia later this year. Those plants could help battery companies cash in on investments as the US EV market faces major headwinds.

Even as the US lags behind, the world is electrifying transportation. By 2030, 40% of new vehicles sold around the world are projected to be electric. As we approach that milestone, expect to see more global players, a wider selection of EVs, and an even wider menu of batteries to power them.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

A cheaper, safer, and more abundant alternative to lithium is finally making its way into cars—and the grid.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you look at the press releases and breathless commentary around the recent acquisition of xAI by SpaceX, you might think we’re witnessing a tectonic shift in technological destiny.

A $1.25 trillion “mega-company” is born, poised to reshape artificial intelligence, space infrastructure, satellite internet, and possibly the fate of humanity itself. That narrative, enthusiastically repeated across headlines, serves a purpose: it frames a somewhat messy corporate consolidation as inevitable progress.

But let’s take a closer look and separate actual substance from Silicon Valley myth-making.

At its core, this acquisition solves one problem: xAI needed a place to spend its money. The startup that once raised billions and expanded by swallowing the social platform X was burning cash, an estimated very serious amount, chasing model performance and celebrity.

Folding it into SpaceX gives it access to a deeper capital pool, a broader story, and a more flattering valuation context.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

SpaceX did not acquire xAI because xAI was on the verge of overtaking tech giants in artificial intelligence. It acquired it because running a massively expensive AI operation inside a standalone startup wasn’t sustainable, even for Elon Musk’s legion of investors. A merger with a revenue-generating aerospace company looks a lot like a bailout disguised as synergy.

One of the dominant talking points from Musk’s own statements is that this consolidation enables space-based data centers, because apparently, earthbound power and cooling infrastructure are so last decade. The story goes: launch AI compute into orbit, agglomerate solar energy, and power the future with starlight.

On paper, it’s an imaginative riff. In practice, it’s strategic sci-fi for the markets. Putting data centers in space involves launch costs, radiation-hardened hardware, maintenance logistics that make ISS servicing look pedestrian, and no meaningful economy of scale compared to terrestrial hyperscalers like AWS or Google Cloud. If it were primarily about economics, the industry wouldn’t be scrambling to keep data on Earth.

The truth is simpler: this narrative reframes costly AI ambitions in a cosmic, venture-capital-friendly guise. It makes investors feel like they’re buying into a future where AI runs on sunshine in orbit, rather than into the present where AI training costs are a gating factor.

It’s good PR, dubious engineering economics.

The timing of this merger speaks volumes. SpaceX is preparing for a public offering, potentially as early as mid-2026. Reports say the combined entity could fetch valuations worth of $1.2 trillion.

Here’s what happens when you’re about to IPO:

You package your story in a way that excites both institutional and retail investors. You highlight future potential, especially grand visions like “ethereal solar compute.” You downplay structural weaknesses and uncertainties. And if you can fold in a shiny AI banner, all the better, because AI is the word that unlocks narrative premiums.

From that standpoint, SpaceX’s absorption of xAI makes sense. It’s narrative arbitrage: build a storyline that elevates the combination well beyond its standalone track records. Who wouldn’t want to invest in “AI in space,” even if the commercial case is mostly speculative?

If the goal was to create an AI powerhouse that actually threatens the likes of OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic, we’d see clear indicators: rapid model improvements, developer platform adoption, real enterprise deals, and benchmarks that are competitive on measurable terms.

What we see is an AI startup struggling to define its identity, a chatbot (Grok) known more for quirks and moderation issues than transformative performance, and a social platform that, let’s just say, gives fact-checking teams ulcers. None of this naturally scales into the kind of AI infrastructure leadership that justifies calling this a strategic technological fusion.

That’s not to say xAI has zero potential; it might. But there’s no verifiable evidence that this merger suddenly elevates it to tier-one AI contender status.

One striking consequence of this move is how deeply entwined Musk’s personal corporate empire has become. With SpaceX, xAI, Starlink, X, and multiple ventures all orbiting around the same figure, there’s little left that feels like a separate institution. That concentration raises questions about governance, accountability, and even regulatory scrutiny.

Musk’s critics have made this point before, whether about content moderation on social media platforms, intercompany transfers of resources, or governance decisions around publicly traded entities, and these concerns aren’t going away just because the companies now share a name on a term sheet.

Consolidation under one umbrella might be efficient from a control perspective, but it’s not inherently a prescription for innovation. In fact, it can stifle internal dissent, obscure accountability, and concentrate risk.

Again, there’s a clear pragmatic logic to this merger: xAI gets access to SpaceX’s balance sheet and a narrative boost; SpaceX gets an AI banner to highlight in its IPO pitch; investors get something that looks both futuristic and marketable.

That’s not a strategy grounded in technological merit. It’s a financial and narrative maneuver, carefully calibrated to appeal to markets and media.

In that sense, what just happened feels a lot like a bailout with a shiny new label and an extraterrestrial backstory.

If this were genuinely about advancing AI, we’d be hearing about:

None of those are the dominant themes of the current coverage. What we have instead is a $1.25 trillion headline and a promise that someday, somewhere, perhaps space will be the next frontier for AI compute.

It’s visionary in the way a concept car is visionary, exciting to look at, and flimsy on the economics.

The SpaceX-xAI merger is undeniably a headline-grabbing moment, but it’s not the strategic leap some commentators portray. It’s a capital and narrative optimization, not a clear answer to the question of who leads AI or how AI’s growth is sustainably powered.

If nothing else, it highlights how difficult it is to build a credible, well-funded AI company from scratch, even for someone as resourceful and celebrated as Elon Musk. His answer was not to reforge the fundamentals of AI research, but to fold an ambitious but unproven AI arm into a larger, more established aerospace machine with a glossy story that sounds like science fiction.

That may delight investors. It doesn’t yet convince technologists. Or me.

            <div id="article-text">OpenAI has given software developers a new desktop toy, and judging by the early reactions, it might feel like someone finally handed coders the Swiss Army knife they’ve been dreaming about or the kind of gadget that makes them wonder if they’re working with a robot coworker now.

The company rolled out the Codex app for macOS, a focused interface for managing AI coding agents, designed to let developers do more than just “generate a few lines of code.” Instead, Codex can juggle multiple tasks in parallel, run background workflows, and act on instructions that span hours or even days.

At its core, the new app is a response to a shift that’s been quietly happening for the past year: AI isn’t just helping write short snippets anymore. It’s taking on whole coding projects, running tests, dealing with pull requests, and even undertaking the kind of repetitive maintenance tasks that make developers groan.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Containers, threads, isolated worktrees, and integrated Git tools support all of this seamlessly within the app, so engineers don’t need to jump between terminals, IDEs, and cloud consoles just to keep a fleet of AI agents moving forward.

OpenAI’s own announcement makes this shift clear: existing tools were built for real-time interaction or single tasks, but today’s coding workflows are multifaceted and sprawling. Instead of coaxing a model to generate code line by line, the Codex app lets you orchestrate agents that work independently on different parts of a codebase.

Each agent runs in its own thread and its own worktree, which means you can explore multiple ideas without fear of one bot overwriting another’s progress. If you want Codex to review diffs, make comments inline, or even open suggested changes in your local editor, it can. If you want it to run in the background while you sleep, it can do that too.

Image: Screenshot shared on Reddit (r/singularity), original post.

There’s even support for what OpenAI calls “skills” and “automations”: reusable workflows that let Codex go beyond raw code generation into things like gathering information, problem solving, carrying out scheduled tasks, or managing routine reviews.

In early internal use cases, Codex has built complete applications, playing the roles of designer, developer, and QA tester in a single string of prompts, an example that hints at what happens when AI stops being an assistant and starts feeling a bit like a team member with infinite coffee.

It’s worth noting that the current release is macOS only, which prompted the usual chorus of developer grumbling about Windows and Linux support. Early adopters on Reddit (and elsewhere) joked that the lack of cross-platform availability feels oddly quaint for an AI tool, even as they praised how much the Codex app can do compared to traditional CLI workflows.

OpenAI is also sweetening the deal: for a limited time, Codex will be accessible to free and Go users, and rate limits for paid Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Edu plans have been doubled across all surfaces where Codex runs, whether that’s the app, the CLI, IDE extensions, or cloud threads.

The company’s broader strategy here is unmistakable. AI coding assistants are one of the most competitive battlegrounds in generative AI right now, and rivals like Anthropic’s Claude Code have already reported strong revenue metrics in this space.

The launch of a desktop command center for Codex feels like OpenAI saying, “We’re in this to win,” not just to ship features.

So what does this actually mean for developers? It doesn’t mean humans are about to be replaced overnight. Codex is powerful, but like all AI tools, it still makes mistakes and needs human oversight, especially when the stakes are high and production quality matters.

Seen through that lens, the Codex app is less a magic wand and more a powerful collaboration layer, one that could reshape how engineering teams operate without pretending to fully automate the craft of building software.

In practice, that suggests a near future where managing AI agents becomes as normal as managing packages or Git branches. Instead of the terminal being the center of your workflow, Codex and its agents might take that spot, responding to prompts, running scheduled tasks, and even adopting configurable “personalities” that fit how you prefer to work.

At a time when the debate around AI productivity often centers on displacement or disruption, the Codex app points in a more nuanced direction: what happens when coding tools become partners rather than assistants?

The answer won’t be immediate, and the work still demands human judgement, but for many developers the first glimpse of that future arrived today.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Every January, millions take on Dry January, a ritual of restraint and resetting after the holiday season. If that’s the benchmark for kicking off the year with moderation, Europe’s startup ecosystem clearly didn’t get the memo.

In the opening weeks of 2026, the region saw five startups join the unicorn club, crossing the $1 billion valuation mark across sectors as varied as cybersecurity, cloud optimisation, defence tech, ESG software, and education technology.

January was anything but dry for European companies. This burst of activity signals more than a funding spike; it invites a deeper look at what Europe’s innovation identity looks like today. Across the continent, there’s a stronger sense that Europe can produce and scale world-class tech companies in its own right, rather than just nurture later-stage spin-offs or see them acquired by U.S. firms.

While the United States still leads in overall startup volume and ecosystem strength, Europe’s recent momentum shows its innovation landscape is maturing and gaining confidence on the global stage.

Europe was already home to over 217 unicorns by late 2025, spread across fintech, AI, enterprise software, and other domains. That’s a milestone for a region whose venture culture has historically leaned toward caution.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

What’s notable isn’t simply the number of new billion-dollar companies, but their variety. Gone are the days when a single sector, often generative AI, defined European unicorn trajectories. Here we see cybersecurity, cloud optimisation, defence-oriented software, sustainability data, and education marketplaces all earning top valuations and investor backing.

The broader context matters. In 2025, deep-tech and university spinouts, including companies in aerospace, robotics, materials, sensors, and health sciences, saw near record levels of funding, and many achieved significant valuation or revenue milestones.

This goes hand in hand with a narrative that’s become increasingly clear: European capital is being more deliberate than exuberant. Rather than inflate every trend label, investors are writing checks where traction, revenue models, and regulatory demand converge. That’s why platforms helping companies with compliance and ESG reporting, or infrastructure for cloud efficiency, are winning attention alongside defence-tech innovators.

Europe’s tech ecosystem has matured, even if it still faces hurdles. Venture funding peaked in recent years and then dipped; for example, total European VC investment in 2024 was reported to be around $45 billion, down from earlier highs. Yet the valuation achievements and funding depth remain meaningful.

This apparent paradox highlights a structural shift: rather than broad flows of unfettered capital, funding is now more selective and outcome-oriented. Investors, LPs, and strategic partners are looking for proof of product-market fit, regulatory differentiation, and defensible business models.

Fragmentation across markets and languages, long considered a European challenge, can also be a strength when paired with clusters of domain expertise, cybersecurity hubs in Belgium, deep tech in the Nordics, cloud infrastructure in the Baltics, and education technology with strong ties to diverse EU labour markets. Observers have noted that these clusters are attracting venture dollars, even if not every founder heads straight for the Bay Area.

Policy tools and institutional support are increasingly part of the backdrop for European innovation. The European Union’s research and innovation framework programmes, most notably Horizon Europe, are directing substantial resources toward areas such as digital transformation, strategic autonomy, and industrial competitiveness.

For 2021–2027, Horizon Europe is the EU’s flagship funding programme for research and innovation, with an overall budget of around €93.5 billion allocated to boost competitiveness, address climate and social challenges, and support key technologies from AI to advanced manufacturing.

This support matters because initiatives that might once have felt niche, advanced sensors, ESG compliance tools, or technologies with both civil and defence applications, now align clearly with broader strategic goals set out in the EU’s innovation plans.

Calls under Horizon Europe Cluster 4 – Digital, Industry and Space, and related programmes bring together public and private partners to tackle digital and green transitions, pooling resources and creating coherent pathways from research to commercial deployment.

That’s why this month’s unicorn news feels less like a fluke and more like a phase transition.

So what does it all mean? Are these five new unicorns signs of a sustainable upswing or just a temporary blip in enterprise valuations?

They’re arguably both: an indicator that Europe’s startup engine still runs on thoughtful investment, real use cases, and foundational problems, and a challenge to continue scaling that momentum into later-stage growth and exits.

Europe doesn’t need to be Silicon Valley. It never really did. What it needs is confidence in its own values, disciplined capital, diverse innovation, and regulation as an enabler, not a constraint.

If this is Europe’s tech moment, it’s not marked by headline-grabbing valuations alone. It’s defined by the breadth of problems being solved and the depth of conviction behind those solutions.

            <div id="article-text">We are all familiar with the subscription economy, and it certainly works as a reminder of the COVID-19 pandemic, when we were all hooked on our TVs watching Netflix or listening to our favorite music artist on Spotify.

Despite how modern it seems to be, the truth is that the subscription economy has been around for some time, surprisingly dating back to around 1800, with the first magazine subscriptions, or the subscriptions for fresh British milk, around 1860.

Over the years, the of subscription-based companies has turned the subscription model into an ideal business strategy since it provides unique benefits. In the same way, the adoption of this model across multiple industries has led to negative repercussions for the general public.

This article explores its growth across industries, benefits and disadvantages, and why this is important for you, as a service provider and/or as a customer.

The subscription economy is a recurring-revenue model in which products or services are delivered daily under a temporary or perpetual subscription in exchange for a fixed price, growing considerably in the last 20 years.

According to the last report in the Subscription Economy Market 2025 by Juniper, the global market had a total revenue of $722B in 2025, with a forecasted total revenue of $1.2T by 2030, with an average annual growth rate of more than 15%. Software as a service (SaaS) remains the biggest part of the subscription market with a revenue of more than $250B by 2022. The car rethinking industry, e-mobility application area, and the digitization of the health sector are expected to be enormously scaled by 2030.

The European market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.50% in the forecast period of 2026-2035. The main industry leaders within the region are beauty, food, and digital subscriptions. Whereas the countries where the subscription market stands out are the UK (beauty and personal care), Germany (software and consumer goods), France (food and beverage), and Italy and Spain (digital subscription and other categories).

A study made by Advances in Consumer Research (ACR) journal highlights how this model is great for businesses because it provides steady income, low upfront costs, and consistent lifetime value (the total value a customer provides to a company over their relationship), while promoting brand loyalty. It also offers unique advantages for consumers, such as a customer-centric approach focused on personalizing services, products and experiences, and experiences; convenient, time-saving solutions; cost-effectiveness; access to a diverse range of products rather than ownership of a few; and even social recognition and identity.

The gaming industry had a steady increase after the COVID-19 pandemic, introducing subscription-based services, which have become regular within the industry. The business model is simple: gamers pay a subscription fee to access gaming services, and there are three different options for customers:

The global market for subscription-based gaming was estimated at $10.1B in 2023 and is forecasted to reach $21.3B by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 11.3% from 2023 to 2030.

It has been popularized due to its affordability and convenience, since the subscription to platforms enables players the flexibility to pay multiple games with an affordable fee.

The subscription model also offers unique advantages for companies, such as reduction of upfront costs since the games are directly streamed from servers, promoted by the technological development of high-speed internet infrastructure and 5G, cloud gaming service, cross-platform accounts, family plans, and leveraged AI to offer personalized game recommendations based on user behavior.

Another industry that is adapting to market and customer expectations is healthcare. As a response to technological and societal advancements, subscription medical care is increasing in popularity within the US, expected to reach $15.1bn by 2032.

Health tech represents a great opportunity for individuals and businesses since it introduces cost predictability, personalized attention, and wellness data. Healthcare providers and health tech companies are leveraging the use of AI, since it facilitates the data analysis process, helping health professionals to make more accurate and efficient diagnoses.

Within the health care and health tech industry, there are several subscription-based models, such as:

The subscription economy has expanded to other services, such as education. Since the customer expectations and behavior is demanding accessible, personalized content at an affordable price, the global e-learning market is growing and expected to reach $1T by 2032 with subscription models leading.

The key drivers for growth are the increasing use of VR and AR in e-learning, digital transformation, and the partnership of universities and diversity in offerings. Some of the most used platforms worldwide are Duolingo, Coursera, and FutureLearn, among others.

Another industry that has greatly benefitted with the subscription model is the creator economy. Content creators are increasingly looking to subscription platforms such as Patreon, OnlyFans, and Substack, adopting them as a solution in a volatile economy and competitive markets, where creators heavily depended on paid partnerships and platform payouts, this way ensuring a stable monthly recurring revenue.

The key drivers for the growth of this market are, whatsoever, slightly different than the previously mentioned: audiences want to pay for a deeper relationship with the creator than passive scrolling, whether of its niche expertise or personal connection.

Despite all the unique benefits that the subscription model offers for customers and companies, the quick expansion and adoption of this model has led to negative effects in the audiences, which become challenges for the companies. You may be familiar with the concept of subscription fatigue, which reflects the customers’ reluctance to engage with multiple subscriptions.

This phenomenon was born due to the saturation in the expanding market and is driven by “lack of perceived value, hidden or unpredictable fees and loss of control,” fomenting churn (percentage of customers who cancel their subscription) for customers to save money or just because the service seems not useful for them.

Another challenge for companies is the constant pressure for ongoing investment in product development and customer engagement, especially in industries with minimal product differentiation, such as the streaming platforms industry. High production costs and limited audience engagement increase this model’s financial struggles, adding pressure on companies to deliver valuable services while generating profit.

Subscription models are no longer limited to entertainment platforms. They have become a core part of modern digital business strategies, offering predictable revenue streams for companies and enhancing customer experience.

The next phase will likely combine hybrid subscription models with usage-based pricing and data-driven personalization. To remain competitive, companies will need to adapt to consumer expectations by offering flexible prices and plans, pause options, bundling strategies, and partnerships across platforms.

Ultimately, the main challenge right now is how to design models that deliver long-term value without overwhelming users, balancing profitability with meaningful user experience.
