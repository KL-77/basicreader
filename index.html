            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/trumps-energy-secretary-orders-a-washington-state-coal-plant-to-remain-open/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">SEATTLE—The last coal-fired power plant in Washington state was set to go cold at the end of the year. It would then switch to natural gas, cutting carbon emissions in half.

The shutdown had been in the works for 15 years and was mandated by state law. It required the Canadian energy company that owns the power plant, TransAlta, to retrain workers and ease the local community’s economic transition.

But the farewell to coal was canceled this week by the Trump administration. In furtherance of the president’s crusade to keep America’s coal plants burning, the Department of Energy announced Tuesday that an “emergency exists” in the Pacific Northwest “due to a shortage of electricity.” To keep the lights on, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said that the Centralia electric generating facility in southwest Washington must continue to burn coal for at least 90 more days.

“Issuance of this order will meet the emergency and serve the public interest,” said Wright, who issued a similar order last summer that blocked the planned retirement of an aging coal-fired plant in Michigan.

There is, however, no imminent shortage of electricity in Washington state or across the Pacific Northwest, according to state officials and regional energy experts.

“Let’s be clear: there’s no emergency here,” said a joint statement by Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson, along with the state’s attorney general and ecology director. “The Trump administration has conveniently ignored the law and the facts. The TransAlta power plant is days away from completing its shutdown—a milestone the company and the state have been working toward since 2011. The workers have moved on. There’s no coal left to burn.”

The governor’s office and local environmental groups said they were examining the Trump administration order and may fight it in court. TransAlta said in a statement that it is “evaluating” the federal order but remains committed to a coal-to-gas conversion at the Centralia plant.

The year-end emergency that does exist in Washington state has been caused by record-setting rainfall and widespread flooding. (President Donald Trump has declared a federal emergency and authorized disaster assistance.) Thousands of people have been displaced and damage to major highways will take months to repair.

“It is so ironic, when we have a real emergency, that they picked this time to fabricate an energy emergency,” said KC Golden, a member of the Northwest Power and Conservation Council, an interstate agency created by Congress to ensure reliable power while protecting the environment.

While there is no emergency electricity shortfall in the Pacific Northwest, the region, like much of the United States, does have a serious and worsening long-term electricity supply problem.

Washington and Oregon are home to about 100 data centers. Oregon is second only to Virginia in data center capacity, and the centers consume 11 percent of Oregon’s power supply, nearly three times the national average, according to the Sightline Institute, a Seattle think tank.

Energy use is rising along with the region’s booming high-tech economy, its outsized appetite for electric cars (The Seattle Times reported that 26 percent of new cars registered in Washington in October were EVs) and the climate-change-driven growth of home air-conditioning. The Northwest could face a 9-gigawatt shortfall of power by 2030, according to a recent utility-funded report by the energy consulting group E3. Nine gigawatts is roughly the electricity load of Oregon.

“We are facing a real energy supply challenge and we have been slow to take up that challenge,” said Golden, who represents Washington state on the Northwest power council.

The Pacific Northwest gets more of its power from hydroelectric dams than any other part of the country (60 percent in Washington), and the region has long been blessed with cheap electricity rates. But drought and changing weather patterns (less snow, more rain) have hammered the reliability of the system, which draws most of its power from big federal dams on the Columbia River, North America’s largest hydroelectric resource.

Grand Coulee Dam, the largest electricity producer in the United States, last year generated about half as much power as it did in 2012, according to the US Energy Information Administration. Power production in the Northwest and across the West fell to a 22-year low in 2022–2023, largely because of a years-long drought.

Making matters worse, the Bonneville Power Administration, a federal agency that sells electricity from Columbia River dams and operates a high-voltage transmission system, has been exceedingly slow to connect new sources of power—wind and solar—to the grid. An investigation this year by ProPublica and Oregon Public Broadcasting found that of 469 large renewable projects that applied to connect to Bonneville’s system since 2015, one was approved. Bonneville has said it is working to speed up the process. ProPublica also found that Oregon and Washington—while promising to eliminate fossil fuels from the grid—trailed most states in connecting large solar and wind projects.

“It takes too long to build new transmission,” said Lauren McCloy, utility and regulatory director of the NW Energy Coalition, an alliance of environmental groups, local utilities and local government agencies. “But we are all working on it.”

McCloy said that the entire Pacific Northwest is trying “to focus on how we can meet our clean energy goals and keep the lights on.” She added that in all the meetings she has attended in recent years, “I haven’t heard anyone in this region point to the [Centralia] coal plant as a solution to this challenge.”

Washington state codified its intention to move away from fossil fuels in 2019. The law mandates the closure this year of all coal-fired plants. It also requires carbon-neutral power production by 2030 and an electricity supply system that is free of greenhouse gas emissions by 2045. Mushrooming power demands of data centers, combined with halting integration of wind and solar into the grid, have raised questions about the state’s ability to enforce its law.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/instacart-agrees-to-refund-subscribers-60-million-in-ftc-settlement/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Instacart has agreed to pay out $60 million in subscriber refunds, the Federal Trade Commission announced on Thursday.

The refunds will help settle a lawsuit the FTC raised, accusing the grocery delivery app of engaging in “numerous unlawful tactics that harmed shoppers and raised the cost of grocery shopping for Americans.”

Under the settlement—which expires after 10 years—Instacart agreed to stop marketing its app with allegedly deceptive claims. That includes supposedly offering “free delivery,” when customers actually paid up to 15 percent in “service fees” not charged for pickup orders. Those service fees, the FTC alleged, were “just delivery fees by another name.”

Additionally, Instacart must cease claims that its services are “100 percent satisfaction guaranteed.” That claim implies that the company offers full refunds, but the FTC alleged that many customers were only offered “a small credit” for late deliveries or unprofessional services. Instacart also allegedly hid the refund option “from the ‘self-service’ menu that consumers use to report problems with their orders, leading many consumers to erroneously believe they can receive only a credit toward a future order rather than a refund,” the FTC alleged in its complaint.

Instacart “pocketed tens of millions of dollars by failing to honor its promise of 100 percent consumer satisfaction,” the FTC alleged.

Refunds won’t be offered to customers allegedly harmed by those claims, but subscribers who were never told upfront that they’d be automatically charged after free trials will soon be repaid. The settlement stipulated that Instacart would transfer funds to the FTC within 14 days of the court’s approval of the deal.

In a blog post, Instacart emphasized that it has admitted no wrongdoing and elected to settle to “move forward.”

The app defended its “$0 delivery fees” claim by reminding customers that “we clearly and consistently distinguish delivery fees from service fees, which are always shown as a separate, itemized line.” Instacart also noted that subscribers receiving refunds were sent email reminders before renewals were charged. Further, any subscriber shocked by the charges had five days to request an automatic full refund if services were never used, the company said.

Boasting that Instacart has helped users save more than $3 billion “through deals, discounts, and loyalty programs,” the company estimated that users weren’t harmed by its practices and, on average, save $5 for each order.

“We flatly deny any allegations of wrongdoing by the agency, and we believe the foundation of the FTC’s inquiry was fundamentally flawed,” the company said.

The FTC, however, alleged that “hundreds of thousands of consumers have been charged membership fees without receiving benefits from the membership or getting refunds.”

Defending Instacart users from an alleged “variety of deceptive tactics,” the FTC will now work with Instacart to retrieve customer information and issue refunds, a jointly filed order detailing the settlement said.

In its blog, Instacart repeatedly claimed to be transparent and clear with customers about charges. But in a sign that the settlement is already forcing changes, a claim that the company provides “one of the most transparent, customer-friendly subscription programs available, unlocking $0 delivery fees on grocery orders of $10 or more” was starred. At the bottom of the blog, the company clarified that “service and other fees apply.”</div>

            <h2>Strava puts popular “Year in Sport” recap behind an $80 paywall</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/12/strava-puts-popular-year-in-sport-recap-behind-an-80-paywall/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Earlier this month, Strava, the popular fitness-tracking app, released its annual “Year in Sport” wrap-up—a cutesy, animated series of graphics summarizing each user’s athletic achievements.

But this year, for the first time, Strava made this feature available only to users with subscriptions ($80 per year), rather than making it free to everyone, as it had been historically since the review’s debut in 2016.

This decision has roiled numerous Strava users, particularly those who have relished the app’s social encouragement features. One Strava user in India, Shobhit Srivastava, “begged” Strava to “let the plebs see their Year in Sport too, please.” He later explained to Ars that having this little animated video is more than just a collection of raw numbers.

“When someone makes a video of you and your achievements and tells you that these are the people who stood right behind you, motivated you, cheered for you—that feeling is of great significance to me!” he said by email.

Strava spokesperson Chris Morris declined to answer Ars’ specific questions about why the decision to put Year in Sport behind a paywall was made now.

Other users feel that Strava is getting a bit too greedy. Dominik Sklyarov, an Estonian startup founder, wrote on X that Strava’s decision was a “money hungry move, really sad to see. Instead of shipping useful features for athletes, Strava just continues getting worse.”

Meanwhile, Reddit user “andrewthesailor” pointed out, “Well, they want me to pay to look at data I gave them (power, [heart rate] etc). And the subscription is not that cheap, especially when you consider that you are also paying with your data.”

Sana Ajani, a business student at the University of Chicago, told Ars that she used to be a premium member but isn’t anymore.

“I did notice the Year in Sport and was a little annoyed that I couldn’t unlock it,” she said in an email. “I would’ve expected some overall stats for everyone and extra stats for subscribers. Year in Review-type stuff is great content and distribution for most apps since everyone shares it on socials, so I’m surprised that Strava is limiting its reach by only letting paid subscribers see it.”

The San Francisco-based company, however, clearly sees things differently.

“Our goal was to give our users ample notice before the personalized Year In Sport was released,” Morris, the Strava spokesperson, wrote Ars in an emailed statement. “With the relaunch of our subscription this year, we wanted to clarify the core benefits of Strava—uploading activities, finding your community, sharing and giving kudos—remain as accessible as possible.”

Some Strava users have blamed financial pressures as the company’s monthly average user base has nearly tripled since 2020, reaching 50 million as of this year, according to Sensor Tower, a market intelligence firm. Per PitchBook, Strava’s rapid rise has only made the company more valuable; it now has an estimated valuation of around $2.2 billion as of May 2025.

CEO Michael Martin told the Financial Times in October that the company has an “intention to go public at some point.” “Growth profiles like ours… are particularly uncommon, especially at scale,” Martin added. “It attracts a lot of attention—especially from bankers.”

Some disappointed fans say restricting access to Year in Sport represents the latest in a series of company missteps dating back to at least 2023, when the company raised its annual subscription fee from $60 to $80. On top of that, last year, many Strava users thought the company’s foray into AI (or as Strava put it, “Athlete Intelligence”) was a bit of a miss. Earlier this year, Strava sued Garmin over alleged patent infringement—before promptly dropping the case less than a month later.

Still, at least one longtime user is now having second thoughts about Strava.

Matt Cook, 32, an amateur triathlete in Oakland, California, who has been active on Strava for a decade, told Ars that while he is a Strava Premium member, many of his friends are not. As such, that’s created some stratification and anxiety for him.

“It makes me not want to share [my Strava year-end results] because it feels like I’m flexing,” he said.</div>

            <h2>TikTok Accounts Are Using AI Slop to Sell Seeds to Plants That Don’t Exist</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/tiktok-ai-slop-seeds-plants-dont-exist">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There are thousands of varieties of hosta — a leafy decorative plant that you’ve probably seen adorning outdoor spaces — being cultivated around the world, in a luxurious spread of colors, sizes, and textures. The hardy and easy-to-care-for plants thrive in the shade and can grow enormous leaves, making them a perfect project for amateur gardeners.

Yet despite the glorious natural biodiversity that already exists in the species, scammers on TikTok are using AI-generated slop videos to sell dubious seeds for hosta varieties that don’t exist.

A quick search for “hosta seeds” reveals countless videos of unnaturally colored hostas, from a fictitious variety featuring enormous, purple leaves, to “God’s rainbow,” a made-up plant that grows garish, rainbow-colored foliage, described as “so magical, your neighbors will think it isn’t real,” according to a robotic-sounding AI voiceover.

“It’s called midnight blue heart,” a voiceover says in a separate video. “A rare black and blue hosta that looks like it came from another planet.”

“It’s magical, it’s hardy, and only a few dollars,” the voice continues. “Tap the link below to order and bring the midnight blue heart home.”

The obvious hallmarks of half-baked AI are impossible to ignore, from water streams from garden hoses that flow straight through the foliage or miss the plant entirely to seeds that magically float by themselves while held in a hand. Many of the videos even claim their miraculous hostas can thrive even in snowy conditions, which is a nonsense prospect: hostas may be perennial, but aren’t very frost-tolerant and sustain damage from freezing temperatures.

The bizarre trend is part of a much larger deluge of AI slop drowning out human-authored content across social media platforms.

Author Bree Bridges noticed her TikTok feed becoming overwhelmed by the videos.

“TikTok has started giving me AI-generated garden content with videos of people supposedly growing plants that quite clearly look like they came from the ‘Avatar’ planet,” Bridges wrote in a post on Bluesky.

“And also they’re watering them indoors sometimes while watering the carpet and they grow in three days,” she added.

Experts have already warned that hosta lovers should stay far away from seeds that purport to grow into fantastical plants. Ads that New York-based NBC-affiliate WHEC showed to Bill Hegeman, co-president of the Genesee Valley Hosta Society, immediately raised red flags.

“Stop!” the TikTok account behind the outdoor living store Touch of Eco exclaimed in a recent clip. “If you see these colorful hosta seeds on TikTok, never buy them. These are fake, AI-generated.”

Even before the advent of generative AI, fake seeds were already a widespread scam on the internet. As YouTuber Atomic Shrimp explored in a video last year, seeds for made-up flowers like “cat face flowers” that inexplicably feature the faces of felines are being sold for considerable amounts of money.

On eBay, for instance, 50 seeds for a “cute cat face orchid” are being sold for $6.68. Poorly photoshopped or possibly AI-generated images show the faces of cats perched in the middle of fantastical plants.

During his investigation, Atomic Shrimp noticed that dodgy seed vendors were all using similar “cookie-cutter sites,” which are “probably very easy, cheap, and quick to deploy from a template.” The sites are also likely “acting as a front end for seedy, pun intended, drop shipping operations where the fulfilment, assuming there is such, is coming from the same sellers that list the same dodgy scam seeds for sale on Wish, AliExpress, Amazon, eBay, and other marketplaces.”

But instead of selling preposterously photoshopped seeds for “rainbow tomatoes,” scammers are using new tactics in a new age defined by AI slop.

One account on TikTok is even recycling the concept of a “cute cat orchid” by animating the images and turning them into a whole video.

Another video shows an adult cat’s face literally blinking its eyes as its disembodied head is reincarnated in the shape of a demonic orchid.

“How have 107 people bought this?” one TikTok account wrote in the comments.

“I can’t believe people actually fell for this,” another added.

            <h2>Investors Warn That Humanoid Robots Are the Next Financial Bubble</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-19</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI powered robots are slowly making their way into our world, from delivery bots on wheels to caregiver bots for the planet’s growing elderly population.

Nothing has captured the imagination of investors quite like humanoid robots, though, as they’ve poured untold billions into the sector amid hype that bots shaped like humans stand to impact almost every part of society — particularly by replacing jobs everywhere from domestic labor to the factory floor.

But a venture capitalist is now issuing a warning: that the current surge of investment dollars toward humanoid robots has the makings of the next financial bubble. Despite all the viral robot dancing videos, she says, the reality is that there are still an imposing number of technical kinks to work out — and hence, startups in the space are a long way from generating profits.

“[I]nvestors should remain disciplined and back companies that have realistic goals based on economics, not hype,” said Daiva Rakauskaitė, partner and manager at Aneli Capital, a venture capital firm based in Lithuania, in a company statement. “From day one, startups should aim for early revenue streams through licensing, partnerships and have a clear model of monetization in the near future. The same revenue-first philosophy can be applied to any field.”

She’s not the only one sounding the alarm. China’s leading economic planner, China’s National Development and Reform Commission, has warned that there’s a bubble forming around robotics and startups are making too similar robots from each other, which is inadvertently crowding out money for important research.

That’s on top of skepticism from robotics pioneer Rodney Brooks, inventor of the Roomba vacuum bot, who wrote earlier this year that all these investment dollars are a waste and humanoid robots are not safe enough to perform human tasks due to issues with hand dexterity and walking, among other lingering technical problems. In a nutshell, the gulf between what humanoid robots can do versus marketing hype is huge, Brooks said.

“We’re going to go through a big hype, and then there’s going to be a trough of disappointment,” he told The New York Times. (Underlining his warning: Roomba’s maker iRobot filed for bankruptcy this week.)

But we seem to be on a runaway train when it comes to humanoid robots, because “AI gives humanoids a commercial potential that was previously not possible,” the statement from Aneli reads.

In an October report from business analytics outfit CB Insights, the AI sector grabbed over 50 percent of more than $95 billion in venture capital funding in the third quarter of this year, while industrial humanoid robotic startups bagged 17 business deals.

But that report also warns about hype in the robotics space, saying it still faces “fundamental challenges with inference, dexterity, reliability, and cost, which limit initial use cases to structured environments like factories and warehouses with a controlled and predictable set of tasks.”

So what’s going to happen once the froth is gone: more humanoid robots dancing and working in factories — or junky vaporware bots collecting dust in our closets?

            <div id="article-text">Chinese robotics company Unitree’s G1 humanoid robot has taken over the internet by storm, from videos of it shooting hoops like an absolute boss to the more dubious viral fame that comes from being assaulted on camera by a livestreamer.

Its technical chops are beyond repute: the highly agile bipedal androids can perform gnarly kung fu moves and even take a direct dropkick without tumbling.

Now, the G1 robot has made its major stage debut by appearing alongside Chinese singer Wang Leehom during a Friday night concert in Chengdu, China.

Video footage shows an army of the robots dressed up in flashy outfits consisting of baggy pants and sparkling overshirts, pulling off some awfully convincing dance moves as theirmovements almost perfectly blend in with the human dancers accompanying Wang on stage.

At one point, several of the robots can even be seen performing a front flip in near-perfect unison.

It’s an impressive feat of coordination and programming, demonstrating once again how far humanoid robots, especially ones being developed in China, have come in a matter of years.

The concert was part of the Wang’s “Best Place Tour” and took place at the Chengdu Dong’an Lake Sports Park Multifunctional Gymnasium, which seats 18,000 spectators.

“The performance marked a rare example of a Robotic Dancer in concert, blending advanced technology with powerful live music,” the singer’s website boasts. “As the opening beats of ‘Open Fire’ filled the venue, robotic dancers appeared and moved in perfect synchronization with Wang Leehom’s choreography.”

“Many fans praised the performance as one of the most creative highlights of the Best Place Tour, showing how music and technology can merge seamlessly,” the website brags.

Indeed, the performance appears to have impressed many.

“Ok… robots in China are next level,” one observer tweeted. “They can do everything, even dancing like professionals!”

Besides being part of a high-budget stage performance, Unitree is looking to get all of its G1 robots dancing in people’s homes.

The company recently showed off a feature dubbed “Keep the Music Going, Keep the Dance Flowing,” which was “just developed in the past few days and hasn’t been rolled out to customers yet.”

The video shows the robot bobbing to a catchy disco beat — only to be pummeled with a soccer ball and smacked by a broomstick-wielding employee.

Others weren’t as amused by the demonstration.

“First we dance,” one user commented ominously, pasting a picture of the Terminator from James Cameron’s famed franchise. “Then you die.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/anonymous-messaging-app-ngl-was-acquired-by-earnphone-startup-mode-mobile/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anonymous messaging app NGL announced on Friday that it has been acquired by Mode Mobile, a smartphone rewards company that makes money by flooding its users with ads.

NGL quickly climbed the App Store charts after its launch in late 2021, joining a group of similar apps popular among teens that allow users to send and receive anonymous questions and messages. But it’s been embroiled in controversy for most of its existence.

Anonymous messaging apps are problematic because they can encourage bullying among teens — Snapchat banned third-party apps like NGL, LMK, Sendit, and YOLO from its platform in 2022 after a parent sued the company for its alleged role in her teenage son’s suicide.

NGL also came under fire for its shady growth hacking tactics, like sending fake messages to users that seemed like they were from real people but were actually automated by the app. Some users were tricked into paying a $9.99 monthly subscription to get hints about who sent the messages, which were fake.

After a two-year investigation, the FTC announced in 2024 that it would ban NGL from offering its app to minors — one of its most drastic interventions to protect minors from harmful social media experiences.

“NGL’s bait-and-switch tactic prompted many consumers to complain, which NGL executives laughed off, dismissing such users as ‘suckers’,” the FTC said in a statement at the time. NGL paid a $5 million fine to the FTC and complied with its demands.

NGL’s two founders, Raj Vir and João Figueiredo, are moving on from the app, according to Business Insider. The remaining three employees of the app will work for Mode Mobile.

Given NGL’s track record of dubious growth hacking, this partnership with Mode Mobile seems like a good match.

Mode Mobile makes a smartphone, which it calls the “EarnPhone,” that has “built-in earning features.” The company claims that users can make money by performing everyday tasks on their phone, like listening to music, playing games, and browsing the web. According to the company’s investor materials, Mode Mobile generates revenue from “digital advertising partners” that “pay for user attention and engagement.” Basically, your phone is constantly flooded with ads, but you might make enough money to buy a round of beers at a dive bar.

The terms of the sale were not disclosed.

            <h2>Hundreds of Cisco customers are vulnerable to new Chinese hacking campaign, researchers say</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/hundreds-of-cisco-customers-are-vulnerable-to-new-chinese-hacking-campaign-researchers-say/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Wednesday, Cisco revealed that a group of Chinese government-backed hackers is exploiting a vulnerability to target its enterprise customers who use some of the company’s most popular products.

Cisco has not said how many of its customers have already been hacked, or may be running vulnerable systems. Now, security researchers say there are hundreds of Cisco customers who could potentially be hacked.

Piotr Kijewski, the chief executive of the nonprofit Shadowserver Foundation that scans and monitors the internet for hacking campaigns, told TechCrunch that the scale of exposure “seems more in the hundreds rather than thousands or tens of thousands.”

Kijewski said the foundation was not seeing widespread activity, presumably because “current attacks are targeted.”

Shadowserver has a page where it’s tracking the number of systems that are exposed and vulnerable to the flaw disclosed by Cisco, named officially as CVE-2025-20393. The vulnerability is known as a zero-day, because the flaw was discovered before the company had time to make patches available. As of press time, India, Thailand, and the United States collectively have dozens of affected systems within their borders.

Censys, a cybersecurity firm that monitors hacking activities across the internet, is also seeing a limited number of affected Cisco customers. According to a blog post, Censys has observed 220 internet-exposed Cisco email gateways, one of the products known to be vulnerable.

In its security advisory published earlier this week, Cisco said that the vulnerability is present in software found in several products, including its Secure Email Gateway and its Secure Email and Web Manager.

Cisco said these systems are only vulnerable if they are reachable from the internet, and have its “spam quarantine” feature enabled. Neither of those two conditions are enabled by default, per Cisco, which would explain why there appears to be, relatively speaking, not that many vulnerable systems on the internet.

Cisco did not respond to a request for comment, asking if the company could corroborate the numbers seen by Shadowserver and Censys.

The bigger problem with this hacking campaign is that there are no patches available. Cisco recommends that customers wipe and “restore an affected appliance to a secure state,” as a way to remediate any breach.

“​​In case of confirmed compromise, rebuilding the appliances is, currently, the only viable option to eradicate the threat actors persistence mechanism from the appliance,” the company wrote in its advisory.

According to Cisco’s threat intelligence arm Talos, the hacking campaign has been ongoing since “at least late November 2025.”

            <h2>Yann LeCun confirms his new ‘world model’ startup, reportedly seeks $5B+ valuation</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/yann-lecun-confirms-his-new-world-model-startup-reportedly-seeks-5b-valuation/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Renowned AI scientist Yann LeCun confirmed on Thursday that he had launched a new startup — the worst-kept secret in the tech world — though he said he will not be running the new company as its CEO.

His startup is called Advanced Machine Intelligence (AMI) and has hired Alex LeBrun, co-founder and CEO of medical transcription AI startup darling Nabla, as its CEO. Nabla disclosed LeBrun’s new job in a press release and LeCun confirmed it in a brief post on LinkedIn.

“Yes, AMI Labs is my new startup. I’m the Executive Chairman. And Alex LeBrun is transitioning from CEO of Nabla to CEO of AMI Labs!” LeCun wrote.

AMI Labs is also reportedly seeking to raise €500 million (about $586 million) at a €3 billion valuation (about $3.5 billion) right out of the gate, before even launching, the Financial Times reported, citing people familiar with the dealmaking. Given the kind of money that VCs are throwing at AI startups founded by world-recognized AI scientists these days, that’s not even an comparatively outrageous ask.

For instance, former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati’s startup, Thinking Machines Lab, was valued at $12 billion for its seed round last year. And Murati doesn’t have the same kind of street cred as LeCun.

LeCun, a professor at New York University who was formerly VP and Chief AI Scientist at Meta, won the prestigious A.M. Turing Award, for his work on reinforcement learning.

The press release also confirms what everyone knew as well: that AMI Labs is working on world model AI. This is an alternative to LLMs where the AI attempts to understand its environment (aka the world) so it can simulate cause-and-effect and what-if scenarios to predict outcomes. World model creators believe it’s the answer to LLMs’ structural hallucination problems. LLMs can’t be trusted to never fabricate info because it is their very nature to be “non-deterministic” — that is, creative.

Top labs and startups like Google DeepMind and Fei-Fei Li’s startup, World Labs, are also developing world models. By that comparison, the fundraising aspirations of AMI might appear a bit more audacious. When World Labs debuted, Li raised $230 million at a $1 billion valuation right out of the gate, which was considered a lot at the time. But that was way back in August 2024, or about 100 AI years ago.

Meanwhile, Nabla says the company will be searching for a new CEO and will be, for now, run by its co-founder and COO, Delphine Groll, who has not been handed the reins permanently yet. Nabla also says it has signed a partnership to use AMI’s models as they are developed.

Nabla has raised $120 million in total from an all-star list of backers, including a $70 million Series C in June. LeCun is one of Nabla’s investors, as is Tony Fadell’s Build Collective, HV Capital, Highland Europe, and Cathay Innovation.

Nabla’s LeBrun could be a good choice for CEO. He’s been building multimodal AI since before anyone called it that, working at Nuance Communications in the early 2010s, which originally powered Apple’s Siri in those long-ago years when Siri was wow technology. (Microsoft eventually acquired Nuance.) He founded and sold a couple of natural language startups, including one to Facebook. Then he ran Facebook’s AI division before founding Nabla in 2018, according to his LinkedIn.

LeBrun said that Nabla, a darling of the Paris-based AI startup community, is still growing well.

“We have more than tripled our live ARR this year. Up next to $1B!” LeBrun wrote as he announced his departure as CEO. The founder says he will remain on at Nabla as chairman and chief AI scientist. Nabla declined further comment and AMI did not immediately respond to our request for comment.

            <h2>Circles of Epstein Hell</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2025/12/epstein-released-files-doj/685341/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Recent document and photograph releases from the ongoing investigation into the life of Jeffrey Epstein have produced little new information about his crimes, but they have filled out the ever-growing roster of his notable associates: Woody Allen, Larry Summers, Noam Chomsky, Donald Trump, and many more. The steady drip of investigative proceeds has brought about a remarkable degree of cross-partisan condemnation. Anyone who spent time with this evil person, the implication seems to be, must also be evil, and quite possibly in the same way that Epstein was evil. But though association with Epstein is certainly worthy of scrutiny, not everyone in his network is guilty of participation in his abusive sexual enterprise—or necessarily guilty at all.

The entire Epstein story is hellish from top to bottom, an almost-Gothic tale of the appalling deference society pays to the rich and powerful. At the lowest rung of this inferno is Epstein himself, always amused or impassive in photographs, a blithe and shallow cipher of a man. His main hobbies appear to have been defrauding people and having sex, which is empty and fleeting enough in its own right. But his fixation on minors meant that the objects of his desire were always slipping away as time conveyed them past the point of his interest, and the fact that he offended so consistently for so many years suggests that he was indeed never satisfied, but was rather driven by a malevolent lust. He was a pedophile, a scoundrel, and a coward.

Accordingly, what emerges from the paper trail of Epstein’s life is not a portrait of deep friendships, but a web of transactional, superficial relationships, designed for mutual enablement. It appears that there was no one in his life with whom he was vulnerable or honest; even his interactions with his closest confidante, Ghislaine Maxwell, read as generally businesslike. Maxwell was his procuress at the very least, and, according to victims’ testimony, was sometimes an active participant in sexual abuse herself.

Read: Virginia Giuffre’s family was shocked that Trump described her as ‘stolen’

Anyone who directly facilitated Epstein’s abuse—and there were apparently many such people beyond Maxwell—or participated in sexual exploitation themselves belongs on the same rung as Epstein; by their own deeds are they condemned, not simply by association. Britain’s former Prince Andrew, for instance, stands accused of sexually abusing one of Epstein’s victims, Virginia Giuffre, when she was 17 years old. (He has vigorously denied these allegations.) Where Trump fits into this picture is an open question and the subject of furious debate. Trump has repeatedly denied any knowledge of or engagement in Epstein’s illicit sexual activities, and has claimed that he was not in touch with him after the early 2000s.

On the next rung are those among Epstein’s massive network of associates who knew about his sex crimes or suspected something was amiss, but decided that whatever was happening was none of their business, or that it wasn’t their problem, or that it wasn’t their place to intervene, or that interfering would frustrate the transactional opportunities that had brought them into Epstein’s world in the first place. Contained in this group are scores of people who seem mainly to have been interested in ingratiating themselves with Epstein in hopes that he would grant them large sums of money for their various projects, or that his putative financial acumen could make them even richer (though in many cases Epstein was instead scamming them). These people can be distinguished from the prior set by the fact that they themselves neither committed sex crimes nor aided Epstein in doing so. Though, to the degree that Epstein used these relationships to insulate himself from the consequences of his crimes so that he could continue to offend, they are something like accessories after the fact.

In the furthermost reaches of Epstein’s orbit there are people who seem genuinely not to have known about his criminal activity, and who are therefore the least guilty of all of his associates. Consider, for example, Princess Sofia of Sweden, who met with Epstein on several occasions in social settings 20 years ago, when she was a 21-year-old swimsuit model. Epstein’s emails show that Barbro Ehnbom, a Swedish business executive, had effected an email introduction between Epstein and Sofia, sending along a picture of the future princess. Epstein replied with interest, and offered to send her a ticket to visit him in the Caribbean. The role she played in the exchange seems more analogous to the experience of some of Epstein’s victims than his accomplices, in that she was a young and beautiful woman presented to Epstein by a wealthy friend and then invited to an island in the Caribbean. (The Swedish royal palace has stated that Sofia declined the invitation.) Given that context, it seems perfectly plausible that Sofia was not responsible for any crime or for any effort to shield Epstein from accountability. Nevertheless, her reputation has been tarnished by the Epstein affair, which brings with it a strong presupposition of sexual depravity. Again, there is no reason to believe that the princess did anything especially wrong. Her case appears to be a genuine instance of guilt by association, because it seems she is guilty of nothing more than some minor failure of prudence, meaning that she ought to have been more careful with her company.

But many of those moneyed and prestigious Epstein orbiters innocent of sex crimes may be implicated in another category of offense: conspiracy to hoard and entrench wealth. The Epstein affair has produced evidence confirming that many of the people who control society’s wealth, politics, and prestige move in the same small circles, and may work together in private to make consequential decisions about the movement of money through society. This is hugely demoralizing; in a recent NBC poll, 54 percent of Americans now agree that “when it comes to politics and society, nothing really matters because powerful people will always do whatever they want.” They have ample reason for thinking so. It’s hard to imagine how the Epstein narrative could ever conclusively end, because it has also triggered a legitimation crisis.

Evil often presents a front of sophistication and implies a great deal of depth, when in fact it is almost always pathetic, stupid, and meaningless. Epstein was connected to some of the world’s most significant figures and had apparently unlimited resources at his fingertips, but his life seems to have amounted to very little. That is perhaps why one category of Epstein associate appears to have no known members: real and true friends, Ghislaine’s superficial closeness to him notwithstanding. Was there anyone Epstein bared his soul to, anyone he cared for beyond their practical use to him, or anyone who saw underneath his slick veneer, if there was anything there to see? This would be a more morally defensible group than his existing crop of allies, because complete isolation from human relationships is never a just penalty (which, among other reasons, is why solitary confinement is a fundamentally inhumane practice: Even the wicked are due a friend or two, supposing they can win them and keep them). And, insofar as those relationships can serve as a kind of tether to the moral community, cutting them off could conceivably be counterproductive. But all of that is likely beside the point, because no such person is evinced in the known fragments of Epstein’s life. He was little more than a hungry ghost.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is an edition of the Books Briefing, our editors’ weekly guide to the best in books.

Venice is a city so globally famous that even those who have never been there tend to hold opinions about it. In my experience, those are frequently negative: It’s too expensive, too hot, too crowded with tourists. Calling it overrated has almost become a cliché; people love to remind one another that it’s sinking—fast. At the same time, few places have had as strong, or as enduring, a hold on the artistic imagination. John Singer Sargent, Claude Monet, and Isabella Stewart Gardner, among many others, have long been inspired by Venice’s rich cultural history and captivating views.

First, here are three new stories from The Atlantic’s Books section:

Henry James was part of that group. He visited Venice 10 times between 1869 and 1907, and made it the setting of his 1888 novella The Aspern Papers, which was serialized in The Atlantic. The book’s narrator goes to Italy on a hunt for letters by the late poet Jeffrey Aspern to a former lover, Juliana, which he believes the now-elderly lady has secreted away in her palazzo. This year, we sent Anne Applebaum on a related quest: She showed up in Italy searching for the city James got to know—the Venice that inspired a substantial part of his work.

James’s Venice doesn’t dwell among oppressive crowds and opulent halls; it lurks in deserted squares, on less-traveled islands, and within cool, dark churches that hold Renaissance masterpieces. Venice was already becoming a tourist hot spot when James was alive, but he gloried in another city, and that city still exists. Even now, “if you take an odd turn down a narrow pathway and head away from the main attractions,” Applebaum writes, “the crowds thin out, and eventually you can find yourself quite alone.” James wrote appealingly about exploring the city’s “campos—the little squares formed about every church—some of them most sunnily desolate, the most grass-grown, the most cheerfully sad little reliquaries of a splendid past that you can imagine.”

Applebaum’s trip helped me think of Venice differently. She enjoyed the same “perfect light” on the island of Torcello that James saw, the same gold mosaic that covers one wall of the Basilica of Santa Maria Assunta; she even walked through the same palazzo on which James modeled the one in The Aspern Papers. She stood on the balcony of the Palazzo Barbaro, another house where James frequently stayed, looking out at the Grand Canal just as the author did almost 150 years ago. If you know where to look, she argues, and if you take the time to do so, the old Venice is always there.

In James’s The Aspern Papers, an American uses “duplicity” to access a palazzo. Fortunately, there are easier ways to discover the writer’s beloved Venice.

This novel is so packed with plot that Quentin Tarantino adapted it into the extra-long film Jackie Brown, in 1997. If you’ve seen the movie, you might imagine Pam Grier sauntering across the page, but this is a breakneck novel in its own right: Characters make and shatter alliances at dizzying speed, and nobody’s motives are ever quite what they seem. A middle-aged flight attendant, Jackie Burke, finds herself trapped between the FBI and an ambitious gunrunner when she gets caught moving his merchandise across international borders. Shoot-outs, sting operations, and boatloads of blow: This book has it all. It’s a terrific beach read, but it has enough substance to keep you sustained no matter where you pick it up.  — M. L. Rio

From our list: Eight plot-heavy books that will keep you turning pages

A Daring New Take on Shakespeare’s Most Famous Soliloquy

The “To be, or not to be” soliloquy sets a particularly tricky trap. On-screen, the speech’s prestige can overwhelm its existential subject matter, and the passage tends to get overacted. “Because it’s a beautiful speech,” Peter Kirwan, a professor of Shakespeare and performance at Mary Baldwin University, told me, “the beauty of the speech kind of takes away from what it actually means for someone to be working through this.” The fact that any soliloquy halts dramatic action also poses a challenge. Onstage, an actor can naturally hold an audience’s attention, being in the same physical venue. Cinema’s visual language, though, has the potential to undermine the words’ meaning. The sentiment can become a spectacle more than an interior reflection made exterior.

Always nice to bash Microsoft, but Copilot runs on gpt-5. Isn&#39;t OpenAI to blame?

Did OpenAI do the false advertising?  If not, then they&#39;re not to blame.

Nothing about actually having a positive contribution in any way. Good old crappy Microsoft.

I am very on board with policies that clamp down on this tidal wave of cheap junkBecause it is cheap does not mean it must also be bad (although I will agree there was a lot of cheap junk being sold).  There are some items for which the only manufacturer ended up being offshore, so now that item costs more due to the taxes.

I am very on board with policies that clamp down on this tidal wave of cheap junk

Because it is cheap does not mean it must also be bad (although I will agree there was a lot of cheap junk being sold).  There are some items for which the only manufacturer ended up being offshore, so now that item costs more due to the taxes.

Whatever. His tariffs have thrown a lot of small American businesses out of business because they relied on stuff that is not made in the U.S. but is made by China. That&#39;s American jobs down the dumpster because that idiot never thinks further than his nose. People like you should stop buying his cheap bullshit.

We all know the counter argument. However, it will take a fair amount of time for American manufacturing to gear up. Except that won&#39;t happen because, these being small businesses, the market to them

So the cheap junk will come from a different place. What was the point?

I don&#39;t understand how decreasing import to the USA has increased buying in Europe. Was there a shortage and more was going to the US? Did they reduce prices in Europe? The article says &quot;redirected a tsunami of cheap stuff into Europe&quot;, so I don&#39;t quite understand how the tariff in the US has increased buying in Europe.

Indeed there is no reason for a connection. What I think is happening is Shein and JD.com, maybe others, decided to open retail shops in Europe, so their revenue from Europe is now soaring.

I don&#39;t understand how decreasing import to the USA has increased buying in Europe.Because you have a working brain.

I don&#39;t understand how decreasing import to the USA has increased buying in Europe.

I don&#39;t personally nor do I know anyone who says they miss TEMU or missing the extra few pages of junk to scroll thru first on Amazon one little bit.

I imagine the people who do, still having their needs for the instant gratification of opening a package, any package are met with trash from Dollar General

I&#39;m pretty sure someone was expecting that we were addicted to that $100B trade, and by throwing a 15-999% tariff on it, 15B-1.5T of fresh taxes were going to be generated. With a 40% drop in purchasing, that&#39;s going to translate to a lot lower tax intake than expected. The price for that will probably be more inflation, but the powers that be have shown very little concern over using other, more nuclear options (possibly even literal nuclear options), for handling budget shortfalls.

The fact there can be a 40% decline in an entire category and you don&#39;t see it on the streets, in the form of empty shelves, shuttered websites etc suggests to me that a lot of economists when the considered tariff impacts wild underestimated the gamification of shopping.

There are ton of people out there that just scroll and a click buy on things they don&#39;t need and if they thought about it for more than moment would realize they don&#39;t actually really want - they&#39;re just bored...They solve that by frequentl

I think there was a much better way to address the cheap junk from the likes of Temu and Ali express. Closing the De minimis exemption means you can&#39;t even send Christmas gifts to family members abroad.

One of my hobbies is working on/restoring vintage European cars. Most of the parts are ONLY available abroad. Even the few domestic suppliers have pretty much emptied their warehouses. With de minimis gone, you can easily pay $50 for tiny odds and ends like a bolt that cost $5. Before, the Bolt would be $5 and they&#39;d charge you $5 to ship it and you&#39;d get it for $10. Now, most shippers charge a minimum fee of $20 for customs processing and a minimum of $20 tariff regardless of value (because they won&#39;t allow processing of a $1 tariff). And it&#39;s not just the cost. Shipments that would arrive in a few days (because they didn&#39;t get a full customs inspection) can now take weeks to arrive. Other&#39;s I&#39;ve talked to have had shipments flagged and returned for no apparent reason. We are collateral damage in the fight against cheap Chinese junk. I&#39;ve never even ordered from Temu.

I can&#39;t wait for Democrats to get back in power and start ripping these evil companies to shreds.

What I&#39;m waitig for is when a Democratic president is in office and starts making wholesale changes.  The howls from Republicans will be glorious.  Sending their whines to the Supreme Court will be even funnier because if the Court says the president can&#39;t do that after they&#39;ve let Trump do whatever he wants, they just outed themselves as partisan hacks and can be ignored.

As Jackson remarked, let them try and enforce it.

DoorDash, DeliverEasy and Uber are guilty of it too

A deal for &quot;Free Delivery&quot; through a delivery provider, gets you all the way to &quot;checkout&quot;, then adds on service charges, a delivery fee, the credits back the delivery fee.

&quot;Free delivery&quot; is free. Not an arbitrary percentage of the delivery cost they&#39;ve decided to split between delivery fee and service charge. They&#39;re both delivery fees. It&#39;s a delivery service. All their fees are delivery fees.

A Wisconsin jury found state court Judge Hannah Dugan guilty of obstructing federal immigration enforcement on Thursday, delivering a victory to the Trump administration’s crusade against anyone—even judicial officers—who attempt to impede its mass deportation campaign. Dugan, a Milwaukee County Circuit Judge, helped a noncitizen evade ICE agents at the state courthouse by instructing him to exit the courtroom through a specific door. Agents apprehended him anyway, and prosecutors promptly charged Dugan with obstruction, a felony punishable by up to five years’ imprisonment.

On this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed the jury’s verdict, and the dissonance of a legal regime in which the president can break the law with impunity while a judge faces prison for impeding an immigration arrest inside her own courtroom. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: Judge Dugan allegedly pointed an undocumented immigrant to a side door in her courtroom to evade ICE agents. And now she has been found guilty of a felony offense. This verdict is so depressing in so many ways. Can we count them?

Mark Joseph Stern: We are living in a world in which the Supreme Court has granted sweeping criminal immunity to presidents—specifically, to Donald Trump—for actions that they take that fall anywhere within the “outer perimeter” of their “official responsibilities.” SCOTUS simply made that rule up in Trump v. United States. Yet there is a real doctrine of judicial immunity that has deep roots in American law. It provides an absolute shield against prosecution of judges for all actions taken in their official capacity. That has long been understood to include how judges direct activities within their courtrooms. Now, remember what Dugan allegedly did: She directed a criminal defendant in her courtroom to leave through a certain door so ICE would not arrest him, thereby preventing her from continuing to adjudicate his case. The Trump administration argued that Dugan should not receive judicial immunity for this act. And U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman agreed, paving the way for Thursday’s guilty verdict.

The idea that a judge can’t claim judicial immunity for the act of telling someone to leave through a certain door in her courtroom strikes me as absurd. Set aside professional penalties. How in the world can a judge face criminal prosecution for this conduct after Trump v. United States? The Supreme Court has now granted the president absolute immunity for ordering a sham investigation into a free and fair election in order to nullify valid votes and overturn the results. But Dugan can be prosecuted for this? I just can’t square those things.

I’m not saying that what Dugan did was unquestionably right or good. I am saying that when a judge in her robes, in her own courtroom, tells someone who is going to appear at her hearing to leave through a particular door, she is surely acting within the outer perimeter of her official duties. Certainly much more so than Trump was acting within the outer perimeter of his official duties when he attempted to secure himself another term by overturning the results of an election.

I think you’re making a subtle argument and it’s worth landing on it really squarely. It’s one thing to confer maximalist, seemingly boundless authority on the executive branch and on the president that, by definition, circumscribes the judicial role. But to aggressively chip away, cut away, minimize, and cabin the powers of the judiciary at the same time? That’s really salt in the wound, and a threat to an independent judiciary.

Let’s be clear: This is an effort to chill the conduct of judges, especially state court judges, who believe they should decide the case before them without worrying that ICE agents are going to ambush plaintiffs or defendants or witnesses and thwart their effort to carry out justice. That is what happened here. That is what is happening in many states around the country. Some, like New York, have tried to block ICE agents from going into state courthouses. This was Judge Dugan doing much the same thing; trying to contend with the fact that ICE was about to arrest someone who was due to appear before her.

I think the verdict shows a real failure of the jury to understand how vindictive and partisan this prosecution was, and to see the deeper issues lurking here. It’s awful that the U.S. attorney brought this case in the first place. I think the prosecutors who worked on this case should be ashamed of themselves. I guess my one consolation is that Judge Adelman is known to be a very lenient sentencer. If Dugan’s conviction is upheld on appeal, I think it’s unlikely that he’ll give her any term of confinement behind bars. She has no criminal record and there are no other factors that would call for a higher sentence. Adelman might impose house arrest, but probation seems more likely.

When Robert F. Kennedy Jr. convened a panel on Monday to discuss “chronic Lyme,” many leading researchers of the disease were genuinely excited. Kennedy’s Department of Health and Human Services promised to allocate more resources to understanding the disease. There was hope, among experts, that this would mean an important new chapter for Lyme research.

But there’s a problem: Kennedy is a conspiracy theorist with seemingly little understanding of how modern science works. It didn’t emerge in Monday’s roundtable, but Kennedy, for example, once claimed Lyme disease was developed by the U.S. military as a bioweapon in the ’70s. He still maintains that the medical community has “gaslit” the public over Lyme and even asserted, without evidence, that during the Biden years, there were top officials within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services who, due to political motivations, were “saying Lyme disease did not exist.”

This is not an ideal mindset to bring to any medical topic, but it’s particularly troubling for Lyme, given that it is already one of the most controversial diseases.

Active Lyme disease, identified in the 1970s, is not a particularly mysterious illness. The tick bite that transfers the bacteria typically causes an easily identifiable bullseye rash; once spotted, symptoms, which can include fever, headaches, stiffness, and fatigue, can be resolved with a round of antibiotics. The treatment of active Lyme is fairly straightforward. But the aftermath of active Lyme remains a deeply unsettled area of science. A subset of Lyme patients go on to complain of arthritis-like joint pain, fatigue, and neurological issues for years afterward. For a smaller population, the symptoms become debilitating. Some patients grow desperate and even suicidal.

Until recently, many mainstream medical professionals disputed the idea of “chronic Lyme” altogether, insisting that Lyme was done once it was treated with antibiotics. Any complaints the patients had afterward, they argued, likely resulted from other conditions or from psychiatric disorders, which can indeed cause severe physical symptoms. But patients don’t like being told something is all in their head, particularly when their lives are falling apart over a maddeningly persistent illness. As a result, a “Lyme community” began to form of patients who felt forced to become their own champions and validate one another’s suffering. Many looked for answers outside conventional medicine.

The rush of pseudoscientists, grifters, wellness influencers, and celebrity advocates into the space only made the chronic Lyme debate more fraught. Even the term “chronic Lyme” was, and is, highly charged: In medical literature, doctors call it Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome, in part to clarify that they are not referring to a continuous, chronic infection with the bacteria but only to a constellation of symptoms that develop and linger after confirmed bouts of Lyme disease. The people this term doesn’t include are those—often self-diagnosed laypeople or the patients of anti-scientific practitioners—who believe that they have insidious Lyme infections missed by blood tests and persistent beyond any normal antibiotic treatment. (The research does not show any evidence for a chronic Lyme infection, experts said.) These patients never developed the rash or had any other concrete evidence of Lyme infection. These are the cases that caused many in the mainstream medical community to dismiss “chronic Lyme” as nonsense.

But mainstream scientists weren’t entirely ignoring the possibility of both undetectable and chronic Lyme, as much as Kennedy may insist otherwise. Many researchers agreed there was a need for better testing and that it was possible that real Lyme sufferers were going undiagnosed. And even in the earliest Lyme studies, experts said, the National Institutes of Health had attempted to suss out longer-term damage. The problem, said Dr. Brian Fallon, the director of the Lyme and Tick-Borne Diseases Research Center at Columbia University, was that most Lyme research dealt primarily with “well-defined” patients—those with telltale rashes and active infection that showed on blood tests—in order to have clean, careful studies. Those patients were those with the easiest cases, with easy diagnostics and prompt treatment. The potentially messier cases, without rashes, or with long periods of infection without treatment, were not taken into account. The pace of the research moved relatively slowly, given that Lyme was never such an urgent problem. It is not deadly or contagious like Ebola or AIDS. For many patients, it’s more like a temporary inconvenience.

But two things changed. First, climate change has made Lyme an increasingly visible and pressing issue. As the tick population explodes across North America, Lyme has become a virtually inescapable threat in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest. Second, a global pandemic struck. In its aftermath, research institutions turned their resources to questions about COVID’s long-term effects. As they did, they began to bring those same questions to other infectious diseases that might result in chronic conditions.

“It shouldn’t come as any surprise to the world right now that infections can cause chronic problems, because of what we have learned from long COVID,” Fallon said. “I think it’s helped tremendously in changing the conversation. … There’s a great deal of interest in looking at something that’s been ignored.”

It is now a potent moment for Lyme research. If scientists can get the funding and resources they need to develop better diagnostics and unlock the mechanism that explains what is making chronic Lyme patients sick, it could bring profound relief to hundreds of thousands of Americans, allowing them to get the care they need. But a large part of pursuing a major medical breakthrough is separating science from pseudoscience in order to allow the scientific process to proceed with its dispassionate methods. And Kennedy has shown that he is incapable of that—and is steering his HHS accordingly.

There are urgent reasons, beyond the success of future research, for the leading medical institutions in the country to try to purge the lingering anti-scientific elements in the Lyme conversation: They may actually put patients’ health at risk. When confusion meets desperation, as it does when the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health cannot provide any clarity, patients and doctors may seek out unconventional answers.

“A lot of these patients undergo bizarre, unapproved therapies, like extended intravenous antibiotic therapies, for months or even years,” Dr. Durland Fish, the chief executive officer of the American Lyme Disease Foundation, told Slate. “A lot of them are bogus.”

These treatments, Fish said, can be expensive, as they usually aren’t covered by insurance. And they can be deeply dispiriting when they don’t work. Some patients, he said, can become depressed and even suicidal.

And perhaps even more worryingly, if a patient becomes convinced they have chronic Lyme based on an influencer’s videos, they may be diverted from identifying something else. Part of the reason chronic Lyme has always been controversial is that its symptoms are so nonspecific. Fatigue, brain fog, headaches, and joint pain can be caused by anemia, sleep disorders, mental illnesses, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus, ALS, fibromyalgia, cancer, and many other conditions.

“From my perspective, I think the misdiagnosis and mistreatment is a bigger problem than the actual Lyme disease,” he said.

Now, as chronic Lyme emerges from its era of hazy theories and pseudoscience, it continues to be tainted with its previous associations. As an example, New Jersey Rep. Chris Smith, who attended Monday’s hearing, slipped a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act, which passed Wednesday, requiring the Government Accountability Office to investigate whether Lyme disease was bioengineered by the U.S. military. (Lyme disease, it should be noted, predates the United States itself by millennia.) During Monday’s hearing, he complained that mainstream news media, including the Washington Post, had portrayed him and his allies “like we have a tinfoil hat on our heads.” Smith is a Republican, but conspiratorial thinking on Lyme is a bipartisan problem.

And few are as damaging to chronic Lyme’s reputation among skeptics as Kennedy himself. As head of HHS, Kennedy has baselessly attributed deaths to the COVID vaccine, connected both Tylenol and circumcision to autism, and linked SSRIs to mass shootings. In one throwaway comment in the hearing, he claimed that the antiretroviral drug developed during the AIDS epidemic under Anthony Fauci’s NIH killed more people than AIDS itself.

The panel he convened was similarly questionable. Participants were largely not the leading experts in Lyme research but instead patients, medical technology business owners, politicians, and people with out-there theories about the disease. One person claimed there was a connection between Lyme disease and autism—something no mainstream researcher seems to find credible. Another person, who is a patient and an HHS official, asserted that had she followed standard medical Lyme treatments, “I would be dead today.” Lyme disease is not a fatal disease.

Still, Fish, like the other experts, said that Kennedy’s NIH putting more resources into understanding chronic Lyme could be extremely helpful for the thousands of Americans struggling with mysterious symptoms. These patients, he said, need answers and better diagnostic tools.

“These patients have serious illnesses, and I don’t blame them for raising hell about the situation,” he said.

Lyme is a disease that makes sense as a target for Kennedy, as obsessing over chronic illnesses is a core tenet of the “Make America Healthy Again” movement. Kennedy has said one of his sons developed Bell’s palsy from Lyme and that one son developed severe, debilitating chronic Lyme. Kennedy is also, fittingly for his family’s reputation for being full of robust outdoorsmen, a big proponent of getting outside into the woods—advice being made dangerous by the ticks. He noted the “spiritual” value of the outdoors in his address Monday.

Lyme also makes some sense as a target for the moment, when there is no epidemiological crisis such as SARS or COVID or AIDS consuming all the oxygen in the conversation. Leading experts in Lyme say people are beginning to understand the “insidious epidemic” of Lyme, as Dr. John Aucott, the director of the Johns Hopkins Lyme Disease Clinical Research Center, put it. He and Fallon expressed the need not just for studies and testing but an entire built-out academic infrastructure around it. Right now, most academic programs are struggling under federal budget cuts; Lyme research is one area where Kennedy’s personal interest may be of use.

For countless Americans, this could be great news. Aucott noted that he watched AIDS go from a death sentence to a manageable condition—proof that painstaking, rigorous research can revolutionize the understanding and treatment of a new disease. Today, he said, some of his Lyme patients are sicker than the AIDS patients were at the end of his time treating them.

Hopefully, Kennedy’s anti-science approach will not impede the evidence-based Lyme research that comes. His sloppiness, as when he repeatedly during panel discussions conflated Lyme disease and Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome, may not carry through to actual policy. And in at least one way, experts gave Kennedy credit on something else: He’s right, they said, that most people are not just sick from psychosomatic causes. “These are complex illnesses we’re just starting to understand,” Aucott said. “They’ve got a hard-to-explain illness. That doesn’t mean it’s just in their heads.”

But when diseases are particularly complex, and when the medical understanding of a topic shifts rapidly, it’s particularly damaging to have a man who consistently undermines the mainstream scientific community as the face of its public health response. The public needs clarity from its government, not just disruption. In this case, clarity doesn’t just mean validating suffering patients’ frustrations. It means acknowledging the limits of our knowledge while having an open mind—and focusing not on heated feelings but on the scientific process.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">hands on Infinite Machine, a New York-based electric vehicle startup, began with a stolen Vespa.

Eddie Cohen, president and co-founder of the company, told The Register that he and his brother Joseph were living together during the COVID outbreak.

&quot;His Vespa had gotten stolen and we just kinda had this crazy idea … if we were to design one for the future that was all-electric, had the best technology, what would it look like? What would it feel like?&quot; Cohen explained.

As I stood beside P1, a $10,000 electric seated scooter, and Olto, a $3,495 bike-lane legal class 2 e-bike, that question had been answered. The brothers&#39; company started shipping the P1 to customers in October and expects to deliver Olto in early 2026.

&quot;We just started dabbling and we came up with P1, you know, just a sketch,&quot; said Cohen, who had a background in product design. &quot;And then, over the subsequent two or three years, we just continued to noodle on it. Nights and weekends, we both had other jobs.&quot;

In January, 2024, he said, Infinite Machines became their full-time job. He and his brother assembled a team and began moving from sketch to actual product.

&quot;So P1 is a plated, M-class vehicle,&quot; said Cohen, meaning drivers should be licensed for motorcycles unless they only use it in Mode 1, where speed is capped at 30 mph.

&quot;It goes 65 miles an hour, 60-mile range. The battery is in the floor. It fits two people. It has a full touchscreen – 8.5&quot; display – that has what we call Phone Connect. So it connects to your iPhone, you get Maps. Music, etc. It has whisper-quiet acceleration. It&#39;s kind of like riding a Tesla for the first time, but it&#39;s even more surreal because it&#39;s silent.&quot;

The P1, said Cohen, was designed from scratch. &quot;All of the componentry is custom-toolled and developed. That&#39;s not a trivial thing.&quot;

He pointed to the fender for example. It&#39;s not off the shelf.

&quot;We designed it,&quot; he said. &quot;We made the tooling. We made the molds, and made it so that the engineering works just because we actually care about the details.&quot;

It&#39;s an opinionated design. The use of anodized aluminum and steel makes comparisons with the Tesla Cybertruck unavoidable. But the DMC DeLorean is an equally apt comparison, perhaps more so given the challenging nature of startup vehicle companies.

&quot;We were inspired by the Cybertruck,&quot; said Cohen, &quot;but we didn&#39;t set out to design the Cybertruck of scooters. We used it as one reference point in a lineage of vehicles, like Marcelo Gandini and the Lancias back in the day. The Diablo, the Countach, the DeLorean, like these are all references that we love.&quot;

Cohen added that the plan is to explore future colors, and variants for specific markets like police and other first responders.

Your correspondent had the opportunity to take the P1 for a spin in San Francisco and it was a thrill – it&#39;s fun, fast, and handles well. I&#39;m not by nature a rider of scooters or motorcycles, though I&#39;ve enjoyed the lazy ease of electric bikes. Were I a younger man, more willing to mix it up among motorists without the protection of an automotive frame, airbags, and a seatbelt, I&#39;d be looking seriously at the P1 or the more modest Olto for urban transportation.

The P1 includes just the right number of physical buttons, with well-conceived software and hardware. It features secure storage, front and rear cameras, phone-based keyless access, and GPS location tracking, among other niceties. It relies on a Linux fork called IMOS, Infinite Machine OS.

Presently, there&#39;s no AI on-board – which this reporter considers a selling point. Cohen recounted how someone had asked the company&#39;s head of systems what AI is being explored. &quot;He kind of was like, &#39;Look, they&#39;re expensive, right? You put a Nvidia chip on here and you put a camera and it&#39;s expensive. It adds to the [bill-of-materials] cost. And it&#39;s not obvious that there is value there.&quot;

He added however that the company has ideas for ways AI might be useful to improve the safety of two-wheeled vehicles.

Software applications for the vehicles will be developed in time. Cohen said that Infinite Machine does gather data to understand how people are using its vehicles, but does so in a way that respects privacy.

&quot;So we don&#39;t know anything about the individual rider and we have anonymized everything,&quot; he said. &quot;We care about rider privacy. We also care about, like, you buy this vehicle, it&#39;s just gonna work. Like you don&#39;t have to pay a subscription ever. It&#39;s just gonna work all the time and it&#39;s your vehicle. But we do anonymize and track usage.&quot;

Cohen said he expects the target market in the US will be those who appreciate technology and design. &quot;They want something that&#39;s new and they want the best,&quot; he said.

&quot;In 2025, the ultimate luxury is really time and freedom to do what you want. And P1 saves you time. It&#39;s the fastest and best way to get around any city like in San Francisco, this thing is liberating. It&#39;s amazing. It handles the hills totally well. You can park it anywhere. You don&#39;t have to spend 30 minutes looking for a spot. You get to live life on your own terms.&quot;

Cohen expects the Olto will have broader appeal.

&quot;For Olto, I think it&#39;s for everyone,&quot; he said &quot;I think it&#39;s the mom in Brooklyn dropping her kids to school. I think it&#39;s the person that is single and wants to commute to work. I think it&#39;s the SoCal kid that&#39;s going to school. This is an accessible vehicle. It&#39;s very easy to ride, very approachable, and affordable.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A Venezuelan gang described by US officials as &quot;a ruthless terrorist organization&quot; faces charges over alleged deployment of malware on ATMs across the country, illegally siphoning millions of dollars.

Two indictments were returned in Nebraska, collectively charging 54 alleged members of the Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang in connection with a spate of ATM jackpotting attacks.

The gang allegedly deployed a variant of Ploutus malware on ATMs across the US. Court documents assert that TdA members would travel in groups and compromise ATMs managed by certain banks and credit unions.

The alleged gang members would inspect each ATM for external security features before opening the machine&#39;s door, checking for alarms being triggered or law enforcement rushing to the scene.

Once they confirmed a machine could be safely tampered with, the suspects would either remove the ATM&#39;s hard drive and install the Ploutus variant before reinstalling it, or in some cases simply replace the hard drive with one that already had Ploutus installed. Other instances saw the malware deployed using external thumb drives.

Thought to be first observed in Mexico back in 2013, Ploutus malware targets the cash-dispensing module of ATMs, allowing attackers to issue commands that force the machine to spurt out bills.

According to data shared by the Justice Department, ATM jackpotting attacks have seen more than $40 million stolen via physical device tampering and malware deployment since 2020. It did not share specific figures about how much of that could be attributed to TdA.

&quot;Tren de Aragua is not just a criminal gang; they are a ruthless terrorist organization that preys on communities, spreads fear, and bankrolls violence across borders,&quot; said Mark Zito, special agent in charge at HSI Kansas City.

&quot;HSI and our law enforcement partners will track you down, break up your networks, and ensure you never find safe harbor in the United States. Our mission is to protect American families from predators who think they can operate with impunity. We will not tolerate foreign terrorists stealing from our citizens and threatening our homeland. Our communities are safer today because of the relentless work of this team, and we are just getting started.&quot;

Across the various indictments against alleged TdA members in Nebraska over the past year are additional charges related to assault, money laundering, and sex trafficking of minors.

The announcement comes as the US announces a broader crackdown on the Venezuelan gang, with a slew of indictments across various states charging hundreds of alleged members since January.

The DOJ in Washington also unsealed indictments on Thursday related to other violent crimes committed by more than 70 alleged members, including murder, kidnapping, and drug trafficking.

Two of the group&#39;s suspected leaders were indicted in Colorado on various charges, including RICO offenses, while the alleged mastermind and co-leader of TdA, Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores, was charged in New York.

Flores remains at large, although there is a $5 million bounty on his head. The co-leader of TdA escaped from Venezuela&#39;s Tocorón prison in 2012, allegedly with the help of Jimena Romina Araya Navarro – another TdA leader – before being sent back in 2013.

Tocorón was notoriously lawless for years, but during the early 2000s, TdA began to assemble, and by the following decade, it assumed total control of the prison, infamously building amenities such as the Tokio nightclub, a zoo, a swimming pool, and more.

In 2023, Venezuelan authorities regained control of the facility in an operation that saw 11,000 officers storm the grounds, but Flores and his associates reportedly escaped days before.

In other states, New Mexico charged 11 alleged members over violent and armed crimes, and in Texas, more suspected high-ranking members and those in leadership roles were charged with cocaine trafficking, murder, and extortion.

The renewed focus on tackling TdA began in February when Attorney General Pamela Bondi expanded the remit of Joint Task Force Vulcan. Created in 2019, it was originally tasked with bringing down MS-13 gang members, but is now also responsible for handling TdA.

&quot;Immediately upon taking office, I directed the Department of Justice to fiercely pursue the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations,&quot; said Bondi.

&quot;This latest multi-state series of charges underscores the Trump Administration&#39;s unwavering commitment to restoring public safety, dismantling violent trafficking networks, and ridding our country of Tren de Aragua terrorists.&quot; ®

            <h2>DOE recruits cloud, chip, and AI giants for Trump's Genesis Mission</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/19/doe_genesis_agreements/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The US Department of Energy (DOE) has a Christmas gift for the AI industry in the shape of agreements for collaboration in the Trump administration&#39;s Genesis Mission, which aims to use AI to drive scientific discoveries.

On Thursday, the DOE said it had signed agreements with 24 organizations interested in working to advance the Genesis project.

The list includes the usual AI ecosystem suspects, with developers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI; major cloud operators AWS, Google, Microsoft, and Oracle; server makers Dell and HPE; chip suppliers AMD, Intel, and Nvidia; plus everyone&#39;s favorite Bond villain organization, Palantir.

However, the agreements are not contracts to provide services as such, but are described by the DOE as Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with organizations that have either expressed interest in response to a Request for Information (RFI), or which already have active projects with DOE and its National Laboratories for activities related to the Genesis Mission.

&quot;These agreements help advance President Trump&#39;s Executive Order to build the national AI platform for scientific discovery and uplift the entire US R&D ecosystem,&quot; said Genesis Mission director and DOE Under Secretary for Science Dr Darío Gil.

The Genesis project was kick-started just last month via an executive order issued by President Trump. It aims to create an integrated Science and Security Platform for the US by pulling together supercomputers and other resources across the DOE&#39;s 17 National Laboratories and supplementing this with input from industry and academia.

Earlier this month, the agency announced $320 million in funding for four initiatives as part of the project, including the American Science Cloud (AmSC) as the infrastructure platform for Genesis, the Transformational AI Models Consortium (ModCon) to work on model development, and various projects to curate existing datasets and develop AI models validated for scientific applications.

So-called neocloud firm CoreWeave is also among the signatories with the DOE, and the rent-a-GPU biz said that it plans to make its purpose-built AI cloud platform available to support advanced scientific workloads.

CoreWeave chief exec Michael Intrator said Genesis &quot;represents a vital national commitment to accelerating scientific discovery and reaffirming America&#39;s leadership in research and innovation.&quot;

Consultants McKinsey & Company recently opined that neoclouds such as CoreWeave needed to adapt their business model to offering services built on their AI infrastructure rather than just renting GPU time, and Genesis may prove just such an opportunity.

Google&#39;s DeepMind subsidiary is set to make available its frontier AI for Science models and agentic tools to scientists at the DOE National Laboratories, starting with AI co-scientist on Google Cloud, it declared.

This it described as a &quot;multi-agent virtual scientific collaborator built on Gemini,&quot; which has been trained using Google&#39;s cloud-based TPU AI chips.

OpenAI said that the agreement builds on its existing work with DOE&#39;s National Laboratories, and creates a path for the parties to discuss and develop potential follow-on agreements as specific projects take shape.

&quot;We&#39;re excited to collaborate with the Department of Energy and contribute to the Genesis Mission. When frontier AI meets the expertise of the national labs, it opens up new ways to explore ideas, test them faster, and accelerate scientific progress,&quot; said Kevin Weil, OpenAI VP for Science. ®

SerpApi says it can deliver Google search results for use by AI tools, but Google claims it’s illegally evading bot-blockers to steal copyrighted content.

Google has filed a lawsuit against SerpApi, a company that offers tools to scrape content on the web, including Google’s search results. SerpApi is accused of violating the Copyright Act by using “deceptive means” to automatically access and take Google’s search results “at an astonishing scale” before selling the data to customers.

Reddit also sued SerpApi, along with two other data scrapers, in October, accusing “at least one” of ripping content from its site for the AI startup Perplexity. Though Google’s complaint briefly mentions Reddit’s lawsuit against SerpApi, it doesn’t directly say anything about Perplexity or AI bots.

Google’s lawsuit claims SerpApi discovered a way around SearchGuard, a technology Google deployed earlier this year to block SerpApi from scraping its search results:

In an effort to halt this harmful misappropriation and protect its partner relationships, Google developed and deployed a technological measure, known as SearchGuard, that restricts access to its search results pages and the copyrighted content they contain. So that it could continue its free riding, however, SerpApi developed a means of circumventing SearchGuard. With the automated queries it submits, SerpApi engages in a wide variety of misrepresentations and evasions in order to bypass the technological protections Google deployed. But each time it employs these artifices, SerpApi violates federal law…

When SearchGuard launched in January 2025, it effectively blocked SerpApi from accessing Google’s Search results and the copyrighted content of Google’s partners. But SerpApi immediately began working on a means to circumvent Google’s technological protection measure. SerpApi quickly discovered means to do so and deployed them.

SerpApi’s answer to SearchGuard is to mask the hundreds of millions of automated queries it is sending to Google each day to make them appear as if they are coming from human users. SerpApi’s founder recently described the process as “creating fake browsers using a multitude of IP addresses that Google sees as normal users.”

Google argues that its search results include a “substantial” amount of copyrighted content, including images, which it displays on different modules within Search, like its Knowledge Panel. It alleges SerpApi “undermines” its investment in licenses to display copyrighted material by “making the content available to other services that need not incur similar costs.”

Google asks the court to order SerpApi to stop the company from circumventing its restrictions against scraping, as well as to destroy any technology involved in the process.

Ready Player Me’s tech will help players ‘carry their identities and fandom’ across Netflix’s games.

As Netflix continues to build out its gaming strategy, which has recently included a new era of TV party games, it’s going to let people build avatars — with the help of a new acquisition. The company is acquiring avatar company Ready Player Me and its “cross-game avatar tech” to let players “carry their identities and fandom across games,” according to Ready Player Me CEO Timmu Tõke.

Netflix “doesn’t have an estimate of how long it will be until avatars launch” or which games will get them first, TechCrunch reports. Terms of the deal haven’t been disclosed.

Ready Player Me’s team of about 20 people will join Netflix. The company’s services, which “thousands” of developers used to “power cross-platform avatars,” will “become unavailable” on January 31st, 2026, Ready Player Me says on its website.

“Our vision has always been to enable avatars and identities to travel across many games and virtual worlds,” Tõke says. “We’ve been on an independent path to make that vision a reality for a long time. I’m now very excited for the Ready Player Me team to join Netflix to scale our tech and expertise to a global audience and contribute to the exciting vision Netflix has for gaming.”

The energy demands of AI are driving investment in futuristic fusion reactors from Big Tech and now Trump Media. Is it viable?

Trump Media — yup, the parent company of Truth Social — is the latest entrant in the near century-long race to develop a nuclear fusion power plant. It announced a merger agreement with fusion company TAE Technologies on Thursday and a bold plan to break ground on the first utility-scale fusion plant some time in 2026.

TAE doesn’t plan to start generating power from its first plant until 2031, which is still an incredibly ambitious timeline. There will likely be a myriad of financial and regulatory issues to contend with along the way, of course. But the scientific and engineering challenges to overcome, which we’ll dive into here, are also enormous.

Fusion is considered the ‘Holy Grail’ of clean energy technologies

Fusion is considered the ‘Holy Grail’ of clean energy technologies, and AI companies are salivating over it as a potential source of abundant electricity for data centers. But while a future fusion reactor might one day help solve some of humanity’s headaches, it could just be wishful thinking to expect them to come to the rescue for data centers anytime soon.

With fusion, scientists are trying to replicate the way stars create light and heat — atomic nuclei fuse together, generating a tremendous amount of energy. A fusion power plant could avoid the greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels that are causing climate change, as well as the long-lasting radioactive waste that today’s nuclear fission reactors create by splitting atoms apart to produce energy.

President Donald Trump has made his disdain for clean energy clear by falsely calling climate change a “con job,” ending tax incentives for renewables, and halting federal funding and permitting for solar and wind projects. But he has aligned himself with the tech broligarchy in trying to rush the development of new AI data centers. How to power these energy-hungry facilities has become a major hurdle for the industry, provoking pushback from communities across the US concerned about new data centers potentially driving up electricity rates and pollution.

Big names in tech are funneling money into fusion in the hopes that it might become a silver bullet for everyone’s energy woes. Google and Microsoft have announced agreements to purchase electricity from fusion power plants that other companies plan to complete by the late 2020s or 2030s. Sam Altman, Bill Gates, and Jeff Bezos have also backed startups developing their own fusion technologies.

“Fusion power will be the most dramatic energy breakthrough since the onset of commercial nuclear energy in the 1950s — an innovation that will lower energy prices, boost supply, ensure America’s AI supremacy, and revive America’s manufacturing base, and bolster national defense,” Devin Nunes, Trump Media Chairman and CEO, said on a Thursday investor call.

There are no utility scale nuclear fusion power plants yet, despite the rush of initiatives to design one that might actually work. Success still depends on researchers solving significant scientific and engineering unknowns that they’ve been plugging away at for decades.

We don’t. As you can imagine, re-creating the dynamics of a star on Earth is very difficult. It takes an enormous amount of energy just to kick off a fusion reaction. A stumbling block scientists have faced for decades — and still face — is how to achieve a net energy gain from a fusion reaction.

The first time anyone in the world was able to achieve that net energy gain, often referred to as “ignition,” was in 2022 at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s National Ignition Facility (NIF). No other group, including TAE, has yet been able to do this with their own technology.

The 2022 breakthrough at Lawrence Livermore was achieved by firing 192 laser beams at a diamond-encased pellet of fuel. It’s a form of inertial confinement, triggering a fusion reaction by compressing and heating a fuel-filled target. Another competing fusion technology is called a tokamak, which uses magnetic fields to confine plasma and trigger the reaction.

Re-creating the dynamics of a star on Earth is very difficult

You can think of the reactor TAE is developing as a kind of a hybrid of both strategies, using what’s called field-reversed configuration (FRC). It still uses magnetic fields to lock plasma into place and also shoots beams of fuel directly into the plasma to stabilize it and create the conditions necessary for a reaction to occur.

Most experts The Verge has talked to over the years have been cautious to put a date on when a commercial fusion power plant could actually start powering homes and businesses.

Not only does TAE still have to demonstrate that it can achieve a net energy gain — that gain has to be big enough to make economic sense. The Lawrence Livermore breakthrough, for example, achieved a net energy gain of 1.5 megajoule gain (the experiment yielded 3.15 megajoules of energy compared to the 2.05 megajoules the lasers used to trigger the fusion reaction). A laser fusion power plant would likely need to achieve a gain of 50 to 100. The lab has repeated its experiments to work to get higher gains — reaching a record gain of 4.13 MJ in April of this year.

That’s all to say that there are still a lot of milestones for the industry to reach. The Trump administration released a roadmap in October for the advancement of fusion technologies, and the Department of Energy has set a goal of deploying commercial-scale fusion power to electricity grids by the mid-2030s.

“We’re really at kind of that first-of-kind technology innovation, and it’s kind of hard to assign direct timelines to these things,” says Patrick White, group lead for fusion energy safety and regulation at the Clean Air Task Force (CATF).

Commercial fusion reactors would also need robust supply chains for fuel and materials strong enough to withstand the extreme pressure and temperatures necessary for nuclear fusion. In short, designing a working reactor would be an enormous step forward — but then comes more difficult work to build the infrastructure and business around it.

The biggest impact this merger is likely to have — if it ultimately goes through — is to infuse a lot more cash into TAE’s ambitions.

TAE, founded in 1998, claims that its research has advanced enough to the point that “capital is now becoming our biggest challenge,” TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer said on the investor call.

Trump Media has agreed to shell out up to $300 million to TAE as part of the transaction. That adds to the more than $1.3 billion in private capital that TAE says it has raised to date from Google (TAE has been partnering with Google since 2014 to incorporate machine learning into its research), Chevron Technology Ventures, Goldman Sachs, and others.

With that money, TAE says it’ll be able to start construction on its first utility-scale fusion plant by the end of 2026 and generate “first power” in 2031. The first plant is supposed to have a capacity of 50MWe, similar to a fission microreactor. TAE didn’t immediately respond to questions from The Verge about where that facility would be located and how much it would cost. But the company’s already planning to build more fusion plants after that with a capacity reaching up to 500MWe.

Those plans are also contingent on regulatory approvals. But in a controversial decision by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that was codified by Congress this year, fusion reactors are regulated as particle accelerators in the US, similar to equipment used in cancer therapies and to sterilize medical equipment. That allows fusion plants to bypass lengthy federal licensing requirements that apply to fission reactors.

TAE has developed five iterations of its fusion reactor design. It said as recently as April that it planned to unveil its sixth, called Copernicus, which it hoped would show a net energy gain “before the end of the decade.” From there, it would work toward developing the company’s first prototype power plant, Da Vinci, “in the early 2030s.”

Then in November, TAE announced that it’s now leapfrogging over Copernicus and moving straight to Da Vinci. That’s a result of its latest fusion research reactor, Norm, being small and efficient enough to shave down costs by up to 50 percent, according to TAE.

“Norm is such a tremendous breakthrough that it renders Copernicus unnecessary — saving us considerable time and cost,” Binderbauer said in a November press release.

But it’ll still be resource-intensive for TAE to take the next leap in its reactor design. “As [TAE starts] looking at either building a scientific demonstration machine or going straight to a commercial prototype, those types of machines take a substantial amount of investment,” CATF’s White says. “And this [merger] potentially is going to be a pathway for them to receive the capital they need to actually start testing and deploying their fusion technology.”

Correction, December 19th: This story has been corrected to clarify that Trump Media agreed to provide up to $300 million to TAE, and to clarify that nuclear fusion would avoid the long-lasting radioactive waste from fission reactors. Fusion reactors would still produce short-lived radioactive materials. Update, December 19th: This story has been updated with information regarding Copernicus.</div>

China figured out how to sell EVs. Now it has to bury their batteries.

In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road.

It’s a weird time to be an AI doomer.This small but influential community believes, in the simplest terms, that AI could get so good it could be bad—very, very bad—for humanity.The doomer crowd has had some notable success over the past several years: including helping shape AI policy coming from the Biden administration. But a number of developments over the past six months have put them on the back foot. Talk of an AI bubble has overwhelmed the discourse as tech companies continue to invest in multiple Manhattan Projects’ worth of data centers without any certainty that future demand will match what they’re building.So where does this leave the doomers? We decided to ask some of the movement’s biggest names to see if the recent setbacks and general vibe shift had altered their views. See what they had to say in our story.—Garrison Lovely

Synthesia’s AI clones are more expressive than ever. Soon they’ll be able to talk back.

Earlier this summer, I visited the AI company Synthesia to create a hyperrealistic AI-generated avatar of me. The company’s avatars are a decent barometer of just how dizzying progress has been in AI over the past few years, so I was curious just how accurately its latest AI model, introduced last month, could replicate me.I found my avatar as unnerving as it is technically impressive. It’s slick enough to pass as a high-definition recording of a chirpy corporate speech, and if you didn’t know me, you’d probably think that’s exactly what it was.My avatar shows how it’s becoming ever-harder to distinguish the artificial from the real. And before long, these avatars will even be able to talk back to us. But how much better can they get? And what might interacting with AI clones do to us? Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In August 2025, Wang Lei decided it was finally time to say goodbye to his electric vehicle.

Wang, who is 39, had bought the car in 2016, when EVs still felt experimental in Beijing. It was a compact Chinese brand. The subsidies were good, and the salesman talked about “supporting domestic innovation.” At the time, only a few people around him were driving on batteries. He liked being early.

But now, the car’s range had started to shrink as the battery’s health declined. He could have replaced the battery, but the warranty had expired; the cost and trouble no longer felt worth it. He also wanted an upgrade, so selling became the obvious choice.

His vague plans turned into action after he started seeing ads on Douyin from local battery recyclers. He asked around at a few recycling places, and the highest offer came from a smaller shop on the outskirts of town. He added the contact on WeChat, and the next day someone drove over to pick up his car. He got paid 8,000 yuan. With the additional automobile scrappage subsidy offered by the Chinese government, Wang ultimately pocketed about 28,000 yuan.

Wang is part of a much larger trend. In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.

But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.

The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, building out formal recycling networks and take-back programs, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road.

Like the batteries in our phones and laptops, those in EVs today are mostly lithium-ion packs. Their capacity drops a little every year, making the car slower to charge, shorter in range, and more prone to safety issues. Three professionals who work in EV retail and battery recycling told MIT Technology Review that a battery is often considered to be ready to retire from a car after its capacity has degraded to under 80%. The research institution EVtank estimates that the year’s total volume of retired EV batteries in China will come in at 820,000 tons, with annual totals climbing toward 1 million tons by 2030.

In China, this growing pile of aging batteries is starting to test a recycling ecosystem that is still far from fully built out but is rapidly growing. By the end of November 2025, China had close to 180,000 enterprises involved in battery recycling, and more than 30,000 of them had been registered since January 2025. Over 60% of the firms were founded within the past three years. This does not even include the unregulated gray market of small workshops.

Typically, one of two things happens when an EV’s battery is retired. One is called cascade utilization, in which usable battery packs are tested and repurposed for slower applications like energy storage or low-speed vehicles. The other is full recycling: Cells are dismantled and processed to recover metals such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese, which are then reused to manufacture new batteries. Both these processes, if done properly, take significant upfront investment that is often not available to small players.

But smaller, illicit battery recycling centers can offer higher prices to consumers because they ignore costs that formal recyclers can’t avoid, like environmental protection, fire safety, wastewater treatment, compliance, and taxes, according to the three battery recycling professionals MIT Technology Review spoke to.

“They [workers] crack them open, rearrange the cells into new packs, and repackage them to sell,” says Gary Lin, a battery recycling worker who worked in several unlicensed shops from 2022 to 2024. Sometimes, the refurbished batteries are even sold as “new” to buyers, he says. When the batteries are too old or damaged, workers simply crush them and sell them by weight to rare-metal extractors. “It’s all done in a very brute-force way. The wastewater used to soak the batteries is often just dumped straight into the sewer,” he says.

This poorly managed battery waste can release toxic substances, contaminate water and soil, and create risks of fire and explosion. That is why the Chinese government has been trying to steer batteries into certified facilities. Since 2018, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has issued five “white lists” of approved power-battery recyclers, now totaling 156 companies. Despite this, formal recycling rates remain low compared with the rapidly growing volume of waste batteries.

China is not only the world’s largest EV market; it has also become the main global manufacturing hub for EVs and the batteries that power them. In 2024, the country accounted for more than 70% of global electric-car production and more than half of global EV sales, and firms like CATL and BYD together control close to half of global EV battery output, according to a report by the International Energy Agency. These companies are stepping in to offer solutions to customers wishing to offload their old batteries. Through their dealers and 4S stores, many carmakers now offer take-back schemes or opportunities to trade in old batteries for discount when owners scrap a vehicle or buy a new one.

BYD runs its own recycling operations that process thousands of end-of-life packs a year and has launched dedicated programs with specialist recyclers to recover materials from its batteries. Geely has built a “circular manufacturing” system that combines disassembly of scrapped vehicles, cascade use of power batteries, and high recovery rates for metals and other materials.

CATL, China’s biggest EV maker, has created one of the industry’s most developed recycling systems through its subsidiary Brunp, with more than 240 collection depots, an annual disposal capacity of about 270,000 tons of waste batteries, and metal recovery rates above 99% for nickel, cobalt, and manganese.

“No one is better equipped to handle these batteries than the companies that make them,” says Alex Li, a battery engineer based in Shanghai. That’s because they already understand the chemistry, the supply chain, and the uses the recovered materials can be put to next. Carmakers and battery makers “need to create a closed loop eventually,” he says.

But not every consumer can receive that support from the maker of their EV, because many of those manufacturers have ceased to exist. In the past five years, over 400 smaller EV brands and startups have gone bankrupt as the price war made it hard to stay afloat, leaving only 100 active brands today.

Analysts expect many more used batteries to hit the market in the coming years, as the first big wave of EVs bought under generous subsidies reach retirement age.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard.

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you.  We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.
